"It would take too long to list the five resolutions on which the Budgets Committee is offering an opinion in my name."
"The objective in the Budgets Committee is not, in any way, to intervene in the policy arrangements of the spending committees."
"But as the Budgets Committee we are concerned by two things in particular."
"One thing was referred to by the President of the Court of Auditors here yesterday."
"He said that for two years running the number of irregularities in the structural funds were growing at the same time as those in agriculture, which has long been a problem, were falling."
"The other is the regular annual underspend of the regional funds."
"So, we as a committee welcome the new rules being put forward in this way by the Commission."
"The amendments are to all five reports and are technical amendments."
"They are in no way seeking to alter the policy-making processes of the spending committees."
"The one exception might appear to be the Budgets Committee's support for the performance reserve."
"Another name for the performance reserve is efficiency reserve."
"Can you imagine the Budgets Committee being able to resist the idea of something called efficiency?"
"I know - because I am a member of that committee too - that the Regional Committee is seeking to promote the idea of the performance reserve."
"However, if the Commission's proposals hold true, the Budgets Committee believes that we should be having proper financial rules to cover it."
"In no way should the decision-making view of Parliament be by-passed by use of the performance review, although it is tempting for a budgets committee to find support for this."
"The amendments have not been welcomed in large sections of the House."
"I think that is a great pity and I would invite Members to read them."
"Any suggestion that we might be using the Financial Regulation should not raise hostility."
"Any suggestion that we should follow the financial rules should not cause people to be greatly concerned but I do understand that there are several Members of the House who are worried about those and I would invite them to read those amendments before they come to vote tomorrow."
"Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, although the European Social Fund reform is much less controversial than the reform of the other funds, there are still problems associated with it."
"The first thing to emphasise is that the Social Fund is the only labour market instrument we have at European level."
"It also accounts for an impressive 10 % of the budget."
"Precisely because it is our only instrument for supporting the European employment strategy, we absolutely have to whip it into shape for the big new challenges in labour market policy."
"We must use it to open up new employment opportunities above all in the third sector, the non-profit-making sector."
"By this I mean the environment, culture and social services."
"It is also necessary to use local employment initiatives to create more employment."
"Over and above that, we should be using Social Fund support not only to develop new forms of work, but also to do more to test them. This applies to two particular cases."
"Firstly, as regards women, we need to enhance the compatibility of family and working life. Secondly, for older employees, we need to facilitate the transition from working life to retirement."
"In future we also need to take greater care of a new problem group, workers in their mid-forties, who are generally the first in line to lose their jobs."
"Experience shows that regardless of age, doing a training course under the Social Fund increases a person's chances of finding a job by a third compared to someone in the same age group without this training."
"Another novelty is that whereas up to now, education measures were only possible in Objective 1 areas, in future they are to be promoted throughout the EU."
"On this subject, I am very happy that yesterday the European People's Party was also able to agree to a compromise on this, which allows us to offer hundreds of thousands of young people in Europe the opportunity to improve their employment prospects through better education."
"This point is particularly important to me because taking Portugal as an example, in that country alone 600 000 young people are profiting from education under the Social Fund."
"In Spain the figure is 152 000. In Ireland, in the current promotion period alone, ECU 380 million has been deployed for education under the Social Fund."
"But it is not only poor Member States that need this assistance."
"The United Kingdom, France and Italy have all implemented appropriate measures as well."
"Dear colleagues from the PPE, that is why it is a good thing that you agreed at the last minute."
"These are new priorities for assistance that have the support of all groups."
"But there are also two PPE amendments which the committee has already rejected, and which my group certainly cannot support."
"Opinions diverge fundamentally on a preventive labour market policy and, unsurprisingly, on assistance for women."
"Now to begin with the first contentious issue, which is the expenditure of 15 % of Social Fund resources on a preventive labour market policy in Member States."
"This policy approach was introduced so successfully to Europe in 1994 by the Social Fund, that it quite naturally found its way into the Luxembourg Employment Guidelines, which is why I cannot for the life of me understand why you are against it now."
"The present division of funds between Objectives 3 and 4 is already quite similar."
"The present ratio between the resources for fighting long-term unemployment and for measures to facilitate the adaptation to industrial change is 80: 20."
"Turning now to the second controversial issue, everyone here knows that mainstreaming for women is not enough to reduce the discrimination against them in the labour market."
"If we really want to make progress in realising equal opportunities, then here too Europe must adopt a pacesetting role and make 50 % of the Social Fund resources available for very specific additional measures to assist women."
"Anyway, I hope that by tomorrow, my dear colleagues in the PPE, you will have come to your senses on this."
"Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, in 1994 fisheries became a part of the Structural Funds for the first time and the financial instrument for fisheries guidance (FIFG) was set up. The main objective of this instrument was to reorganise the chaotic situation that existed up until then in terms of the system of funding for the fisheries structural policy, which involved, on the one hand, the Structural Funds, and on the other hand, an instrument called the European Fisheries Guidance Fund."
"This situation involved serious management problems, administrative inflexibility, a lack of coherence and a lack of transparency."
"The idea was to find a new and different way of dealing with the issue of funding measures related to the fisheries structural policy by simplifying instruments in order to overcome the flaws evident in the previous system."
"The 1994 reform covered all the areas of the European Union dependent on fishing as it was in the form of a common policy."
"In addition, as part of this reform, Community initiatives appeared for the first time."
"Among them was the Fisheries Initiative, which was set up to complement the Structural Funds."
"It seems, however, that the Commission has now forgotten the reasons that led it to make that reform. With the model it is currently proposing we are in danger of going back to absolute chaos in the fisheries structural policy, as well as the lack of coherence that the Commission is presenting us with in its proposal for a new regulation."
"The Commission's proposal does not move further along the path taken with the 1994 reform."
"It is incomprehensible that we should be presented with a document in which details are not even given of the measures to be taken and in which structural action in the fisheries sector is not clearly expressed."
"The result of this shortcoming is that instead of the fisheries sector, it is the Commission that is benefiting from extending its discretion in an unthinkable manner in other sectors, such as agriculture or rural development."
"Perhaps the fisheries policy is not such a common policy as the agricultural policy?"
"What Parliament is proposing in view of the lack of coherence, the contradictions and the discriminations that we find in the Commission's proposal, is something as simple as a single legal framework, a horizontal regulation within the framework of national programmes with the aim of maintaining the coherence necessary to fulfil the objectives of the common fisheries policy."
"We are proposing a document that is the result of reorganizing and simplifying all the instruments available for structural measures in the fisheries sector, and that covers all the regions that are dependent on fisheries."
"This more pragmatic approach would enable us, on one hand, to cover all the structural measures and, on the other hand, to cover all the regions that really need those measures to be implemented, disposing of ideas such as that introduced by the Commission of selecting areas for the new Objective 2 on the basis of employment criteria and not of fishing activity."
"This would inevitably cause a significant distortion as it is forgetting the ultimate reason for the fisheries structural policy, that it should be aimed at regions that are dependent on fisheries, and not exclusively at regions with employment problems in the fisheries sector."
"These are completely different concepts that should not be confused."
"To this I should add that, in general, regions that are dependent on fisheries do not have a particularly high level of unemployment."
"Usually, the problems in those areas are of a different order."
"The regulation would enable the fisheries sector to have its own structural policy so that it might maintain its competitiveness, and would enable the Member States to resolve internal issues, taking into account the particular characteristics of various sectors."
"In addition, this system would mean that there could be considerable simplification in terms of programming, as many existing regulations that are complicated, and at times inconsistent with each other, would disappear."
"In short, we need to establish a single legal framework that brings together all the Community regulations on fisheries and that includes all the measures on modernising and renewing fleets, joint ventures, processing and marketing, socio-economic measures, aquaculture, etcetera. In short, we need measures that enable the fleet to maintain its competitiveness in an open global market."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have to prevent the achievements made so far from being lost through an incoherent reform that would lead us into a chaotic and obsolete situation."
"We must not forget the achievement that meant that the Edinburgh European Council adopted the decision to consider structural action in the fisheries sector within the framework of the Structural Funds."
"With the proposal that the Commission is presenting we have an alternative that goes against this decision by trying to take part of the structural action out of the Structural Funds to the detriment of the European fisheries sector."
"I would like to conclude by briefly referring to the Cohesion Fund, stressing - like Mr Collins - that the only reason for the Cohesion Fund is to contribute to strengthening economic and social cohesion, not to constitute a nominal convergence instrument in order to fulfil the requirements for joining the single currency."
"It is always a final instrument, linked solely to the objective of cohesion and regulated in the final cohesion policy title and not by the Economic and Monetary Union title."
"For this reason, I fully support Mr Collins' suggestions and the Commission's proposals, which we believe are the only ones that fully comply with the spirit of the Treaty."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioners, firstly on behalf of my group, I should like to thank all the rapporteurs for their reports on the Structural Funds, and if I single out Mrs McCarthy and Mr Hatzidakis by name, then it is only because they have done the lion's share of the work."
"If European regional policy is to remain effective we must confine ourselves to the main tasks."
"The objective is to help the regions that have economic problems, which is why we would approve the idea proposed by the Commission of concentrating assistance on the regions which lag behind in development, namely the Objective 1 regions. From a geographical point of view also, Objective 1 regions should receive assistance amounting to exactly two thirds of Structural Fund resources."
"We urge strongly that the choice of the Objective 1 regions should in future be based on the strict application of the criterion of a regional GDP per capita which is less than 75 % of the Community average."
"For us this is a very important yardstick that is significant for the overall evaluation of the report."
"I would draw your attention to the fact that those who advocate flexibility on this issue are jeopardising the common consensus and preventing a reform of the Structural Funds as a whole."
"At the same time, however, I would urge the Commission to see to it that Objective 1 regions are treated equally when resources are distributed."
"In view of the regional slant of Objective 1, I do not think that we can guarantee equal treatment by considering the national criterion of prosperity in determining the amount of resources to be allocated."
"We therefore explicitly reject this on the grounds that it would create a new type of unfairness."
"As far as the Cohesion Fund is concerned, the opinion of my group is divided."
"Some of the group, mostly Members from southern European countries, are in favour of what the rapporteur and the Commission propose, which is a continuation of the Cohesion Fund in its present form."
"Others, including myself, consider that the Cohesion Fund has already achieved its most important goal as far as the countries participating in Economic and Monetary Union are concerned, by significantly helping to bring about nominal convergence."
"In our opinion there is therefore no reason for it to continue to exist in its present form."
"This kind of European assistance consists of temporary measures and should not be considered a permanent acquisition after its aim has been achieved."
"This issue is fundamental for a society based on solidarity. Solidarity is not just a one-way street; it is not just about taking, but must be based on the understanding that there is both give and take."
"Otherwise, this solidarity that we all emphatically support will be a very one-sided burden."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party would like to express its support for the principle of strengthening economic and social cohesion in all the territories, all the states and all the regions of the European Union."
"We would like to affirm the need to maintain the level of 0.46 % of gross domestic product for the Structural Funds."
"We are in a period when the European Union is enlarging and we will have to bear the costs of this."
"In order to do so, we are relying on the economic growth of the Union."
"The main objective of the Structural Funds, along with economic and social cohesion, must be to encourage job creation through the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"In the Commission's document we support the concentration of the Structural Funds with the aim of making them more efficient, and we also agree with the simplification of procedures in order to bring more transparency to the management of the Funds."
"We support the principle of subsidiarity and the recognition of the important role played by regional and local authorities, especially the authorities in those Member States where the regions also have legislative powers."
"We are in favour of consulting civil society and non-governmental organisations in drawing up the programmes."
"We are also in favour of decentralising the management of the Funds and making it more flexible, but we know that this means strengthening the control mechanisms in order to guarantee that the Funds are used appropriately."
"We support, too, the reduction in the number of objectives from seven to three and we believe it is necessary to make State aid, as established by Article 92(3)(c) of the Treaty, compatible with the Structural Funds, especially in Objective 2 regions where the two types of aid need to be compatible."
"We must also highlight - and I said this a few times in committee, Commissioner - the problem of rural areas, and in those areas unemployment and population decline must be looked on as important factors."
"We support the Commission's approach with regard to the phasing-out system."
"We also support the reduction in Community initiatives and would like to highlight the important role of Interreg in cross-border cooperation, which brings a truly European dimension to the initiative."
"In addition, its action involving the candidate countries must be strengthened."
"Our group unreservedly supports the establishment of a percentage for performance, and a reserve percentage for each objective and in each Member State in order to encourage greater efficiency in its application."
"We believe, Commissioner, that the reserve fund is a good idea that should be supported."
"We can discuss the percentage, but we think that it is important that it be implemented."
"Finally, we also support the Cohesion Fund for Member States whose gross domestic product is less than 90 % of the Community average."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the McCarthy-Hatzidakis report quite rightly welcomes the Commission's extremely valid objective of simplifying standards in terms of structural policy."
"Parliament has a duty to draw the attention of the Commission and the Council to the need to closely link the aim of economic and social cohesion to that of cohesion in the European area, which is clearly expressed in the Varela report."
"As well as the terrestrial aspects of the Union, we must also take the maritime aspects into account and then provide an adequate response to the specific needs of the island, peripheral or landlocked regions."
"We should not allow Europe to let its peripheral regions crumble."
"This is unfortunately the risk which these regions run, given the socio-economic data which is typical of these areas and the economic trends of the European market, mainly based around the London-Paris-Bonn axes."
"As strict as it may be, the definition of the new Objective 1 in the report on general provisions, by tolerating limited exceptions, gives Member States the opportunity to improve the coherence of national zoning as the procedure is transparent and the list of eligible regions is annexed to the regulation."
"Therefore, the obstacles which impede the economic and social development of regions suffering permanent structural handicaps would be taken into consideration as a priority objective of the Structural Funds."
"I am also pleased to note that the report on general provisions provides for a special Interreg strand, dedicated to regional cooperation with and between the island regions."
"This fulfils the Commission's commitment which, until now, has been without any follow-up."
"Finally, I believe it is important to compensate for the absence of Commission proposals on the relations between the Structural Funds and the draft development plan for the Community area."
"To this end, I would like to ask that we support the two amendments which we tabled to the McCarthy-Hatzidakis report, so that the framework regulation does not disregard the efforts made to develop a coherent strategy for planning the European area."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the central question in the report on the Structural Funds is whether or not the European Parliament approves of reducing the financial resources earmarked from 0.6 % of Community GNP to 0.34 % in the next Community support framework."
"Whoever agrees with that reduction, tantamount to a reduction in the Structural Funds - which would lose my country hundreds of billions of escudos - will be voting for the report."
"Whoever thinks that it should not be for the current cohesion countries alone to finance EU enlargement will be voting against it."
"That is what we shall be doing unless the European Parliament approves amendments aimed at rejecting that move."
"The essence of the report will not be hidden by its somewhat positive aspects. These positive elements include the vehement objections to the creation of a reserve, supposedly for reasons of effectiveness, the point that the Commission's guidelines for structural actions should only be indicative of the allocation of two thirds of the appropriations to Objective 1, or the restoration of the URBAN initiative."
"The report on the Cohesion Fund, on the other hand, is in keeping with what the Treaty on European Union already provides for legally and what Agenda 2000 only confirms. In other words, all countries with a GNP lower than 90 % of the Community average should benefit from the Cohesion Fund, whether or not they belong to the group of countries participating in the single currency."
"On the other hand, in line with what we have always contended, the report opposes the idea that the Cohesion Fund should be conditional, as the Commission proposes, on meeting the requirements of the Stability Pact."
"We hope that the content of this report will not be radically altered by the amendments tabled by Mr Walter and Mr Berend, from the Socialist Group and the Group of the European People's Party. They reveal a total lack of solidarity with the current cohesion countries and are aimed at preventing countries that form part of EMU, such as Portugal, to mention just one, from continuing to benefit from the Cohesion Fund."
"Finally, the continuity of the Cohesion Fund for these countries cannot be used to exert extra pressure, as Mr Berend is now doing, nor should it be used to conceal possible or real losses in the Structural Fund, since that Fund is, in principle, laid down in the Treaty and is even one of the rare positive elements included in Agenda 2000."
"Having said this, we shall go along with the remaining reports as a whole in that they involve essentially operational regulations."
"As for the FIFG, we support the strategy of the report aimed at unifying regulations on activities in this sector, but we do not feel it necessary or even appropriate to present such a complete document at this stage as, for that very reason, we have not been able to sufficiently discuss all its implications."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, you will be amazed that I of all people am the first and only one here to observe that the Commission proposal is quite balanced, considering the tight financial framework."
"It makes sense to concentrate resources on the weakest regions."
"The Greens support the Commission proposals, even though we must of course observe that the Commission did not show any internal flexibility concerning the limits on resources in its own sectors, nor was it able to develop coherent structures."
"I must simply say that there is no uniform structure for assisting the rural area, and no attempt is made to find a solution to the problems of European regions which share borders with the applicant countries."
"In other words, there is no attempt to establish the possibility of cross-border assistance in these regions."
"The common fund is the only useful solution and the Commission has still done nothing in that regard."
"It is of course undeniable that progress has been made."
"Most importantly, in the Structural Fund Regulation, we have finally been able to introduce sustainable development as the central objective."
"The economy, ecology and social security need to be re-balanced once again if regions are not to stay connected to the drip forever but instead to undergo stable development."
"Of course, for this type of stability, the participation of the local and regional players and social groups is crucial."
"The Structural Funds have this democratic approach."
"Parliament has put forward some crucial improvements in the Committee on Regional Policy, which could allow the social players a decisive say in drafting the plans."
"Unfortunately 'could' is about as far as we will get, because everyone knows that the new legal basis comes much too late as the plans were ready long ago."
"That is why today, Commissioner, I expect you to give us some idea as to how, in view of this dilemma, enough time can be found for the democratic participation stipulated in the Structural Fund Regulation."
"In conclusion, it makes no sense for us to push through old claims of entitlement here, as though this were some kind of fair."
"The Structural Funds are not akin to a shop that is there to serve Member States."
"We are called upon to support the German Government's plan to conclude the Agenda 2000 package in March."
"It really is the last possible opportunity for us to grant regions assistance in January."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating all the rapporteurs on the reports presented to us today."
"There is little doubt that Structural Funds have delivered very worthwhile support to peripheral and poor regions in many parts of the European Union for many years."
"We are now at a stage where they need to be reformed."
"They have been extremely successful and many projects have gone forward which would otherwise never have got off the ground."
"European Union support for my own area through difficult and dangerous times gave us hope for a better tomorrow and helped us to maintain our position for almost 30 years."
"I understand why there has to be a 75 % benchmark."
"I must say to the Commission that we need a degree of flexibility to ensure that special areas will continue to receive support."
"For me, coming from Northern Ireland, to remove Objective 1 would send the wrong message at an extremely important and crucial time."
"Parliament's report is balanced, responsible and realistic."
"It offers a possibility of a better proposal than exists at present."
"I agree with the performance reserve in principle but it is too high: it should be no more than 4 or 5 %."
"There are not enough European lead projects."
"I would like to see the Urban programme and other European-led initiatives - five, six at the most - remain so that the people can see that this comes from the European Union."
"Mr President, I will begin with recital C of the report, which specifies that the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund are the principal instruments of economic and social cohesion in Europe."
"Of course, it would have been useful to distinguish more clearly between cohesion between the various Member States and cohesion within the states themselves, especially cohesion between rural and urban areas."
"On this first point, namely cohesion between Member States, it is difficult not to think along the same lines as the rapporteurs, given that the high number of appropriations allocated to some Member States is necessary for the sake of efficiency."
"Nonetheless, we should not forget the need for cross-border cohesion, as there is still a great deal to be done in this field."
"Appropriations for such cross-border cohesion should not be used to bear the costs of adjusting to new objectives."
"Indeed, in relation to this, there is a most welcome mention of the Interreg programmes on page 14."
"As regards the internal cohesion of Member States, which is perhaps discussed less, I believe this to be extremely important as cohesion between rural and urban areas is vital in the stages of development that we are currently experiencing, and which are generally detrimental to rural areas."
"Objective 5b will disappear, which is indeed regrettable and there is a danger that this may lead to disinvestment in rural areas."
"Examples of this are north-western Alsace, a region I know well, the Vosges massif and the Sundgau region."
"We are also unwittingly promoting the urbanisation of less-favoured regions."
"It would be worth knowing what percentage of funds were awarded to urban and rural areas, taking all funds into account."
"The Social Fund, for example, or industrial conversion funds, are mainly paid to towns."
"I approve wholeheartedly of the rapporteurs' paragraph 3 which quite rightly suggests that separate treatment is needed for the coherent development of the rural area under Objective 2."
"I hope that this request will later be acknowledged and that rural areas will not bear the costs of restructuring funds, as is currently the case."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a Parliament we want single programming for the fisheries sector."
"The Commission's proposal closely resembles the fragmentation theory: in substance it seeks to divide the sector along existing territorial lines and abandons the option of unitary management for the European Regional Development Fund, the European Investment Fund, the European Guarantee Fund and the European Social Fund."
"We want single programming because we do not think there should be territorial discrimination in fisheries, and we are convinced this can come about through a regulation capable of achieving single programming of actions in the fisheries sector, covering Objective 1, Objective 2 and areas outside Objectives 1 and 2."
"Unless there is unitary action, there will be the risk of discrimination."
"That is why we are committed to putting forward a serious and rigorous regulation, anticipating the Commission proposal."
"That is why we have looked at fisheries not just from an exclusively production and market angle, but taking account of environmental issues, social issues and the revival of sector-linked economic and social activity as well as thinking about the market."
"We have also considered the possibility of establishing mixed companies involving third countries, taking maximum advantage of NGOs and small-scale fishing."
"In short, ours is a serious, precise and timely proposal, and we would have hoped the Commission would naturally incorporate it."
"In fact the Commission is taking its time, but we are pleased that in some respects the Fisheries Council is fairly consistent with Parliament's position, and we are also aware that the Commission is going to propose a regulation which does take account of Parliament's own proposals, opportunely backed by the Fisheries Council."
"For this reason the possibility of two readings, approving this proposal for a regulation today and then approving the legislative resolution in April, when we assess the Commission's new proposal, will allow us to give the fisheries sector a single answer and single treatment, avoiding discrimination which would certainly be negative."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Mrs Jöns, the rapporteur, has already explained, her report is about the organisation of ESF content."
"Important things are to be settled in the framework regulation as it is still unclear whether or not certain points are going to be included in the text of the ESF Regulation."
"These delimitation problems should not arise in future."
"With regard to organisation, there were at first considerable differences of opinion between my group and the Socialists."
"As a result of many constructive discussions and rounds of negotiation continuing through into yesterday afternoon, we managed to reach some compromises."
"I should like to express my respect for the rapporteur and thank her for being prepared to enter into discussion with me."
"I should particularly like to thank her for the commitment she has shown."
"We agree on the basic direction to be taken."
"The ESF is the structural policy instrument for fighting unemployment, and this in turn is the best social policy."
"Unemployment is the biggest economic problem we have, and the biggest problem for social policy."
"ESF resources are in short supply, and we must bear this in mind when considering the compromises that have materialised."
"This is the message for the Commission regarding the implementation of the text."
"It is also because of this that education is not itself one of the fields of ESF intervention, although of course it is a prerequisite for employability and for a culture of lifelong learning."
"Of course Europe should also play its part."
"But on the basis of experience garnered from the last few programming periods, we have agreed not to just use the word concentration because it sounds good, but also to implement it rigorously."
"This is also true when it comes to the application of the ESF resources, where we want concentration on actively combatting unemployment."
"In this process, we should be guided by the employment guidelines at all levels."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"I have to be strict, in view of the number of speakers."
"So just a few words to finish, please, in 30 seconds."
"In conclusion, allow me to cite the rapporteur in this regard: 'In future the ESF is to support the European employment strategy and the multiannual national action plans for employment set up within the framework of this strategy.'"
"I support this completely."
"Mr President, firstly I should like to congratulate the Commissioner on putting together a proposal which is generally uncontentious among the 15 Member States and on all sides of this Parliament."
"That is no mean feat."
"I want to focus on three specific areas: timetables, the criteria for Objective 2 and access to funds."
"Firstly, on timetables, we have just had an informal summit on bringing Europe closer to the citizen."
"One of the key issues with structural funding is making sure that we deliver regional and structural funding on time."
"This is one of the key areas where the European Union has credibility."
"Of course we have to complete the rest of Agenda 2000 as well but we have to be there for the March Summit."
"The other thing I would say is that there will be a huge bottleneck at the beginning of year 2000, making it difficult to get these programmes approved."
"I should like to ask the Commissioner how she intends to deal with the almost impossible task for her staff of approving SPDs and CSFs in time to get those programmes rolling."
"Secondly, on criteria; in Objective 1 we have a very good and tight definition of who should qualify for Objective 1, based primarily on GDP."
"Yet in Objective 2 GDP is not one of the criteria for qualifying."
"Will the Commission accept GDP as one of the extra qualifying criteria for Objective 2?"
"It is the best poverty index so let us use it."
"Thirdly, on access."
"One of the things I hear most often from my constituents is how difficult it is to get hold of structural funding, in particular for small voluntary organisations or firms."
"I know it is primarily a national problem, but how do we make sure that organisations can easily access European funding without being put off by the bureaucracy?"
"Mr President, at the outset I want to compliment Mr Arias Cañete on the presentation of his very fine report."
"I pay tribute to all my colleagues on the Committee on Fisheries for presenting a set of very realistic proposals."
"The 1994 reform ensured a common approach to all Union areas dependent on fisheries."
"There are many such areas throughout the Union where there is no alternative source of employment."
"These measures were complemented by the socio-economic measures of 1995, as I outlined in my report on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries."
"The Edinburgh Summit did not endorse Parliament's proposal for a separate objective to deal with fishing."
"However, it accepted the strong case made by Parliament by directing that appropriate funds be allocated to coastal regions dependent on fisheries."
"This Commission proposal is a retrograde step and does nothing to improve the lot of the fishing communities."
"The proposal is too general."
"It leaves a vacuum to be filled not by this Parliament but by the Commission."
"The Commission is hoping to obtain our imprimatur."
"I suggest that we should not do this until we know the details."
"Under the new proposals most of the fishing policy measures are to be finalised under the agricultural guarantees section."
"I question the legitimacy of this section being used to fund structural measures."
"The agricultural funds are apportioned on an annual basis while the fisheries funds are provided on a multiannual basis."
"Even if we accept the principle of the Commission proposal, it must agree to ring-fence funds specifically for the fishing sector..."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to say that the provisional report on the Structural Funds regulation makes important advances - that we support - in strengthening the principal of cooperation by increasing the number of people who will be involved in preparing, implementing and monitoring the programmes."
"The report also makes progress in enhancing transparency and in supporting peripheral, ultra-peripheral and island regions."
"However, there are important aspects with which I am bound to disagree, such as the approval of the Commission's proposal that the resources destined for the Structural Funds should be fixed at 0.46 % of the European Union's annual gross national product."
"There are plenty of reasons to fear that, whatever happens, this allocation will be insufficient to secure economic and social cohesion."
"As a result, if this proposal is approved, inter-regional solidarity would be seriously damaged."
"In addition, the report even contradicts itself."
"It expresses an opinion against the establishment of the performance reserve proposed by the Commission, but it does not prevent those reserves from being set up: it only stipulates that the provision must be less than 10 %."
"What is our decision?"
"Are we for or against the performance reserve?"
"Mr President, I broadly welcome the Commission's proposals and would like to make some concrete points."
"As Mr Collins has pointed out, cohesion funding should not be linked to monetary union."
"The cohesion funds could usefully be transformed into a structural instrument not directly linked to the trans-European networks."
"Here we have made a global amendment keeping the structural and cohesion funds in line with the agreed budgetary proposals of this House, as Mr Kellett-Bowman has indicated."
"We are giving priority to rail infrastructure."
"In my own country, Ireland, for instance, the railways are in a state of dangerous decay whilst most of the funding has gone to roads."
"Our amendments also stress the importance of cross-border links."
"I should like to ask the Commissioner to emphasise in her response the importance of the democratic involvement of local regions, particularly those local regions who are asking for Objective I status."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, my aim is to try and wring the heartstrings of the Commissioners and Members who are here and, hopefully their groups also, to support Amendment No 49, tabled in the name of my colleague Mr Escolá Hernando and 60 others, with the pledges of nearly 200 Members already, and Amendment No 85 in the name of Mr Miller with the signatures of nearly all the British Labour Members."
"They bring in the concept of remoteness and low population density."
"The Highlands and Islands of Scotland are certainly remote and have a low population density of 8.9, as probably everybody knows by now."
"The GDP is 76 % of the average according to my information at the moment."
"There are two points I would like to refer to: one was made by one of the government Ministers to me recently, Gus MacDonald, who admits that but for the wages of all the oil rig workers - of whom very few come from my area - we would be well under 75 %, and I think it is a very unfair situation."
"We are the land of whisky, but although the British treasury gets billions from that, we do not get very much in the way of financial benefit."
"My constituency is often described as the last wilderness of Europe."
"It is a man-made wilderness."
"It was created by genocide."
"We peopled the lands of Canada because we were cleared out in favour of sheep, which were more profitable."
"The Commission has done a marvellous job of supporting the Highlands and Islands."
"We have taken full advantage of it."
"We have spent the money wisely, as the Commission must admit."
"But you cannot expect 150 years of neglect and oppression to be cured in five."
"It would be ironic if, just when the work of the Commission has enabled us to halt, for the first time, the drain of our brightest and best young people away from the Highlands and Islands, it suddenly came to a stop because of the infrastructure."
"There are still single track roads in much of my area, with 50 miles to a petrol pump."
"When you get there you find the petrol is the most expensive in the whole of the EU."
"A hundred miles to a hospital - one could go on indefinitely."
"And the weather - I am sure you all sympathise with that."
"We even had a visit from hurricane Mitch - the only bit of Europe to get it - at 240 kilometres an hour over my area."
"We have sub-Arctic temperatures in the winter."
"For two-thirds of the year all surfaces are damp, houses have to be strong, the cost of distance is enormous."
"There are 90 inhabited islands - longer than England, bigger than Belgium or Denmark - and the costs of that peripherality are enormous."
"I am trying to wring the heartstrings of everyone."
"Make a note now for your coordinators: Amendments Nos 49 and 85, please."
"Mr President, the Arias Cañete report is an excellent step."
"Along with Mrs Fraga's and my own opinions on regional policy and rural development, it displays a great deal of determination and widespread agreement in the views of the three committees on Regional Policy, Agriculture and Rural Development, and Fisheries."
"There is widespread agreement on the need to maintain a substantial CFP, based on significant structural measures which apply to Community territory as a whole and which affect fisheries, marine cultivations, aquaculture - including inland aquaculture - and activities further on in the chain such as processing and marketing."
"The unanimous position of the Committee on Fisheries, adopted after consultation with fisheries representatives in the Member States, should have attracted the attention of the Commission, and especially that of Commissioner Bonino."
"In the opinion I drafted on the 'Agenda 2000' communication, also adopted unanimously by the Committee on Fisheries, we had already warned the European Commission that the whole fisheries sector was in danger of experiencing intra-Community relocation. Such relocation would take place if the Commission's original intentions - which would have created distortions - were not modified by implementing a regulation which accepts that the whole of the Union's territory is eligible for structural measures."
"In the field of agriculture, a specific regulation on rural development has been drawn up."
"We have scrupulously monitored it to ensure that it applies to all of the Union's territory in order to preserve equity when applying the CAP."
"Why has the same thing not happened in the fisheries sector since it, like agriculture, has its own common policy?"
"So what will remain of the CFP, as there is no overall horizontal regulation bringing together all structural measures which apply to the fisheries sector throughout Union's territory and there is no regulation which is financed by an single instrument adapted to the needs of this sector?"
"All that will be left is a bundle of different restrictions, fleet reduction measures and some stopgap measures, remnants that are certainly not worthy of being called a common policy."
"We do not expect the policy to be abandoned, but we expect a far-reaching and forward-thinking policy to be developed which will take into account the maritime dimension of the Union, one of its most essential characteristics."
"Mr President, the amendments tabled by our group reflect this aim."
"Mr President, the Alleanza Nazionale delegation does not believe the objective of strengthening economic and social cohesion can ignore special situations involving structural handicaps, as in the case of island regions."
"Islands suffer from structural disadvantages which have long-term negative effects on their economic and social development, and there are many islands among the territories to be excluded from Objective 1 programmes."
"This means island territories will be dealt with on a par with regions which do not need special structural aid."
"That is a contradiction in terms."
"The new regulation cannot ignore the precepts of the new Treaty of Amsterdam which recognises and emphasises special features in Article 130a and the statement on the islands."
"So there ought to be a category for islands in Objective 1, applying greater flexibility to the GDP parameters."
"This is because careful and conscientious examination of the situation should make it clear that macro-economic issues are not the only ones; above all there are geo-economic issues involved."
"On Objective 2, we note that the Commission's proposal to apply a certain population ceiling to the various Member States may penalise some regions in comparison with others."
"In Italy the Commission's proposal to include regions leaving Objective 1 in Objective 2 would penalise the centre-north regions."
"Instead the concentration of the Structural Funds by reducing the population assisted ought to be balanced and equitably distributed between all the Member States."
"As regards transitional support, we think the period should be seven years for regions leaving Objectives 1, 2 and 5b. We are not asking for greater allocation of resources to regions in this group, only Structural Fund intervention for the whole of the programming period."
"I should specify that one Italian region, Abruzzo, ought to be able to benefit from transitional support despite the fact that it came out of Objective 1 in 1996, otherwise its inclusion in Objective 2 must be regarded as further penalisation of the centre-north."
"Finally, we agree on the reduction in the number of Community initiatives from thirteen to three, but we think it is essential to maintain the URBAN initiative in order to implement a homogeneous policy throughout the territory."
"Mr President, the Interreg, URBAN and Leader initiatives are breeding grounds for social and economic innovation which we must preserve at all costs."
"Interreg will encourage cross-border development of European territory."
"This affects not only the peripheral regions but also the very heart of Europe."
"Whilst we are on the subject of the heart of Europe, have you ever travelled by train between Brussels, Luxembourg and Strasbourg?"
"The trains are slow, uncomfortable, often late, and so on. However, the train is the ideal way to travel such distances and also the most ecological way to do so."
"What should be a symbolic journey - travelling on the train of the future to the heart of Europe - happens on a rickety and wheezing machine from a bygone era."
"And that brings me to Interreg."
"Something that should feed and open up regions - such as the Walloon, Lorraine and Luxembourg regions - across borders is a train that has not progressed in the past hundred years."
"Something that should contribute to developing cross-border regions is out of date."
"Mr President, we must make a serious effort to look after cross-border regions such as those I have mentioned, regions which ask nothing more than to be integrated and to develop."
"Mr President, I hope that you will not need to watch the clock while I am speaking."
"This morning we have already heard a great deal on the subject of enlargement."
"We have also talked about how this has to do with more than just making use of a historical opportunity, as we have to do a great deal before we can actually use this chance."
"We have discussed pre-accession strategies in the applicant countries, which involve driving forward as intensively as possible the process of economic and political accession to a common Europe."
"But although we have a great deal to do in the candidate countries, there is also homework to be done here."
"We often talk for instance about the need for institutional reforms."
"This is an important issue but it is not the only one."
"For example, there is much potential here for economic restructuring in order to safeguard our own chances for the future."
"In this regard, I think that there is one important key idea."
"Austria, the country which probably shares one of the longest external borders with the candidate countries, is justifiably interested in ensuring that the crossing and opening of the common border is organised in such a way as to bring advantage to both sides and harm to neither."
"The long discussions in the Committee on Regional Policy have achieved a great deal."
"I would particularly like to thank the Regional Affairs Commissioner, Mrs Wulf-Mathies."
"Yesterday evening during Question Time, we touched on this subject briefly, and today all sides of the House have rightly emphasised this willingness to cooperate."
"It has led to some fine results, but a little bit more could still be achieved."
"More could and should be achieved, given that the money is guaranteed and there are many good ideas from the regions."
"We should not always be waiting for Europe to lead the way; we must take things in hand ourselves."
"On this subject, although in essence we fully approve and support the content of the Commission proposals, we would perhaps have liked to have seen one or two things treated differently."
"Perhaps also a separate Objective for rural areas would have been good, although we are satisfied knowing that the rural area can be suitably safeguarded by specifying percentages of the population."
"For the next few years and for the transition period the phasing-out rules are particularly important, as is a long phasing-out period for areas which will no longer be eligible for assistance under the future criteria because they no longer need it."
"Mr President, I wholeheartedly agree with the key aims of the Structural Fund reforms on improving the focussing and effectiveness of aid, pruning bureaucracy and simplifying administration."
"I also believe it is now essential to ensure that this more transparent policy is put into practice."
"In applying the principle of partnership a clear division of responsibility must be established and the decision-making process must not be allowed to be hampered, but we have to approach the question of listening and commitment on the part of the various parties flexibly."
"I support the Commission's proposal on eligibility criteria and funding contributions for Objective 1."
"The poorest regions must be included in the group receiving the highest amounts of aid, that is to say the under-75 %-GNP regions, as well as the current northern and sparsely populated Objective 6 regions, as already agreed in the accession negotiations."
"Regarding the Objective 2 criteria and the issue of population density I would hope for some flexibility according to circumstances."
"For example, in Finland, Europe's most rural country, the hardships of farming in a northern climate and the long distances that people have to travel underline the need for an effective agricultural policy."
"Unemployment and mass migration from the countryside demonstrate the need for development aid measures."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the first report on cohesion reveals to what extent the structural policies have had a strong levelling off effect."
"In particular, the Cohesion Fund has played a fundamental role in achieving convergence among the Member States, although some of them still have not reached the level of 90 % of the average GNP in the EU."
"It is a fact that, in some cohesion countries, there is still a considerable deficit in terms of infrastructure."
"The conflict between the need to invest in these infrastructures and the need to make budgetary cuts, for countries taking part and not taking part in the euro, justifies the maintenance of the Fund."
"On the other hand, the Cohesion Fund is fundamental for sustainable development in environmental terms, as was stipulated in the Amsterdam Treaty."
"Therefore, we welcome the Commission's decision to maintain the fund, despite the fact that these countries are joining the euro."
"It would be unfair for the poorest countries, which have made the greatest efforts to meet the convergence criteria, sacrificing expenditure in fundamental sectors, to be now deprived of this instrument for cohesion."
"We should not confuse nominal and real convergence."
"But the Cohesion Fund is not just an act of generosity."
"We must not forget that it also enables money to be returned to the more developed states in the form of the acquisition of know-how and capital - in some cases, such as Portugal, as much as 50 %."
"Therefore, not only is the Commission's decision in keeping with the treaties, but it is also in keeping with the spirit of Edinburgh: that of a cohesive Europe embracing solidarity."
"Mr President, in spite of their growing share of the Community budget, the Structural Funds have not allowed us to get to the root of regional imbalances."
"They have barely compensated for the negative consequences of implementing the single market and preparing for the single currency."
"The efficiency of the Structural Funds must be strengthened."
"To achieve this, we must concentrate the funds on least-favoured regions and channel them towards job-creating objectives."
"The participation of elected representatives, of organisations and of citizens - democracy, in other words - is vital for the effectiveness of the Structural Funds."
"And moving beyond the Structural Funds, the question of future financing of the European Union is also being raised."
"I am more than slightly hesitant about the guidelines from the recent Commission document which aims at redistributing national contributions, under pressure from Germany who wants to pay less whilst still benefitting from the markets that will open up in Eastern Europe."
"On this issue, I should like to say that I believe the theory of fair returns is the very antithesis of European integration as it goes against solidarity, and without this solidarity Europe cannot exist. There is solidarity with the poorer regions, with sectors in difficulty, solidarity amongst the peoples of Europe, with applicant countries, with the Mediterranean countries of the south as part of the move towards development cooperation."
"Rather than bickering over national contributions, would it not be a better idea to think of a more fitting use of Community appropriations, to seek new resources - from the financial markets, for example - by introducing a tax on financial transactions which, in this case, would be a fair return based on justice and not on..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioners, firstly I would like to thank Mrs Jöns for constructively including our group's ideas in her report as well."
"A point she made very clear in her statement, which I would endorse, was that we cannot lose ground."
"The 15 % figure reflects the level of European experience."
"Targeted assistance for women simply reflects our stage in the process of civilisation."
"Do our colleagues from the People's Party really want us to drop behind that?"
"I think that the Christian Socialists in the House are in future going to have to decide whether they really want to risk a red-green majority in Parliament by opposing proposals which make sense."
"(Heckling from Mr Schiedermeier) That is certainly something we shall see."
"Mrs Glase, concentration is not about cutting back on the given aims."
"It has to do with labour market policy, the process agreed upon in Luxembourg and above all employment policy in the third sector."
"But it is also about social reintegration, complemented of course by a fight against poverty that is worthy of the name."
"I shall have to stop there."
"But let me just add that we based the synergies with other Funds on..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, perhaps you will remember that at the time of the Oostlander report, Mr Hänsch commented that many people would change their tune when it actually came to giving things up."
"We have reached that point now."
"Those who are familiar with the situation of the Structural and Cohesion Funds will know that Mr Hänsch hit the nail on the head."
"As is so often the case, everyone is basically of the same opinion, but when it comes to the crunch - the details of the sacrifices that need to be made - many change their tune."
"Let me turn now to the individual points, and firstly to the Cohesion Fund."
"I also think that the countries participating in Economic and Monetary Union should lose their right to these resources."
"Secondly, the Commission suggests that we maintain the present criterion for Objective 2."
"I am in favour of strict compliance with this, and not ..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, with the inclusion of an Employment Chapter in the new Treaty, a process began which led to the adoption of the employment guidelines in Luxembourg last November."
"One of the pillars of these guidelines is employability, based on a preventive and proactive labour supply policy in which training plays a fundamental role."
"The proposal for a Social Fund regulation we are debating today is part of this new approach."
"The Commission has undoubtedly put a major effort into making the Fund as flexible an instrument as possible, without losing sight of the need for it to serve the achievement of European objectives."
"Those objectives can be summarised as the development of proactive labour market policies, the promotion of social inclusion, the development of educational and vocational training systems to promote lifelong learning, the development of systems and models for the organisation of labour geared to producing a qualified labour force capable of facing up to the challenges of change, support for entrepreneurship and for the world of scientific and technological research, and the development of actions geared to promoting equal opportunities in the labour market."
"Now I would like to comment on certain points contained in the Commission's proposal and strengthened by the excellent report from Mrs Jöns."
"The range of measures that can be financed allows the training stage to be encapsulated in a package of integrated actions, geared to facilitating entry into or return to work."
"It is important to emphasise that a whole series of pre-training measures is included, intended to reach the categories of people who would otherwise be irredeemably lost."
"This means there can be a response to problems which go well beyond the work dimension and, instead, involve the whole person, which is something worth highlighting."
"An important part of this is the proposal to devote 1 % of the Social Fund's resources to funding small projects run by non-governmental organisations, entrusting them to intermediate bodies on the basis of simplified procedures."
"The Commission has already begun an important experiment in this area."
"Equally important is the promotion of new sources of employment by exploiting the third sector and the social economy, in particular by promoting and supporting local development."
"Fundamental here is the proposal to extend partnership, which should become an obligatory procedure at national level, for both governments and regions."
"Finally, women must be guaranteed equal rights to participate in the measures promoted by the Social Fund not only by including mainstreaming in the regulation but also through specific measures."
"For this reason, the Jöns report proposes setting a minimum of 15 % of the Social Fund resources to guarantee that equal opportunities for women and men also remain a priority when the regulation is applied by the national and regional services."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I come from Brittany, a region where fishing is a vital and dynamic economic activity, a keystone in development and employment and a balancing factor in land management."
"Where I come from, the fishing tradition has been handed down from father to son for hundreds of years."
"Fishing permeates every aspect of our way of life and our traditions and, in spite of the difficult nature of the job, it plays such a large part in our lives that it is a fundamental element of our identity."
"This is why, Commissioner, we cannot accept the proposals for regulations on structural measures in the fisheries sector."
"As our rapporteur pointed out, these proposals in their current state would threaten the unity of the fisheries sector by scattering the structural measures in the different regulations, they would destroy the current coherency in the maritime sector and, to the detriment of the final beneficiary, they would make it more difficult to gain access to aid. Above all, they would inevitably cause activity to be transferred from certain regions to others that will have greater advantages in the future."
"In Brittany, as in all regions dependent on fishing, we must preserve the means for building newer and safer boats, we must continue to modernise our ports and the fisheries industry, to upgrade our production and to train young people for a noble profession which, despite what is sometimes said, is a profession of the future."
"Mr President, I intend to speak on Mr Arias Cañete's report on the fisheries sector."
"The Greens agree with many of the rapporteur's criticisms of the Commission's proposal, which is decidedly inadequate."
"Mrs McKenna has already been able to express our point of view during discussion in the Committee on Fisheries, and the various amendments proposed by the Greens have been accepted by the committee."
"But we do not agree with all the proposals made by Mr Arias Cañete: I refer in particular to the new annex 3, which lays down measures for the construction of new fishing vessels."
"The Greens believe Community financing under the CFP should be limited to vessels no longer than 24 metres."
"Our proposal takes account of the environmental aspects - sustainable fishing is incompatible with a fleet of large fishing vessels - and the employment aspects, because large vessels certainly employ fewer fishermen."
"We hope the House can accept our amendment."
"Mr President, this proposal for the reform of the Structural Funds is broadly positive in intention."
"The present seven objectives will be cut to three, which will certainly make it easier for both the Commission and the regions to manage the funds."
"Better practical implementation also demands greater decision-making powers and greater autonomy on the part of the provincial authorities, which cover bodies with more detailed knowledge of the situation locally."
"As regards Objective 2, I think a great deal of attention needs to be paid to the admissibility criteria."
"This objective groups together four separate and distinct actions, namely one for urban areas, one for industrial areas, one for rural and mountain areas and one for fisheries."
"If the admissibility criteria are neglected this grouping threatens to be detrimental to regions where there are great disparities between the various sectors in terms of development."
"Take Lombardy, for instance."
"It has a highly productive industrial fabric, which often means the poor and backward rural and mountain areas are forgotten."
"The depopulation and abandonment of pastures in progress are grave symptoms of an irreversible decline caused by our insensitivity to the mountains."
"The elimination of the Leader Community initiative in favour of the rural areas is a clear example of the lack of interest in mountain areas and people."
"I wonder how the Commission intends to manage this situation equitably."
"Still on the Leader programme, we are told that, with the reformed financing, the actions under it will be funded through Objective 2."
"I am curious to see how the funds will actually be managed."
"I am convinced - and I am not too far off the truth - that some of the local action groups always financed and provided by the Leader programme will be refinanced by the new Objective 2, but I rather fear that many of them will be destined to disappear together with much of the aid, support and incentives to rural development."
"We are once again faced with a good reform of the ..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, Commissioner, representatives of the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament have all appealed to one another to keep to the timetable agreed at Cardiff, and we have been assured that at least the institution that this speaker represents is keeping to this timetable."
"We have thus shown ourselves to be unanimous in our wishes here."
"Now we should also be able to agree unanimously that once the Council has finalised its decisions by the Brussels summit in March, Parliament will then be able to take part fully in the decision-making process."
"We know that there are deadlines to meet here, so we need to agree on how this is to happen."
"The Commission communication on the Agenda 2000 document has provided a very good and solid basis for regional and structural policy reform."
"It is particularly important to simplify the administration of the Structural Funds, to place more reliance on regional and local authorities, and to concentrate resources in regions that have the greatest development problems."
"It is vital to keep to the priority of tackling the employment problem."
"The Commission's proposal is founded on the principles of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which took account of the fact that important environmental matters have gained greater prominence in the eyes of our citizens."
"The question of integrating environmental issues with regional, structural and cohesive funding does not, however, go far enough in the Commission's proposal."
"This aspect of the issue has been dealt with more effectively by Parliament."
"What is of most importance is that the environmental authorities play a full role in the selection and implementation of regional projects."
"Furthermore, the role of NGOs has to be acknowledged as part of a real effort to bring about greater transparency and better publicity."
"By making the role of partnership between the environmental authorities and NGOs more visible and genuine we can make it much easier for citizens to become involved in regional and structural policy projects."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to look briefly at the main points."
"The ceilings of 1.27 % of the gross national product on the revenue side and 0.46 % on the expenditure side for the Structural Funds should not in future be exceeded."
"For Objective 1 the threshold should be a strict 75 %!"
"Objective 6 regions - peripheral and island areas - are in the Treaty, but that is all. Phasing out should just be six years, not seven under any circumstances, otherwise you will be dealing with them forever."
"With regard to Objective 2, I do not agree with you."
"I do not like this catch-all category of yours, as the rural area will probably get a raw deal."
"I am afraid that unemployment as a sole criterion may be too harsh and I think that the soft criteria are important so that national authorities can have a say in the arrangements."
"For reasons of fairness, I want the 'phasing out' to be not four years but six, as you know is the case with Objective 1."
"I would say yes to the safety net."
"With Objective 3, I would say yes to the horizontal assistance."
"I fully agree with you on the three Community initiatives."
"If you permit others, then you will quickly find that you end up with 13 again, and that is also something that I do not want."
"No reserves, Commissioner, I cannot grant you that playground."
"National assistance is better and I would support it."
"Above all else, within the context of subsidiarity it should still be possible for us at least to use own resources without the Commission constantly stepping in."
"So please increase the 'de minimis' rule as you have already promised to do."
"My preference would be ECU 1 million, as we could easily accept that and arrange everything quite successfully."
"Commissioner, although you are already hearing about the red-green majority, I do hope that you accept sensible proposals from the other side. As I am a trade unionist, I hope that this is at least one level on which we can agree."
"Mr President, I should like to welcome both Commissioners to the House and thank them for their time and assistance."
"I should like to speak in particular about the social fund regulations and thank Mrs Jöns for her very visionary and forward-looking report."
"We must remember that when the Treaty of Amsterdam is ratified and comes into force it will have an employment chapter."
"Because of the problems of unemployment, in particular long-term unemployment across Europe, we must have preventative as well as curative measures for the long-term unemployed."
"Therefore I would hope that we maintain our emphasis on life-long learning."
"It is essential that in an ever-changing world, in technological and financial terms, we upgrade people's skills."
"We must also ensure that in our schools and colleges more emphasis is given to looking forward to seeing where the new skills are going to be required in 10 years' time so that we can put in place the training programmes for that as well."
"Most important of all is local development, where we can provide more and more assistance and more and more long-term employment, but for far smaller amounts of money than the present state aids and interventions."
"I am delighted to see that under the local social capital programme 1 % of the proposed new regulations under the ESF would be given towards that."
"Finally, we must never forget that there is nothing rigid; it must be flexible; we must adapt."
"Mr President, it is quite right that we should recognize here the efficient actions of the Member States that have received Structural Funds during their short but already ample history."
"Therefore, the obligation for all the European institutions should be to try to improve and strengthen them, without forgetting the fact that there is also inevitably a flow of capital into the more industrialised Member States."
"Will the regulations be improved?"
"We have our doubts."
"Making the conditions for being declared Objective 1 more flexible would lead to a distortion of its essence, which is fundamentally social and involves solidarity and redressing imbalances."
"We should also recall that the ruling from the Council's Legal Service was very convincing."
"The Maastricht Treaty states that it is legitimate to continue to include in the Cohesion Fund countries, such as Spain, that passed - indeed, with flying colours - the test to join the third stage of monetary union."
"If it is established, the performance reserve - at least as it is in the Commission's current proposal, with a figure of 10 % - will in practice be a political instrument that is unnecessary and even counterproductive."
"Other complementary indicators should have been taken into account, such as inequalities in health resources, the decline in working population or environmental problems."
"However, we welcome the fact that the criterion of unemployment will play an essential part."
"Finally, Mr President, I must point out the scarce amount of attention that has been paid to sustainable development in terms of the availability of energy resources and regional investment."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, no-one challenges the principle of or the need for the reform which has been proposed, but it is practical details of the reform which give us cause for concern and raise questions."
"I am thinking of my region in particular - the Nord/Pas-de-Calais region - which currently comes under Objectives 1, 2 and 5b and which stands to lose much of the aid it has received until now."
"This region suffers from high unemployment, as high as 25 % in certain areas."
"The recession here is serious and the conversion of coal fields, amongst other things, is far from complete."
"Thanks to European aid, we were able to initiate a significant development process but this would be jeopardised by any sudden cut-off in aid."
"Of course, a transitional support mechanism has been set up but, as in other cases, people are still worried and need to be reassured."
"Therefore, I would like to stress the absolute necessity of this transitional support."
"We welcome the fact that it is provided for but we would like it to be extended to all regions no longer eligible for Objective 1, 2 and 5b status. We would also like it to cover the whole programming period, in other words from 2000 to 2006."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is Parliament's first opportunity to comment on the Commission proposals for the reform of the Structural Funds, and give some clear indications on them."
"As we do this, we German Social Democrats will be anxious to discover whether or not Parliament has the strength to display some truly common, clear principles."
"The consultations have shown that, in principle, all of us want greater accuracy and a concentration of resources on what is important. This means priority should still be given to assisting regions whose development is lagging furthest behind, but it also means continuing to give an appropriate level of assistance to regions in the richer Member States which are experiencing problems with restructuring."
"We agree that we should concentrate the Structural Funds on creating employment and on simplifying structural policy, as well as helping the regions that are no longer eligible with transitional rules so that they are not just excluded all of a sudden."
"But the discussions of the last few weeks have shown that there is reason for us to fear that the representation of national interests and the horse-trading that accompanies it - something which we have so far only seen in Council - have spread to Parliament too."
"Parliament is running the risk of needlessly ruining its reputation."
"There are amendments which we will table and present tomorrow so that a decision can be taken on them, but two points should allow me to clarify the exact direction that we are heading in."
"If at first reading we are already opening the door to exceptions to the 75 % rule for Objective 1, then we are giving the Council the unequivocal signal to start horse-trading."
"The price we will pay is a long list of exceptions, and less money for the regions that really need it."
"We cannot suspend basic arithmetic, after all!"
"If we do not make the cake we are distributing any bigger but more people want a slice, then there is less for those who urgently need it."
"The cake that we are distributing is not going to become any bigger because there are more hungry people."
"On the other hand, we should not, via the back door, turn the Cohesion Fund into an unlimited instrument for redistributing income to all those Member States which are beneath a certain level of prosperity."
"European integration has not quite reached that stage yet."
"The Structural Funds are an expression of European solidarity."
"The Cohesion Fund must be concentrated on the Member States that are having difficulty in complying with the hard criteria."
"I would ask that flexibility ..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, I shall confine myself to commenting on the Community initiatives, on which Parliament is now to deliver its opinion."
"I myself am in favour of reducing the number of initiatives, but I would urge that they be reduced from thirteen to five, which still simplifies matters very considerably."
"These would be Interreg, which has a very clear European added value, Leader, which guarantees rural development, and the Community initiatives on combating discrimination in access to the labour market, all of which are excellent."
"However, I also regard URBAN as extremely important."
"Focusing attention on Objective 2 cities is a good idea, but it is not enough."
"Medium-sized cities outside the objective areas should also be given a chance, and this is what URBAN, which has already proved its effectiveness, does."
"We all know that urban development and the accumulation of problems in cities has now almost become a global problem."
"It is a good idea to focus equal attention on their problems in tandem with the development of rural areas."
"Together with Mrs McCarthy, the PPE Group has tabled a compromise amendment on behalf of the Socialist and PPE Groups, which I would urge Parliament to support."
"In the amendment, we call for the possibility of creating an instrument at EU level that can be applied flexibly in regions feeling the effects of the rapid changes that industrial processes are currently undergoing."
"There are at least three reasons for these changes: firstly, increasing globalisation; secondly, the dramatic upheaval caused by the information and communication technologies; and thirdly, enlargement towards Central and Eastern Europe."
"We felt we had to table this amendment in order to ensure that we ourselves have the possibility of reacting flexibly."
"Moreover, we will shortly be living in euroland, and if there were to be a real crisis, there is currently nothing in the Structural Funds that could help the EU countries to deal with it."
"As a consequence of the amendment, I would also, as is only logical, urge that the contribution be raised to 7 % to ensure that funding is not taken away from the other initiatives."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by making the point that I believe that in the current phase of the European Union's development regional policy is perhaps more important than ever before."
"One of the encouraging things we have seen over the last few years is the reduction of the gap in wealth between the rich and the poor Member States."
"On the other hand we have seen the prosperity gap between Europe's regions increasing."
"That demonstrates very clearly that more than ever before we need a proactive regional policy which ensures that all regions of the European Union benefit from firstly, the single market and, secondly, the establishment of the euro zone."
"There are two things I should like to emphasise with regard to the report."
"Firstly, there is a consensus between the Commission and Parliament and, I believe, the Council of Ministers, that we need a simplification of the regulations governing the structural funds."
"But also there is a crying need for more partnership between everyone who is involved in the process of economic development: the social partners, local authorities or regional government as well as the Commission and central governments."
"We need to work much more closely together on identifiable objectives."
"The second point concerns the principle of concentration."
"There is a strong case to be made for concentration."
"We want to make sure that the structural funds have the greatest possible economic impact and therefore we must target the areas of greatest need very carefully."
"I would like to refer to one area of identifiable need, my own country, Wales."
"There is a reasonable chance now that much of Wales would qualify for Objective I funding."
"Certainly the resources would be put to very good use there, based on the principle of concentration and partnership."
"Mr President, there have been few times when the various rapporteurs and draftsmen in a committee have worked so much in unison as we have done in the Committee on Fisheries on the reform of the Structural Funds. We were trying to prevent structural actions in the fisheries sector from being left practically to the Commission's discretion and to neutralise the contradictions and the enormous programming problems that the current proposal presents."
"Therefore, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries on the framework regulation, I have proposed the creation of a single legal instrument that would enable us to draw up a regulation on fisheries Structural Funds - the FIFG - which, being horizontal in nature, might bring together all the structural actions involving the fisheries sector, as the Commission itself has already done for the agricultural sector."
"This need for a single sectorial legal instrument was easily understood by the various parliamentary committees and the change proposed will - I hope - be incorporated at this first reading."
"The fisheries sector does, in fact, need to have access to a series of structural measures that must be the same for the entire sector, regardless of the region in which a particular fisheries enterprise is established."
"That is why the legal instrument that embraces them needs to be of a horizontal nature."
"This essential horizontal nature is destroyed by the regional planning that the Commission's proposal establishes for Objective 2 regions."
"The result of this will be enormous programming difficulties in the fisheries sector and serious risks of relocation of enterprises, as they will establish themselves in those regions where there are regional programmes or where the regional programmes are more favourable to them."
"It was therefore necessary to correct this tendency so that the Member States might have the flexibility needed to establish the most appropriate level of programming for the fisheries sector, regardless of the region concerned."
"Commissioner, you have seen that many Members have spoken on the subject of fisheries."
"The structural side of the fisheries sector is greatly affected ..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioners, I think it is now quite clear to both Parliament and the Commission that the Structural Funds must be focused much more than before on the priorities of Community policy, and one of the main priorities for us is equal opportunities between men and women in employment, social policy and regional policy."
"The Structural Funds could be quite a trump card in improving equal opportunities, if only this were spelled out in the regulations governing them."
"Previously, these regulations referred to equal opportunities, but in such a half-hearted way that often nothing much was actually done in practice."
"Women were given attention in training and employment initiatives, but the Member States were far less enthusiastic when it came to infrastructure and regional policy."
"I would love to know, in figures, just how much has been spent on female entrepreneurship, social infrastructure, reconciling job and family, and support for women in rural areas."
"The Commission has done its best."
"It has organised two conferences and supplied information on good practice."
"The Council even passed a resolution on the subject in December 1996, but none of this was enough."
"We are therefore particularly pleased that the Commission is making an effort to strengthen the principle of equal opportunities in legislation, and we welcome the twin-track approach it proposes of incorporating equal opportunities right across all the Structural Funds while also devoting special attention to equal opportunities between men and women."
"Yet we still think, Commissioners, that greater attention can and must seriously be given to this subject."
"I am particularly grateful to the rapporteurs and especially to Karin Jöns for looking very carefully at the questions raised by the Committee on Women's Rights here."
"We want to see improvements in two areas."
"Firstly, mainstreaming must have a much higher profile and must be much more quantifiable, in other words equal opportunities must be translated into clear objectives, clear statistics broken down by gender, accurate indicators and detailed evaluations."
"Organisations must be able to prove whether and how they have spent money on equal opportunities for women."
"Making structural policy work also means involving women more."
"This means that women must be included in the monitoring committees, and those responsible for equal opportunities must be involved in all stages of the implementation of the Structural Funds."
"Secondly, alongside mainstreaming we also want to see accompanying measures specifically designed to eliminate inequality."
"We therefore think that the excellent measures that have only just been launched under the Community initiative should be retained in the new Community initiatives in the future."
"Finally, as Karin Jöns said, we insist that 15 % of the Social Fund should be used for equal opportunities."
"I have to say that I cannot understand why the PPE Members are opposed to this."
"The Commission itself has proposed it, and we all know that special measures are needed."
"Mr President, the structural funds have been a great success for Europe in Ireland."
"On the whole, the bulk of the funds have been used very well though there have been some instances when European funds were used for projects which threaten to undermine our environment."
"However, what a difference a few short months make."
"Our government has put together a package which must fail the Eurostat test for structural funds which requires eligible regions to have less than 75 % of average European GDP."
"The structural funds for Ireland are in danger of becoming a victim of this particular plan."
"We should have put aside party political divisions and established priorities based on need in targeted rural and urban unemployment blackspots."
"The plan could have faced the need to integrate immigrants and refugees also."
"Instead, its only contribution to future regional planning has been to produce a plan so bizarre that it can only be designed to fail."
"We should have put aside party political wrangling."
"The Irish Government's strategy is, at best, a party political deal based on expediency."
"At worst it is a cruel attempt to deceive the Irish people."
"Proposing at the last moment a plan that must be rejected by Brussels has only one aim: to blame Brussels for its rejection."
"I would like to thank both Commissioners present for their own contributions to the success in Ireland."
"We have, however, substantial and real underprivileged and underdevelopment, in particular in the west and in parts of Dublin and other urban blackspots."
"We have a serious literacy problem."
"We need a revised structural fund to tackle these and other problems and a greater political consensus to solve them effectively."
"I can only hope that there is sufficient goodwill in the Commission and in this House to ignore the dithering and mismanagement of our government."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I have to interrupt the debate at this point."
"You must forgive me for being strict, but we had an hour ahead of us and 50 speakers on the list."
"The debate is therefore adjourned."
"It will be resumed this evening at 9 p.m."
"Situation in Central America and EU action"
"The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the situation in Central America and European Union action."
"I give the floor first to Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, President-in-Office of the Council."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, some of the disasters of our times are predictable."
"Then we can at least take measures to prevent them or reduce their impact."
"But the scale of some other disasters is unpredictable and there is no human means of preventing them."
"Hurricane Mitch was that kind of disaster in Central America."
"Hurricane Mitch was a Category 5 hurricane."
"It was the most violent whirlwind to hit the Caribbean this century."
"You all know the consequences, insofar as we can estimate them at all at this stage."
"I am grateful to Parliament for proposing that we should discuss this question in the plenary today."
"Once again we are facing a situation that is so serious that all the international players must cooperate intensively, coordinate their efforts and mobilise all the available resources."
"The effects of Hurricane Mitch call for measures at two levels: firstly at the level of humanitarian emergency aid and, secondly, at the level of long-term reconstruction aid for the countries concerned."
"The fact is that the hurricane caused damage that none of the countries concerned, and probably very few countries anyway, could repair by their own efforts alone."
"Economic development in these countries appears to have been set back years, perhaps decades."
"They cannot tackle the short, medium and long-term effects of this disaster unless the international community provides generous and effective aid."
"We are referring to them as the countries concerned, but that is not all they are: they are our direct partners, these countries are our friends and partners in the framework of San José."
"We regard the European Union as representing above all a community of values and of solidarity, a Community whose members must show solidarity not only among themselves, but also and in particular with all other states and their inhabitants."
"These are not just so many empty words, as shown also by the rapid response of the Member States and Commission departments to the news of this natural disaster."
"Following a request by Spain, which the Austrian Presidency was only too happy to endorse, the General Affairs Council began to consider the question of humanitarian aid for the countries concerned at its meeting of 9 and 10 November."
"All the delegations welcomed this initiative and the proposal for emergency aid."
"An inquiry carried out during that Council meeting showed that the Union as a whole is making ECU 100 million available, of which ECU 70 million comes directly from the Member States and ECU 30 million from Community resources."
"I am in constant contact with Commissioner Emma Bonino, who is currently visiting that same crisis-hit region, where she has had contacts with the governments, the international organisations and the non-governmental humanitarian organisations and has also been able to see for herself the scale of the damage and of course of the necessary aid measures."
"ECHO will be submitting a further global humanitarian plan so that we can determine the additional funding that is required."
"But the amount of resources is not the only important factor; another is the way in which they are used."
"We must prevent hunger, disease and epidemics in the worst-hit areas and guarantee minimum supplies of food, drinking water, medicines and emergency shelter."
"The use of the financial aid must be monitored strictly."
"The material aid must be distributed as quickly and directly as possible to the suffering people of the region, and for three reasons in my opinion."
"Firstly, it is because the humanitarian aid must have as rapid and direct an effect as possible. Secondly, it is because we have an obligation to our taxpayers and contributors, who are entitled to see their contributions used for the right purposes."
"Moreover, the best means of preventing aid fatigue is by utilising the aid in an absolutely exact and correct way."
"In this context, we must not forget that other regions of world, such as Kosovo but also Bangladesh, are also in great need of humanitarian aid."
"The third and last reason is the need to maintain social peace and political stability in the recipient countries."
"The poverty and despair among the suffering people, the governments' failure to manage the crisis, and inadequate, slow and poorly organised aid measures can, as we all know, produce a social powder keg that could easily explode."
"The appropriate lessons should therefore be learned from comparable experiences in the recent past."
"Misappropriations of financial aid and the resulting social unrest following this kind of natural disaster are, unfortunately, the rule rather than the exception."
"At the same time, we must begin even at this stage to think seriously about reconstruction and a development plan."
"Here special attention will also have to be given to reafforestation, for instance, since deforestation evidently made the effects of the hurricane even worse."
"In Nicaragua, despite the tradition of political polarisation, the disaster appears to have led to a new approach, towards a more pragmatic and consensual policy with regard to the current problems."
"It seems inadequate and also illogical to provide humanitarian aid without at the same time cancelling at least a major portion of the debts of the hardest-hit countries, Honduras and Nicaragua, which are also the most heavily indebted countries in the region - the foreign debt of Honduras is 92 % of its GDP, and that of Nicaragua 300 %."
"That is why we attach special importance to the trust funds to be set up by the Inter-American Development Bank and the International Monetary Fund with a view to cancelling the multilateral debts of the countries concerned, and we should all support this."
"Austria is currently drafting a law to that effect at my initiative."
"The aid measures by the international community are now under way."
"The share provided by the European Union - the Member States and the Community together - is substantial, and is a reflection in humanitarian terms of the Union's importance and weight."
"Above all, we should show that we have learned from past experience in the conduct of humanitarian actions."
"But we will also cooperate closely with the governments concerned, for they now have an opportunity, through reconstruction, to improve their economic and technical structures and also their social, environmental and political structures."
"We shall also call on the governments to make the appropriate contributions here."
"I have therefore asked for this subject to be placed on the agenda of the next Development Cooperation Council, which I myself will be chairing on 30 November, and expect practical proposals on long-term aid measures to be discussed there."
"Thank you for your attention; I am of course available at any time to answer further questions during the debate."
"As you heard from the President-in-Office, Mrs Bonino is currently visiting the disaster area in order to see for herself, and on behalf of the Commission, what the situation is like there."
"Clearly, alongside the measures that the presidency has already taken, the Commission felt that priority had to be given to providing emergency aid for the most vulnerable people in the region."
"A preliminary detailed assessment indicates that things like food, blankets, medicines and chlorine are urgently needed, as well as cooking utensils and the like."
"Pending a more complete analysis, the Commission approved an aid programme of almost ECU 7 million under the emergency procedure provided for in Article 13 of the regulation on humanitarian aid."
"We were thus able to make a very timely and substantial contribution to the international aid effort as early as 4 November."
"The first aid programme is being carried out by the German and Spanish Red Cross, in cooperation with their sister organisations in the countries affected and 11 European NGOs already working on ECHO projects in the region."
"The first phase, in more detail, is as follows: first of all, direct support is being provided via the various national disaster programmes, and major efforts are being made on the ground to coordinate the work of national and international organisations, United Nations bodies, the International Development Bank, the World Bank, USAid and the European Commission, because coordination is the key to ensuring that all the human and financial resources deployed in the region are used as effectively as possible."
"There are a number of measures which form part of this and which focus on a regional or sectoral approach, such as the Red Cross's work to save victims and organise evacuations, help in providing a water supply, measures to protect public health, water purification tablets to prevent epidemics, and so on. Médecins sans Frontières has been extremely active and is receiving our support."
"The international Red Cross federation is being supported in its attempts to restore the very fragile and damaged communication network, which is vital for the distribution of the first emergency aid supplies."
"Existing humanitarian aid projects being run by NGOs in the region have been reorganised to provide the most urgently needed aid."
"The NGOs were already on the spot and have been able to provide help straight away, and they have reorganised or adapted ECU 3 million worth of projects to deal with the current situation."
"The emergency aid under ECHO has come to ECU 10 million up to now, and the total including food aid is some ECU 30 million."
"The ECHO workers are now asking for extra funding in order to organise another aid programme, which is likely to be finalised in the next few weeks and which will probably be on the same scale as the previous one."
"However, this second phase of emergency aid will also need to include a recovery element in order to prepare for the transition to more structured recovery work and aid for economic reconstruction."
"There is just one point I would like to make about the prospects for recovery and reconstruction programmes in the short and medium terms."
"Of course, we are still waiting for a detailed analysis of the effects of this terrible natural disaster on the economies of Central America, but there is no doubt that each of the countries involved has suffered enormous structural damage."
"The first assessments mainly talk about damage to key sectors like agriculture, roads and supply systems."
"The Commission is examining what potential funding could be provided to make an early and substantial contribution to the international reconstruction effort."
"Our approach from this point onwards will be as follows. In the short term, in other words in December this year, the Commission will put a funding proposal to the Member States using an urgent procedure, setting out a framework for future action."
"The proposal will be based on whatever funding for reconstruction and technical financial cooperation is still left in the 1998 budget."
"As soon as access is possible to the areas affected, a multidisciplinary technical evaluation team will be sent there in close coordination with the Member States and with the national authorities and other donors."
"The development programmes planned for 1999 will be reviewed and adapted case by case, in close consultation with the beneficiary countries."
"Current projects may be strengthened or restructured to help with recovery or reconstruction."
"In addition, a strategic approach may require the setting-up of a regional reconstruction fund in the medium term, say, and the Commission could put forward proposals on this subject to the Council after consultations with all the parties involved, including other donors and the governments of the countries affected."
"The main problem with this strategy is the rather low level of funding currently provided under the budget line for recovery and reconstruction in Latin America, B7-313, which at present amounts to only ECU 4.25 million."
"Of course, the budgetary authority could take a decision to allocate extra funding to this budget line."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first I wish to thank the Council and the Commission for the emergency aid."
"It is perhaps not always a matter of course in this House for us to thank one another, but I do want to express my open praise for them here."
"I am also glad that Mrs Bonino has made the European Union visible in Central America through her presence there."
"I have little time and will therefore be brief."
"Unfortunately, this will not be the last natural disaster to occur, so I would advise that we consider building up a kind of disaster aid system."
"A number of countries in the world actually have a special ministry for disasters, with its own transport capacity, aircraft and perhaps even satellites for predicting natural disasters."
"My second point is that longer-term reconstruction aid should be given not only to the states of this region, but also towards the integration of the region."
"Now that so much has been destroyed, infrastructure measures, roads, telecommunications, energy networks and so forth can in fact also help to turn this region, inhabited by something over 30 million people, into a common region."
"The European Parliament, with the support of the Council and the Commission, has always expressed strong political support for the integration of this region."
"My third comment is that we keep saying the aid must be unbureaucratic."
"On the other hand, it must be carefully thought through, planned for the long term and as transparent as possible."
"That is squaring the circle, I know."
"Perhaps we could discuss one day how we really can square the circle, since otherwise we shall be in trouble with the Court of Auditors again."
"Mr President, there are of course misfortunes that do not need describing at length and I think that this is true of the tragic case of hurricane Mitch."
"It is time to act."
"Until now, the Commission has acted promptly and efficiently and such action needs to be acknowledged and considered in a positive light."
"Efforts are now needed to set up an ambitious and strategic reconstruction plan."
"It is not simply a matter of hoping these things will happen, but of making sure they become a reality."
"Mr President, in my opinion, such a plan has to contain several components."
"The first component relates to the budgetary dimension, and the response given by the European Union to this situation has to be in line with that of the Member States."
"I have to say that I feel particularly proud of how my country, Spain, the Spanish Government and the whole of Spanish society have responded to this situation."
"I think that, as an arm of the budgetary authority, the European Parliament must set an example of generosity and flexibility in this budgetary dimension and mobilise as many resources as possible."
"The Commission's representative, Mr van den Broek referred to this a moment ago."
"Such a plan also needs to contain a substantial trade component."
"For two years, this House has been calling for Central American countries to be included in the Generalised System of Preferences, like the Andean countries, including for industrial products."
"This, Madam President-in-Office, needs to be done unconditionally and without delay, because I have to say that the double condition contained in the Commission's proposal is inadmissable - given the circumstances - as well as being discriminating. What is more, it completely contradicts the philosophy that has inspired such measures."
"This plan also needs a credit component and, in my opinion, as part of the plan's strategy, the Commission should endeavour to propose a whole series of measures that, taking advantage of the scale of this tragedy, are aimed at increasing the European Investment Bank's credits to this region."
"In addition, there obviously needs to be a debt component. It must not be said here that the European Union does not have any competence in this area because, Mr President, it is clear that there is nothing to prevent either the Commission or Parliament from asking the Member States to make clear concessions on the issue of debt."
"I would ask, Commissioner, that in addition to the components I have just outlined, the Commission make use of its imagination."
"In the fight against misfortune and tragedy, and very often against reality - however hard it may be -, the best weapons, although they may not seem like it, are not the resources that have to be used in an efficient and coordinated manner, as Mrs Ferrero-Waldner pointed out."
"Often, the imagination also has an important part to play in such situations."
"And, Mr President, I would call on the Presidency of the Council to act by setting in motion the wheels of political dialogue as well as calling an extraordinary meeting of the San José Conference at ministerial level."
"I think that this ministerial conference could, to a certain extent, give incentive to the possible conference of donors to which the representative of the Commission, Mr van den Broek, referred in his speech."
"I think that it is time to look to the future and view this tragedy as an opportunity to further unite the inhabitants of Central America and encourage them to double their efforts in pursuit of regional integration and greater solidarity."
"To sum up, Mr President, I call on the Commission to spare no resources and to mobilise all its efforts."
"And you can rest assured, Commissioner, that the Commission - and I would ask you to pass this on to the Commissioner responsible for this policy, Mr Marín - will have the support of this House, because we shall never say of those who are doing all they can, that they are not doing what they should."
"Mr President, I just wanted to add a few words to what my colleagues in the Socialist Group and the Group of the European People's Party have been saying in relation to the urgent action - and subsequent action - that needs to be carried out by the European Union, at both Council and Commission level, in the areas affected by the disaster."
"In July, I had the opportunity to visit the countries involved and saw that they had begun a very positive recovery process following the internal wrangles and serious conflicts they had experienced, and I could see that they were genuinely on the road to recovery with a real desire to cooperate."
"In a matter of hours, nature, in a most brutal and unfortunate way, destroyed the work of recent years."
"I think that from our privileged position in Europe, we must show as much solidarity as possible with the societies and people affected. We must also bear in mind those urgent aspects where, logically, public authorities at all levels - starting with the administration of the European Union, the governments of the Member States, and the other levels of administration within Europe - should be directly involved, together with non-governmental organisations."
"I would like to stress that it is essential to review these countries' debt so that it does not impede their possible recovery. Moreover, as we propose in our joint motion for a resolution, it is also vital to build the foundations for a medium and long-term recovery that will consolidate and restore the process that, as I said, I had the opportunity to see at first hand in July."
"Mr President, Hurricane Mitch has devastated Central America, destroying everything in its path."
"This would be just another news story if there were not such an immeasurable human drama behind it all which, sadly, will remain a gaping wound for a long time to come."
"Throughout history, nature has made its presence felt through extremes, creating natural disasters which unfortunately take place all too often in areas that are already poor."
"These disasters add inhumane conditions, grief, desolation, separation, illness and the anguish of the aftermath to economic instability."
"As a member of the interparliamentary Delegation for relations with the countries of Central America and Mexico, last May I had the opportunity to visit Honduras with a few colleagues and we were able to see how, even in the capital, Tegucigalpa, the hand held out by the Union was already a lifeline for these populations before the hurricane struck."
"Now, we not only have a duty towards them, but a real moral debt, which must take the form of a long-term commitment."
"The international community as a whole has immediately lent a hand, and its spontaneity is not all as it has also provided supplies, clothing, means of transport, water filters, medicines and mobile hospitals. Like my colleague, I am proud to be French."
"And although, of course, I fully support the value of the emergency aid provided to these countries and pay tribute to the men and women in the field who are making every effort to reconstruct basic infrastructures to support a population which has absolutely nothing, I believe that the worst we could do would be to forget them after this emergency aid."
"After this united effort, the world's rich nations, together with the governments of these countries, must draw up a plan for rebuilding this area and go beyond cancelling debts."
"However, we must not make the mistake of making decisions for them, as I believe that the chance to support the development of democracy in these countries has been presented to us on a plate."
"Alongside these plans we should introduce close dialogue with these governments, but also with the populations and organisations of these countries, to whom we must give the means to play a role in their own reconstruction."
"Mr President, I completely agree with the President-in-Office of the Council, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, when she said that the hurricane had been very strong and devastating because it was classed as a level 5 hurricane."
"However, we must also bear in mind - and I think that many non-governmental organisations are highlighting this fact - that if there had been housing in this area that was not substandard, a civic network that could have predicted what could happen and, in short, if there had been greater consolidation of human rights in that area, the hurricane would not have been as devastating."
"And I agree with many of the issues raised here by Mr Salafranca and Mr Linkhor in relation to generalised preferences for these countries."
"However, in the short time I have left, I shall inform you of what was said to us by some Members and certain Central American organisations at a seminar held last week in Brussels."
"Their main concerns are the following."
"First, they believe that in this case we need to review the cooperation agreements and, as other Members have said, adapt them to the medium and long term to help recovery in the area."
"Second, there needs to be a way to ensure that aid reaches those affected."
"Unfortunately, this has not always been the case in the past."
"Third, the distribution of aid has to take the town councils into consideration."
"There are small councils that are facing many difficulties but lack resources to deal effectively with these problems."
"Fourth, a call must be made to have these countries' debt written off. We are all aware that it amounts to 300 % of gross domestic product in Nicaragua, but it is equally high in other countries."
"Fifth, it is essential that a debt write-off does not serve to alleviate the governments' concerns, but those of the people."
"This is why the total amount of debt should be earmarked for specific recovery projects in the area."
"I also feel proud, as Mr Salafranca said, not only of the response of the Spanish Government but, more particularly, that of the Spanish nation."
"It has shown a great sense of solidarity."
"But that is for now."
"We shall see what happens in January and February. We all need to continue acting beyond this emotional period surrounding the events in Central America."
"Mr President, a disaster on this scale calls for reactions going far beyond those of the past."
"Thousands of people have died or lost everything, in part also because no precautions were taken as the hurricane roared towards them, because the poorest people have to live in the unsafest areas, because whole swathes of land were deforested for industrial agriculture."
"Central America has been devastated; it will take decades to reconstruct."
"But if this reconstruction is to work, these countries do not just need effective handouts of aid packages."
"They need a far-sighted reconstruction plan to be drawn up, not a patchwork of gift packages which, as we have seen in the past, seep away into dubious or government-chosen channels."
"Well-coordinated reconstruction must be aimed primarily at improving the condition of the population."
"Top priority must be given to health, education and housing, as well as far-reaching agricultural reform."
"The people concerned must have a say and a right of control here."
"Central America needs total, bilateral debt cancellation. France is setting a good example here."
"The other EU countries should follow suit as quickly as possible."
"But it is not just a question of writing off debts that can in any case no longer be recovered."
"The multilateral debts must also be cancelled."
"The IMF and the World Bank will help out with loans, but these must not be tied to structural adjustment measures."
"The European governments should therefore make real use of their influence at the IMF and the World Bank to make sure the loans are not conditional."
"According to today's 'Guardian', the prospects for Chiquita are rosy."
"The banana multinationals will make the insurance companies pay for the reconstruction of their plant, while their workers are left on the streets."
"The multinationals, for instance those in Honduras that have not paid taxes for years, are trying to evade their responsibility."
"The devastation caused by a hurricane is not just the result of a force of nature descending on mankind."
"The destruction of the ozone layer, the thoughtless wastage of natural resources and the reckless poisoning of the environment play their part in the disaster."
"And this will not be the last one, unless the industrialised countries engage in a process of radical rethinking."
"Mr President, with each day that passes and as people begin to assess the human toll and material damage caused by hurricane Mitch, the true scale of the disaster is gradually emerging."
"On this occasion, nature has not been kind to the countries of Central America, but we should remember - as Parliament has - that it was the hand of man and his negligence that has caused climate change to unleash natural disasters such as this."
"We must all be aware - particularly industrialised countries - that if we do not radically change our behaviour, other hurricanes will follow hurricane Mitch with similar and devastating effects."
"In Central America, ladies and gentlemen, as is almost always the case, the weakest have lost the most."
"It is therefore our unavoidable duty to ensure that aid is distributed in the most efficient, effective and coordinated way possible so that it reaches, above all, those who need it most and so that it does not become a source of corruption as has unfortunately been the case in other similar situations."
"Lastly, we would like to publicly welcome the excellent displays of solidarity that have been made by the citizens of Europe individually and by the institutions that represent them, particularly the European institutions."
"We must welcome the rapid response that has been given to a situation that required immediate solutions."
"On many occasions, we have complained about the bureaucratic red tape that has delayed Europe's response to such situations, but today we can thank it for responding so promptly."
"Now all that is needed is for this action to be supplemented by totally writing off the debts of the countries concerned."
"Mr President, we have been shocked to see the devastation in Central America."
"When the forces of nature wreak havoc in this way, leaving behind a trail of destruction, death and injury, we cannot help but feel completely powerless."
"Even in today's modern society with all its technical expertise, nature can still take us by surprise, though in this case it was not a total surprise in that we knew Hurricane Mitch was on its way shortly before it arrived."
"The impact of the hurricane was bound to be hard, but the scale of the disaster was increased by the type of region affected."
"Poor farmers had been driven out by large landowners to farm on higher mountain slopes, with disastrous consequences."
"The hurricane was unleashed on the deforested slopes and washed everything away in a destructive river of mud."
"However, the most important thing at the moment is to ensure that adequate help is provided."
"A great deal has already been done by countries all over the world, including in Europe."
"The example set by France and the Netherlands in writing off debts should be followed by the other EU countries, and the same applies to the rescheduling of debt repayments by the financial institutions and the international financial organisations."
"In the longer term, a socially and ecologically responsible programme needs to be set up to help farmers and to restore the environment."
"The major landowners must cooperate in genuinely sustainable development, including appropriate measures to combat erosion, and it would be advisable to involve the NGOs here."
"Mr President, I want to speak on debt rescheduling to revive the economies of the countries struck by the catastrophe."
"The countries cannot all be measured by the same yardstick: Guatemala and El Salvador seem to be richer countries than Nicaragua and Honduras, or at least less poor."
"When the criterion for debt remission is established, the actual difference between national incomes might favour differential treatment depending on the economic and financial situation of the country involved."
"In this way, the clauses agreed at Naples on the fringe of the 1993 G7 meeting, which provided for 66 % debt remission, could be applied to the less disadvantaged countries, while the G7 Lyons Agreement of 1996 could be applied to the most disadvantaged: remission of up to 80 % of debt."
"In Nicaragua, as in Honduras, the already difficult economic situation is now expected to get worse, with damaging repercussions on a poverty threshold calculated today at 60 % of the population, and increases in rates of unemployment which currently stand at 53 % in Nicaragua and 30 % in Honduras."
"Mr President, the rapid reaction from the Community institutions and civil society is a sign that we have got off on the right foot."
"But it is only a start; everything else is still to be done and Parliament eagerly awaits Commissioner Bonino's report and the proposals she is going to suggest to us."
"In fact, the catastrophe in Central America is not just a natural and a human catastrophe, it is also, and above all, a political catastrophe."
"All these years we have been thinking in terms of political unity for Central America in the hope of bringing peace to the region in the face of the wars which have torn it apart, and now there is the possibility of a new social breakdown."
"We have supported Parlacen, the parliament of Central America."
"We have always thought in terms of regional interdependence."
"Well, now we must try to reproduce that interdependence in the proposed second stage of our intervention."
"We must think in terms of interdependence in relation to the plan to combat the mass unemployment which has immediately resulted, the infrastructure plan, the financial plan - where the problem of bilateral and multilateral debt remission arises both for the countries affected and for the international organisations - and above all in relation to multilateral cooperation between the donor countries. This must of course operate, as Mr Salafranca just said, in association with the San José Conference, but must definitely involve the continuous presence of the Union and not just at this emergency stage."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to convey my sincere sympathy and dismay to those who live in the countries of Central America."
"I shall continue in German."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have heard it many times."
"The scale of the disaster is enormous and there has been nothing like it ever before, at least not in this region."
"So we really must all try to make our support as good and comprehensive as possible."
"There must be no taboos here."
"I have already said this at a meeting of our delegation."
"Parliament and the Council must jointly and rapidly consider how to release the necessary budget funds."
"The funds allocated so far can only be a first step, since we shall be needing a great deal of money for reconstruction for many years to come."
"Nicaragua and Honduras were in any case two of the poorest countries in the world, and now they are even poorer."
"So we need a great deal of money and we will have to take a very unconventional approach here."
"That is why I would like to repeat the proposal I made during the delegation meeting: we must seriously consider whether European Development Fund money could not be made available for this disaster because of their particularly difficult situation."
"Of course Honduras and Nicaragua are not ACP states, but we have to take an unconventional approach here."
"If some of the ACP states do not utilise the funds earmarked for them, perhaps these funds should be made available for disaster and reconstruction aid."
"In the long term, I believe these countries will have to become members of the Lomé Convention, because how can we in fact justify withholding the Lomé preferences and financial resources from these countries, which are the poorest in the world and now becoming even poorer?"
"We cannot justify it at all."
"If we want to be really honest, we really will have to do everything in our power."
"That is part of it."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the situation in Central America is devastating: 12 000 people are dead, 18 000 missing."
"In Honduras, 90 % of the banana harvest has been ruined and 70 % of the roads are destroyed."
"A majority of Central American states have seen their development set back by years."
"The European Union aid is vital, not least as a means of preventing the threat of an escalation of the political situation in Nicaragua."
"The call for resources to be used to maximum effect in the motion for a resolution is of course welcome."
"Besides the humanitarian aspects, which we all support in this House and where we strongly encourage the Commission to continue its activities, let me address a further aspect, following on from what Mr Kreissl-Dörfler said."
"Many experts believe that the high level of greenhouse gas emissions is one of the main causes of this environmental disaster."
"In these circumstances, I cannot understand why the adoption of rules on reducing greenhouse gases was postponed for another two years at the climate conference in Buenos Aires."
"I believe that it is essential, precisely in view of this kind of natural disaster, for the Union to give firm support to a rapid, worldwide reduction of CO2 emissions."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the Commission and the Council for their presence."
"In Central America, more than one generation will go by before the consequences of hurricane Mitch are fully overcome. This infernal hurricane has left a fateful mark that is far greater than was originally imagined."
"The area affected has been set back several decades and its efforts to heal the deep wounds of its most recent past have been undone."
"The countries affected are aware of the reality of their situation: they have only a minimum response capability and State structures that are too weak to cope with the damage."
"We are seeing societies that, resigned to their fate, refuse, in spite of everything that has happened, to lose even hope in the face of these tragedies that affect them from time to time, as though they were some sort of collective Sisyphus watching his work being undone, just as he was about to complete it."
"My sincere congratulations go to the Commission for responding immediately - mainly in the form of humanitarian aid - and also to the Member States for acting with equal speed."
"Our societies - and I know this has been the case in Spain - have shown solidarity and generosity, and in some cases have even surpassed government responses. However, the measures taken until now, though quite substantial, will not be enough."
"Governments need to solve the problem of these countries' debt through an act of strict justice, as a useful tool to cooperate in kick-starting their economies."
"I would like my government, the Spanish Government, to write off the debt of these countries and for all the Member States to follow suit so that it can be used for physical, medical, educational or environmental infrastructures."
"As has been said, a regional aid and reconstruction plan will be necessary and should be launched in January or February. The institutions of the European Union will undoubtedly have to make their financial and budgetary mechanisms more flexible in order to support this plan."
"The tragedy of pain and death was caused by the hurricane and it is up to all of us to alleviate its consequences and help build a future for the people."
"Mr President, as a vice-chairman of the PPE Group, with responsibility for relations with Latin America, I would briefly like to express the feelings of solidarity our group shares with the victims of the tragedy, as well as our delight at seeing that this popular and official sentiment of solidarity has been so strong."
"I would also like to say how pleased we are at the speed with which Parliament's Delegation for relations with Central America and Mexico met, at the request of Mr Salafranca, and with the large number of Members that attended this extraordinary meeting along with the Vice-President of the Commission, Mr Marín, and Commissioner Bonino."
"Finally, we must welcome the huge amount of aid generated in Europe, not by each state on its own, but by all of them together."
"Perhaps this aid may be symbolised by the visits to the area by the Prince of Spain, Don Felipe de Borbón, President Chirac and Commissioner Bonino."
"These three names perhaps best reflect the European aid given, aid that will certainly not be lacking in the future."
"Mr President, the countries of Central America which were devastated by hurricane Mitch were already seriously afflicted by the aftermath of years of civil war."
"In all of them high rates of illiteracy, grinding poverty and the crushing burden of international debt were endemic, as those of us who have visited the area have seen."
"Now hit by the most deadly storm of the century, innumerable villages, shanty towns, bridges and roads have been swept away, crops destroyed, farm stock decimated, supplies of water eliminated, and many thousands are dead."
"The European Union and all who have sent emergency aid are worthy of the highest praise."
"The steps taken to relieve the burden of debt are also of vital importance."
"It will, however, take years to rebuild the economies of these countries which were, in any case, desperately poor."
"We need to face the fact that there is a pressing need not merely for a moratorium on debt servicing but also for debt cancellation."
"Honduras and Nicaragua will never be able to repay the interest on what they owe and postponing their liabilities is not enough."
"Furthermore, medium- and long-term development aid must not be allowed to be cut back, particularly for social needs."
"In land ownership there are all sorts of problems over tenure."
"The need for land reform is more pressing than ever."
"The European Union has long been deeply concerned with Central America, for instance through the San José process."
"We must redouble our efforts to help."
"The Council, the Commission and Parliament should facilitate the use of unspent funds in our budget for relief."
"The disaster also reminds us of the need for far-reaching international action to limit environmental damage from climatic change, which will otherwise cause ever more frequent catastrophes, some even worse than the one we are talking about this evening."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, may I briefly respond?"
"Firstly, I am very grateful for the support expressed in the various statements made, and also for the many suggestions and ideas put forward by Parliament, which will certainly prompt me to review these matters again at the Development Cooperation Council on 30 November."
"In summary, let me say the following: the main issue is the coordination of the humanitarian aid - and also of the reconstruction and development aid - and here we will first have to achieve coordination between the partners, a task which the presidency intends to tackle mainly on the ground."
"Secondly, it is of course very important to consider the debt clearance question."
"This too has already been discussed in the General Affairs Council."
"We shall be devoting great attention to this issue at the Development Cooperation Council, but of course preparations are also under way for a donor conference."
"A donor conference is to be held in Washington on 10 and 11 December."
"There it will also be determined, under the aegis of the Inter-American Development Bank, what amounts can still be demanded."
"Another conference has now been scheduled for March, in Stockholm, which will focus on long-term reconstruction."
"As regards the debts, we must of course distinguish very clearly between bilateral debts - development loans on the one hand and export credits on the other - and multilateral debts, in particular the HIPC initiative which is indeed seeking either the creation of a new fund, which the presidency will of course support and encourage, or drawing on existing World Bank funds, which we will also support."
"For the rest, everything I said earlier has been discussed during the debate."
"Perhaps just a word on the climate convention: we all know that the European Union is, of course, making headway here, but that it is not easy to bring all the other major players on board too."
"Speaking for myself and also on behalf of the Commission and Emma Bonino and Manolo Marín, who could not be here but who would certainly have been delighted to take part in this debate, I would like to thank you for the tremendous unanimity of feeling and solidarity that you have all shown towards this terrible natural disaster that has befallen so many people and countries in Central America."
"I would just like to look briefly at a few of the points that were made, including the speech by Mr Salafranca."
"It is true that the Commission has no powers when it comes to the debt problem, but listening to what the presidency had to say, I think that it must be clear to everyone that our efforts cannot stop at humanitarian aid, and that the international community must also do something in the present circumstances to ease the terrible debt burden or even, if possible, to write it off."
"Secondly, Mr Salafranca referred earlier to the San José dialogue, which I still remember from much further back with the Contadora process and so on."
"I imagine, and I am sure that this goes for Mr Marín and probably also the presidency too, that once the situation in Central America has become a little clearer and financial decisions have been taken and a reconstruction programme has started, we will certainly begin talks between the European Union and the countries of Central America within the San José framework."
"This would seem to me to be an extremely constructive approach."
"Thank you, Mr van den Broek."
"I have received a motion for a resolution to wind up the debate."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Developments in Middle East peace process"
"The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on developments in the Middle East peace process."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union has always underlined the need for a comprehensive, just and lasting peace settlement in the Middle East."
"The foundations for this are contained in the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions and elsewhere."
"In this context, we should note that all the states of the Middle East region have a right to live within secure, internationally recognised borders, but also that the Palestinian people have the right to self-determination, and that here no option should be excluded."
"The Union has therefore fully endorsed the content of the Madrid and Oslo accords which set the current Middle East peace process in motion."
"Since early 1997, however, we have been witnessing the dangerous standstill of this development with growing concern."
"The United States and the European Union reacted to this difficult situation by making even greater mediation efforts, during which the EU special envoy in the Middle East, Miguel Moratinos, repeatedly put proposals to the conflicting parties on ways of bridging their differences."
"On 23 October this year, after difficult negotiations between Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Arafat, an agreement was finally reached at Wye Plantation near Washington, largely thanks to the efforts of the United States and President Clinton, but in which King Hussein also played a crucial role."
"This agreement was meant to signal the long-awaited breakthrough and set the peace process in motion again, after it had been at a standstill for more than a year and a half."
"In signing it, the parties to the conflict revived the Oslo process by withdrawing further Israeli troops from the West Bank in return for comprehensive Palestinian security guarantees."
"Both sides agreed that they would rapidly begin negotiations on the final status and refrain from unilateral measures."
"With its commitment to achieving an agreement, the USA has assumed the role of arbitrator and also of guarantor."
"Given the present lack of trust between the contracting parties, the Wye Memorandum may, however, very easily be at risk."
"So under these circumstances, we consider it most important for both sides to refrain from any unilateral action that could prejudice the outcome of the final status negotiations."
"At the same time, it is a remarkable and positive sign that the current Israeli Government has for the first time openly accepted the 'land for peace' principle by signing that agreement."
"The European Union has firmly endorsed the breakthrough achieved at Wye Plantation, while also pointing out that its success or failure will depend on the speed at which the accord is implemented."
"So yesterday's ratification of the agreement by the Israeli Parliament is a very important step in that direction."
"The European Union will support the implementation of the Wye Memorandum in all areas where it can make a constructive and further contribution."
"This relates in particular to aspects of the Israeli-Palestinian interim agreement, such as opening the airport and building the Gaza port and safe road links between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip."
"The European Union is currently conducting an anti-terrorism support programme for the Palestinians, and is preparing another small programme of the same nature within the EU-Palestinian security committee."
"Independently of the progress made in implementing the Wye Memorandum, the first five-year tranche of EU aid for the Palestinians will expire at the end of this year."
"The USA has convened another donor conference at ministerial level in Washington on 30 November 1998, in order to assure continued support for the Palestinians."
"The EU has already taken a decision of principle to maintain its high-level support for the Palestinian people for a further five-year period."
"The Austrian Foreign Minister, Dr Wolfgang Schüssel, visited the Middle East region from 12 to 15 November in his capacity of EU President-in-Office of the Council, accompanied by Miguel Moratinos, the special envoy, and a European Commission representative. He visited Jordan, Israel, the Palestinian areas, Syria, Lebanon and Egypt, where he held political talks."
"The purpose of the mission was to seek means of actively involving the European Union in the implementation of the Wye Plantation agreement."
"The period immediately after the signature of that agreement was a propitious moment for this visit."
"The talks with all the regional parties were very open and substantive."
"It was found that all the parties concerned valued the role played by the European Union in the peace process, and that many people hoped Europe would show even greater commitment towards it, not least of course through the intermediary of the EU special envoy, Mr Moratinos."
"Israel, however, wished for this commitment to apply only to practical areas of cooperation and not, as it made quite plain, to political questions."
"There remains considerable domestic policy resistance among both the Israelis and the Palestinians to the implementation of the Wye Memorandum."
"Israel seems to be as inflexible as ever on the question of Jerusalem, the security zones around Jerusalem and in the Jordan Valley, and the expansion of existing settlements."
"Israel did, however, signal its willingness to cooperate with the Arab side on the questions of water and infrastructure - for instance railway construction."
"Many of the interlocutors in Egypt, Syria and Lebanon expressed scepticism about the Wye Memorandum and the willingness of Israel to implement it."
"There was clear evidence of a certain pessimism among the Palestinians."
"Israel was particularly keen to see the rapid resumption of the multilateral components of the peace process, while the Arab representatives were against this so long as the Wye agreement has not been implemented and the peace talks at Syrian-Lebanese level have not been resumed."
"In the light of the new developments initiated by the Wye Plantation agreement and the impressions gained from the Middle East mission of the President-in-Office of the Council, we have now identified a number of urgent tasks that need to be addressed and opportunities that need to be taken in order to support peace and enhance the European presence in this region, in terms of the Middle East peace process."
"For example, it seems urgently necessary for the EU to establish a common position for the forthcoming donor conference in Washington on 30 November to which I have referred, so that the Union can take a firm stance there."
"Since Europe provides some 60 % of the economic aid to the Palestinians, the Europeans must have a very substantial say at this meeting, which we must use to assert our position."
"It would seem a very good idea to hold a quadrilateral meeting between the European Union, the USA, Israel and the Palestinians, since that would give strong impetus to raising the question of support measures during the talks on final status."
"Support measures relating to water, refugees and infrastructure could then be discussed."
"It would also be valuable to set up a bilateral European Union-Israel working party to consider regional questions and projects relating to water."
"The Union should also make greater efforts now to reactivate the Syrian-Lebanese negotiating route, and the EU special envoy Mr Moratinos will continue his efforts in that respect."
"On 7 December, the Austrian Foreign Minister and President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Schüssel, will report to the General Affairs Council on his mission to the Middle East and use that occasion to submit further, concrete proposals on how the EU can play a more effective role in the Middle East peace process."
"During this unusually difficult and complex process, it is particularly important that we do not allow ourselves to be deterred by the constant setbacks."
"We must initiate, coordinate and support extremely comprehensive and concrete cooperation measures at political level and in all other areas."
"In that way, we can contribute to building confidence, to defusing existing and potential conflicts and preventing the entire process from coming to a standstill, because such a standstill could herald the beginning of a new spiral of violence and confrontation in the Middle East, which it is also in our own, immediate interest to prevent."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office, thank you for your report."
"There are indeed few promising signs."
"Those that do exist should however be recognised, such as the ratification by the Knesset yesterday."
"We must admit that steps were taken in this case, despite the bomb attack, whereas in the past the Israeli Government and Parliament always used such events as a reason not to take any steps towards peace."
"On the other hand, however, Israel has tied that decision to certain conditions, and then there is the government action regarding Jerusalem, in particular Har Homa."
"Let me state here even more clearly and plainly than the President-in-Office can perhaps put it: for us in Europe, for my group at least, it is quite unacceptable for the Israeli Government to keep trying to incorporate the whole of Jerusalem into Israeli national territory."
"Israel must show more respect here, towards the Palestinians and of course also towards the religions practised on an international basis there."
"My second point is that I believe it is most important - and I have some information to the effect that the Arabs and Palestinians take the same view - for the European Union also to carry out some form of monitoring of the implementation of the Wye Plantation agreement."
"We must strive towards that, and we need exact information about what is happening."
"In the same way as settlement is being monitored, we now need to monitor effective withdrawal; that is what my group is calling for."
"I fully endorse what the President-in-Office said about investment, which we wish to support and indeed have to support."
"Parliament is also prepared to do so."
"Even if we are only talking about small sums, I would now call on the Commissioner to carry this forward, so that we can also give adequate and prompt support to the Israeli and Palestinian NGOs which are doing good work, across the borders and in particular through people-to-people initiatives."
"I would ask the Commissioner and the Commission representatives to please consider how long the various organisations have to wait between the authorising of funds and the actual financing!"
"That is quite unacceptable!"
"My final and very important point is this. As we can see from the calendar, it is not long till 4 May 1999."
"However much my group fully recognises the right of the Palestinians to unilaterally declare independence if the appropriate agreements cannot be reached with Israel, we should nevertheless strive all the more to ensure that agreements are reached, either agreements on independence or agreements on postponing that deadline, if Israel accepts the principle that there will be a Palestinian state."
"The European Union must endeavour in the immediate future to ensure that this date, 4 May 1999, does not signal the beginning of a new crisis, but that we have a joint declaration on independence by that date or, in the event that the deadline is postponed, that interim agreements are reached and the Israeli Government fully recognises the principle of a Palestinian state."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner and the President- in-Office of the Council for their statements."
"I rise today with a certain diffidence because I was hoping, as I am sure many colleagues were hoping, that we would be much further down the track of reaching peace in the Middle East."
"Whilst one welcomes the statements of Yassir Arafat that he has no intention of using violence to achieve his ends, one does see a continuation of violence."
"We must also recognise that there has been a certain courage shown by Yassir Arafat in arresting some of the leaders of Hamas."
"That is to be greatly welcomed by this House and a great step forward."
"I am also glad that the Knesset has approved the Wye Accord and that we can move forward hopefully to see some greater security within that agreement."
"But the final status talks are really the most important we have to face."
"It is of the utmost importance - and I agree with Mr Swoboda - that the beginning of May is going to be a turning point."
"If UDI were the result of the lack of a peace process and a peace agreement in the final status talks, that would be a disaster for everybody involved."
"We have to strive very hard to ensure that does not happen."
"Unfortunately we are still seeing a certain amount of confrontation on both sides."
"I hope we can involve Syria, Jordan, Egypt and Lebanon to make sure that we begin to see a stop to this horrible confrontation."
"That is where we must try to achieve our results."
"Implementation of the existing agreements is vital."
"The resolution which Parliament is going to adopt tomorrow emphasises this."
"We must go back to the Oslo Agreements and hopefully, as we can now see movement as a result of Wye, we can get back to these agreements without delay."
"Fresh impetus should therefore come as a result of the Wye Accord and that is what we must all try and achieve."
"I believe Israel always intends to discuss more with the United States than with the European Union."
"That is a tragedy."
"We get the reputation of only looking after the interests of the Palestinians."
"We must try to overcome that perception with the Israeli Government and point out that we are dealing evenly with both sides of this argument and not taking sides at all."
"Mr President, the Liberal Group is delighted with the Wye Accord, and the Clinton administration deserves great praise for its efforts."
"At long last we once again have some good news about the Middle East, though if we are honest it is still a rare event."
"Since Mr Netanyahu became prime minister the peace process has, honestly speaking, been in terminal decline, and it was only thanks to considerable American pressure that an agreement was reached."
"I agree with Mr Provan that America tends to play a pro-Israeli role and we a pro-Palestinian, yet it was America that talked the Israelis round, or so it appears."
"We also welcome the fact that the Israeli Government has finally reluctantly agreed to hand back an extra 13 % and that the Palestinians have agreed to cooperate with the Americans on security guarantees."
"The terrible attacks that took place afterwards show that Israel's security demands are perfectly legitimate."
"If we fail to accommodate them, there will never be peace."
"Human rights organisations have rightly pointed out that maintaining law and order must not be allowed to lead to large-scale human rights violations which would have negative consequences for both sides."
"Since the developments on 23 October, it is clear that constant external pressure is needed to keep the peace process on track."
"The statements made by President Arafat and Mr Sharon have merely poured oil on the flames, and the extra conditions demanded out of the blue by Mr Netanyahu were, even for us Liberals, unacceptable and unpalatable."
"The decision to give the go-ahead for the construction of more houses in Har Homa and Hebron was another wrong signal, and undermines the mutual trust that is essential for lasting peace."
"I would like to ask the Commission what is happening about the Palestinian airport and seaport?"
"Can he also tell us what the situation is with the hospital in Gaza that was built with European funding?"
"And is there any truth in the rumours that Brussels bureaucracy is delaying the opening of the hospital?"
"I must apologise for asking these two questions so abruptly, but we want to see peace and we want to see justice."
"Mr President, there has been a war of words in the Middle East over the last few days, a war of words between the Israelis and the Palestinians that was supposed to lead to peace."
"In my opinion, this is one area of the world where deeds are what count, and looking beyond all the words and rules, I think that we really are coming closer to compliance with the Wye Accord."
"I welcome the fact that the European Parliament is making another critical but supportive contribution here today in a special debate on the subject."
"I congratulate the Members of the Israeli Knesset for voting by a majority to support the Wye Accord."
"The Palestinians too have shown great commitment, as we have all seen, and this must eventually be rewarded."
"I hope that in December, when the Palestinian national assembly meets in Gaza, they will finally remove the paragraph on the destruction of Israel from their charter once and for all."
"Plans for a port and an airport in Gaza are back on the cards, but I gather that the airport has come up against certain technical problems."
"I was there recently and I saw that the buildings were finished, but there were no technical installations."
"Can the President-in-Office or the Commissioner tell us what the problems are?"
"The EU plays a vital economic and financial role in the Middle East which is likely to grow in importance."
"The resolutions mention specific areas where we can provide support, and I entirely agree with these."
"As vice-chairman of the Subcommittee on Human Rights, I would draw your particular attention to peace education and to the citizens' programmes which are designed to foster mutual understanding between the Israelis and the Palestinians."
"Our enormous financial and psychological commitment to the Middle East is certain to increase our influence in the region."
"My group has no problem with the proposal put forward in paragraph 12 of the resolution that the EU should take on the role of monitor and, if necessary, arbitrator, but the resolution then goes further and starts to concern itself with the final status of the peace agreements, which I think is particularly confusing, because this is something that the United States partly dealt with in the Wye Accord."
"The President-in-Office indicated that Israel would prefer us not to interfere here, but would be glad to see us play a stronger economic role."
"This is perfectly understandable, since a country whose existence has always been under threat would obviously prefer not to let it depend on a partner that does not have a uniform foreign policy."
"It cannot afford to do so, particularly while it still does not have peace agreements with Lebanon and Syria."
"Mr President, the peace process may be moving slowly, but progress is being made."
"Mr President, it is to the credit of the Wye Plantation accords that they have reignited a peace process which we may have feared dead and buried."
"Of course, the accords are limited as the majority of Palestinian territories are still occupied."
"They also contain negative aspects, such as the role bestowed upon the CIA."
"Yet in spite of this, the agreements constitute a step forward."
"Of course, provided that they are implemented, they will be able to bring positive changes to the lives of thousands of Palestinians and allow hundreds of prisoners to be freed."
"The Knesset's agreement is a positive sign."
"Unfortunately, many extremists are fast constructing obstacles."
"The Israeli Government itself is relaunching a provocative strategy for fresh colonisation."
"This is not in the interests of peace, nor is it in the interests of the Israeli people."
"Once again, this peace process is in danger of being compromised."
"The European Union must show proof of a firm stance and use the means available to take effective action to implement these agreements and to work on stopping anything that may go against them."
"The Wye Plantation agreement cannot be seen as a finishing line but rather as a starting block leading to a peaceful and lasting settlement which respects the right of the Palestinians to their own land, in the spirit of the Oslo accords."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office, it gives me great personal pleasure to congratulate the members of the Knesset, on behalf of my group, on their successful adoption of the Wye Mills Memorandum between Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Arafat of the Palestinian Autonomous Authority."
"That agreement makes it clear that the Oslo accord, which has constantly been violated, and the process it initiated are irreversible."
"At the same time, I must of course express to the people of Israel, its parliament and its government our deep concern and sympathy following the recent terrorist attacks."
"I do so in the awareness that the peace process in the Middle East is not just a question of foreign policy and the European Union's association agreements, however important both aspects are, especially in the context of the Barcelona programme."
"The peace process in the Middle East is a key question of our political and religious culture."
"We must decide how long we are to allow terrorists and fundamentalists on both sides to succeed in imposing their agenda on the civilised world, by reversing a fundamental tenet of Jewish, Christian and Islamic tradition, namely the commandment: thou shalt not kill!"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is another fresh start for a new stage in the race for peace in the Middle East."
"Hope, like the phoenix, has risen from the ashes, and yet the truth is that the main characters involved are hardly enthusiastic."
"We cannot say that they are welcoming each other with open arms."
"Urged by the President of the United States and already rejected by more than half its parliamentary majority, the Israeli Government is moving forward but dragging its feet."
"For its part, the Palestinian delegation, tired of having been deceived too many times and of being taken for a ride, no longer believes in the merits of dialogue."
"Nevertheless, the commitments made will actually have to be respected."
"The attacks and murders on all sides must stop, extremist settlers must no longer be urged to take provocative actions, deaths must cease and people must be prepared to look at, listen to and respect one another."
"We in Parliament must launch an appeal to our counterparts in the Knesset and the Legislative Council, above and beyond the Israeli Government and the authorities."
"Through our counterparts we must launch an appeal to the Israeli people, heirs of those who brought unprecedented and unequalled messages of knowledge and spirituality to the whole world. We must launch an appeal to the Palestinian people, where Christians and Muslims come together in the melting pot of a nation that is being born and whose birth is particularly painful."
"We must tell them not to be afraid, not to fear their neighbours or the world that is following their progress."
"Europe, although unfortunately still not involved in the diplomatic progress, is nonetheless very active and very much part of the construction of this country; this Europe is their brother and wants them as its new-born partners."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office, Commissioner, in the Book of Psalms, King David says in the 122nd psalm 'Pray for the peace of Jerusalem'."
"Even though he wrote that thousands of years ago, his appeal is still extremely topical."
"Time and time again, peace accords seem to break down because of mutual suspicion and the breaking of agreements by both sides."
"Even after the Wye Accord recently concluded between Mr Netanyahu and Mr Arafat, peace in Israel seems further away than ever."
"This week violent conflict broke out again, with both parties perhaps rightly accusing each other of breaking agreements."
"Fortunately the Knesset approved the accord yesterday evening, but sadly this does not yet bring peace within reach."
"On the contrary, once it has been approved by the Israeli Parliament, the accord still has to be implemented in practice, and this is only part of the problem, because first and foremost confidence needs to be restored between the two peoples, and no agreement can achieve that."
"The basic conditions for lasting peace in the Middle East are, in my view, the establishment of secure and recognised borders for Israel and recognition for the Palestinian nation's right to self-determination."
"Only when the Arab countries enter into full diplomatic relations with Israel can a lasting peace settlement be reached."
"The European Union must show political restraint here and coordinate any action it takes with the United States."
"There is always a risk of terrorist attack with any peace negotiations, as we saw last week at a market in Jerusalem."
"Terrorism is the greatest threat to a lasting peace settlement and must be countered by international agreements, strict border controls and measures to combat poverty."
"European Union aid should be targeted on this, and it should also be an important consideration in any trade agreements that are concluded."
"Support from the European Union must foster strong economic cooperation in areas such as water supply, infrastructure, tourism and security."
"Finally, the countries of the Middle East must take the agreements seriously, as this is the only way that progress will be made."
"Outsiders must show restraint, including the European Council and the European Parliament."
"If the peace talks are to go smoothly, the European Parliament should not interfere."
"It can no longer act as a neutral mediator, since it has openly sided with the Palestinians in the past."
"It is counter-productive to blame one of the two parties when both have clearly made mistakes."
"At the start of my speech, I quoted the Bible's call to pray for the peace of Jerusalem."
"The original text says 'shalom', which has many connotations including the good or well-being of the city."
"Let us make this well-being our objective in our policy on the Middle East."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Wye Plantation agreement can be seen as a glass that is either half full or half empty."
"It could be seen as progress or one may feel rather uneasy, as I myself do, and think that the actors involved are only hoping to prolong a situation which has already been going on too long."
"The Wye Plantation agreement represents an enclave policy and will turn the situation into another Bosnia; it is a pathetic agreement not worth the paper it is written on."
"I am well aware that this is not an easy situation."
"It is not easy because the situation in Israel must be confronted head-on."
"Yesterday, I criticised a report which appeared in an important left-wing newspaper from my region, La Dépêche du Midi , taken from the Sunday Times , which I hope was wrong and which stated that Israeli laboratories are working, and I quote, 'on the production of ethnic biological weapons, containing genetically modified micro-organisms that would harm Arabs but not Jews."
"The Hebrew State scientists are apparently attempting to identify the distinctive genes carried by some Arabs, then create a virus or bacterium which would affect that specific population'."
"I hope that this will be denied and that the Sunday Times , given the information by the Israeli Embassy, will tell us that this is not true."
"But, in addition, the domestic situation in Israel is tragic and I acknowledge that Benjamin Netanyahu's role is not, of course, an easy one."
"This is why, in Tel Aviv's main daily paper, Yediot Ahronot , the great writer Seffei Rachlevsky criticises the cabbala-Messianic revolution which seems to be making progress towards 'relentlessly taking absolute control of the Holy Land', to use the words of Yediot Ahronot ."
"Furthermore, in Tribune Juive , Jean Kahn, president of many organisations and rapporteur for the Committee of Inquiry on Racism and Xenophobia, describes the meetings held in Israel by the Sephardim where speakers claim that Hitler, alas, did not complete his work with the Ashkenazim."
"Finally, again in the Israeli press I read that the Falashim are demonstrating in the streets shouting 'death to the whites'."
"So, the reality in Israel is not simple: it is one of real hatred and the climate of a civil war."
"It is not any simpler in Palestine, where Yasser Arafat is struggling to control the situation and where, at times, his days appear to be numbered."
"I think that the only way out of such a situation is by working objectively and with very clear ideas."
"We could believe in the greatness of Israel, which would lead to a situation similar to that of the Milosevic regime and to civil war."
"Or we could promote - and why not? - a secular republic of Israel and Palestine, based on the South Africa of today, as there are both Muslims and Christians in Israel."
"Or we can even advocate a sovereign and viable free Palestine, with the right to self determination as recommended by the UN."
"This is the position of our group and we believe that, in the long term and if people behave wisely, it could lead to an Israeli-Palestinian confederation."
"But I do not think that squabbling yet again over tiny portions of territory will lead to a definitive peace agreement."
"Madam President-in-Office, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, without any hesitation or beating about the bush, I should like to say that, as far as I am concerned as chairman of the Delegation for relations with Israel, I am extremely pleased about the signing of the Wye Plantation agreement."
"After months and months of wrangling and of difficulties, this agreement, ratified today by the Israeli Government and by a large majority in the Knesset in spite of the two attacks that have taken place, is a major step forward."
"Of course, all has not been resolved but a new step has been taken on the road to peace."
"We must not forget that this agreement was signed by a right-wing Israeli Government, elected on a political platform hostile to the Oslo accords. Therefore, this peace process has today been given an electoral basis which has never been reached before in Israel."
"I would therefore like to congratulate Mr Netanyahu and his government on their courage."
"I would also like to congratulate Mr Arafat and his secular team of Palestinian leaders, who have shown proof of their maturity, their composure and their ability to carry out the duties which weigh heavily upon them."
"We must now implement this agreement completely and swiftly, and on both sides."
"The next phase must now begin as soon as possible in order to discuss the final frontiers of the future Palestinian State as well as all the different links with the State of Israel, with Jordan and with Egypt, and we must not forget about the Syrian issue."
"Between now and then, we must avoid further obstacles being thrown in the path of this process. We must avoid threats of unilateral declarations, on the one hand, and of continuing to establish settlements, on the other."
"Such settlements are true time bombs, for Israelis as well as Palestinians."
"Last week, in Brussels, the Group of the Party of European Socialists organised Israeli-Palestinian meetings."
"We were able to gauge the good-will on both sides and almost completed discussions for the basis of an agreement on the long-term objectives to be achieved."
"We were also able to gauge the ground that remains to be covered and the many obstacles to be overcome."
"But who would have imagined, in May 1943 - a bloody year if ever there was one in Europe -, that five years later The Hague would launch an appeal for a united Europe and that then, eight years later, the Treaty of Rome creating the EEC and the Common Market would be signed."
"So, ladies and gentlemen, in the name of our still-recent history, let us be tolerant and attentive, in particular when a new problem arises in the Middle East. Rather than always asking whose fault it is, let us ask ourselves what we can and should do to help the Israelis and the Palestinians overcome this obstacle, and then go one step further down the road to peace and cooperation."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, it is to be regretted that just a few weeks after the Wye Plantation Agreement we have seen a series of damaging remarks and threats made on both sides that, although they have been withdrawn very recently, can only be described as very dangerous and unproductive."
"We do, however, welcome the fact that the Israeli Parliament has ratified this Agreement."
"It is evident that the main opponents of the peace process at the present time are the most radical factions on each side that continually attempt to thwart the small advances that are so difficult to achieve for both the Palestinians and the Israelis."
"This can be seen in the fact that Netanyahu needed the support of the Labour opposition to guarantee the ratification of the Wye Plantation agreements, as well as in the increasing difficulties experienced by Arafat in his attempt to win over the more fundamental and radical sectors."
"In spite of this, we must bear in mind that the majority of the people - both Palestinian and Israeli - openly support the peace process. This amounts to the best guarantee the process has of reaching a satisfactory conclusion and I hope that that conclusion will include the issue of Gaza."
"In this respect, and as stated in the resolution we are discussing here today, the European Parliament fully supports the agreements of 23 October. It reiterates the need for the European Union to exert a political influence in line with its current role in the area of providing economic and financial assistance, particularly in relation to the implementation of these agreements and the proposals for new formulas that might help the peace process move forward."
"Having said all this, I do not want to overlook how important it is for both parties to avoid an increase in verbal attacks, such as those we have seen recently. Such attacks incite violence and do nothing to reconcile their positions and search for compromises, merely serving to add confusion and desperation in the area and in the rest of the world."
"The Israeli Government should review its policy on the resettlement of colonists, as has been mentioned, as well as making the necessary efforts to implement the Oslo and Wye Plantation Agreements. In so doing, it must not give in to the pressure exerted by the ultra-orthodox sectors whose only aim is to destroy the peace process."
"On the other hand, the Palestinian Authority must focus its attention on monitoring the extremist factions that are also opposed to the peace process, especially in relation to the control and prevention of terrorism, which, sadly, has been so prominent in recent years. It should also offer Israel the guarantees of security it has been calling for."
"The European Union must play a more prominent role in this process and, in this respect, I was very pleased to hear the comments and proposals put forward by Madam President-in-Office of the Council."
"However, it must not limit itself to merely donating funds. The 15 Member States are currently involved in an in-depth debate on how to reach the desired objective of acting with one voice on the international scene and ensuring that this voice is strong and listened to by the rest of the world."
"Madam President-in-Office, Mr President, I think that we now have a unique opportunity to make the voice of the European Union heard in the peace process."
"Mr President, I agree with my fellow group member Mr Ullmann when he calls for an end to violence."
"I therefore feel very strongly about the total lack of balance in the reactions of the world community to last week's violation of the Middle East peace agreement."
"In the case of Iraq, we had to prepare ourselves for a major military offensive, which according to the 'Washington Post' could have cost the lives of 10 000 Iraqi citizens."
"But when, only a few days after the Wye Plantation meeting, the Foreign Minister, Ariel Sharon, in breach of the recent agreement, openly encouraged Israeli settlers to occupy Palestinian territory, what happened then?"
"Not very much - at most a resolution here in Parliament."
"I am not asking for Israel to be treated in the same way as Iraq."
"I do not want tens of thousands of Israeli children to pay with their lives for their leaders' transgressions."
"But some form of economic and political pressure should be exerted - and very soon - if our resolutions on the right of Palestinians to their own state are to be taken seriously."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to add my voice to those who have agreed to support the Knesset's ratification of the Wye Plantation Agreement, with one exception, however: they have added a number of conditions that, to a certain extent, almost amount to a denunciation of the Agreement."
"But the fact that there has been such widespread support is a sign of hope for the future, and the same applies even for the reactions to the Agreement reached."
"In other words, everyone has had to confront their extremists, and that is usually what happens when agreements that are equally unsatisfactory for both parties are able to work."
"In this respect, there is an issue that needs to be highlighted that forms part of my personal experience: terrorists - whatever their colour - cannot be given the chance to hold the key to a process."
"I wanted to focus on one point that was highlighted by the President-in-Office of the Council, that is, the role of Europe."
"We are faced with an immediate challenge."
"I think we must try and explain to our Israeli friends, with all the patience of a saint, that it is not normal for us to simply donate money and do nothing else. We have been reminded of this on several occasions, although there now appears to be more discretion."
"I believe that Europe's wish, as shown in the process that has gone from Venice via Madrid to Oslo and continued until now, is to participate, because we feel politically and morally responsible and because we have a great deal to offer, not only in the financial sense but also in terms of our own experience."
"This is why I think that we should not only support the action of our mediator, Mr Moratinos, but that it is also vital for us to strengthen the role the European Union plays."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the President-in-Office for her statement."
"It is always a delight to listen to her."
"I hope she will take particular inspiration from what Mr Caudron said."
"I think our commitment in this situation should not be to one side or to the other but to success."
"We should be offering solidarity to both sides in the face of the inevitable terrorist extremist outrages."
"We should be putting pressure on both sides to observe commitments which they have undertaken and, above all, we should be offering encouragement to both sides to think, if not the unthinkable, at least to think those things which are politically difficult."
"Yes, we must play our role in those matters such as water, trade and infrastructure, where our experience and money are important and are urgently needed."
"But I suggest that there is a much more difficult area where we might also make a uniquely European contribution and that is Jerusalem."
"For 50 years we in Europe have struggled with the nature of co-existence in a crowded land."
"We have learned to be creative with the heritage of sovereignty and symbols."
"This European fascination with Jerusalem is not a new or a passing fad."
"Next year marks the anniversary of the conquest of Jerusalem in 1099 by Christian armies, in moments of medieval glory mired in murder."
"This city of Jerusalem has been central and sacred and important to all the peoples of the Book and we should honour that interest by a legal and a constitutional creativity, the kind which we have shown here in Europe in our own domestic arrangements in the Union."
"I would say to all who choose to be involved in these negotiations positively that we will need two great virtues."
"The first is an eye for the devil in the detail."
"I learnt on a trip to Ramallah that our diplomats are going to have to eat and sleep and negotiate with a street map of greater Jerusalem in their pockets."
"They are going to need to watch each and every word."
"For instance a capital in Jerusalem is different from Jerusalem as a capital or the capital."
"Secondly, and most importantly, they are going to need the absolute determination to secure success, of the kind which President Clinton showed in Wye Plantation."
"I think the European Union owes the Holy Land not just an economic investment but an intellectual investment in the final status of issues."
"This is not something which we should leave just to our overworked presidency."
"It is a challenge to the creativity of the Commission and indeed of this Parliament and of all of us as individuals."
"I hope it is not too much to believe that by May 4 next year we could perhaps echo the prayer of the ages, 'next year in Jerusalem, and mean by that a peace for the millennium in the navel of the world."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the signing of the Wye Plantation accords have given rise to a fresh wave of optimism that the current deadlock will be broken and substantial progress made towards peace in this part of the world."
"By pulling out all the diplomatic stops, the European Union should put all its strength behind these beginnings of a peace process, no matter how fragile they may be."
"We must once again remember that the civilian populations of Israel and of the Palestinian territories are the victims of blind violence, whose aim is to obliterate any progress towards a negotiated solution."
"The Near and Middle East encompasses different conflicts and the specific interests that fuel them."
"Each conflict in this region has its own origins, its own particular aspects, and needs its own specific solutions."
"Yet these will only see the light of day after a widespread dialogue, based on a detailed analysis of the situation and leading to a balanced agreement for the whole region."
"To attempt to solve each conflict separately would be to erase all historical, ethnic, religious and cultural characteristics which fuel nationalist or fundamentalist attitudes, and would be to forget the international strategies that aim to control raw materials and maintain spheres of influence by means of military alliances."
"The real problems to be solved in this region involve abolition of the occupied territories, freeing prisoners and allowing refugees to return freely, recognising the rights of national minorities, lifting embargoes, ceasing military operations, organising cooperation between the countries in this region, normalising trade and exports, and strict control of the production and trading of arms."
"I dreamed that this was an ambition which the EU was capable of achieving and that we were willing to see through such a process which would establish mutually beneficial security and cooperation amongst all countries in the Near and Middle East."
"I dreamed that we would be willing to support any joint efforts to find regional solutions, which are at the heart of the Euro-Mediterranean partnerships."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I think the new Wye Plantation agreement is important, as also are the results of yesterday's vote in the Knesset on the implementation of that agreement."
"Also important and serious, and I congratulate you on that, are the Austrian Presidency's activities to assist the peace process."
"At the same time, however, it is sad that the agreement was reached in the United States, under the aegis of the United States and not in Salzburg or Vienna under the aegis of the European Union."
"There is no doubt that the peace process will progress more correctly and completely if the European Union becomes politically involved."
"In parallel with the huge economic and technical aid it provides, the European Union should also maintain a permanent political presence in the area which, - and I am sorry to have to disagree with you, Madam President-in-Office - does not now exist."
"It does not exist because the European Union cannot express its position through just a single ambassador, Mr Moradinos, who in any event is not doing much."
"I would propose two measures here. First, upgrade the presence of the European Union by selecting a prominent figure, as happened for example with the choice of Felipe González for Bosnia, supported by a team of experts."
"And secondly, establish the presence of the European Union in all procedures involved in the implementation of and compliance with the content of the Wye Plantation agreement."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have followed this most interesting debate with the greatest attention and believe we all agree on one important point or important aspect, namely the role the European Union must play in the peace process."
"We know it will be enormously difficult to implement the Wye Plantation accord, but let me emphasise again that it did represent another new start and a new hope."
"I believe one very important factor is that the European Union should now continue, as has been said here, to work firmly, patiently, courageously and creatively towards its implementation and continue to do so at the various conferences."
"I referred a moment ago to the donor conference now scheduled for 30 November in Washington."
"Of course we would have liked to see it held in Vienna."
"And we made every effort to achieve that."
"We negotiated with the Americans, we negotiated with the Norwegians, because we had hoped at least to co-chair the conference."
"We made all these efforts, but unfortunately we did not succeed."
"Of course one could now say that we are rather sad and a little offended about this."
"Yet I believe that is not the right approach to take."
"The right approach is for us to become an important factor, an important element in the peace process. And what could be more important for both sides at present than for the Union to be present at, for example, the donor conference in Washington and to play its own important part there?"
"We are not in competition with the USA - one could almost liken this to a beauty contest."
"What is important is to make progress towards peace."
"If there is no other option, if one side listens more to the Americans and the other side more to the European Union, then we will simply have to act together."
"I think that is precisely what we must all do."
"We must try to discover what specific contribution we can make, and on that basis I have tried to identify a whole range of necessary follow-up measures we must take."
"We cannot entirely separate the political and economic aspects, since the opening of the airport is in fact a very political matter, because it is the next step."
"How long is it since the airport has been completed but not opened?"
"In principle the airport is scheduled to open very soon, on 20 November, on an emergency basis. True, the airport is not quite ready."
"It should be completed as soon as possible; but at least this sends out a political signal that things are finally progressing here."
"Secondly, the port. Foreign Minister Sharon said himself in talks with the President-in-Office, Mr Schüssel, that we could count on further steps towards agreement, if not agreement itself, in about two months' time."
"Even I tend to think it is perhaps going a little too far to use the word agreement."
"We have to be careful here."
"Another point that was unfortunately raised - and quite rightly so - was of course the question of the possible consequences of the 4 May 1999 deadline."
"It could indeed spark off a serious crisis and a new outbreak of violence, unless it is preceded by negotiations that can avert such a crisis, avert a unilateral declaration and the ensuing reactions."
"The Council has begun internal consultations and has also had contacts with the United States on this matter."
"But what I regard as most important of all is that we jointly take concrete steps forward."
"As I said earlier, after the donor conference we shall be organising a quadrilateral meeting at which the four main partners, the EU and the USA, together with Israel and Palestine, will be discussing these important political and economic questions further."
"On the whole, I believe this is an important new step on the long and difficult road to peace in the Middle East."
"Mr President, the Commission has an important role to play in this matter."
"I find it inconceivable that a man of the legendary eloquence of Commissioner Flynn does not feel moved to contribute at the end of this debate."
"Would you please repeat your invitation to him to take the microphone."
"Mr President, I support Mr Spencer's proposal."
"I listened to the President-in-Office of the Council and I am afraid there has been some misunderstanding."
"I did not criticise the Austrian Presidency for the fact that the Wye Plantation agreement was not concluded in Vienna or Salzburg, I simply said that I would have felt much better if it had been reached in Vienna or Salzburg, and I repeat as much."
"With this opportunity, I wish to say again that the Austrian Presidency's contribution towards helping the Middle East peace process has been and is important."
"I wanted to make that clear."
"I will speak very briefly, as I would hate to disappoint Mr Spencer."
"I appreciate his kind words about my eloquence."
"I have been listening very carefully to this debate."
"It seems to me that the Wye River Israeli-Palestinian interim Accord really gives the peace process a much needed chance."
"We have to appreciate that it was at a very delicate point of near collapse, so I see this as a very major improvement."
"In fact it is the only tool available to support peace in the Middle East that the international community has available to it at this time."
"For that reason, since it is the best chance that the ailing Middle East process has, it has to have our great support."
"We greatly applaud the fact the Knesset has taken the necessary steps in the recent past."
"There may be many hurdles to cross insofar as the Accord is concerned but both political and economic support should be provided to all of the parties to maintain the momentum."
"That is a key point that has come out of this debate."
"But when all is said and done, implementation is the key."
"I quite clearly support what Mr Spencer so eloquently said."
"He said it is going to require a delicate touch from those who are on the ground to recognise all the vagaries of the situation that exists in that very sensitive part of the world."
"Having visited myself I have a full appreciation of how a wrong word, used at the wrong time, can jeopardise the whole thing."
"That must certainly be taken on board."
"We have a contribution to make."
"We should focus our action on a limited number of high-impact areas."
"There were a few mentioned."
"It is quite interesting to mention the one about the hospital."
"The hospital is there; it is empty."
"The Palestinians would appear not to have the capacity to run it just now."
"But the Commission has sent a management team to get it up and running."
"So that is a positive development that we can support."
"As far as the airport is concerned, Israel said that it should be up and running this particular week."
"We have to wait now to see what is going to happen over the next couple of weeks, if that commitment can be honoured."
"Insofar as the port is concerned there are the continuing problems of access."
"They have yet to be resolved."
"One has to understand that there will be a three or four year delay in the actual construction anyway."
"So there are impediments there."
"But what we have heard here is a consensus view that we want to give this a chance and we want to give our total support to the Austrian presidency and Mrs Ferrero-Waldner for all that has been done to enable it to happen."
"Certainly the Commission will be pursuing that objective too."
"The debate is closed."
"I have received seven motions for resolutions tabled pursuant to Rule 37(2)."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9.30 a.m."
"(The sitting was suspended at 7.40 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)"
"Structural Funds (continuation)"
"The next item is the continuation of the joint debate on the Structural Funds."
"Madam President, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs made a significant contribution to the report by Mr Hatzidakis and Mrs McCarthy."
"We have an important opportunity to plan the future of the European Social Fund since the new Objective 3 that is proposed in the regulation will be exclusively applied in respect of the European Social Fund and its activities are closely linked to the development of the national employment plans."
"We see as positive the simplification and concentration that has resulted in combining the current Objectives 3 and 4 into Objective 3 for the next seven years."
"The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Committee on Regional Policy support the horizontal nature of the regulation because it is in keeping with the aims of the new Objective 3 to promote the policy of developing human resources in the management of the rest of the objectives. In addition, it is linked to the national employment plans and this guarantees that active policies will be applied in the entire Union, and not only in the regions that are not included in Objectives 1 and 2, as proposed by the Commission, since that would discriminate against the richest areas of the least developed regions, which would not come under the umbrella of Objective 3."
"In committee we also expressed the need to guarantee the planning and implementation of the Structural Funds in all its objectives and to promote the principle of equal opportunities, but in a balanced way."
"It is true that there are serious distortions in the labour market that are detrimental to women and to the disabled."
"I would also like to emphasize that we agree that resources should be used efficiently, but in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs - and the Committee on Regional Policy feels the same - we feel that the formula proposed by the Commission to free funds automatically is too rigid and that the exceptional nature of the Structural Funds appropriations should be retained."
"That is, these appropriations should be spending objectives and not ceilings for spending."
"In addition, if there are funds that are not used, they should be distributed among other regions of the Member State, and the Committee on Regional Policy has also approved this."
"Finally, with regard to Community initiatives, it is important that the interventions and objectives of Community initiatives should be clearly separate. In addition, the Commission should announce the criteria it will propose for the new generation of initiatives, as is stated in the report."
"Madam President, I think today's debate has demonstrated substantial agreement between the approach of the Commission and the position of Parliament, agreement on concentration, simplification, efficiency and partnership."
"But I think the Commission will need to take account of some of Parliament's views if there is to be a meeting of minds in the spirit Mr Hänsch spoke of this morning, rather than a dialogue between someone maintaining one position and someone pursuing another route."
"I think we have reached some important agreements on principles; now there are a few points to be finalised."
"The Commission is already willing - it seems to me - to review the reserve proposal."
"One approach to the Community initiative programmes is that Interreg should immediately become the main programme, but we are insisting both on the maintenance of the URBAN programme and on a greater role for the city within the regulations, both in Objective 1 and in the other Community initiatives, like the Interreg programme."
"For Objective 2, coherence with state aid can be achieved in two ways: either through greater flexibility, or by asking the state aid to bear in mind that a problem has to be identified for there to be Structural Fund intervention, and that, possibly, the two maps should coincide."
"However it is the Structural Fund intervention which signals that there are certain problems to be dealt with here."
"Madam President, I would like to have talked in general terms but, given recent developments in my own country, I will confine my remarks to our future strategy."
"I am sure the Commissioner is well aware of the Irish Government's decision to divide Ireland into two regions: a grouping of 15 counties from the west, the border and the midlands, including two counties in my own constituency, Kerry and Clare, to be designated as a new Objective 1 region."
"It is intended that the remaining 11 counties will be designated as Objective 1 in transition."
"I understand, Commissioner, that you have already made it clear to the Irish Government, that this strategy will not result in any extra funding for Ireland."
"In any case you are leaving it to Eurostat to decide on the admissibility or otherwise of the new regions, based on the statistics available."
"Could you confirm whether it is true that Eurostat will be producing new figures in the next couple of days providing the economic indicators for 1996-1997?"
"If, as I fear, they show a dramatic improvement in Ireland's economic performance, is there not a real danger that a major part of the newly designated Objective 1 region will no longer qualify?"
"It will be above the threshold and that would leave our current strategy in tatters."
"The use of the GDP criterion overestimates Ireland's true position."
"It includes multinational profits which do not stay within our economy and I ask the Commission to bear this in mind when considering the Irish case."
"GNP would be a much fairer criterion."
"Finally, I seek clarification from the Commission in relation to the proposed Objective 1 in transition status."
"Will the change in co-financing from 75 % to 50 % apply equally to EAGGF projects and those under ESF and ERDF?"
"What will be the situation in relation to headage payments."
"Will the level of headage payments under Objective 1 be continued under Objective 1 in transition areas?"
"Madam President, I commend the Commissioners on their attendance at this marathon debate and the attention they are paying to it, but I am afraid I have to use my limited time to talk about where I believe the Commission has got it wrong: first in the proper pursuit of concentration and simplification."
"The cuts in the Community initiative go just too far."
"The Commission must not tell us that the amounts are too small to justify the administration."
"Tell that to the people in my region, which has used ECU 30m - £25m - in the last five years."
"Smaller programmes which are targeted, can actually work better."
"In supporting the Urban initiative, let us not hear about duplication."
"What about the 60 % of people who live in small and medium-sized towns, innovation, transnational links?"
"A new Community initiative can be tailored to these needs."
"In Objective II, let us be clear that giving help to the poorest regions is not the same as giving help to the poorest people."
"Let us help the pockets of poverty; one programme, one region, yes, but targeted help from Objective II within the region at below NUTS III level."
"On the question of services, a redundant bank teller or hotel receptionist is just as unemployed as a redundant factory worker."
"I welcome the fact that the Commission has supported our representations on this, but the regulation still needs clarification."
"It was wrong of the Commission to exclude environmental authorities from participating in decision-making."
"And regional funding, just as much as social funding, should respect principles of non-discrimination."
"Finally, on the issue for which I have been rapporteur, the guidelines: let us have an unequivocal assurance from the Commissioner that they will be published by the end of the year and they will not be used to impose late changes on local projects."
"This is a test of the Commission's real commitment to simplification."
"Let us accept a duty to negotiate this package on time."
"Anything less will mean funding delays, short deadlines, rushed projects for the next seven years."
"The opportunity to prevent that exists once and once only."
"We must act now."
"Madam President, the cohesion policy is an element of solidarity for the most disadvantaged regions."
"The regions that are a priority for aid, as defined by the Commission, are the Objective 1 regions, which are those with an income that is less than 75 % of the European average."
"For this definition the autonomous community or region is used as a point of reference."
"This procedure may seem fair, but one change needs to be made."
"There are areas that, although they are not as large as a region, have objective needs, and their income is unfortunately below the level required."
"For this reason there must be exceptions, which are, of course, limited, so that those areas can be Objective 1 and can take priority in receiving aid."
"There are various areas of this type in the European Union."
"One example is the area made up of the left bank of the Nervión and Ayala in the Basque Country."
"It has 350 000 inhabitants, with an income that is below 75 % of the European average, a level of unemployment above 20 %, a socio-economic fabric that urgently needs revitalising and, what is more, is an area adjoining two autonomous communities that are currently Objective 1: Castilla-León and Cantabria."
"Therefore, including the left bank of the Nervión and Ayala in Objective 1 would leave no island in the European aid map."
"It would be an act of solidarity towards its inhabitants and a essential element in revitalising investment and economic activity in the area and in creating jobs."
"It is therefore necessary to consider the possibility of taking account of exceptions in the Objective 1 map, so that specific and objective needs for support will have their share of the Structural Funds, above and beyond political and administrative limits."
"There is another aspect of the Commission's proposal that we must modify."
"Aid for training and employment for the new Objective 3 could be lost for Objective 2 areas: industrial areas."
"This would be a complete contradiction in terms."
"Where are training and human resources more needed than in areas that are undergoing industrial change?"
"It is only through this concept and through this modification that the Basque Country, as well as other industrial areas of Europe, will be able to continue to receive around 8 billion pesetas every year."
"I hope that Parliament will tomorrow be in favour of using that Fund for training in Objective 2 areas that are undergoing industrial change, because if training is needed for employment anywhere in Europe, it is undoubtedly needed in areas like these that have a high level of unemployment and where a considerable amount of effort is being made in industrial and technological change."
"Madam President, I would like to speak about the proposal for a regulation on structural actions in the fisheries sector."
"It is impossible to take, in principle, anything but a critical position with regard to this regulation."
"This critical position is justified by the current situation of the fisheries sector, and by the proposals that are being made to us in this regulation, even though they are not very specific."
"It is important to emphasise - and you are all perfectly aware of this - that the common fisheries policy currently relies almost exclusively on the Structural Funds."
"On this issue, both from a quantitative as well as a qualitative point of view, it is impossible to take anything other than a critical position."
"The Community fisheries sector is currently undergoing a profound change in order to survive and be competitive in a globalised economy."
"The action that is taking place requires the provision of sufficient funds to finance the various aspects that make up the common fisheries policy in its various facets: conservation and protection of resources, international agreements, markets, structural measures, social aspects, etcetera."
"The lack of sufficient funding would lead to the collapse of a sector that is vital in coastal areas and that is labour-intensive, both in the actual fishing sector and in the processing industry, and the loss of this would result in a considerable outlay of public resources."
"From a quantitative point of view, there are a series of uncertainties that are making its future difficult."
"And from a qualitative point of view - and I am coming to an end here - there is an observation that has been made many times in the Committee on Fisheries: it involves the plan for the new structural policy, in which the horizontal nature of the fisheries objective is lost."
"The fisheries sector needs a regulation, or at least a specific objective, that is of a horizontal nature, as well as a single legal instrument, a basis like the current FIFG, which should be strengthened on the basis of the criteria put forward by the Commission in the proposal to create a rural development fund."
"This is what we are calling for, Madam President, in our amendments."
"Madam President, in the discussion on the Cohesion Fund overriding importance should be attached to the proposals for amendments removing entitlement to the funds from countries that have joined the euro. In other words, we should focus our attention on this element."
"These are proposals without any substantial justification since it is a structural fund aimed at bringing about real convergence among the countries with per capita GDPs less than 90 % of the Community average."
"Given that this convergence would be jeopardised by the restrictive policy dictated by nominal convergence, it is understandable that, in everyone's interest, further support should have been granted to bring about real convergence."
"The need to bring the less developed countries closer to the more developed did not come to an end when they joined the euro."
"This is indeed a temporary mechanism - as was said yesterday afternoon -in that it no longer applies once they reach 90 % - as a transitional measure -, and due to the fact that these less developed countries are obliged to pursue austerity policies under the terms of the stability and growth pacts."
"The proposal to exclude these countries from the Fund would have the paradoxical consequence of punishing those countries that met the conditions for joining the euro while rewarding those that failed to do so because they applied a less rigorous policy."
"Apart from these substantial reasons, what is at stake is our credibility vis-à-vis a Treaty where the conditions of access to the Fund are made perfectly clear: a per capita GDP of less than 90 % of the average Community GDP and the definition of a programme of nominal convergence."
"It is a Treaty that, without any reservations, rightly won the support of the European Parliament and has been ratified by all the Member States."
"What image would we be giving of politicians in general, and Members of the European Parliament in particular, if, for no reason - and in this case against the Commission - the Treaty were disregarded through our initiative?"
"Both the treaties and our word must be honoured, not only by the southern countries but also by the northern countries, which naturally played a decisive role in drafting those treaties."
"Madam President, Commissioners, we are debating a section of Agenda 2000 that has a special bearing on the nature of Europe, as it is directly concerned with cohesion."
"I have listened to many speakers in this debate and, possibly because they have been rushed due to the short amount of time we have, they seem to have given an impression with which I do not agree, because they have tried to say to the Commission that its proposals are not sound."
"I wish to say the opposite - using the short amount of time that I have - by stating that the documents we have received from the Commission are truly positive, genuinely encompass the meaning of cohesion, have enabled us to work, and we are amending them."
"However, I am not so pretentious as to assume that our amendments improve the Commission's texts."
"I think that society is complex and that our amendments possibly complicate the Commission's text."
"And this is necessary because we are Members of this Parliament and representatives of the people, but are acting at the cost of lowering the technical level and the appropriate tactical level of the Commission's document."
"However, I know that in the Commission you have been positive and courageous."
"You have been courageous in designing the structure of cohesion, courageous in proposing the Cohesion Fund and succeeding in the legal ruling, and courageous in proposing a balanced and sound amount to be set aside for this Cohesion Fund."
"Madam Commissioner, I ask you in particular to try to send us a new document on this framework regulation that precisely encompasses this very rich debate that you have had with Parliament and that I know you are having with the Council."
"It would be good if this regulation, which has already been discussed at great length in a certain way, could be replaced by another that would then be the final draft in this very fruitful debate we have had."
"Madam President, the funding for trans-European networks proposed by the Commission from 2000 to 2006 is almost double that from 1995 to 1999."
"I welcome this increase in funding, but it should be noted that the period from 2000 to 2006 is longer than the previous period, that figures must be compared in real terms and not in current terms, and that investments in the Union's infrastructures have fallen from 1.5 % to 0.9 % of the GDP in recent years."
"I therefore think that the figure is as relatively poor as that put forward in the Council regulation that we are now amending and for which I was rapporteur."
"At that time, I said in this House that the funding anticipated for trans-European networks only represented 0.6 % of the funds needed in order to build the infrastructures planned for the 1994-1999 period."
"We are in a similar situation despite the fact that the funds have been doubled in current terms, and there is therefore still a clear contradiction between the needs in terms of a real Community policy on infrastructures and the funds that are available from the Union."
"In addition, as I was also draftsman of the opinion on the Cohesion Fund, I must make the following observation."
"According to what has been determined, if a Member State that is receiving money from the Cohesion Fund does not fulfill the convergence criteria, such as public debt and public deficit, it will stop receiving funds."
"That is what has been determined."
"However, some people say - and today we have heard speeches to this effect - that if a Member State that is receiving money from the Cohesion Fund has fulfilled the convergence criteria, it should stop receiving that money."
"That means that every Member State, whether it fulfills the convergence criteria or whether it does not, will be punished by not receiving its share of the Cohesion Fund."
"When faced with such a contradiction, there is nothing more that can be said."
"I will only add that this was not the spirit of the temporary committee that was set up in order to implement the Cohesion Fund."
"I know what I am talking about, as I had the honour of being one of the members of that temporary committee."
"Madam President, the document presented to us today is the result of many hours of discussion and compromise."
"It was drawn up by our two co-rapporteurs, Mrs McCarthy and Mr Hatzidakis, whom I should like to thank for their efforts."
"Although we can approve the general content of the report, which adopts the Commission's suggested principles of concentration, simplification and decentralisation, we cannot vote in favour of the final version."
"In effect, we will still vote against the report, in spite of its positive points, such as the horizontal application of Objective 3, maintaining the 'URBAN' initiative and taking small and medium-sized towns into account for the first time, the need for a new initiative to deal with the economic and social crises that lead to job losses, and the restructuring of the performance reserve provided for by the Commission."
"As regards Objective 1, we too believe that, first and foremost, aid should be given to the regions that need it most."
"We believe that the 75 % criterion should be adhered to strictly."
"We cannot, under any circumstances, accept that appropriations from the Guarantee section of the EAGGF, used within Objective 2, be considered as non-compulsory expenditure."
"Also, we consider that our democracy will be tarnished if the House does not vote in favour of our Amendment No 46 which, in the interests of greater transparency, stresses that the non-discriminatory use of Structural Funds appropriations must be ensured in the different regions concerned."
"It is for this reason, Madam President, that the French Socialists in the European Parliament will not vote in favour of this at first reading."
"Madam President, Commissioners, quite an important objective in the Council Regulation is that the ERDF resources should mainly be used for measures which are favourable to employment."
"I would consider that point, which was also the subject of our discussion in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, to be particularly significant."
"I should like to pick out a few essential points which we in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs unanimously thought should be implemented."
"Firstly, we know that, in general, flexible models and new forms of organising work also lead to more jobs."
"However, we also know that these flexible models are very often not applied, and this is often because small and medium-sized companies are not in a position to transpose them."
"That is why we would request that you promote examples which can show how these new flexible models are to be implemented in smaller companies."
"Secondly, many small and medium-sized companies cannot afford to transfer to their companies all the technology that has been developed."
"I would propose that we set up innovation centres where innovative young entrepreneurs can obtain the appropriate knowledge and guidance to create new jobs in young companies."
"Thirdly, we think that from the very beginning of each project attention should be given to ways of best developing human resources in this context."
"Fourthly, we were all very concerned that the needs of the disabled should receive special attention during the planning stage of the infrastructure measures being supported."
"There are a great many other points, but I think that these are the main ones that can help to create a higher level of employment. We have reached unanimous agreement on these points and I call for them to be implemented."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen of the Commission, just a week ago I organised a conference in my hometown of Cuxhaven, an important fishing location in Germany, to look at the reform of the structural measures in the fisheries sector."
"The criticisms made by the regional fisheries sector reflected the great anxiety that prevails in that sector at present."
"In December 1992, the European Council in Edinburgh agreed upon the principle that areas dependent upon fisheries should receive privileged assistance within the context of the structural policy."
"However, in the new Regulation on the Structural Funds, the Commission no longer respects this principle."
"The partial restructuring in the agriculture fund threatens to bring the fisheries sector once again into direct competition with agriculture, an aspect which caused the greatest disquiet during the conference."
"According to the Commission plans, the very same measures in the different Objective regions are to be financed from different sources in future, with Objective 1 areas clearly coming off better."
"Does the Commission realise that companies in Objective 2 areas are going to consider relocating to an Objective 1 area purely and simply because the conditions there are better?"
"We must drop our original request for a separate Objective 4 for rural areas and separate consideration of the areas dependent on fisheries. However, we do need a horizontal, harmonised structural policy to safeguard the objectives of the common fisheries policy."
"That is the only correct approach."
"We cannot simply proceed as normal, because making the wrong decision in such a sensitive area as this would further undermine confidence in the European Union."
"That should not be the outcome of this new European Structural Funds policy."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today Parliament is dealing with the first step in the reform of the Structural Funds which will govern the cohesion policy of the Fifteen up to 2006."
"From this date onwards I think everything will change substantially, both the CAP and the conception and management of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund."
"To manage the period up to the enlargement of the Union, the financial perspectives propose the maintenance on paper of 0.46 % of GDP for Category 2 of the budget, while the Commission is in fact promising a concentration and a simplification which, in real terms, will significantly reduce the map of the regions and the percentages of the European population which will be covered by Objectives 1 and 2."
"Now, if the level really were 0.46 %, this concentration could be understandable."
"But it is not so, since the cohesion policy funds will also be used to finance the pre-accession, thus reducing by half a point the percentage of expenditure laid down at Edinburgh and confirmed in Agenda 2000 for the cohesion policy of the Fifteen."
"On the subject of the Community initiatives, the reduction from thirteen to three is acceptable if the surviving Community initiatives really have the added value compared with the existing funds and the trans-European regional character that must be at the basis of this type of initiative."
"I welcome the reference in the general regulation on the Structural Funds to the fact that it is not appropriate to link this regulation with competition policy."
"Of particular importance, in the reports on the general regulation and on the European Regional Development Fund, is the reference to the requirement to incorporate the island criterion both for Objective 1 and for the Community initiatives, providing a new area clearly dedicated to inter-island cooperation under the new Interreg especially."
"By adopting these proposals at first reading, the European Parliament shows consistency with its own position - in view of the vote in May on my report - and with the Treaty signed in Amsterdam, which provides, in the basic article on cohesion policy, for the inclusion of all the European island regions amongst the less favoured regions."
"In conclusion, I hope that the Commission can adopt the same consistent line that the Council and Parliament have been following since Amsterdam."
"Madam President, I would like to begin by thanking Mrs Jöns for her splendid work."
"I intend to speak here about the social funds."
"I would like to raise three points in particular relating to the proposal by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"Firstly, it is inevitable that the social funds should form part of the process of implementing common guidelines for employment."
"On this we are in full agreement with the Commission."
"Secondly, we need action to promote the status of women, and thirdly, we need to address the possible role of the social funds in implementing Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam on non-discrimination."
"The committee proposes that Article 13 should be amended and that a statement should be added to the effect that the funds should promote action to prevent discrimination based on gender, race, ethnic origin, religion or beliefs, disability, and age."
"I do hope the Commission will take the committee's proposal seriously."
"It is vitally important, as without resources the article on non-discrimination might not have any real impact."
"I hope the Commission will take the views of the committee on board."
"Madam President, Commissioners, one of the most important aims of this reform is concentration."
"If we are to achieve this objective, the funds available must be concentrated on - that is, allocated to - the really needy areas."
"The more regions are classified in the highest category of assistance - Objective 1 - either because people do not wish to accept the 75 % threshold or because they find ways to avoid complying with it, the harder it becomes for us to achieve this important Community objective satisfactorily."
"That is acceptable neither in the present Community of 15 Member States, nor in the light of the coming enlargement."
"In my view the 'phasing out' suggested by the Commission is in itself a fair way of dealing with the regions that have reached the 75 % mark."
"But let me give you an example by way of clarification: a region that has reached 74 % in 1999 would evidently remain at the top level of assistance for another six years and then ultimately enter the 'phasing out' stage by 2011."
"If I may express it thus: those who have benefited cannot with a clear conscience claim that there is a lack of solidarity in the EU; quite the contrary."
"I should like to remind you that we had a very distinguished guest here today, the President of one of the countries on our doorstep."
"I hope that if we ever reach the situation where the Republic of Poland fulfils the 75 % criterion during membership - and of course neither I nor any one of us knows when that might be - then our Polish friends will not insist upon staying in the top level of European assistance for more than 12 years from that date."
"To summarise, we in Parliament should really think once more about establishing a clear, exact definition of the criterion for membership of Objective 1. I hope that tomorrow's decision will reflect this."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"That was certainly required, even if it means that we have gone well beyond the speaking times."
"Nevertheless, only 20 minutes were set aside for both speakers."
"I did not interrupt you because I felt that your detailed statement was entirely appropriate."
"Mrs McCarthy would like to put another question."
"Madam President, it is very simple."
"The Commission indicated that it will be modifying its proposal on the performance reserve."
"Does that mean that we are to expect a modified regulation or simply a modified proposal on the performance reserve?"
"I should like to remind the Commission that while we are very willing to have discussions with you on the perfomance reserve, we do not have the right of initiative."
"We would like to have codecision, we would like to propose our own performance reserve, but that is not our job."
"It is up to the Commission to come forward with a proposal that is water-tight and workable."
"Madam President, Mrs McCarthy, we are not going to draw up an actual legislative proposal yet, but a paper which we would like to discuss with the Council and Parliament."
"I think that before we work on a new legislative proposal, it would make sense for us to discuss it together and see if we can reach agreement as far as possible."
"We also want to include many of the valuable ideas from Parliament, as I see that you are prepared to support the basic idea of the performance reserve."
"Madam President, first let me thank Mrs Jöns for her extremely thorough report on our proposal for a Council regulation on the European Social Fund."
"We agree on nearly all the major points of substance in the Commission's proposal for the future operation of the Social Fund, the importance of preventing and combating unemployment and the vital link between the Social Fund and the European Employment Strategy."
"In this spirit I am happy to take on board your Amendments Nos. 4, 8, 11 and part of 14 which reinforce these points."
"I also know that Parliament has concerns about the Commission's proposal, that Objective 3 - the main focus of the Social Fund activity - should apply only outside Objective 1 and Objective 2 areas."
"This is a concern which is shared by many of the Member States."
"We accept therefore, on reflection, that Objective 3 will have to intervene within Objective 2 areas in the future."
"We will still have to establish how we will operate that."
"Our original proposal in this area was framed with the objectives of simplification and flexibility."
"We must ensure that any alternative arrangements do not depart from this."
"We also agree on the need for a strong partnership in the Structural Funds."
"It is all the more important for the European Social Fund with its focus on inclusiveness, developing human resources and on involving local organisations."
"I welcome the recognition that the report gives to the importance of local development and the involvement of non-governmental organisations."
"I am happy to accept the first part of Amendment No 12, the first part of Amendment 38 and Amendment 63, which clarify the importance of partnerships particularly involving NGOs in the distribution of small grants by intermediary bodies."
"I want to take the opportunity to thank you all for your continued support for our proposal in Article 4(3) of the draft regulation, that at least one per cent of the Social Fund appropriations should be available for such an approach."
"We are running into some resistance in the Member States in the Council who want to water it down to a point where it would be just meaningless."
"Parliament clearly has a better grasp of the job creation potential of local development and local social capital."
"We will all do our utmost to keep these provisions in the Social Fund regulation and I hope that you will continue to support us on this essential point."
"An interesting fact here is that we have had more than 600 applications for a pilot project action that we have undertaken."
"It gives you some idea and I hope that the sceptics will take note."
"In keeping with our emphasis on equal opportunity I accept Amendment No 6 clarifying the aims of the fund in relation to equality between women and men."
"I also accept the principles behind Amendments Nos 19 and 60 for specific additional measures to encourage women's participation but we need a clear wording here."
"The general regulation sets out very clearly that the principle of mainstream equality of opportunity should apply at all stages of programming in all of the Fund's interventions."
"Accordingly, Amendment No 47 dealing with equal opportunities at the evaluation stage is therefore already covered in the general regulation and is not therefore necessary."
"I am pleased that you broadly support the five Social Fund policies that we have proposed in Article 2 of the regulation."
"Amendment No 15 - the first part - Amendments Nos 17, 18 and 19 are in line with the Commission's intentions and I am happy to support them."
"Similarly, the clarifications that you bring to Article No 3 - the eligible activities - to Amendments Nos 21 and 24 and in principle Amendments 23, 27 and 31, these are very welcome too."
"However, there are three main groups of amendments which the Commission could not accept."
"I will explain why very quickly."
"The first is the return to the target group approach of the current Objective 3, which for us of course would be a retrograde step."
"The key principles behind our proposals for the new Social Fund are simplification and flexibility."
"Specifying certain target groups at the start of a seven-year period would act to the exclusion of other groups and would deny the Social Fund the flexibility to intervene in support of any further vulnerable groups which might emerge during the programming period."
"It is in fact the exact opposite of the mainstreaming approach that we have been trying to promote."
"For this reason I am unable to accept the new Article 1(2) proposed in Amendments Nos 14 and 58, the second part of Amendment No 15 or Amendment No 39."
"However, let me be clear. Support will still be available for these groups."
"The Social Fund must support a more all-embracing approach to combating inequalities in access to the labour market."
"I accept Amendment No 3 (first part) which makes this very clear, and Amendment No 7, subject to some rewording."
"The second major amendment which the Commission has difficulty with is Amendment No 20."
"This seeks that a minimum of 15 % of interventions be devoted to adaptability and equal opportunities."
"This does not mean that we are not committed to these two issues."
"Indeed, we suggest this 15 % in the explanatory memorandum as an indicative figure and stipulate in the regulation that particular emphasis must be given to these two fields."
"However, specifying a figure in Article 4 would not allow Member States the necessary flexibility to respond to the needs identified by their ex ante evaluations and in their national action plans for employment within the annual employment guidelines."
"Finally, the third group of amendments concerns technical assistance."
"It is a simple fact that the availability of technical assistance is a matter defined within the regulation and not by the budgetary authority."
"So, in conclusion, I have no difficulty in accepting 19 of the proposed amendments."
"These are Nos 1, 2, 3 (first part) 4, 6, 8, 11 and 12 (first part) 14 (second part) 15 (first part) 17, 18, 21, 24 and 34 (first part) 38 (first part) 45, 52 and 63."
"Further to this, I can accept in principle a further six amendments, subject to some clarification of the wording."
"These are Amendments Nos 7, 19, 23, 27, 31 and 60."
"I hope that I have adequately explained why the Commission cannot accept the remaining amendments."
"The Social Fund is above all concerned with people - their jobs, their skills, their prospects in the labour market."
"I therefore believe that it is absolutely right for the European Parliament to have a strong input into this regulation."
"I have greatly appreciated Mrs Jöns' partnership and that of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and I look forward to continuing close cooperation in the future."
"Thank you, Mr Flynn."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9.30 a.m."
"CAP, EAGGF"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following oral questions:"
"B4-0702/98 by Mr Colino Salamanca, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, to the Council, on Agenda 2000 - reform of the CAP; -B4-0703/98 by Mr Colino Salamanca, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, to the Commission, on Agenda 2000 - reform of the CAP; and the report (A4-0405/98) by Mr Görlach, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council Regulation on support for rural development from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) (COM(98)0158 - C4-0297/98-98/0102(CNS))."
"Madam President, I would first like to welcome the President-in-Office of the Council."
"Thank you for attending this evening."
"I think that this sets a good example for future Councils."
"With regard to the Council, I would like to express our concern about the way in which Agenda 2000 is being handled."
"The Presidency's programme stated that you intended to actively continue the negotiation process."
"The truth is that, if we believe the most recent Council report from the 19th and 20th, we may have some doubts as to whether the Council is really continuing this active negotiation."
"I am saying this mainly because I have had the opportunity to read the report of the last Council of Ministers in which you listed the key issues in each of the sectors being reformed. That list does not give us much optimism that we are soon going to reach a solution."
"For example, I read the Council's thoughts on the horizontal regulation where you specify that the main issues are the need to include 'environmental conditionality', the need to regulate aid, the need to fix a ceiling for direct aid and the need to determine how budgetary resources are redistributed."
"In order to produce that, all that you really needed to do was to read the regulation involved."
"This gives the impression that, so far, four or five months have gone by and all the Council has really done is to read the regulations."
"In truth, we had thought that something more would have been done during the last four or five months."
"We are even surprised to find that the Council of Ministers is still discussing whether the wine regulation is included in the Agenda 2000 reform or not."
"I thought that this had already been resolved, that we had come to an agreement on this issue and that we were now working on Agenda 2000 with wine included."
"In any case, you concluded at your last Council meeting that you can now start to look at the solutions."
"This is all well and good."
"Above all, I would like to know when you intend to conclude your discussions, because I think that after five months things should have progressed a little more, especially if we want to meet our deadline of the Vienna European Council in December and, in particular, so that by March, which is the date we have fixed, we will be in a position to give our opinion on the issues involved in Agenda 2000."
"With regard to the Commission - and I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Fischler for attending - I would like to say that there is an issue that is somewhat disrupting the debate: the famous issue of co-financing."
"It did not come up initially, but halfway through the debate, and it has complicated the matter somewhat."
"I think that more information is needed."
"For example, when reference is made to 25 % of the aid, what aid is being referred to?"
"There are many types of aid."
"Does it refer to aid for tobacco or hops, to the premiums for sheep or those that are in the 1992 reform?"
"It would be good if these issues were clarified so that the debate could move on."
"We should also have clarification on whether or not this co-financing has to be the same for everyone when there are - as you know very well from the study carried out by the Commission - countries affected that are undergoing what we call 'cohesion' and that, according to your presentation, it does not seem that they are the ones who end up paying when this situation arises elsewhere, as occurs with budget balances."
"The other issue that I feel needs to be highlighted with regard to the Commission is that it recently endorsed the studies carried out in Bonn and Amsterdam on the possible consequences of the 1999 reform."
"I think they are a good thing - I am not going to start judging them as I do not have a detailed knowledge of them - but there is one piece of information that catches my attention: the possible job losses that could occur while farmers' incomes are being maintained."
"I feel that this is serious, because there were already significant job losses in 1992."
"In this respect, it would be appropriate to consider what measures we are prepared to take in order to prevent this."
"Moreover, according to my information, the calculations and forecasts are pure futurology."
"Sometimes the results show that they are right, and sometimes not."
"However, what does seem to be correct is the information that unemployment may rise - according to the studies - by between 2.2 % and 3.7 %."
"If this were the case, it would be important to know whether or not you plan to strengthen the area of rural development."
"I think that if this forecast might be right, we should be able to implement the second pillar of agricultural policy - that is, rural development - with even more vigour."
"We should have a set of measures planned that will enable us to deal with a situation that will otherwise overwhelm us."
"In this respect, I think that it would be appropriate for us to consider the possibility of promoting rural development - not only that linked to agricultural issues, but also to non-agricultural issues - so that we can approve the reforms that are currently on the table."
"Madam President, now that Commissioner Wulf-Mathies' comprehensive discourse has given us the opportunity to discuss one or two points outside the Chamber, perhaps we can now catch up with some lost time to ensure that everyone on the list has the chance to speak this evening."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have all entertained high hopes for the Commission's proposed reforms."
"There is no doubt that the overall package, including the merging of several directives into a single directive for rural areas and their development, contains genuinely far-reaching proposals and new ideas."
"Having said that, I must add that, if the headings are compared with the descriptions, it emerges that not every heading matches the small print underneath."
"We must be careful not to raise hopes that cannot be fulfilled when the ideas are implemented."
"Let me now focus on the new proposals on rural development."
"For several years, of course, we have all been under the influence of the proposition, which the Commission has reiterated, that the development of rural areas is effectively a second pillar of the agricultural production system that has to be erected alongside the traditional, albeit reformed, agricultural policy."
"I recall the excellent conference that the Commission organised in Cork, but we are all well aware that, although we may sit together in a relaxed atmosphere and speak a little about our dreams for the future, those dreams cannot always be fulfilled in the way we would wish."
"Our hopes were higher, but they could not all be converted into concrete proposals."
"I also know this is difficult, but I believe that many of the Commission's proposals were too strongly influenced by the thought of the editing scissors that the Council would inevitably wield, given the wide diversity of the Member States' interests."
"Of course it is essential to seek a majority but, as every trade union knows, to secure a 3 % pay rise you must start by asking for 6 %."
"Anyone who opens negotiations by offering a compromise solution need hardly be surprised when that offer is beaten down, particularly in the agricultural debate, where so many different interests are involved."
"Allow me to highlight Article 31, for therein lies the key to the question of the extent to which we can take account of the potential of rural areas in the support we give them."
"As far as the agricultural economy is concerned - and I refer expressly to the agricultural economy, and not just to farming - the wording is unclear."
"We are not quite sure where it is supposed to be leading."
"We have heard many explanations from you, Commissioner, and from others."
"That puts our minds at rest."
"But I believe this has to be more clearly worded."
"It must say more clearly what we intend to do, and it must also give a clearer indication of the resources that will be available to us in the future."
"Parliament cannot accept being fobbed off with the promise of more specific provisions in the implementing regulations."
"I am well aware that it is not possible to formulate everything in detail in a legislative text."
"I have even criticised a considerable number of my parliamentary colleagues' amendments for trying to do just that."
"A piece of legislation cannot be crammed with helpful details, but there should certainly be a little more clarity."
"If the implementing provisions subsequently spell out everything that can be done, we should then find a way, if possible, in which Parliament can participate in a Commission measure as a goodwill gesture, even beyond the scope of written agreements."
"The two pillars are not yet pillars."
"Or at least the second pillar, namely rural development, is not so much a pillar as a spindly little tree."
"We shall have to tend and fertilise it very well until its trunk attains the same girth as the first pillar."
"That will be exceptionally hard work."
"Parliament knows that the Commission is on the right road, but that road is not yet very clearly signposted."
"Let us try to work with you to mark out this route and perhaps also to find a means of bringing home to the Member States, in all their diversity, that rural development is not simply a matter of financing non-agricultural activities but that, by bringing stability to rural areas, it ultimately benefits agriculture and the agricultural economy."
"Madam President, I am pleased that this oral question on the agricultural part of Agenda 2000 affords me the opportunity to continue our dialogue with the European Parliament which has started very promisingly, in my opinion, in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"In view of the situation with regard to speaking time, I should like to give a very condensed report on the progress made by the Agriculture Council in examining the Commission proposals with a view to transposing them into statutory instruments."
"I should like to concentrate on the main political issues that will be at the heart of future discussions."
"I need hardly tell you that some of my comments will be made without prejudice to next week's Agriculture Council discussions, the aim of which will be to formulate a clear political position as a contribution to the Vienna meeting of the European Council."
"As you are also aware, it is the intention of the presidency to engage in further talks with the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development as soon as we have the results of the forthcoming Council meeting."
"We are all conscious of the challenge posed by Agenda 2000 in general and particularly by the special status attaching to the common agricultural policy in that context."
"It is now generally recognised by the body of Agriculture Ministers that the reform process initiated in 1992 must be continued, intensified, adapted and supplemented."
"This necessity derives from both the inherent constraints within the farming world and the new extraneous challenges, such as the forthcoming round of WTO negotiations and enlargement of the EU."
"It is therefore our duty in the context of our political responsibility for agriculture to take swift and concerted action to structure the CAP in a way that will determine the course to be followed in the global negotiations."
"In my opinion, at any rate, this approach is preferable to a wait-and-see strategy, which would result in our having to take decisions that were forced on us by a deteriorating market situation on the one hand or by our non-EU partners on the other."
"In this respect, we are proceeding from a number of basic principles which most Members of the House have approved and are able to endorse and which ought to enable us to complete the ambitious project of CAP reform on satisfactory terms, in the true interests of the farming community and to the advantage of consumers."
"I am thinking here particularly of the European agricultural model, which ought to be further developed."
"This model agricultural system must be multifunctional on the one hand and sustainable and competitive on the other; in other words, it must cover the entire territory of the EU, including regions with specific problems."
"This European model should not be unfamiliar to us, since the initial inspiration came from this House."
"The model was endorsed in the conclusions of the Luxembourg European Council."
"We also largely agree that the reform of the common agricultural policy has to result in arrangements that are economically prudent and reliable as well as socially acceptable, in appropriate earnings and in a balanced relationship between production sectors, producers and regions, and that it must prevent distortions of competition."
"After all, we are firmly resolved to preserve budgetary discipline and are virtually unanimous in the view that the agricultural guideline should, as a matter of principle, be maintained as a ceiling and be calculated in accordance with the present formula, irrespective of what the guideline covers."
"With regard to this point, however, I must point out that there has been a change in the position of some delegations on the agricultural guideline, as well as on the question of shifting some fiscal burdens from the CAP purse back to the Member States."
"The European Council itself, moreover, has expressed the view that the Commission proposals offer a basis for further reform of the common agricultural policy."
"This means that the completion of the reform process will depend on adjustments being made to these proposals."
"In this context, it is imperative that the Vienna European Council should make considerable progress, in accordance with the Cardiff timetable, on the main components of Agenda 2000, so that political agreement can be reached on the whole Agenda 2000 package by March 1999 at the latest."
"The Austrian Presidency expects to engage in highly constructive cooperation with the European Parliament in this matter."
"As far as the Agriculture Council is concerned, may I tell the honourable Member that tangible progress has been made since the meeting of the European Council in Cardiff."
"For one thing, the Council has completed the process of identifying and clarifying the issues that will form the core of future negotiations."
"This means that it can now move on to the next and more substantive stage of seeking ways and means of resolving these issues, possibly in the form of a range of options."
"To this end, as I explained at the start of my remarks, the Agriculture Council is to adopt a report at its meeting this week for the Vienna European Council."
"The aim of the report is to identify the general guidelines that have emerged from the papers produced to date, to outline the main progress made since the Cardiff meeting and to shed light on the issues on which the Member States still hold sharply differing views."
"From my point of view, there is also a need to emphasise that the negotiations have to proceed at a very brisk pace after the Vienna European Council."
"Since I assume that the timetable for dealing with Agenda 2000 which was set by the European Council in Cardiff will be adhered to, I believe it is desirable that agreement be reached as quickly as possible on the unresolved issues, so that the Agriculture Council is left with a limited number of key political issues to discuss at its March meeting. As you can imagine, the solution of these problems may depend to some extent on developments in the negotiations on other aspects of Agenda 2000, particularly on the financial conditions."
"For that reason, it would be very useful if the European Parliament's preliminary reports were available on time."
"I am gratified to note that the report on rural development, one of the most important areas where reforms are needed, will shortly be completed."
"As far as the reform of the common organisation of the cereals, beef and milk markets is concerned, may I remind you that the Agriculture Council, at its November meeting, expressed the view that the approach adopted back in 1992, the main element of which was a reduction of the price-support measures, combined with direct compensatory aid and accompanying measures, remains valid."
"The Council also took the view that the suitability of this approach in specific situations and the weighting of the various measures should be assessed on a case-by-case basis, with all available internal and external factual information being taken into account."
"The work that has been done on this subject, however, indicates that the Member States have different concepts of suitability."
"There is actually quite wide-ranging agreement that this approach should be pursued in the domain of crop farming, irrespective of the size of the reduction in the intervention price and the amount of compensatory aid."
"With regard to beef too, the great majority of the delegations consider this approach useful, again notwithstanding the amount of the reduction in the intervention price or of the compensatory aid."
"Some delegations, however, doubt that this approach alone can control the supply situation and recommend provision for measures specifically designed to control supply, which would mean a smaller reduction in the intervention price."
"As far as dairy products are concerned, the positions of the delegations differ widely."
"Some Member States believe that this approach, and especially the lowering of prices, is unnecessary in the present market situation."
"Others, however, believe that radical changes to the system are indispensable."
"These differences derive partly from the opposing positions adopted by the delegations on the future of milk quotas."
"While most of the delegations wish this quota to be retained, some Member States are calling for it to be abolished by 2006."
"There are numerous questions concerning details of the individual market regulations which we can certainly include in the discussion if so desired."
"With regard to the proposed reform of the common organisation of the wine market, which was submitted in July, a technical examination is now being undertaken so that the key questions can then be identified quickly at the political level."
"For that reason, I cannot provide you with a résumé of the Member States' positions at the present time."
"However, I should like to make two comments, because I believe they are important."
"First of all, the discussions to date and the exploratory talks held by the Council in September have shown that the Member States generally regard the present Commission proposal as a decidedly better discussion basis than the proposal of 1993/94."
"The more flexible approach and the general objectives are considered on the whole to represent substantial progress."
"In addition, let me say to the honourable Member, since it was he who asked the question, that this proposal should be regarded as part of the general package of CAP reforms under Agenda 2000."
"So in order to achieve this goal, it is essential that we progress as quickly as possible."
"It would be very, very helpful - and I address this appeal to all of you in this House - if the opinion on this proposal could be delivered as soon as possible, so that we in the Council can make the progress that needs to be made."
"Some very definite progress has been achieved in the realm of rural development."
"This is an issue with extremely important implications for the future of our farmers and the entire countryside."
"That is precisely why the presidency devoted its informal meeting in St Wolfgang to this topic."
"There is unanimous agreement in the Council that vital importance attaches to rural development policy as the second pillar of the common agricultural policy."
"The delegations also largely accept the recommended integrated policy framework."
"There is also very wide-ranging agreement on the objectives that should underlie the granting of assistance for the development of rural areas."
"Moreover, the idea of developing forestry and giving it a more prominent role in the package of rural development measures has also been welcomed, although I cannot deny that the Member States still differ on the scope of individual measures in the package, because most of this domain, of course, falls within the jurisdiction of the Member States."
"Various important questions will have to be dealt with in greater detail so that they can be definitively resolved."
"In my view, the main questions are these: firstly, the type of specific measures that can be implemented - in other words, whether these measures should only relate to activities connected with agriculture in all its multifunctional aspects, or whether multisectoral contributions to rural development of a non-agricultural nature can be considered."
"Secondly, the link proposed by the Commission between the compensatory allowance for less-favoured areas, subject to compliance with certain environmental requirements, has elicited comments from many delegations to the effect that the compensatory allowance is primarily a socioeconomic instrument designed to compensate for natural disadvantages."
"The third and last question relates to sources of funding and especially to the Commission proposal that rural development be switched from the Guidance to the Guarantee Section of the EAGGF."
"As far as the financial regulations are concerned, it is logically obvious that the discussions on those can only be concluded at a later stage, particularly in the light of the negotiations on other elements of the Commission proposals, the results of which will have to be reflected in the provisions of the financial regulations."
"My own point of view on the question of horizontal regulations is that these proposals include innovations which must be examined extremely thoroughly before they can actually become common political guidelines."
"As for compliance with environmental requirements, there is general agreement on the need to promote the attainment of environmental targets; this, incidentally, is wholly in line with the European agricultural model that all the relevant bodies want to see developed."
"But there is still a need to examine how these targets are to be achieved, and particularly whether they should be incorporated into the common organisation of the markets or whether they should be prescribed elsewhere, for example in specific regulatory frameworks."
"Moving on to the criteria governing the employment of workers, there are divisions among the Member States on basic principles as well as on procedural details."
"This is evidently a highly sensitive subject which requires more study."
"Lastly, with regard to the sliding scale of total grants paid to farms on the basis of farm size, the delegations evidently differ on this point too. Several delegations agree with the principle or are keeping an open mind on the maximum amount, whereas some delegations still disagree with the Commission's approach."
"I hope that I have managed to provide you in this brief summary with all the most important information on the work that has been taking place in the Agriculture Council and on the prospects for future progress in connection with the agricultural element of Agenda 2000."
"I am confident that this dialogue will help to foster the deliberations that are taking place in Parliament and in the other institutions."
"You may rest assured that the Austrian Presidency is willing to do whatever is necessary to ensure that the targets laid down in the Cardiff timetable are met and that the process is therefore duly completed in March 1999 in the interests of the agricultural sector, which needs a clear vision of the future."
"Thank you."
"Madam President, first I would like to compliment Mr Görlach on his report."
"His argument is very convincing, and reflects our group's constant attention to agricultural and rural policy."
"We are disappointed that, in fact, despite all the declarations and grand statements at Cork, this second pillar of the CAP still looks like a shaky crutch."
"Yes, simpler procedures for rural development programmes are an excellent step forward, and the new role of the regions and strengthened partnership are important, but the paramount problem is still funding, which is pretty limited at 10 % of all CAP expenditure."
"This suggests that planning for the countryside, that vast physical and human European resource, will be largely driven by traditional market policy with its powerful funding and instruments, which makes our poor little rural policy look like a lady-in-waiting"
"In this context, I fear that the entirely legitimate attempt to extend rural policies to cover more than just agriculture - mentioned by the Commissioner - runs the risk of generating eagerness and expectations everywhere which are bound to be disappointed."
"We will not be able to satisfy all the rural communities wanting to take advantage of them."
"I think that is a sign of the difficulty and uncertainty surrounding this endlessly awaited reform of the CAP."
"And our motion for a resolution on the Agenda 2000 agricultural reform is geared to that very point."
"We are driven by two concerns: the first is that the crisis situation on the international markets may hold up reform while waiting for better times."
"Instead, we think it is necessary to press on rapidly and stick to the planned timetable for decisions next spring."
"And there is no need to water this reform down excessively and have a kind of artificial reform - as the Commissioner said - especially on those innovative aspects of the horizontal regulation which are supposed to be an opportunity to reconcile people to the CAP and justify the aid it covers, and which, in my opinion, threaten to disappear altogether."
"Mr Görlach is right - if the Commission's proposal, here too, had been a bit more courageous and a bit less wedded to a rather too convenient subsidiarity, we might not have reached this point."
"But now we must move forward, and there is absolutely no need to curl up like a hedgehog to defend the status quo."
"I believe a fortress Europe would be the worst signal to send to the CEECs who even now see their accession date fading sadly into the distance."
"The second concern is the one this debate on the cofinancing of income support raises in me."
"Commissioner, I appreciated your extreme prudence at the last meeting with the Committee on Agriculture because, in fact, this logic of net budget balances, which has got absolutely nothing to do with the real issues of reforming the CAP, threatens to introduce a dangerous virus into the whole construction of Europe, and I do not want all of this to lead to another reform deadlock."
"Our message - at least the one we have tried to get across in this resolution - is that it is right to have the cards on the table and let the farming world have its say too, because it cannot be made just a passive witness of decisions taken over its head."
"If we want to grasp the opportunity of the debate on budgetary resources to talk about expenditure, and hence about the CAP, fine, but what drives us are the real problems of the CAP - the unfair distribution of its benefits - which the President of the Court of Auditors also described to us in this House yesterday."
"I think it would be wrong to erect an ideological wall against the renationalisation which the cofinancing would provoke, and see it as a demon."
"But it would be equally wrong to allow purely accounting logic to prevail over aspects of balance, cohesion and solidarity which are even more necessary in the new CAP than they were in the old one."
"So debate and negotiation should come together in this context."
"I think it will be best for everyone."
"Madam President, I wish to greet the President-in-Office and the Commissioner."
"I should also like to congratulate Mr Görlach on his excellent report."
"What are the main issues of concern for the European Parliament that led to the tabling of this oral question?"
"You only have to consider the report on the general aspects of the reform approved by the European Parliament in July, a report that I myself drafted, the declarations made at the 1997 Agriculture Council or the Cardiff European Council, or the statement made recently by the Austrian Presidency to find the answer."
"But I should like to reiterate the main concerns."
"First of all, we must show caution and moderation in the reduction of prices, especially in the milk and beef sectors."
"Secondly, we need to maintain the intervention regimes, albeit in a more flexible and operational form."
"Thirdly, we must ensure greater equality between different crops, farmers and types of farm so that the CAP can finally contribute to the economic and social cohesion of the European countryside."
"Fourthly, we should strike more of an internal balance within the CAP by strengthening the so-called second pillar of rural development."
"It is incomprehensible that there should be virtually no change in the appropriations earmarked for this extremely important pillar when around 10 % of the guideline resources have not been used."
"Fifthly, we need to preserve an adequate number of farmers working the land. This is a major concern in the less-favoured, peripheral and ultra-peripheral areas, which are already running a great risk of abandonment and desertification."
"If, as is proposed, the reform of the CAP is limited to a reduction in prices and their compensation by means of aids indexed to productivity rates, then we shall be carrying out a reform only for the more efficient farmers."
"That would be a shocking contradiction with the political aims of defending the European farming model and keeping the countryside alive."
"Those aims have always been pursued and reiterated by the Commission and the Council."
"Let us leave aside such political hypocrisy."
"It is now 13 months since Agenda 2000 was first presented and 7 months since the proposals became more practical. But we have yet to see any signs of progress despite the efforts made by the Commissioner and Jacques Santer."
"As if that were not enough, there is now the proposal on cofinancing, which has poisoned the whole debate over the CAP."
"We do not want to avoid this debate and we cannot escape it but it goes far beyond the question of the agricultural policy and is a debate that we have to hold at the right time, not now."
"The European Parliament has reached a broad consensus on the CAP but the question of financing at this stage cannot be allowed to poison our debate, nor should it be allowed to divide us."
"Madam President, I should particularly like to welcome the President-in-Office, the Austrian Minister for Agriculture, along with his many assistants who are here this evening."
"This is a very positive signal from the Austrian Presidency."
"I should also like to congratulate Mr Görlach on his report, which I think lays a very solid foundation for the rural policy in Europe which my group feels is so badly needed."
"It will have to be defended in future, particularly in international circles in my view, as part of the 'blue box'."
"While we on this side of the Atlantic are busy drastically reforming the agriculture policy that we feel we need, those on the other side are sending out completely different signals, however understandable this may be, by suddenly increasing their subsidies enormously."
"It would be interesting if the Commission could analyse, and let Parliament know, whether this extra aid is classified as being in the blue box or the green box."
"It will inevitably be part of Europe's future agricultural policy, to be paid for from Category 1."
"The main problem with income support in future will be that once the Central and Eastern European countries have joined, they are sure to apply for it."
"This will be very difficult: it will become unaffordable, and then the common agricultural policy itself will come under threat."
"I favour cofinancing under strict conditions: only if there is no renationalisation, and if the Member States are obliged to pay or face strict sanctions if they fail to do so."
"You will not be surprised to hear that I also advocate a policy of promoting good-quality agricultural products."
"In my report a few months ago, I gave a detailed account of how this should be approached, and I hope that the Austrian Presidency will bring this matter up again in its discussions in future."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, as the Commissioner explained to us a few moments ago, in answer to the protest from certain Member States who make net contributions to the Community budget, the Commission has just drawn up a report on the own resources of the European Union, with a view to readjusting Member States' contributions."
"The Commission puts forward three options, one of which is the national cofinancing of direct aid to agriculture at a level of 25 %."
"This proposal may be tempting at first sight as it would have a considerable effect in terms of readjustment for certain Member States whose agricultural sectors are smaller than the Community average."
"However, in the short and medium term, there is a danger that national cofinancing could weigh heavily on the national annual budgets of certain Member States, such as France, who would be forced to significantly increase their agricultural budget."
"Yet this goes against the policy of controlled expenditure needed for the success of the euro."
"Also, national cofinancing represents a real threat to financial solidarity among Member States."
"There is a danger of intolerable imbalances among the fifteen Member States, which would lead to the formation of a two-speed Europe: a Europe of rich states and a Europe of poor states."
"I am opposed to national cofinancing."
"The Commission's proposal poses a serious threat to the common agricultural policy and could mark the beginning of its renationalisation and, over time, its disappearance."
"The progressive and underhand dismantling of the CAP would irreparably challenge European unity as the CAP is the first Community policy which, for 50 years and despite battles fought over agricultural matters, was able to give strength to the cohesive force and spirit of solidarity that are characteristic of the European Community."
"CAP reform is necessary but it should not trigger the collapse of Europe."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I think firstly that the Cunha report - which is an excellent report - brought to light the contradictions, imbalances and effects of the 1992 reform."
"I do not think it is right that the Commission should propose Agenda 2000 to us without having completed the task of presenting a report evaluating the effects of the 1992 reform."
"Commissioner, reports from universities are not enough: the Commission's political responsibility obliged it to set out the effects of the previous reform before this Parliament in order to have an adequate debate."
"This was one of the Commission's major responsibilities."
"With regard to the proposals, the Commission has restricted itself to drawing up proposals for sectorial reforms, without having an overall plan. What is more, the reforms it is proposing are, in general, price reductions that are not partially compensated for by direct aid to incomes, and a widespread system of replacing purchasing intervention with aid for private storage."
"With the development of the international financial crisis, it would also have been desirable to use more specific tools for analysing these measures and the effects that the international crisis might have on this sector."
"Finally, on behalf of my group, I would like to congratulate Mr Görlach, and draw attention to rural development, Commissioner, as neither the tools nor the financial resources considered in the Commission's proposals are satisfactory with regard to this issue, and they will in no way be able to compensate for the negative effects of the remaining proposals on the rural society and economy."
"I would like to add a few thoughts on the subject of co-financing."
"What is proposed is not a policy of solidarity, because the real economic policies - the internal market policies and the common commercial policy - are not reflected in the budget."
"Therefore, presenting matters in terms of net balances is inappropriate and very inaccurate."
"Perhaps we are seeing there the hand of a Member State, and the Commission should be more generous and not give in to certain pressures."
"Allow me a final thought: what is happening with Agenda 2000 is an example of institutional game play within the context of Europe."
"It is very important to keep to timetables, but it is just as important to take the right decisions, with the appropriate methods and pace of debate and with sufficient transparency."
"Madam President, Commissioner, a great deal of money is spent in the agricultural domain; just imagine that all the money that has been poured into agriculture in the past had gone towards this second pillar we are discussing here today."
"Commissioner, it is impossible to assess the extent to which rural areas could have flourished, how many jobs would have been created and preserved, how much agricultural spin-off development we could have initiated too."
"If we consider how much innovation has taken place as a result of the frugal programmes we have had and through the funds that have trickled into the Leader programme and the accompanying measures, we can obtain a rough idea of the sort of impact these programmes would have had if they had been furnished with the necessary capital."
"Nevertheless, what is planned for the second pillar is very sound in terms of quality, but in quantitative terms its resources are meagre."
"We should be bolder here, and above all in the other areas, in the traditional agricultural domains, in the support premiums for price reductions; we should surely look long and hard at the social and environmental quality of our measures and adjust them accordingly, with a view to bringing them into line with our social and environmental policies and to charting a new course, so that these funds will eventually flow into what we now call the second pillar, which within five or ten years - perhaps we should not set ourselves too tight a schedule - could become the first pillar."
"If we make wise use of the funds at our disposal, if we do not let them disappear into the national treasuries, we stand a great chance of succeeding."
"I would ask you, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, to be rather more daring and to adopt a somewhat more positive approach in explaining to the public the great opportunities that lie along this route."
"Your native country has some valuable tips and good examples to offer us in this respect."
"Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office, I would simply like to make two points."
"Firstly, we are used to hearing that the CAP has achieved its objectives of self sufficiency, as set by the Treaty."
"Then we immediately think of overproduction, set-aside, fallow land, the drop in agricultural prices and yet, it has to be said, this does not really reflect the reality of the situation."
"The Union is in deficit in certain products that it could easily produce itself."
"We import 70 % of proteins for livestock farming, but also 50 % of honey and a considerable amount of citrus fruits, fish, wood and even sheep whilst, at the same time, troubled rural areas remain unused."
"Also, on a budgetary level, we should not be decreasing aid but rather improving it, without diluting it with hypothetical cofinancing. Such cofinancing promotes selfishness in national accounting and harms the founding principles of solidarity within the Union."
"This reform should redistribute production among the various regions, climate zones and countries."
"This reform should stop making intensification a priority."
"The main aim of reform cannot be to satisfy the multinationals of the food and farming sector."
"We understand that European citizens do not wish to continue financing such a convoluted system."
"A European agricultural model does exist."
"It is not uniquely based on the Union's exports, nor on a widespread drop in prices."
"It is based on the multi-functional nature of our agricultural sector and on the patchwork of our land. We should ensure that they complement one another with a view to sustainable rural development in the human interest, and the creation of jobs."
"And what of the world market?"
"We must, of course, take our place in it, but not at the expense of our fellow citizens and their health, nor at the expense of their environment."
"This is also the price we pay for European integration."
"It is also the price we pay for having a European Union, a worthy partner that is respected and well-known in the globalised world."
"Madam President, the proposal for a regulation on support for rural development from the EAGGF incorporates all of the existing measures relating to Objective 5a of structural policy."
"I find that the Commission proposal lacks realism and does not take into account the negative impact that the 1992 reform of the common agricultural policy had on the economic fabric of rural areas."
"A perfect example is the frantic race for output, productivity and enlargement in order to maintain an income that no longer allows profitable investment."
"Our group, both in committee and in the House, has tabled a series of amendments which include all economic sectors in rural areas in the support mechanism for extensive agricultural production. This support is provided by compensating for the supplementary production costs for farms in less-favoured areas."
"A large number of these amendments have already been adopted by different majorities in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, thereby showing both the Commission and the Council how much importance we place on rural development for a healthy balance in European society."
"As regards financing the CAP, we are opposed to any system where Member States cofinance a common policy due solely to the fact that Article 2 of the Treaty of Rome lays down the principle of financial solidarity."
"Moreover, although the national cofinancing of aid would at first be compulsory, the methods for implementing it would soon become optional or discretionary."
"As a result of this cofinancing proposal, Mr President, I question the Commission's objectives."
"Do you really want to maintain a Community agricultural policy, the only existing common policy along with the Common Fisheries Policy?"
"If this is not the case, then it must be stated clearly and without pretence in order to allow Member States to renationalise agricultural policy to defend their own interests themselves."
"Madam President, CAP reform is dictated by outside considerations, particularly in the eyes of the Commission, and it should now be clear that developments in the international arena, with the crisis in Asia and Russia, mean we must be more realistic about export possibilities for our agricultural products."
"We must be wary of being too confident in this area."
"Similarly, enlargement to include the CEECs should be subject to careful consideration."
"In this respect, it must be clear that such enlargement should not lead to our common policies, particularly the CAP, being watered down."
"In addition, it is also in our interests as Europeans to note that, currently, the United States is once again being forced to strengthen public support for its farmers."
"These are new arguments to justify our CAP and the European agricultural model within the WTO."
"But I would also like to draw attention to more internal aspects of our forthcoming reform. The legitimacy of our agricultural policy needs to be renewed."
"For the consumer, the quality of products needs reinforcing, and the taxpayer needs to be reassured that public money is being wisely spent. And our fellow citizens need to be reassured that we are safeguarding regional balances and promoting sustainable development."
"More importantly, we must make our CAP more coherent, as the Cunha report suggested."
"From this point of view, I would like to warn against the initiatives and decisions in favour of Member States cofinancing the CAP as this measure, if it were taken, would challenge the whole principle of financial solidarity, one of the basic tenets of the CAP."
"It may also lead to the renationalisation of the CAP as, when national partners have to vote on appropriations for their country's farmers, it will not be long before they use national criteria to decide which way they vote."
"For these reasons I cannot sanction the idea of cofinancing, and I call on my colleagues to be most careful on this matter."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for his cooperation and his willingness to compromise."
"A report on the funding of measures for rural areas is very difficult to deal with, not only because of the host of amendments but also because of the diverse needs of the Member States."
"The development and promotion of rural areas is a particular concern of mine, since I am convinced that Europe, in all its diversity, will only have a future if its less-developed regions, including its rural areas, receive targeted and effective support."
"I therefore crave your indulgence, ladies and gentlemen, for my repeated interventions in the House on behalf of rural areas, but I consider rural development to be a very important subject which warrants these constant reminders and which needs to be explained clearly to all our citizens."
"Alongside regional policy, agricultural policy plays an important role in the development of rural areas."
"While regional policy focuses its array of instruments and resources on supporting the rural population and the economic base of small and medium-sized businesses, agricultural policy supports the farming community through the EAGGF."
"This fund and the regional support measures are now to be made available as a combined package, primarily to meet agricultural needs and requirements."
"In my opinion, this idea of an integrated policy for rural areas is extremely important, but let me emphasise that care must be taken from the outset to ensure that these resources are used efficiently."
"In other words, measures which primarily affect agriculture must be financed from this fund, whereas measures that affect rural areas without having any link at all with agriculture and the multifunctionality of rural areas should actually be supported within the framework of regional policy."
"I also support the constructive approach based on the principle of good professional practice."
"Good farming practice is really the basis of the way in which farmers run their businesses."
"They must be specially recompensed for any contributions they make, over and above that basic farming practice, to improve the environment, promote animal welfare, care for the countryside and help society in general."
"Let me just remind you of the Commission's policy, the aim of which is a relentless process of price liberalisation; that makes it all the more important that our farmers should have the opportunity to top up their incomes by providing additional services."
"I am naturally a staunch advocate of transparency in the production chain, of environmentally acceptable production methods and of high standards of animal welfare."
"Farmers, however, cannot be expected to make these contributions without the guarantee of a commensurate income. It is on that guarantee that the future of our European model of agriculture depends."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, Agenda 2000 aims to facilitate the eastward enlargement of the EU and to prepare for the next WTO talks."
"The Agenda 2000 timetable was decided at the Edinburgh summit, and the ELDR Group is pressing ahead with the agreement of reforms laid down in the timetable."
"The costs of enlargement have been assessed too conservatively."
"The global economic situation has got worse and so the plan for the funding of enlargement has altered."
"The new situation prompted the Commission to draft a report on own resources, proposing as one solution the partial assumption of the burden of funding agricultural expenditure by the individual states."
"This national funding of Common Agricultural Policy expenditure is already routine in Finland, for example, which acquired the right to finance aid itself during the transition period, in order to ease the integration of Finnish agriculture into the EU single market."
"The co-funding of environmental aid is also something already happening."
"The national funding of agricultural expenditure must be very strictly regulated, so that farmers in the Member States receive equal treatment."
"When operating in a single market under very different circumstances the worst-off producer regions must be supported by means of a common agricultural policy."
"The Agenda 2000 reform, therefore, should have given more weight to the needs of the worse-off regions, as was called for in the Luxembourg resolution."
"I hope more consideration will be given to these needs in future."
"The Agenda 2000 reforms further reduce the share producers get from the market place, which is a particularly serious problem for the worse-off regions."
"The share of direct aid in the income structure for the Finnish farmer has now grown too large."
"Agenda 2000 is only exacerbating the situation."
"How, I would like to know, is the spirit of enterprise in farming to be kept up?"
"The provisions on forestry aid in the Agenda 2000 reforms are worded very unclearly, and it is thus difficult to discover what they mean, for example, in terms of funding."
"The ELDR Group opposes extending the aid policy to cover the forestry sector, which falls into the category of free trade."
"Madam President, in the available time it is not possible to deal with the many challenges facing European agriculture or the role of farming as a central pillar in rural infrastructure."
"Neither is it possible to evaluate that role in economic terms."
"In spite of generous EU support, which I acknowledge, family farms are disappearing from the rural landscape."
"The age profile of farmers is deteriorating and young people no longer see farming as a sustainable career."
"How then is the European family farm model to survive?"
"What are the consequences for long-term food security and quality, not to mention the role of farmers as managers of the environment?"
"To those politicians who see farmers as a legitimate target to boost their own political careers with urban voters, I say that they are displaying an appalling lack of understanding of the unique role of agriculture in the context of broader national and EU policy."
"They are ignoring the fact that in the present circumstances food is now being produced at profit levels that are marginal and, in many cases, below the cost of production."
"In Ireland there is certainly a short-term crisis for beef and sheep producers which could not have been foreseen at the time of the 1992 reform."
"The collapse of the Russian economy and the fall-out from BSE are just some of the problems that are impacting on our beef sector."
"Taking the long-term view in the context of Agenda 2000, we must ensure that family farms and their individual enterprises are supported within the available budget resources."
"Large-scale commercial enterprises should not be allowed to usurp funding which should go, in my view, go to family farming."
"In conclusion, I fully support those who say that there should be no co-financing of the common agricultural policy."
"I would certainly oppose any move towards renationalisation."
"Madam President, I should like to congratulate Mr Görlach on his excellent report, in which he emphasises the fact that rural development is in danger of falling between two stools, in other words being virtually gambled away, since according to the Commission's proposal, it is no longer to be a separate objective."
"I wonder whether a proper analysis of the consequences has been carried out."
"It is important to support and encourage interaction between rural areas and towns, since each provides the other's resources."
"The development of agriculture - in which the EU plays an important part - has brought about a situation in which it is often impossible to depend on the family farm as the principle means of employment and sole source of income."
"Running a farm often has to be combined with other work to make it feasible for family members to remain in the countryside."
"The situation is particularly acute in sparsely populated areas."
"Therefore, the support criteria need to be changed, otherwise only the large agricultural units will continue to thrive, while the small, environmentally friendly farms see their future disappear."
"Rural depopulation would continue, leading to the painful demise of small towns and villages, since it is the small and medium-sized undertakings that keep the countryside alive."
"The EU's agricultural policy therefore needs to be flexible to allow the countryside to go on flourishing."
"Madam President, I should like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur."
"He is a man we all respect within the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and Parliament."
"Rural development is being put forward at the moment as a second pillar for agriculture."
"The question I ask myself is: will the second pillar be any use?"
"You can only give it the strength it requires by providing sufficient finance to give maximum support to the rural community."
"I am extremely concerned that the second pillar will create an even more uneven playing field within the European Union than presently exists."
"To only make the agri-environmental measure mandatory is an extreme weakness."
"It gives Member States the licence to pick and choose to their own advantage, which may not be in the best longer-term interests of people living in the country, especially those dependent on the land for their support."
"Rural development, as proposed, can never hope to address the serious problems facing the rural and agricultural communities throughout the European Union at present."
"This will not protect the family farm structure that we have within the European Union."
"Farmers throughout Europe are asking where do we go from here; what do we do and what have we done wrong? We should ask ourselves what we have done wrong."
"We are the people with the responsibility within the Commission and Parliament."
"We are the people who have to point the way forward."
"We are the people who have to find and ensure that there is a way forward."
"Unfortunately, to date, I do not see within this proposal enough support for the family farm structure within the European Community."
"Madam President, we need to be serious in this Parliament about achieving genuine reform of the common agricultural policy for the 21st century."
"Mr Görlach produced an excellent report on the Commission proposals for rural development and put forward a small number of very practical amendments to bring them more closely in line with the Cork Declaration which the Commission had watered down somewhat."
"Those amendments recognised the reality that in the conditions of the 21st century European agriculture will be much less labour-intensive and more mechanised in almost all sectors."
"It is therefore essential to see rural development as support for the creation of a range of additional occupations in rural areas, not just those relating directly to agriculture and food processing, important elements though they will certainly continue to be in such areas."
"It was therefore disappointing that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development introduced many additional over-detailed amendments to link support primarily to farmers and weaken the commitment to wider rural development."
"We are not the farmers' committee and we have a duty to look beyond personal vested interests and towards the interests of all those citizens living in rural areas who will not find jobs in agriculture."
"I hope this House will reject the majority of amendments so that we will have an opinion from the European Parliament which is realistic and constructive in adapting the European model of agriculture to new economic and social conditions as set out in the joint resolution from our colleagues, Mr Fantuzzi and Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf."
"They identify as key factors sustainable development, quality food production, consumer safety, protection of the environment and biodiversity, animal welfare and rural development."
"To achieve the latter we need LEADER type programmes to assist small-scale enterprises to develop new jobs in high technology as well as in tourism, traditional crafts and skills and environment-enhancing projects."
"They should not only be in Objective 1 and 2 areas but everywhere the rural environment is suffering high unemployment and social deprivation."
"Madam President, I have listened very carefully and have participated actively in many debates on the major elements of Agenda 2000."
"I fully agree that the Union must plan its course for the future."
"But the proposals for CAP reform are based too heavily on measures to ease the cost of enlargement to the East and to satisfy US pressure in WTO."
"It is very clear that there is a strong move to reduce farm prices to world price levels and the levels of Eastern Europe to save money."
"This approach requires EU farmers to sell their products below the cost of production and depend for their income solely on partial compensation."
"This is not sustainable and should be changed."
"The system is already generating angry criticism of farmers as the amounts of these payments are identified separately from the costs of products that farmers produce and are seem by some as handouts."
"In fact, you yourself, Commissioner, used the word subsidy."
"The Court of Auditors report this week is a good example."
"It certainly generated widespread headlines almost implying that farmers are criminals."
"The system is also acting as a deterrent to young people making a career in farming."
"The environmental benefit of their management, their energy and their skills is also being lost."
"I can find no basis for the Commission's optimism that farming incomes will increase except at the expense of a sharp decline in numbers."
"The proposals will cost an extra six billion euros and make farmers a lot poorer."
"I would appeal to the Commission to soften the severity of these proposals and find a better way."
"Farmers in my country are already suffering a huge decline in income."
"Beef prices to farmers are 40 % lower than two years ago."
"Pig prices and sheep prices have collapsed."
"Lastly, can I ask the Commission again to investigate why food prices to consumers are not reducing in line with the huge fall in farm prices?"
"Madam President, Commissioner, Minister, I think that it is extremely important that we should follow up the report by Mr Görlach and the proposals from the Commission by developing a broad rural policy."
"Why do we need this policy?"
"The point has been made several times this evening: because we need new economic platforms in rural areas."
"I would like to draw attention to two aspects that have scarcely been mentioned this evening."
"Eighty per cent of the population live in towns or cities."
"I think that people in rural areas must realise that, when we develop a rural policy, it has to be geared to the people in the towns."
"This is what I mean by a broad rural policy."
"I would also ask for attention to be given to women in rural areas, who are often a powerful voice for change, often much more so than men."
"I would like to see them given extra help as part of this rural policy."
"Madam President, we agree that the CAP needs to be reformed, partly because of the new economic circumstances but also because of the malfunctions that have been noted in it so far."
"We say yes to reform, reform that will reduce the inequalities between countries, regions and farmers, reform which will contribute towards ecological development of the countryside, reform which will support the farming populations in our countries."
"So we back the measures proposed by Agenda 2000, which move along those lines and are compatible with the fundamental principles of cohesion and financial solidarity."
"We must point out, however, that like some other objectives, the objective of developing the countryside will be nothing more than wishful thinking unless it is accompanied by sufficient funding."
"However, the need to reform the CAP must not serve as an excuse for its virtual abolition."
"Consequently, we cannot support proposals such as the co-financing of direct aid for farming, which, though it responds to the demand by some Member States that their net contributions to the Community's budget should be reduced, leads the CAP along the way to renationalisation and in essence calls into question the level of the agricultural guideline."
"At the same time, the adoption of co-funding will have an adverse effect on the flow of funding from the Structural Funds to the Union's poorer countries, so increasing the inequalities that exist already."
"I think the need for reform is more or less agreed."
"That should allow us to proceed more steadily, taking careful steps towards a well thought out reform which the farming world really needs."
"Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this important debate must end with approval of a document on the reform of the CAP."
"I do not want the difficulties that have emerged in relations between the political groups to lead to the defeat of the resolutions tabled."
"In my opinion, this would be serious for the European Parliament, which ought to express itself clearly and not just leave the decisions to others."
"There has to be a realistic assessment."
"Cofinancing can make it possible to resolve the conflict which has developed on the net contributions of Member States to the agricultural budget."
"What must be avoided is renationalisation of the CAP and reduction and weakening of the spirit of internal solidarity."
"That is why I am in favour of the proposals which clearly uphold all these principles and I urge all my colleagues, starting with the Italians, to vote consistently tomorrow."
"Ladies and gentlemen, if we do not decide on an approach here and if the Council does not find a solution to the problems soon, the risk is that the decision will pass to others, to the Ecofin Council of course, and it certainly is not likely to increase the relevant resources, which would be needed to sustain the reform of the CAP."
"So the cofinancing can be there if the demand for a new equilibrium and internal cohesion remains firm."
"Madam President, Commissioner, 80 to 90 % of Europe is countryside."
"A vast area of Sweden consists of countryside, but only a small fraction - 10 to 20 % - of the population lives there."
"If no one lived in the countryside, half of Sweden would be uninhabited."
"It is therefore very important for us that support should be given to rural development and agriculture."
"Support for Objective 6 should be included in Objective 1, and support for Objective 5 should be included in Objective 2."
"The criteria for support should remain the same."
"The countryside, the people, nature, the soil and water are all resources that Europe should be using sensibly."
"It is also important to strengthen local communities, coordinate support, address education, protect the environment, encourage organic farming and invest in bio-energy and new types of fuel such as ethanol and methanol, as well as in tourism and transport."
"However, these activities must take place in accordance with the wishes of the people concerned, if rural development is to be successful."
"Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office, Agenda 2000 is most certainly one of the issues that has caused the greatest activity in the European Parliament over the past ten years."
"The length of the debates and the number of meetings that all Parliament's committees have devoted to it lead us to expect a far-reaching project."
"We were finally about to give birth to Europe, so to speak, to an ideal Europe where our children were be able to live in peace as free citizens, from the Atlantic to the Urals."
"We were going to open our doors to new countries, countries that may be poor in financial terms but are rich in hope."
"At last we had stopped being afraid and were marching towards the creation of a European state."
"This state was to be a area of intellectual freedom where the concerns of political and economic leaders would be centred around human concerns."
"We were going to leave hormone-laden meat and the quest for profit at all costs to the Americans and to their World Trade Organisation."
"We were ready for true solidarity, where the rich - as indeed we are - offer a helping hand to give and to support rather than to take and to trample."
"Yet this was just another dream."
"I woke up this morning and my blood ran cold when I realised how we have behaved."
"Once again, we are ready to pretend to help our poor, each of us entrenched in our own little states, made more callous by our narrow-mindedness."
"Sadly, cofinancing will for example legally allow our richer states to help their own farmers."
"If there is no longer any solidarity in Europe, if Agenda 2000 consists simply of allowing rich Member States to obtain rebates of their own money, then who will pay for the poor in the poorer countries, be they in southern Europe today or in eastern Europe tomorrow?"
"Once again, we are doing the opposite of what should be done, and this is unfortunate for our children."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, nobody doubts that a reform is necessary and nobody doubts that the common agricultural policy is not entirely fulfilling the role assigned to it in the Treaty."
"When this policy is judged from the point of view of its contribution to economic and social cohesion, the level of criticism is sometimes outrageous."
"However, in my opinion, the most worrying thing is that with a reform process that is so highly complicated, particularly given the small amount of resources set aside for rural development policies, the debate on the Community's own resources has become involved."
"In this context, it is true that the Commission has restricted itself to presenting a report with various options, but our experience in the Community means that we are accustomed to fearing reports, White Papers and Green Papers drawn up by the Commission."
"In the end, there is a considerable possibility that the option that has the most support and the most justification will become a definitive part of Community legislation."
"Co-financing direct aid to incomes represents not only a breakdown in the principle of financial solidarity, but also a violation of the principle of 'means necessary', as laid down in Article F.3 of the Treaty on European Union."
"It is not a means of improving the efficiency of the CAP, but simply a mechanism for redistributing the burden of spending."
"The proposals involved are clearly regressive, are largely detrimental to the 'economic and social cohesion countries' and benefit the more prosperous countries, with the exception of France and, to a lesser extent, Denmark."
"This would lead to the paradox whereby enlargement would take place at the expense of the 'cohesion countries', whose relative share in category 2 has been considerably reduced and that, in addition to this, the reform of CAP funding would also affect those countries again."
"Moreover, Commissioner, that does not take account of the fact that, according to the information provided by the Commission in June, the list of direct aid that Directorate-General XIX has used for its calculations includes a much smaller amount of aid than that which is considered direct and subject to regulation in the reform that we are currently dealing with."
"This means that the proposals are even more regressive."
"Madam President, the common agricultural policy was established in the 1950s, when there were only six Member States."
"As nearly everyone recognises, this policy is not ready to cope with an enlargement which will mean the Union consisting of some 20 countries."
"The Commission has submitted its proposals for specific changes to the agriculture policy, and we are currently studying our attitude to the reform of the CAP in several parliamentary committees."
"The main ideas are well known: the across-the-board support schemes will be abandoned, and European farmers will have to compete on the world market, where liberalisation is now in full swing."
"This will mean that prices have to fall into line with those on the world market, and that will put an end to milk quotas and stocks of surpluses."
"This should not take place at the expense of our farmers, who will find it difficult to hold their own in free competition."
"On the contrary, future agricultural support needs to be much more targeted."
"Price support should be replaced by increased direct aid for those farmers who really need help."
"Support will also continue to be provided for areas and sectors which have special problems."
"The present form of agricultural support is based on quantity rather than quality."
"It takes no account of animal welfare and environmental considerations, and in my view is in fact totally out of step with the growing importance which most consumers attach to these values."
"The agricultural policy cannot continue without change if European farming is to participate in competition on the world market."
"And the CAP currently swallows up more than half the EU's total budget, and with enlargement things will become even worse."
"Our consumers are increasingly demanding to be told what their food contains and how it has been produced."
"They want to have natural systems of production which protect the welfare of animals and do not harm the environment."
"It is important to realise that we have to organise our common agricultural policy so that it meets the current demands both for the present Member States and - not least - for those which join in future."
"Madam President, Commissioner, the farmers in the new federal states, like farmers everywhere, are following the decision-making processes in the realm of agricultural reform very closely."
"Even though it has not yet filtered through to everyone - I know that it filtered through to you long ago - most of these farms of ours correspond to the European model of agriculture."
"They are multifunctional, they are sustainable and they are at least potentially competitive."
"We all know that some of those in favoured locations are very competitive."
"Let me say a few words on multifunctionality with special reference to communal farms, which of course account for most of our farmland, especially in less-favoured locations. Not only are these farms multifunctional, but - and this is our main concern, and I believe you are aware of it - in truly rural areas where unemployment is in the 30 to 40 % range, such as Mecklenburg/West Pomerania and other regions, they are the only guarantors of the relatively few jobs that still exist."
"With regard to this second pillar, to which we all look forward eagerly and which ought to become strong as quickly as possible, under no circumstances must we permit the rules governing the first pillar to break down the last bastion of employment in these regions."
"I believe this point has been taken on board."
"As far as long-term prospects are concerned, I should like to make explicit reference to the re-established family farms, which are reasonably sized from our point of view, because their size is based on the sole objective of passing on the farm as a viable business to the next generation."
"Here too, the degressive intentions of the Commission meet with very little comprehension."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, I shall begin with the point I feel is closest to the statement made by the Commissioner, that is, we cannot carry out a 'reformlet' but it must be a real reform - I would even say a great reform."
"The problem facing us at the end of this century is not one of production."
"Production is doing fine and Europe has nothing to worry about."
"Since 1950 the rural population has dropped from 35 % to 5 %, yet production has increased almost eightfold. As you have just said, Commissioner, this reform is going to lead more people away from the countryside."
"That means that the Commissioner is going to spend half of the Community budget on far less than half of the population and, since there is profound injustice in the entire common agricultural policy, the Commissioner is going to spend 40 % of the Community budget to benefit 1 % of the richest people in the Community."
"While 20 % of all farmers get 80 %, the Commissioner can work it out for himself that 1 % of the richest are going to be receiving 40 % of the Community budget."
"After all, the problem is not one of production."
"The problem is one of justice, a just policy to defend people living in the countryside."
"That policy of justice is not understood or even being discussed by the Commission."
"That is the fundamental issue at stake because today's problem is whether the Commissioner or the Council are going to put a complete end to aid to production."
"As they stand, they are the enemy of quality, the enemy of the environment, and the enemy of jobs, because the crops that the Commissioner gives most of the finances to are those with the highest levels of unemployment: cereals currently receive 43 % but producing cereals is the least labour-intensive of all the types of farming that exist."
"In other words, unemployment is being subsidised."
"The Commissioner is doing nothing to regulate, set ceilings or ensure that justice prevails."
"It is the vital issue of justice that we ought to be discussing because productivity is doing very well, thank you."
"Madam President, although I am speaking last, I do not think I am speaking about anything trivial if I take up the points made on this issue by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection."
"The aims of agricultural reform in the Agenda 2000 document are in principle very much a step in the right direction, taking account of the decisions taken, for example, at the meetings in Amsterdam and Cardiff."
"The aim is to make agricultural policy more environmentally-friendly, and to serve the needs of the consumer to a greater extent."
"In practice this is not actually being implemented very successfully."
"The problem is that the Commission is leaving these issues to be decided at national level."
"The decision on whether or not to link environmental matters with income support is being left to the national authorities."
"There is no desire to make joint decisions, but this is vital if we are to be able to change tack."
"Agriculture, as is well known, is one of the worst polluters of soil and water."
"We will only see genuine improvement when we devise common rules for good agricultural practice which apply the principle of sustainable development, and only when these practises are introduced can we share the benefits of a common agricultural policy."
"As for future agricultural policy in the European Union, the issues have been gone over at many summit meetings."
"Along with the approach to the environment that emerged from the Cardiff conference, emphasis must be given to the policies agreed at Luxembourg, which stated that in the future we must be able to practise farming everywhere in the European Union area, including the north."
"Thank you, Mrs Myller."
"The Council and the Commission have indicated that they will forego their statements if there are no further questions, as seems to be the case."
"I am grateful to everyone for staying with us for so long."
"I have received eight motions for resolutions tabled pursuant to Rule 37(2)."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9.30 a.m."
"Finally, I must not forget to thank the interpreters, who have worked for much longer than was originally planned."
"I wish you a safe journey home."
"(The sitting was closed at 0.17 a.m.)"
"Mr President, I am sure the House will join with me in condemning the action of the British House of Lords last night in rejecting the British Government's attempt to bring the United Kingdom in line with the rest of the European Union by introducing proportional representation in the United Kingdom."
"Mr Donnelly, that is an opinion on another parliament's decision."
"This House is not the place to condemn or approve actions of other Houses."
"We have to respect other parliaments."
"Mr President, I wish to bring to the attention of this House a totally unacceptable and disgraceful attack on the government of Italy yesterday by the Prime Minister of Turkey speaking before the Turkish Grand National Assembly."
"I would like to ask you, Mr President, to make clear to the Turkish Prime Minister that this House utterly rejects and condemns his accusation that failure to hand over Mr Abdullah Ocalan for trial in Turkey is tantamount to becoming accomplices in murder."
"Italy has a clear legal, indeed constitutional, obligation not to return a person under extradition to countries where the death penalty still exists."
"In that context, it must be said that Italy embodies the values of this House and the European Union generally."
"Italy is currently going through the proper democratic and constitutional processes dictated by its constitution."
"Encouraging demonstrations and trade embargos against one of our Member States is, frankly, unacceptable from a country which wishes and aspires to join us in the European Union."
"An attack on the government of Italy in this way is an attack on all of us in the European Union: on the values which underlie this Union, on the solidarity and partnership which is fundamental to European integration."
"Mr President, I would ask you to make clear the views of this House to the government and Prime Minister of Turkey and, indeed, to send a message of our strong support to the government and Prime Minister of Italy to continue with their proper democratic and constitutional processes, despite the harassment, to deal with the issue before them."
"Perhaps we could ask the Turkish Grand National Assembly to join with us in seeing this moment not as a threat but as an opportunity to launch the political dialogue, which is the only way to solve the Kurdish problem."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of our group I should like to express support for Mrs Green's proposal."
"We do indeed believe that the Turkish authorities - and more specifically the Prime Minister - have made unacceptable statements about Italy, accusing it of being an accomplice to terrorism if it fails to grant the extradition of the Kurdish leader Öcalan."
"We believe that in this case Italy and the Italian authorities are respecting the rule of law by applying a constitution which prevents the extradition of an individual to a country which still has the death penalty."
"I believe that the vast majority in this Parliament have always opposed terrorism, in all its forms, and that we can have every confidence in Italy, a Member State of the European Union, which has shown a fundamental respect for the rule of law and the fundamental rules of the constitutional state."
"It will solve the specific problem it is now facing in accordance with these rules, of that we are convinced."
"I should indeed like to support the request to protest to the Turkish authorities and to declare our support for the position of the Italian Government."
"Mr President, on behalf of the ELDR Group I support the initiative of Mrs Green."
"We believe that the Italian Government is respecting the rule of law, that we should show our solidarity with that process and that we deplore as misguided the political attack which has been launched against the Italians by the Turkish Prime Minister."
"We reject the view that according any person whose extradition is sought their rights under law is tantamount to an implicit or explicit support of terrorism."
"Nor does it in any way pre-judge their guilt or innocence."
"We wish to show our solidarity with the Italian process."
"Mr President, at the beginning of the week, I expressed my group's concern regarding the Turkish Government's request for extradition."
"I had already made it clear, as other chairmen had made it clear, that we wanted Mr Ocalan to be granted political asylum."
"We are now faced with a new situation that affects Parliament."
"The co-chairman of the European Union-Turkey Joint Parliamentary Committee, Mr Bülent Akarcali, sent a letter to the various Italian Members threatening them on behalf of Turkey."
"This letter ends by saying that granting Mr Ocalan political asylum would not only have a negative effect on the friendly relations between Turkey and Italy, but would also create a terrorist problem for Italy, Europe and the rest of the world."
"It is entirely unacceptable that the co-chairman of the EU-Turkey Joint Parliamentary Committee, a country with which we have a customs union, should be allowed in both an institutional and formal way to threaten Members and Italian and European institutions with terrorism."
"Mr President, I strongly call on you to write to this gentleman to defend the dignity of this Parliament, peace and democracy."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Greens in the European Parliament agree with what has been said here today."
"But we should like to stress two points in particular."
"Firstly, the way Italy and the Italian Government have been treated by the Turkish authorities is unacceptable."
"This is not a dispute between Italy and Turkey. It is a dispute between Europe and Turkey, which is I why believe it is a good thing that the European Parliament - albeit a little late - is now giving its attention to it, as we knew on Monday already that serious problems were in store."
"Secondly, a very clear majority in Parliament has taken the line throughout this debate that a political solution must be found to the Kurdish problem."
"In this respect it is clear that at the very moment when the PKK - from which my group and all other groups have always distanced themselves - unilaterally declares a cease-fire in order to seek a solution by alternative means, Turkey has decided to resort to this sort of action."
"We therefore believe that no pressure must be placed on Italy, that the whole of Europe must declare its support for Italy on this and above all that further efforts must be made in working towards a political solution."
"Clearly there must be no pressure to extradite an individual to his enemies who have already shown in the past that they often use methods which are little better than his."
"Mr President, we are not being asked today to judge the leader of the PKK."
"In fact, on several occasions, particularly in the McMillan-Scott report, Parliament has given its opinion on this movement that takes part in terrorist activities."
"What we are being asked today is whether or not Italy should extradite Mr Öcalan."
"Italy is a state under the rule of law."
"Italy has a constitution and case-law that prohibits it from extraditing anyone to a country that still has the death penalty."
"We should trust Italy as a state under the rule of law."
"It will abide by its constitution and its case-law and that is as it should be."
"We support the Italian authorities."
"Statement by the President"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I think that the European Parliament possesses sufficient moral authority, as a constant defender of the rule of law and as a Chamber that has always condemned terrorism, to show support and solidarity with a Member State that strictly adheres to these rules, and that respects the independence of the judiciary and the implementation of its own laws."
"I therefore understand that I am responding to the requests that have been put to me by the vast majority of representatives of the political groups. These requests form a vigorous protest, on behalf of this Parliament, against the attacks the authorities of that country have been subjected to by no less than the Prime Minister of a third country."
"At the same time, they express your outright rejection of the procedure whereby a co-chairman of a committee addresses the Members of this House and poses what could be considered a threat to both their independence and freedom in exercising their mandate."
"Both aspects will be dealt with immediately."
"Mr President, Article F of the Treaty of European Union requires the Member States of the European Union to be democracies, a provision which has, if anything, been strengthened by the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"In the circumstances I am sure that the majority of this House would agree that the vote last night, in an unelected chamber ..."
"Mr Corbett, I say clearly that it is not up to this House to pass judgement on what the parliaments of our Member States do. They have their established powers."
"It is not for us to judge the use they make of them."
"I will not allow any further debate on this question."
"VOTES"
"Madam President, I am sorry to have to intervene so soon, but it says on my voting list that if we adopt Amendment No 9, then No 21 falls."
"Amendment No 21 addresses an issue which affects not only Mr Barón Crespo's report, but also Mr Sonneveld's and my own, that is whether the applicant countries are to be represented on the appropriate monitoring committee or not."
"The Committee on Regional Policy has advocated this."
"We believe that these countries should be involved in the committee, at least in an advisory capacity."
"We should be consistent across these three areas."
"If we reject No 21, then we should make a general statement to the effect that we do not want these countries represented on the committees."
"If we vote in favour here, that would support the view of the Committee on Regional Policy, and then we would have to say for all three: they are in."
"But this needs to be settled now, because it is here that it appears on the agenda for the first time."
"Mr Walter, I shall give the floor to Mr Barón Crespo."
"It may be that the request from the Green Group has created some confusion."
"That is why I should like things to be clear."
"I wanted to put to the vote first Amendment No 9 by the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"It seems to have been rejected, but we shall check that."
"If it had been adopted, we should have voted on Amendment No 19 by the Green Group as an addition."
"After that, I will of course put to the vote Amendment No 21 by the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"Is that how you see the matter, Mr Barón Crespo?"
"Madam President, you said before the vote that you would also be putting Amendment No 21 to the vote."
"The first phrase of this amendment ..."
"If Amendment No 9 had been rejected, Mr Walter, that is what I said."
"But it was adopted - the result was quite clear."
"Madam President, formally speaking, your conclusion might well be correct, but from a practical point of view, Amendment No 21 constitutes an addition, and I also think that it should be put to the vote, particularly as you said so yourself."
"Many Members want participation in another form, within the meaning of our amendment, and I think they are now expecting that amendment."
"That is why you have to put it to the vote."
"Mrs Schroedter, I did not say that I would put Amendment No 21 to the vote in any event."
"I said that I would put Amendment No 21 to the vote if Amendment No 9 was rejected."
"But it was adopted - that was the decision of the House."
"My personal view is that Amendment No 21 now falls."
"I shall consult the rapporteur and, if he shares my view, we shall move on to the following amendments."
"Madam President, I would like to ask the Commissioner, Mr van den Broek, if he still opposes Parliament's amendments, as he announced yesterday in the House."
"Madam President, I thought that after what I said in Parliament yesterday it was clear that there is one category where we have said: yes, we agree."
"There is also another category where we clearly respect the reasoning."
"But we do not yet want to formally support these amendments, because we have the feeling that the Council will perhaps make changes here and there to the way they are formulated with which we would be able to agree."
"I therefore believe that I must stand by what I said yesterday."
"Madam President, in view of the Commissioner's response, I would ask that, pursuant to Rule 60(2) of the Rules of Procedure, this report be referred back to the committee responsible."
"(Parliament decided to refer the matter back to committee)"
"Madam President, I would draw your attention to the fact that the Presidency has been somewhat inconsistent because by voting for Amendment No 16, Parliament has just contradicted what my report says, despite the fact that I had previously warned of this."
"Parliament has given its opinion as regards the committee's composition in terms of my report and has now just adopted a resolution that contradicts this."
"I would like the first vote to count."
"Madam President, given that Mr van den Broek did say yesterday that, while many figures could be accepted or incorporated, some important parts could not actually be adopted, I would request referral back to committee pursuant to Rule 60(2)."
"(Parliament decided to refer the matter back to committee)"
"Madam President, following the Commission's unsatisfactory response - that it is not prepared to accept Amendment No 1, on which we have just voted - I should just like to announce that, if the Commission has not changed its mind on Amendment No 1 by January, when we have the proper reading of this document, then we will propose that the report be referred back to the committee."
"I should like to make that clear here."
"In so doing, we are giving the Commission time to consider whether it might not rethink its position on Amendment No 1 by January."
"Before the final vote"
"(Parliament approved a request from the rapporteur for the matter to be referred back to committee)"
"Madam President, I would like to remind you once again that we are about to encounter a problem that I outlined in writing to the 'Steering Committee' and to the Presidency and that I repeated today."
"Madam President, I do not want to be held responsible for this."
"I understand that Amendment No 30 by the Committee on Agriculture, which is along the same lines as the one to which I previously referred, namely Amendment No 16 by the Committee on Regional Policy, has lapsed. If this is not the case, then the Hughes procedure and coordination we are involved in serve no purpose whatsoever."
"As I have already stated, I would ask the Presidency and its services to take this matter seriously and not to leave all the responsibility to the Member."
"I think that we should act in line with our rules."
"Mr Barón Crespo, it is not a question of shifting the responsibility on to someone."
"As you know, the House is sovereign, which is a principle of democracy."
"Madam President, I believe that Amendment No 30 deals with something different from what Mr Barón Crespo was just talking about."
"This is a consultative committee on which the EU Member States and the applicant countries have a representative, but it is a committee concerned with the preparation of projects and that is central to my report."
"This is most definitely different from what Mr Walter was just talking about."
"I would not therefore bring it under the same regulation as Mr Barón Crespo just mentioned."
"Madam President, I assume that this is not good news to the Commissioner, and that he has changed the position he announced yesterday."
"In that case I should like to request that the report be referred back to the committee responsible."
"Mr President, if we are going to try and get this vote through quickly, I suggest that the PPE, if they are going to continue to vote against their own amendments, actually have the courage to withdraw them before we go right the way through this session."
"It is ridiculous."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Mr President, I would also like to invoke Rule 60(2) of the Rules of Procedure and ask that this report be referred back to committee for two reasons: to be able to proceed to a second reading and to be able to initiate talks with the Council."
"I hope that the House will unanimously support this request."
"(Parliament decided to refer the matter back to committee)"
"Mr President, since Mr Fischler informed us last night, or rather very early this morning, after the debate, of the amendments which the Commission can on no account accept - and I assume that the position has not changed since then - I request that the report be referred back to the committee, pursuant to Rule 60(2)."
"(Parliament decided to refer the matter back to committee)"
"Mr President, in order to further lighten the work of fellow Members, our group has submitted a proposal to you to vote at the next part-session on Mr Ferri's report, which is now finished, rather than this week."
"I understand that most Members agree with this."
"It is a very complex report."
"(Parliament agreed to the proposal)"
"I propose that we vote on the remaining reports this evening, since we have already done a good deal of work."
"Mr President, in relation to the vote on the McCarthy report, I wish to say that my explanation concerns the Irish situation."
"We have been main beneficiaries of EU Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds and have used them very well over that period."
"As a result, we now have a very prosperous economy."
"However, we still lag a considerable way behind our European partners in terms of our infrastructure, in particular transport, telecommunications and environmental protection facilities."
"We still have enormous problems of social exclusion, especially in deprived urban and rural communities, and, indeed, underdevelopment."
"All these problems have to be tackled and for this reason I welcome the Commission's proposal that there should be no sudden end to funding from Brussels."
"This should be reduced gradually."
"However, I deplore the cynical manner in which the Irish Government has chosen to divide the country into regions for party-political purposes, with scant regard for the aim of structural funds which was to assist with economic and social cohesion."
"They are thereby depriving both the urban and rural poor of the full benefit of funds and, indeed, state aid."
"Mr President, on the McCarthy report. We voted against this report for the following reasons."
"Firstly, on Objective 2, we think it is inappropriate for unemployment to be the dominant criterion."
"It is essential to broaden these criteria, in particular with a view to protecting rural areas."
"Secondly, on Objective 1, the criterion put forward by the Commission must not be watered down or extended by the introduction of exceptions."
"Thirdly, we particularly emphasise our support for all those measures which will help to ease the pressure of making adjustments on regions bordering the CEECs."
"We therefore support the provisions seeking to adapt the Community initiative Interreg, but at the same time point out that this will only be able to make a limited contribution to providing the desired assistance."
"I voted in favour of this report in the final vote because I feel that, in the end, it does not compromise Portugal's specific interests in the negotiations on Agenda 2000, despite relevant factors with regard to economic and social cohesion."
"On the other hand, I voted against Amendment No 2, which calls into question the future decision-making capacity on the financial perspective. I also voted against Amendment No 5, which, following approval of Amendment No 7 - which I again voted against -, could lead to a restrictive reading of the Council's decision-making capacity concerning the regions in Objective 1."
"I would like to begin my comments by saying that I welcome the decision of the Irish Government this week to sub-divide the country for the purposes of drawing down EU Structural Funds during the year 2000-2006."
"It is only correct and sensible that poorer regions in Ireland should receive a higher proportion of European Regional and Social Funds to redress economic performance in all these areas."
"The benefits of Objective 1 status are very clear:"
"A higher proportion of European Regional Development Funds so as to redress the infrastructural deficit in the less well-off parts of Ireland.-A higher amount of state aid to be given to industry setting up in the Objective 1 regions in Ireland.-The fact that Objective 1 status in transition may be accorded to the poorer areas in Ireland post-2006.The fact that this decision has been taken will mean that the correct infrastructures will be put into place so as to win over a higher proportion of industry setting up in the Objective 1 areas in Ireland"
"Ever since the Single European Act was implemented in 1987, it has been clear that one of the core policies of the European Union is to ensure that all regions in Europe can effectively participate within the Single European Currency regime and within the internal market."
"I would like to commend the efforts of all the people involved in the process of lobbying for Objective 1 status for the poorest regions in Ireland for the next round of EU Structural Funds for the period 2000-2006."
"This will go a long way towards redressing the problems of rural depopulation in Ireland, which has reached very high proportions in recent years."
"I would like to thank the Members of the House for supporting my report today."
"I know that voters in my constituency in the East Midlands will be pleased to know that Parliament is supporting continued European funds to the rural, urban and industrial heartlands of our region where lower levels of unemployment mask underlying structural and social weaknesses."
"Indeed in accepting an additional two years of funding beyond the Commission proposal for areas going through restructuring, this will sustain the process, particularly in the coalfields and rural areas."
"I am particularly pleased that the release of the latest Eurostat figures indicates that four UK regions are on track to gain Objective 1 status."
"Although negotiations still have to be held and decisions taken next year the figures will form the basis of those negotiations."
"Merseyside, in the north west region, with a GDP of 72.54 % which falls within the 75 % threshold, has ongoing structural problems which mean the area will continue to need priority EU status."
"On Objective 1 status, Parliament has made it clear that any exception to the 75 % GDP application must be annexed to the regulation before we deliver our final assent on the Commission proposal."
"The House also voted in favour of a new 'Urban' Community initiative and a separate initiative for future crisis sectors or regions; a kind of 'Restruct' initiative."
"Manchester, Liverpool and Nottingham which have benefited from the Urban fund will be delighted to hear that Parliament has backed its continuation."
"As rapporteur I will now take forward this first reading position in our discussions with the Council and the Commission, and hope to achieve Parliament's priorities as outlined in the report."
"While we must recognise that standards of living have increased in Ireland due in part to the contribution of the European Union Regional, Social and Cohesion funds, I still believe that much work remains to be done if there is to be a quality of access and opportunity for Irish businesses, exporters and manufacturers to compete on an equal footing within the frontier-free trading block of the European Union."
"I welcome the acceptance of the European Commission of the need to introduce changes in European funding for Ireland on a gradual basis which is known as the 'soft landing' approach."
"The continuation of European funding after the present programme concludes next year is vital if we are to consolidate the strong economic growth rates of recent years."
"A sudden cut-off of European funding would risk provoking a major shock in our economy and in the process undermine recent gains."
"It is a priority for the government and for the Fianna Fail group of the European Parliament that the European Regional Development Fund and the European Cohesion Fund continue to apply in Ireland in as an extensive role as possible under the next round of funding 2000-2006."
"The reasons for this are as follows: our road infrastructure is still well short of the standards enjoyed by most regions of the Community; our peripheral location creates a greater need for relatively high levels of investments in ports and regional airport infrastructure; investment is required to meet compliance with the EU Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive which is going to cost £1.6 billion to implement in its totality between the year 1994-2005."
"Thirty-five per cent of all structural fund programmes in Ireland is presently spent in the areas of education and training under the European Social Fund."
"While this is likely to be reduced in part post-1999 priority must remain for the provision of better education and training facilities for those who lack the necessary skills or have difficulties in securing employment."
"The transition period proposed by the European Commission post 2000-2006 will ensure many important roads, environmental protection schemes, industrial, tourism and rural development projects will now be able to proceed as planned."
"This decision will means that more communities both urban and rural will be able to avail of European funding for projects to generate new jobs, improve the environment and guarantee continued economic growth."
"In the light of the European Union's enlargement process, the Commission's proposal for reform of the Structural Funds acquires a particular importance for the future of European citizens."
"We must confirm that the Union cannot be merely a large market that is given over to the excesses of liberalism, but that mechanisms are to be established for catching up and for keeping up; in short, for practising solidarity."
"We should not forget that regional policy is still an essential component in moving towards the Europe of citizens."
"We should therefore continue to work in that direction so that we may better understand the challenge of enlargement."
"The report before us today is the product of many hours of discussion and compromise solutions reached by our two rapporteurs, and I thank them for their work."
"We can support the general substance of the report, which incorporates the principles of concentration, simplification and decentralisation proposed by the European Commission. At the same time, it specifies certain eligibility criteria - youth unemployment, long-term unemployment, the level of GDP, and so on - particularly as regards Objective 2, and emphasises the need for transparency."
"These include the horizontal implementation of Objective 3, which is essential in achieving social cohesion, the provision of training and the fight against exclusion. Other important aspects are the maintenance of the URBAN initiative, which for the first time caters for small and medium-sized towns, the recognition of the need to draw up a new initiative to deal with the economic and social crises that lead to job losses, and the revision of the inappropriate and ill-defined 'performance reserve' envisaged by the Commission."
"Our opinion remains negative because, with regard to Objective 1, we have no wish to reopen Pandora's box."
"While we are aware that nobody can escape budgetary cutbacks, we maintain that aid should go to the weakest first."
"That is why in our countries we will no longer have regions with a development lag that receive European aid in this respect."
"We would like the criterion of 75 % to be stringently respected, and no exception should be made to this principle."
"Our opinion remains negative because we cannot, under any circumstances, allow appropriations from the guarantee section of the EAGGF that are used in connection with Objective 2 to be considered as non-compulsory spending, since that infringes the Treaty."
"And finally, our opinion remains negative because we would consider it to be harmful to our democracy if our Amendment No 46 to paragraph 53 of the resolution were not adopted by the House. In the interests of transparency, this amendment calls for an assurance that appropriations from the Structural Funds will be used in a non-discriminatory manner in the various regions involved."
"This is why, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the French Socialist delegation to the European Parliament will not vote in favour at first reading."
"The Agenda 2000 action programme cannot be dissociated from the Commission report on the system of own resources."
"It even seems more logical to first consider the reform of own resources, because that will condition the three programme areas: the budget, the agricultural policy and the Structural Funds."
"In the long term, the system of own resources should be given a new focus to make it fairer and more effective."
"That means giving up the VAT resource, which distorts the fair division of contributions among the Member States, and adopting one of the measures proposed by the Commission: the integration of a tax on earnings from securities into the own resources system."
"It does not appear that the other Commission proposals would actually increase own resources: the tax on CO2 would not generate a great deal, while harmonising corporation tax would involve substantial technical difficulties."
"Community measures concerning speculative capital movements, for which legislation will eventually have to be provided, might be added at a later date."
"The ultimate aim must be to ensure that all Member States pay a fair contribution based on the criterion of GDP per inhabitant."
"In the short term, it is time for certain European countries to stop advocating the theory of a fair return."
"Such a theory corresponds to a mercenary conception of the construction of Europe that would make the enlargement negotiations considerably more complicated."
"The fair return is, in effect, the antithesis of enlargement."
"It makes no sense to support the accession of countries that are far less developed in economic terms than the 15 Member States and to simultaneously reduce net flows within the Union."
"And what about the different areas of Agenda 2000?"
"As far as the budget is concerned, the ceiling of 1.27 % of the Union's GNP is a realistic figure under present conditions. It would not be possible to agree on an increase and this figure has the advantage of obliging the Union to undertake a more effective reform of current expenditure."
"Nonetheless, we might still wonder whether this position is realistic in the medium term, when the accession of the Baltic countries and Poland becomes imminent."
"The figure of 1.27 % cannot, however, be a definitive standard."
"In the meantime, this solution requires that ceilings be established for the agricultural and structural policies."
"Without such ceilings, there is a risk that no funds will remain for the policies that, in our view, deserve priority: research, employment, networks and foreign relations."
"As regards the agricultural policy, it is essential to avoid the major pitfall of revising the CAP in a manner that would carry the European Union towards a de facto renationalisation."
"Consequently, Member States should not be given excessive leeway in the use of funds."
"The success of the CAP reform will be measured by the extent to which it enables European agriculture to become competitive once more, without sacrificing the development prospects of rural areas."
"In other words, the economic dimension of agricultural activity must be enhanced, while simultaneously reconciling agriculture and society on the basis of a sustainable development model that respects the environment and that focuses mainly on the development of rural areas, product quality, consumer safety, respect for biodiversity and animal welfare."
"In the light of the enlargement to include the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the new European model will have to further decentralise its day-to-day management and substantially simplify its legal framework."
"Simplification and subsidiarity will be the key to the successful development of a new process of integration."
"In terms of the Structural Funds, the first two objectives are very different from the third."
"Their activities are focused on restricted geographical areas whose economic and social development is clearly below the average of the other areas of Europe, either because they are disadvantaged, or because they need to be converted."
"These regions are either subject to a development lag or industrial decline, or they are made up of rural or urban areas that are experiencing serious problems."
"Massive financial investment with a clear focus will seek to help these regions counteract the negative effects of an open market that is increasingly deregulated."
"The regions involved should be small enough to ensure that the impact is visible."
"Objective 3, meanwhile, is of a very different nature."
"Here, it is not a question of seeking a localised cure, but rather of triggering an overall movement in society through the development of human resources."
"It is a question of investing in people rather than in infrastructures."
"The development of human resources should play a central role in the European and national employment strategies. And the juxtaposition of a general, horizontal objective alongside vertical objectives that are focused on specific areas is to be welcomed."
"Thought should be given to the resources that are available for achieving such an ambitious objective."
"Although the motion for a resolution tabled by Mrs McCarthy and Mr Hatzidakis on the Structural Funds speaks of the 'horizontal nature' of this Objective 3, and considers that it should cover all areas of the Member States, there is reason to fear that lack of funds will cause the Objective to be confined, as suggested by the Commission, to only those areas that are not covered by Objectives 1 and 2."
"In my view, its most innovative aspect would thus be lost."
"We know that the disparities between Member States have increased in terms of both training and unemployment levels: one young European in five is unemployed and increasing numbers of families live below the poverty line."
"This is a decisive element as far as the competitiveness of regional economies is concerned."
"Such disparities, which are equally apparent in the fields of scientific research and technological development, cannot be tolerated in political and social terms and they undermine the position of the European Union in the light of global competition."
"I would therefore ask that Europe ensures that it has the resources needed to allow Objective 3, which must cover the entire territory of the Union, to be fully implemented."
"It is only when Europe has proved that it is able to resolve the major problems faced by our society, namely unemployment, poverty and exclusion, that public opinion will support, with total confidence, the strengthening and enlargement of the Union."
"People in the EU's less developed areas regard the review of the regulations governing the Structural Funds and in particular their funding from the Community budget with particular disquiet."
"Though the report by the Committee on Regional Policy confirms the proposed 0.46 % of Community GDP for structural activities between 2000 and 2006, since the matter remains outstanding nobody yet knows what the total funding for the Community budget will amount to during those years, and what contribution will be made by the Member States."
"The inadequacy of the amounts provided so far to close the gap between the less and more developed regions is evident, given that the desired result of real convergence is not only failing to be achieved, but even greater discrepancies are appearing, as confirmed for example by figures relating to my own country, Greece."
"While the sums provided are inadequate, and while the funding of the Community budget has still not been settled, to the Objective 1 countries are being added the most remote areas of the Community (from which, quite unreasonably, the Aegean islands are excluded) as well as the areas covered by the old Objective 6."
"At the same time, there is a looming risk that some areas in countries covered by the Cohesion Fund, where per capita income is lower than 75 % of the Community average, may be excluded from Objective 1."
"In other words, as we say in my country, 'a mouse carrying a pumpkin will not fit into its hole'."
"It is known that the required co-financing of projects covered by the Community programmes absorbs almost all the national resources available for development."
"From that standpoint, then, the proposal to increase Community participation from 75 % to 85 % is well founded."
"The fact remains, however, that because of the total absorption of national resources, the potential for applying any national developmental policy is decisively limited and necessarily moves within the framework of Community imperatives."
"To impose still greater control and obedience to the Community's choices, the Commission proposes to create a reserve amounting to 10 % of the appropriations and maintains that appropriations not used after 2 years should automatically be cancelled."
"Quite rightly, the Committee on Regional Policy rejects the proposal to create a reserve and also insists that appropriations unused after 2 years should remain available for the same country to which they were originally allocated."
"While Community funding could play a helpful part in bridging the gap between the less and the more developed parts of the Community, in essence they are a drop in the ocean, designed to throw dust in the eyes of the people of Europe, to buy off consciences and to create mechanisms for promoting the major monopolistic interests which are essentially the main beneficiaries of Community programmes, since they possess the necessary equipment and technical knowledge."
"It is known that a large part, if not the lion's share, of the amounts available for structural aid go back to the better developed Member States."
"We have decided to abstain in the final vote."
"We are among those who are critical of the EU's Structural Funds because they have not attained their objective of smoothing out regional differences."
"The bulk of the Structural Funds should be transferred to national level, where control and monitoring of standards is considerably tighter than appears to have been the case at EU level."
"There is a willingness on the Commission's part to simplify and refine structural support which we regard as a step in the right direction."
"The same remarks apply to a restriction on the number of Community initiatives."
"The European structural policy may have proved itself, but it is in need of reform."
"It is necessary to establish an appropriate structural policy for the next seven years, which will promote economic and social cohesion, while meeting the general requirement of greater efficiency and transparency."
"This is no place for thinking in terms of vested interests."
"The purpose of the European structural policy is to make it possible to close the gap between the Union's poorer and wealthier regions."
"By way of an example, I will simply mention the Cohesion Fund, which was created to help Member States experiencing particular difficulties to prepare for participation in economic and monetary union."
"If this aim has been achieved, then the Cohesion Fund has fulfilled its task."
"Any further funding for Spain, Portugal and Ireland from the Cohesion Fund is, therefore, neither justified nor - in view of the enlargement of the Union - feasible."
"' Innovative actions' are also encouraged through the aid granted by the Structural Funds."
"However, the number of projects submitted to the Commission often bears no relation to the number finally considered eligible for funding."
"This is due first and foremost to the low funding capacity."
"Between 1994 and 1999, 1 % of the Structural Funds' resources are set aside for innovative actions."
"I very much hope that Parliament will declare itself in favour of increasing these appropriations."
"These projects are of particular importance for individuals, clubs, associations and organisations in all the European Union's regions, because they are thus spared the often complicated and tedious alternative of going through the regional authorities."
"In addition, simply because Structural Fund appropriations are concentrated in the worst-affected areas of the Community, this should not mean that national support measures are permitted only in these regions."
"The European structural policy has brought us considerably closer to realising our aim of reducing the disparities between the levels of development and per capita incomes in the Member States and their regions."
"I am sure that the reform of the Structural Funds will further strengthen the social and economic cohesion between the regions of Europe."
"In the long term, Europe can only grow closer together if the existing economic and social disparities are permanently eliminated."
"An absolute condition for reducing the number of objectives and other changes to the Structural Funds is the transferral of the unaltered criteria for sparsely populated areas in Objective 6 to Objective 1."
"In addition, the criteria for Objective 5 should also be included, unaltered, within the framework of Objective 2."
"Furthermore, the conditions relating to sparsely populated and rural areas, which Sweden negotiated as part of its membership package, should not be undermined."
"Enhancement of the Structural Funds is of considerable significance as regards the process of widening and deepening within the European Union."
"In our view, reforming the Structural Funds contributes towards strengthening social and economic solidarity in Europe. It also has an important role to play in meeting the need for increased employment, emphasising the importance of sustainable growth, pursuing a tough environmental policy and enabling us to achieve solidarity between the rich and poor European regions."
"The Structural Funds are a financial instrument that serve to underline the EU's powerful coordinating role in areas where the wishes of European citizens can only be met through greater cooperation across national frontiers."
"In this respect, there is a need for reform of the Structural Funds."
"In particular, we think they should be concentrated on the areas needing most attention, that there should be three main objectives, and that their composition should be simplified."
"Furthermore, we think it is important that any expansion of the Structural Funds - and the same applies in the case of the common agricultural policy - should be adapted to meet the challenges that will be posed by the enlargement process."
"Reform of the Structural Funds should be regarded as an instrument for facilitating enlargement."
"Above all, we would like to stress the need for a financial ceiling of 0.46 % of GNP."
"In addition, structural support should be allocated in a flexible, horizontal and decentralised way in which there is plenty of scope for partnership as well as national, regional and local initiatives."
"Under Objective 1, the 75 % criterion should be strictly applied, and the previous Objective 6 criteria included under the new Objective 1."
"Objective 2 should apply to large conurbations, and Member States should not be given unlimited freedom to decide on the distribution of support measures."
"In our opinion, Objective 3 should be broadly based and allow for support for normal education."
"The Structural Funds should be subject to stringent financial rules."
"Our standpoint on these issues has served as a guide on how we should vote on the different proposals, while we still greatly respect the position of the PSE Group."
"We have decided to allow ourselves to be influenced as little as possible by strictly national considerations, since our remit as MEPs extends beyond Sweden's immediate interests."
"The following are some comments on our position as regards the organisation of the Funds, their size and distribution. These three aspects should be coordinated to coincide with the different obligations of the Structural Funds, but the proposals in the report and the amendments do not meet these requirements in every case."
"We have already mentioned that the financial ceiling must not exceed 0.46 %, so we have decided to support the amendment that corresponds to this objective."
"As for the rest of paragraph 2, which deals with financial calculations, we take this to mean that the proposal should not be interpreted as indicating a willingness to raise the financial ceiling."
"With regard to Objective 6 and its incorporation in Objective 1, we approve the amendment that is closest to our position on the inclusion of a population density criterion."
"Paragraph 6, as well as several other amendments, all refer to distribution in relation to population density."
"While we find this manner of distribution worthy of consideration, we do not think that the percentage allocations as specified, are appropriate in the present situation."
"On paragraph 31 and additionality, we think that the proposal to also take account of macroeconomic conditions is formulated in a way that makes it difficult to assess the work involved in carrying out the proposal."
"As regards continuing to consider the structural measures under Heading 2 as an expenditure target, we think that this should be discussed in more detail than in paragraph 46 and the related amendment."
"Amendment No 94 on evaluation is well-intentioned, but it should be noted that the proposed method of evaluation could lead to increased bureaucracy."
"We should also like to indicate that we do not support the proposal on signs as set out in paragraph 55."
"There should be signs, but their design should not be as strictly prescribed as in the report."
"We agree with the proposal on equal gender representation in monitoring and advisory committees."
"Finally, we especially approve of the proposal contained in the report regarding a strong role for the European Parliament."
"Ireland has been one of the main beneficiaries of the EU's Structural and Cohesion Funds over the last decade."
"EU support has helped turn the Irish economy around and create thousands of new jobs."
"As a result of our economic progress, Ireland has now reached average EU wealth levels."
"But we still lag a considerable way behind our European partners in terms of our infrastructure, particularly as regards transport and telecommunications, and environmental protection facilities."
"And we still have enormous problems of social exclusion, especially in deprived urban and rural communities, and underdevelopment."
"All of these problems have to be tackled."
"For this reason, I welcome the Commission's proposal that there can be no sudden end to funding from Brussels."
"This will have to be reduced gradually."
"This is likely to be the last occasion Ireland receives substantial financial support from the EU."
"This is not a sign of failure on Ireland's behalf but of success."
"It is a sign that we have made good use of the assistance we have received."
"But mistakes have been made."
"Too much has gone on golf clubs and marinas."
"We must not repeat this error."
"We must ensure that the next round goes to those who most need it, the deprived urban and rural communities across the country."
"These must be the absolute priority during the next round."
"The report forms part of the collective strategy for reforming the Union's structural support system."
"I have decided, in the main, to support the Social Democratic Group."
"I am pleased to note that the Structural Funds are more focused and directed towards the areas where support is needed, rather than being 'spread around' and ending up like a rebate from the Union."
"I am also glad to see that we are at last beginning to appreciate the potential problems that might arise in relation to structural and agricultural policies as a result of enlargement - a welcome development, in my opinion."
"The Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations wished to express its misgivings during the vote on the various reports on the reform of the Structural Funds."
"These misgivings do not relate so much to the reports as such or to the authors, whom we congratulate on their work, but to the Agenda 2000 proposals themselves."
"They are frequently incoherent, they are sometimes dangerous for the territorial balance of the Member States and they neglect the difficulties experienced by many European workers, particularly fishermen."
"During the debates, everyone concentrated on defending the interests of their region or their country, which is, of course, perfectly legitimate."
"Our German friends certainly appear to be the most skilled at this game: they claim, for the benefit of anyone who wants to listen, that they are net contributors to the budget of the European Community."
"Before demanding a reduction in their financial contribution, our German friends might do well to remember that the Community largesse bestowed on the former East Germany makes them the main beneficiaries of the regional policy."
"In addition, it would appear that the reform of the Structural Funds unfortunately neglects a number of issues."
"For instance, the regions that depend on fishing have been forgotten."
"Likewise, we might wonder about the implications of Agenda 2000 for the rural regions, which are among the most fragile regions in the European Union."
"In this respect, 9 % of the population of the Member States of the Union benefited from Objectives 5a and 5b; in the future, no more than around 5 % of the population will be eligible for such aid."
"A number of rural regions will cease to be eligible, at the very time when the reform of the CAP and the fall in agricultural prices are eroding the situation of our farmers."
"In France, 9.7 million people lived in areas covered by Structural Fund activities; in the future, that figure will be reduced to 7.1 million."
"Some 3 million French citizens who live and work for the most part in rural regions will suffer as a result of the new reform: 20 % of French territory will no longer be eligible for aid from the Structural Funds."
"We should remember in this connection that, following the GATT negotiations and the reform of the CAP, which had been highly detrimental, rural regions had obtained more ambitious structural aid measures by way of compensation."
"Today, the reform of the Structural Funds calls into question the geographical scope of these measures, even though the effects of the Uruguay Round and the fall in agricultural prices, exacerbated by the new reform of the CAP, are still being felt and increasingly so."
"This is blatantly inconsistent."
"What is more, the Structural Funds seem, in fact, to be a tool of federalist redistribution, whose objective is to make the recipient regions more and more dependent on the Commission, rather than allowing them to overcome their difficulties."
"We would like to take advantage of these debates to point out once more that, instead of indulging in the sterile scattering of public funds, the Union should concentrate its efforts on the existing common policies: the CAP and the CFP."
"Unfortunately, however, that is not the course that has been chosen, since some people are using this opportunity to try to garner a little more power, to the detriment of the nations and their local authorities, in contempt of the principle of subsidiarity and to the sole benefit of Brussels."
"We hear calls for 'the establishment of a European regional planning strategy' or even for the introduction of an 'integrated urban policy'."
"In this respect, it would be better in a general sense if, rather than constantly seeking to gain more powers, the European Union concentrated instead on assessing the repercussions of the existing Community policies, the decisions it makes or the negotiations in which it participates, both at WTO level and in the context of international agreements, on the balance of European territory with a view to doing away with their negative aspects."
"Indeed, it must be acknowledged that Community action has sometimes had highly damaging effects on economic and social cohesion, a matter people are all too ready to revel in, but one that should be resolved."
"Unfortunately, in the final vote I had to vote against, because"
"1.my Amendment No 47 on improving national support was rejected, and2.many additions were made to the proposals, which will ultimately overstretch the funding."
"Out of loyalty to our political group, we have decided that in the main we will keep to the PSE Group's voting list."
"We firmly believe that the Structural Funds are ineffective and should, to a large extent, be returned to the Member States in the form of reduced Union charges."
"A sizeable share, say 20 to 30 %, could be retained and the entire sum used to provide aid for the Eastern European countries, where there is a considerably greater need than in Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain."
"I am voting for this interim report as in my view it represents a sound response from this Parliament to the immensely complex and potentially controversial changes needed to the Regional and Structural Funds suggested in the Commission's Agenda 2000 plans."
"Given the concerns of people in areas which currently receive EU funding about their future status as we need to move towards funding the costs of enlarging to the East and South of Europe, the rapporteurs are quite right to call for the Regional Policy Committee to scrutinise the eventual list of eligible regions and any possible exceptions."
"Equally important is the report's argument for any regions which do in fact lose funding to be given a transitional period in which to adjust."
"In particular I applaud the rapporteurs' call for low GDP, wealth disparities within regions and any decline in the number of people of working age in a region to be included as factors taken into account alongside unemployment when judging which areas in future will be funded under the new Objective 2."
"If the Commission and Member States follow the fair and sensible approach advocated in this report, with transitional rather than overnight reductions in funding, calculated by a balanced set of criteria to decide which EU funding goes to which areas, I believe this would strengthen public understanding of the changes needed to secure the enlarged and more prosperous EU of tomorrow."
"We have voted against the report on the Cohesion Fund."
"The fund is intended to assist Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Greece to meet the convergence criteria in order to become integrated into EMU."
"It does not come under the EU's regional and structural funding, but is direct aid to those countries."
"As soon as they fulfil the EMU convergence criteria, the aid should be phased out."
"The countries that would then be entitled to subsidies should seek assistance from the EU Structural Funds."
"There must be an end to the everlasting aid which has already fulfilled its purpose."
"In the past, the EU's regional policy has unfortunately included many negotiating arrangements where secondary agreements have been set up to create forms of compensation other than those intended to smooth out regional imbalances."
"For example, the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) was established in 1975 to resolve the United Kingdom's budgetary problems, and not to iron out regional imbalances."
"Enlargement to include the new member countries of Central and Eastern Europe on the basis of the current support criteria implies either greatly increased contributions for countries like Sweden and Germany, or a smaller total amount of financial support for agriculture and rural development."
"A complete reform of agriculture is required that would increase labour and product costs and reduce subsidies."
"It is unacceptable and shows a lack of solidarity if the Central and Eastern European countries receive less aid than the rest of Europe."
"A reduction in EU subsidies with the possibility of more support at national level should be the way forward in the future."
"Agricultural subsidies in Sweden must be shared equitably between north and south."
"The Cohesion Fund is very important with respect to economic and social solidarity in Europe."
"The question of its future in relation to the countries that have qualified for EMU definitely needs to be discussed."
"Once the common currency has begun to play its part in strengthening European economic and social solidarity, then the future of the Cohesion Fund and its importance should also be reappraised."
"Therefore, we do not think that a direct connection can be made between meeting the convergence criteria and the possibility of receiving aid from the Cohesion Fund."
"Countries that have complied with the convergence criteria have undoubtedly performed well according to the macroeconomic indicators, but at the same time, this does not necessarily mean that complete social and economic cohesion has been achieved in and between those countries."
"We would also like to emphasise the need for effective financial management and control."
"I voted for this report because the specific vote rejecting the proposal to limit the Cohesion Fund to countries outside EMU, to discriminate against Portugal, was so overwhelming, with more than 300 votes against, that the minimum conditions have been created to prevent Portugal's exclusion from the Cohesion Fund and its benefits."
"The European Parliament is explicitly confirming the Commission's position to guarantee a more favourable position for Portugal's interests."
"The proposal for the Cohesion Fund included in Agenda 2000 - a document presented by the Commission in the middle of 1997 - states that the beneficiaries of this Fund should be countries that continue to have a GNP less than 90 % of the Community average, regardless of whether or not they participate in Economic Monetary Union."
"The Council's legal services later issued an opinion confirming, in the light of the Treaty on European Union, the eligibility for the Cohesion Fund not only of Greece - which is outside the single currency - but also of Spain, Ireland and Portugal - whose governments decided to join the euro."
"For us, there was never any doubt as to this question and we think that no Community institution has the legitimacy on this score to undermine the Treaty and the principle of economic and social cohesion on which the very creation of the Fund was based, and prevent Portugal from having access to the Cohesion Fund."
"The Collins report corroborates this view and we can, of course, vote in favour of it."
"In addition, and in keeping with what we have always contended, the report also questions the condition of meeting the convergence criteria to receive Fund money and also opposes the Commission's proposal that benefiting from the Fund means meeting the conditions of the Stability Pact."
"Obviously, we should emphasise the fact that maintenance of the Cohesion Fund for Portugal should not be seen as something of enormous importance but instead as a simple confirmation that this was conceded a long time ago in the negotiation process on the next Community support framework."
"We have therefore rejected the idea that maintenance of the Fund could be used as a smokescreen to conceal the real losses that Portugal might suffer in terms of the Structural Funds."
"The vital issue is now that of the changes in the government's negotiating stance, to solve the vital issue of increasing funds overall in order to tackle the new problems and burdens resulting from enlargement and prevent the financing of that enlargement from being carried out exclusively at the cost of the current cohesion countries, by jeopardising the very appropriations allocated from the Structural Funds."
"The European Commission's proposal did not aim to make any great operational changes to the EAGGF."
"The objective was to clarify and extend the scope of the Fund."
"As such, I indeed support the report as presented to us today."
"In fact, the additions contributed by the European Parliament reflect the evolution of the European Union's socio-economic development, of new technologies and of local services."
"These are a series of new areas that we believe should be covered by the EAGGF."
"Equally, the rapporteur considers that tourism and culture must both remain within the scope of the EAGGF."
"Indeed, these two sectors are of key importance for job creation: culture accounts for 3.1 million jobs in the EU, that is, 1.8 % of the working population."
"Also, in connection with the report by Mrs McCarthy and Mr Hatzidakis, I strongly support the maintenance of the URBAN initiative for the development of a European urban policy."
"Finally, it is essential that Parliament plays an active role in following up and monitoring the implementation of structural policies."
"For all these reasons, I will vote for the report as amended."
"We have decided to abstain in the final vote."
"We are among those who are critical of the European Regional Development Fund because it has not attained its objective of smoothing out regional differences."
"This type of funding should, in the main, be transferred to national level, where control and monitoring of standards is considerably tighter than appears to have been the case at EU level."
"There is a willingness on the Commission's part to simplify and refine structural support which we regard as a step in the right direction."
"We are also in favour of the proposal to highlight environmental issues and working for equality between men and women."
"We are unable to support the overall text of the proposal for a Council regulation laying down general rules for the granting of Community financial aid in the field of trans-European networks."
"The TENs programme is often portrayed as one which has been introduced to promote environmentally friendly forms of transport."
"Judged against this aim, one is bound to say that the programme has been a fiasco."
"The figures from Eurostat show that the transport sector has now overtaken industry as the largest single source of pollution in the EU."
"Another important part of the argument in favour of the TENs programme is that improving the infrastructure in the underdeveloped peripheral regions - in particular by connecting them to the key regions which are more developed - will help to bring them up to the economic level of the affluent regions in the centre."
"Here too, Eurostat's figures show that the difference between the richest and poorest regions in the EU is still as great as ever - in terms of prosperity, unemployment and so on - despite the fact that this programme has now been in existence for a number of years."
"The TENs programme is now being extended to cover the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, and the arguments being used to justify the TENs are exactly the same as those that were used inside the EU's borders."
"In reality, the TENs programme is first and foremost about ensuring that the EU's industry has the best possible access to its markets, including the new ones in Eastern Europe."
"The Danish Social Democrats have voted in favour of a reform of the Social Fund."
"With the new chapter on employment in the Treaty, there is a need for coordination between the Social Fund measures and the annual guidelines on employment."
"We have voted in favour of a number of changes to the Commission's proposal: provisions have been added concerning the need for sustainable development to be taken into account, emphasising the aspect of equal opportunities for men and women, and on interventions to benefit disadvantaged groups such as the long-term unemployed and handicapped persons."
"Not less than 15 % of the resources should be reserved for women, for example."
"We believe that all the Member States should be obliged to take action in the field of equal treatment."
"Even a country like Denmark, which has come a long way in integrating women into the labour market, must still be obliged to make a special effort in the area of equal treatment under the Social Fund."
"I have abstained from voting on the report on the European Social Fund, because the overall aim of the Fund is to help bring about social convergence in the Union."
"The ESF is therefore an instrument for creating what is in fact a European social policy and for promoting economic and social solidarity."
"The EU should not attempt to regulate the national systems of social and labour market policy, with a view to standardising the social security systems in the Member States."
"Social and labour market policy must continue to be a national matter."
"A series of judgements and assessments are presented in the report regarding Social Fund measures designed to promote equal opportunities for people to be integrated into the labour market, strengthen systems of education and increase the participation of women in the labour market."
"The Fund is also to encourage local and regional initiatives on employment."
"In the longer term, these measures are intended to help reduce the differences between the levels of development of various regions in the EU."
"These initiatives all have some positive features, but the problem is that these efforts are linked to the establishment of a European social policy and the promotion of the social dialogue, which are ultimately meant to contribute to the establishment of a common European labour market policy."
"At the same time, the report also contains moves towards the coordination of Community instruments in education policy."
"I agree that underdeveloped regions throughout Europe should be supported."
"It is also important to promote equal opportunities for people, so that they can be integrated into the labour market, but this should take place without any political undertones, and not as part of a strategy designed to bring about social convergence in the EU."
"We welcome the current revision of the European Social Fund, not least in respect of the new chapter on employment in the Amsterdam Treaty."
"The European Social Fund plays a very important role in employment strategies, since it supports and complements the strategies carried out at national level."
"Previous experience of lower contribution payments to non-governmental organisations, as well as within the Peace initiative, has proved successful."
"We therefore support the proposal, which aims to prioritise local projects in Social Fund programme planning activities."
"My vote on this issue took into account the position on the proposal to cofinance income support out of national budgets, as suggested, in particular, in point 8 of the joint motion for resolution by the PSE and Green Groups."
"I voted against that option - whose impact on the CAP has yet to be determined - because, in my view, it boils down to anticipating the decision on the financial perspective in accordance with one of the Commission's proposals for solving the alleged problem of the excessive contribution by certain Member States."
"In other words, the proposal sets out to correct the situation in Germany's favour and, in particular, to the detriment of France's current Community budget situation, but without safeguarding the situation of other Member States such as Portugal."
"They could be penalised in terms of agricultural expenditure or even their overall receipts from the Community budget."
"Fundamentally, this option would unacceptably make negotiations rely on the issue of own resources and confine Portugal's negotiating position both on Agenda 2000 and on the financial perspective."
"I supported the excellent proposals to reform the CAP contained in the resolution by the PSE and Green Groups and I hope that they will be endorsed."
"A further integration of environmental initiatives must be included in any new revised common agricultural policy for the post-1999 period."
"I believe that the EU's goals of sustainable development, integration of environmental protection with agricultural initiatives and the recognition of farmers as guardians of the countryside must be made central concerns of the common agricultural policy."
"Most parties are in favour of a further integration of environmental policy objectives into the CAP."
"However, positive environmental results must be measured and rewarded."
"In order to do justice to the role of the farmer in caring for the countryside, a further principle should be added, namely the principle that the steward is remunerated."
"Farmers must be supported by the European Union in bringing about more environmentally friendly farming practices in the form of direct payment supports."
"We already know of the success to date of the Rural Environment Protection scheme started in 1994, whose aims include the establishment of farming practices and controlled production methods which reflect the increasing public concern for conservation, landscape protection and wider environmental problems."
"The Rural Environment Protection scheme is also designed to assist in the production of quality food in the extensive and environmentally friendly manner."
"This scheme must go from strength to strength and it was worth over £101.4m alone in 1997."
"Under the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry for the period 1997, £67.176m was allocated for direct on-farm investment."
"This sub-programme was broken down as follows: improvement of dairy hygiene standards, £11.252m; improvement of animal welfare standards, £149 000; farm improvement programme, £8.769m; control of farm pollution scheme, £47.006m."
"This programme has contributed substantially to reducing pollution on our farms as well as promoting environmentally friendly farming."
"I support an expansion of EU assistance for on-farm investment in any new arrangement under the common agricultural policy for the period post-1999."
"Environmental concerns are becoming increasingly important in EU policies in general."
"However, incentives and support arrangements must be in place through the European Union so that any changes in this sphere are brought about in a cost effective manner."
"Rural areas are increasingly used by many people for leisure and recreational purposes."
"Farmers receive no financial reward for maintaining and shaping the countryside."
"Discussion should take place on these issues with farming organisations and with the Irish Government and the European Commission so that any changes which are brought about command the goodwill and the support of Irish farmers and national and European authorities."
"I voted against the Fantuzzi resolution on Agenda 2000 and the reform of the CAP because in paragraph 8, the rapporteur actually claims that cofinancing is not meant to solve the problems and meet the needs of agriculture but to deal with the issue of the Member States' budget contributions."
"I regret having had to vote against an otherwise excellent document on agricultural policy because the matter of financing the Community budget should be discussed at the right place and at the right time, with complete openness and transparency."
"The review of the CAP in 1992 led to a large reduction of the Community budget amounts available for agriculture and to the annihilation of small and medium-sized family holdings, mainly in southern parts of the Community."
"As a result, the numbers of holdings and people employed have been greatly reduced, the proportion of unemployment in rural areas has rocketed, and the rate at which the countryside is being deserted has increased to dangerous levels."
"The new proposals put forward on European farming by the Commission in Agenda 2000 are perhaps the most representative indication of the EU's overall intentions as regards its model of development."
"The agricultural sector bears the brunt of the changes dictated by the medium-term strategic plans of monopolistic capital, since it is one of the most critical sectors for the shaping of the new economic landscape and the distribution of world markets."
"The questionable argument in favour of continual cuts in the section of the Community budget devoted to agriculture, which the Agenda 2000 proposals and those for the review of the CAP put forward, is actually - and now quite openly - calling into question and undermining the decisive developmental role which agriculture has played up to now in most parts of Europe."
"The EU is continually eroding its existing agricultural potential since its declared aim, besides saving resources, is both to prepare for the predatory enterprise of enlargement towards the central and eastern European countries and to secure further possibilities for responding - with customary subservience to the USA's demands - to the new established order of the World Trade Organisation from 2000 onwards."
"We have in our hands proposals which are contradictory, dangerous, without any balance between the human factor, production and land, proposals which aim to reduce the agricultural population still further, cut prices and production costs for the sake of competition, and in general replace intervention by help to accumulate private stores."
"Those proposals will not only cause imbalances in production but will also constitute a direct threat to product quality, environmental equilibrium, farm employment and social balance and cohesion."
"Furthermore, this proposal heralds flagrant and impermissible intervention in the budgets of Member States by introducing conditions of subservience with the compulsory co-financing of direct aid by the Member States."
"This not only goes against the provisions of the Treaty, but indirectly paves the way for a substantive transfer of commitment expenditures to the budgets of the Member States - without the consent of the national parliaments - for policies and decisions laid down by the EU."
"In the name of an unreasonable rationalisation which runs contrary to any concept of solidarity, renationalisation is being advocated with excessive hypocrisy and demagogy, though it will only relate to expenditure, while the Community will continue to have the exclusive right to determine every detail of the CAP - quotas, price and export subsidies, duties etc. without leaving any scope for flexibility or for the Member State itself to define its own agricultural policy."
"In other words, 'heads we win, tails you lose'!"
"We categorically oppose this Commission proposal and there is no margin whatsoever for its 'better management', as some people are saying in order to make it look better and more 'digestible'."
"It is our duty, both to the farmers and for the sake of social equilibrium, to prevent the evils prescribed by the proposal."
"We must resist and avert a policy which is opposed not only by farmers in the EU but by all working people who will bear the brunt of this anti-agricultural EU policy which aims to use the budget resources of the Member States, and this in the context of a policy of financial discipline and strict austerity."
"Parliament's view is that it is extremely important for the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy to be harmonised with the interests and wishes of the large majority of the population, who are now certain to escalate their efforts to frustrate and avert this policy."
"The way I voted on the whole of this resolution was conditioned by the introduction of the idea of cofinancing. This does not seem to be a problem concerning the CAP but one that has been created to deal with certain countries' financial contributions to the budget."
"Had the principle of cofinancing not been defeated by the European Parliament, considerable limits would have been put on Portugal's freedom to negotiate on Agenda 2000, and the aim of maintaining the same volume of Community financial support for the next framework, as a result of Agenda 2000, would have been diluted."
"Therefore, I consider the overall result of these votes highly satisfactory."
"The voting behaviour of the Liberal Group has been strongly influenced by its conviction that in the future it would be desirable to have cofinancing with Member States of those items of agricultural expenditure that concern income support."
"The reasons for this have been explained in various speeches by members of the group in debates on agricultural policy."
"The Liberal Group therefore voted against all those amendments that concerned this cofinancing of agricultural expenditure."
"It voted in favour of the PSE-V Group resolutions because of its conditional approval of income support despite the fact that the resolution contained various phrases (conditionality of the various support measures) that did not all reflect the position of the Group."
"For the same reason it also voted for the PSE resolution and when both of the above resolutions were rejected it of course voted against the UPE and EDN resolutions."
"As was to be expected, the ELDR Group voted in favour of all the articles of its joint resolution with the PPE."
"When the final vote came it had to decide if it would vote in favour of the resolution despite the fact that paragraph 14 with its clause on cofinancing was defeated."
"A majority of the Group take the view that it could still vote in favour, as with the adoption of paragraph 13 the discussion on the financing of the common agricultural policy can continue, especially in the light of the various votes on the oral questions which indicated that those amendments that rejected cofinancing were defeated outright by a very large majority."
"I will be using my vote to condemn a Community agricultural policy that basically adheres to a rationale of reducing prices and lowering the value accorded to labour, a policy that is so destructive that it calls into question the CAP itself by proposing the cofinancing of agricultural spending."
"If the desire exists today to meet the aspirations of the people who have condemned the ultra-liberal policies, then existing policies must not be eliminated."
"Not only should the CAP be maintained and reformed, but it should also be given a new direction."
"The broad outlines of this new direction have already been outlined by the House."
"It supports the concept of 'a high level of employment', including in agriculture."
"It intends to provide safeguards against the race for productivity."
"It wishes to meet the new challenges facing mankind in the areas of food, energy, the environment, water supply and sustainable development."
"We already have the principles in the form of the single market, financial solidarity and the Community preference, which may be renewed."
"This involves substantial public funds that must not be used to produce surpluses that are sold cheaply on the international market. Instead, they are to be used, above all, to meet the Union's internal needs, to provide each production sector with the means to manage the market, to correct the injustices between farmers, types of products, regions and countries, and to develop international trade that is of mutual benefit."
"Other funding could be created with cheap credits allocated selectively for employment, productive investment and sustainable development, with taxation on financial movements and with the tools to ensure the fair distribution, by sector, of the wealth generated between agricultural production and consumption."
"That might be a genuine alternative policy."
"Five million farming jobs have been lost in the EU between 1980 and today."
"The proportion of unemployment in rural areas is higher than in urban areas, and the countryside is being deserted ever more rapidly, with young people as the first to go."
"That is the dramatic situation to which the catastrophic policies implemented have led the countryside and the farming economies of the EU's Member States."
"And now we are talking about even worse measures, whose exclusive aim is to accelerate the rate at which agricultural activity is being abandoned by small and medium-scale farmers, so that land and production will be concentrated in the hands of fewer and fewer people."
"This policy is laying the ground for a new feudalism and we are sorry that although the rapporteur himself recognises the dramatic situation, his report and amendments only oppose it symptomatically and he attempts to correct the letter of the regulation but does not touch, oppose or try to alter its spirit."
"On the other hand he unleashes a potential storm by giving his blessing to the opening of the countryside to alternative activities, not only by farmers but by anyone else who wants to 'make something' of the scorched earth left behind by catastrophic and anti-agrarian policies."
"The rapporteur forgets, and is also trying to persuade farmers to forget, that the countryside, the farming areas in which 25 % of the EU's population live, are closely interwoven with farming and livestock breeding, and that farmers are indissolubly bound to the land and to their work."
"What matters is not to reorientate, or rather, disorientate farmers by covering up and whitewashing hostile policies."
"Within the framework of a now unashamedly anti-agrarian policy whose chief aim is to accelerate the reduction of the farming population, is it not Pharisaic to talk about being interested in employment in the countryside?"
"Is it not pure hypocrisy to make proposals for dealing with the problems of poverty zones when everyone agrees with the overall policy which creates the poverty zones in the first place?"
"Is it not contradictory to make proposals about incentives to regenerate the agricultural population while continual quota reductions virtually debar young people from taking up farming?"
"Is it not hypocrisy to proclaim interest in environmental protection while traditional crops are being extirpated and genetically modified crops are accepted even before serious and detailed research has been carried out and completed on their environmental impact and their consequences for the consumer, solely because that is what the multinationals which produce genetically modified reproducing species dictate?"
"How is the wishful thinking about the countryside's prosperity to be realised when the financial resources available are continually being cut?"
"What European farmers expect and demand is that we should do all we can to defend their right to continue their activities without interruption and under the best possible conditions, and their right to make a decent living from those activities."
"That aim will not be achieved by hypocritical half-measures and placebos."
"It will be achieved by their own struggle, the struggle they are developing for example in my own country even as we speak, and which we support unreservedly."
"For that reason, we will vote against the proposed Council Regulation and the report, which despite the few positive points it contains, does not dare to reverse the overall anti-agrarian content of the proposal as it ought to."
"We are voting against the report relating to support for rural development through the EAGGF."
"The Commission has not gone far enough in its proposed agricultural reform within the framework of Agenda 2000."
"We have generally abstained from voting on forestry policy, because we do not think it is appropriate to deal with forestry at Community level."
"It makes sense to have an instrument, independent of the arrangements for supporting production or those for overhauling infrastructures directly linked to farming activity, to support other activities very closely related to agriculture and used mainly by farmers."
"These would include forestry activities, fire-fighting, and environmental and landscape protection, which, if developed integrally, could help in the fight against rural desertification and bring about economic diversification in the countryside."
"This instrument could also help to reduce some serious, well-known imbalances."
"All of these aims are set out in the justification for the Commission's proposal."
"There is also an appropriate proposal to introduce some uniformity into the patchy and rather unknown regulation on this question."
"However, these good intentions are contradicted by the proposals that have actually been made."
"This instrument does not have at its disposal the financial resources needed to tackle the problems that it sets out to solve. In particular, it seems that it will not even have at its disposal resources to be withdrawn from other areas of the agricultural policy, which in themselves are already underfunded."
"For agro-environmental measures, it establishes a regulation that really seems to be a measure to help the farms and finances of certain Member States, small in number, in the centre and north of the European Union."
"The report does nothing to change the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development-environmental guidelines nor does it eliminate the apparent aim for people or bodies not directly related so far with farming to benefit from this instrument."
"They should be given support in a different way and not through this instrument, which should exclusively be at the service of farmers."
"There are positive aspects in the report as a result of the amendment that we tabled, for example, the doubling of compensatory amounts per hectare or possible assistance with investment in State or common (fallow) land. The recognition of specific regional needs and the call for improving the balance between Mediterranean and continental crops are also positive."
"However, the overall resources remain insufficient and the basic guidelines have not been changed."
"That is why we abstained in this vote."
"The report forms part of the collective strategy to reform the EU structural support funds."
"Out of loyalty, we have decided to support the bulk of the PSE Group's proposals."
"However, we firmly believe that the Agricultural Fund should be phased out and the money returned to the Member States."
"A sizeable share - 20 to 30 % - could be retained by the Union and the entire sum used to provide aid for the Central and Eastern European countries, where there is greater need for financial support than in the Mediterranean countries, which already have a perfectly acceptable standard of living."
"I welcome the fact that the European Commission is proposing to include agricultural structural measures in a framework regulation."
"This will make it possible to better coordinate the various instruments."
"In the Commission's proposals this is largely a matter of continuing and improving the existing measures, and we broadly agree with this."
"In particular, I believe the support measures designed to encourage agriculture to adopt more environmental and natural farming practices are very important."
"In his draft report the rapporteur sought to extend the present measures, which are mainly aimed at developing agricultural structures, to other rural activities."
"His amendments were rejected by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"As far as we are concerned this took the sting out of the report and at the final vote we were able to vote in favour."
"Rural policy must remain primarily the responsibility of national and regional government."
"They are better equipped for this than the European Commission which has a limited capacity to implement and is not close to the problems in the regions."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.05 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Displaced persons"
"The next item is the report (A4-0399/98) by Mr Wiebenga, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs, on"
"I.Amended proposal for a Joint Action on the temporary protection of displaced persons (COM(98)0372 - C4-0505/98-97/0081(CNS))II.Proposal for a Joint Action concerning solidarity in the admission and residence of beneficiaries of the temporary protection of displaced persons (COM(98)0372 - C4-0506/98-98/0222(CNS))."
"Mr President, the proposal for joint action on the temporary protection of displaced persons is a good one."
"It would apply to cases where a large number of people must all be offered sanctuary at the same time with the result that, in such an emergency situation, normal asylum procedures cannot be applied."
"An amendment brought by the European Parliament establishes that these arrangements simply supplement the treaty on refugees rather than replacing it."
"An interesting procedure is involved here."
"This is the first time the European Commission has used its right to initiate legislation under the third pillar."
"On this second reading the Commission - Commissioner Gradin who is here today - has accepted many of the European Parliament's amendments."
"I would say the most important of these is the introduction of a five-year limit to the temporary protection and above all the burden-sharing between the various Member States."
"These changes, and I say this in the framework of the third pillar, are a feather in the cap for the European Parliament."
"So much for the positive comments."
"Now the day-to-day reality."
"It is incomprehensible and irresponsible that the European Union, that is the Council of Ministers where the third pillar is involved, has still not established any fair system for sharing the burden of displaced persons or for receiving them."
"We all know that this is too late for the displaced persons of Bosnia."
"They were and still are dependent on the benevolence of a few Member States, namely Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden, while others have done much less."
"Things are quiet in Kosovo at present, fortunately, although the situation there is of course very tragic in humanitarian terms."
"But if, God forbid, things get out of hand there again and large numbers of Kosovans come to the European Union, then we will find once again that nothing has been arranged at European level."
"The same is true if major problems arise anywhere else which lead to a massive influx of people, such as in Algeria for example."
"The question is which Member States in the Council of Ministers are not prepared to cooperate in drawing up such a system."
"I hear rumours that they include Spain, France and the United Kingdom, but we cannot be certain as the Council meets behind closed doors."
"I should like greater clarity from the Commissioner on this."
"Much remains to be done in the field of asylum and immigration policy."
"The Eurodac data exchange takes much too long."
"There are no agreements on external border controls."
"There is no common return policy."
"The Council of Ministers has found itself in an impasse over recent years."
"This is why the Liberal Group also believes it is a good thing that the Austrian Presidency has now taken the initiative to move towards a more systematic approach to asylum and immigration policy, in particular in the light of the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"But under that Treaty the European Commission itself is going to have to do more and my view is that the present department, with the number of officials available to Commissioner Gradin, is much too small for the European Commission to be able to take the necessary action after the Treaty of Amsterdam enters into force."
"I would be interested to know if there any plans to improve matters in this respect."
"The proposals for joint action for the protection of displaced persons look reasonable now that a number of Parliament's amendments have been adopted."
"The second field of joint action, namely in relation to burden-sharing, represents major progress, because last year there was no such proposal for a regulation on the table."
"Our parliamentary committee also believes that the method of this burden-sharing must be very different from that proposed by the European Commission."
"First must come the balanced distribution of displaced persons between the Member States and only then the matter of financial compensation."
"The Council of Ministers is already much too late."
"If we once again fail to achieve a speedy decision because a couple of Member States refuse to cooperate then an alternative solution must be sought and those Member States who are indeed prepared to assume their responsibilities must work together in a coalition of the willing."
"Mr President, in some national parliaments the asylum and refugee debate is plagued by a populist game appealing to xenophobic sentiments in the hope of scoring electoral points."
"There is none of this in Mr Wiebenga's report."
"He clearly sticks to traditional liberal principles, adopts the right tone and shows concern for the fate of displaced persons."
"The improvements he brings to the two Commission proposals make these even clearer and more humane."
"The rapporteur rightly favours a strengthening of Parliament's role."
"In addition, he seeks a stronger legal basis for refugee policy and, like most of us, he is trying to avoid dependence on a unanimous vote in the Council."
"The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy finds it interesting that he partly attributes the phenomenon of mass displacement to the Council's deficient foreign policy."
"He thus supplements the rules for sharing responsibilities which the Commission wants to introduce by considering the efforts which Member States could make to prevent the massive displacement of persons, such as military intervention and other conflictprevention measures, as part of this shared responsibility."
"These are very laudable additions to the Commission's already praiseworthy attempts."
"Yet the rapporteur still has to wrestle with the same dilemma which confronted the Commission."
"Over recent years the Council has certainly repeatedly given the impression that it is aware of the need for a real sharing of the burden or responsibility for the protection of displaced persons. But when it comes to the crunch the Council remains powerless."
"The Commission is seeking to find a way out of this by splitting its proposal into a part which can win the support of the Council and a part which cannot."
"Each time the need for unanimity serves as an alibi for Member States to whom European solidarity means nothing, yet which these same Member States are so prone to invoke when it is purely their own interests which are at stake."
"I wonder whether or not it could be possible to compensate for the refusal to share responsibility out of some European Union fund or other."
"You cannot dine à la carte at the EU table."
"The call for the abolition of solidarity from Member States who have no desire to share the burden of this European issue falls on very receptive ears in the many countries which contribute to the Union."
"I regret this."
"The unwilling Member States are in fact sawing off the branch they themselves are sitting on."
"It seems from his explanation that the rapporteur has serious doubts about the way in which the Commission is resolving its dilemma."
"The question is whether much progress can be made before the Treaty of Amsterdam enters into force."
"Is the Commission's solution not a self-deception by which we give the Council a loincloth to hide its shame?"
"Mr Nassauer will be making the necessary comments on this on behalf of the European People's Party."
"I believe that because each action first has to overcome the barrier of unanimity, the Commission is not giving us much at all."
"I would like to warn against allowing ourselves to be caught up in a game which simply allows the Council to offload its problems onto us."
"Mr Wiebenga's idea to try to make the most of it nevertheless is very laudable."
"The way in which he has formulated this in his report is also excellent."
"But I also believe that many people share his doubts as explicitly expressed in his explanation."
"Although we appreciate the work he has done on his report, this doubt remains with us all and we have no choice but to draw the consequences."
"Mr President, I hope you have been informed that I have an additional four minutes from Mr Schulz."
"I am pleased that Mrs Gradin - the Commissioner dealing with this issue - is with us here today."
"I always think it is very important for Commissioners to attend debates."
"I should, however, like to express my own frustration and that of my group at the report being constantly rescheduled this week."
"We do not agree that we should be discussing this report at a time when all Members believe that we should actually be discussing topical and urgent matters, and not such an important political issue as this."
"This is about refugees entering the Union, refugees who are treated disgracefully and shabbily; we always feel that they are too much for us, that we do not have room for them, and that we would actually rather ensure that we rid ourselves of these people as quickly as possible."
"This is reflected somewhat in the way in which we are dealing with this debate here."
"This debate is taking place when many colleagues are prevented from being here by other appointments."
"It is a fact that the topical and urgent debate does not concern everyone and, as a result, other appointments are arranged, at a much earlier stage than our debates are."
"That explains why too few Members are here."
"I must also apologise on behalf of several colleagues from my own group - who actually wanted to contribute to this debate - for their not being able to be here either, because they made alternative appointments some time ago."
"This is true of the chairman of our committee, who is usually always present when debates involving our committee are being held in the plenary, and takes part in the debate."
"Unfortunately, she cannot participate today because she too has another long-standing appointment, which could not be further postponed."
"I should like to warmly congratulate Mr Wiebenga on his report."
"Admittedly, there are a few points on which we disagree straight away, but he is aware of that."
"Above all, however, I believe that it is important to make sure that the report is ready before the Council meets in December, so that Parliament is able to make its views known on the Commission's amended proposal and to vote on it."
"Since the war in former Yugoslavia, the European Union has been faced several times with admitting large numbers of refugees from various regions, and in particular recently - as Mr Wiebenga also mentioned - from Iraq and Algeria."
"The European Union has never had an instrument which firstly includes solidarity measures to make it easier for Member States to admit refugees and, secondly, offers bureaucratic protection."
"The tragedy of the refugees from Kosovo has once again revealed the inability of our governments to respond to events of this kind in a way which is commensurate with their own professed standards of morality and human rights."
"Now refugees from Kosovo are being detained at the Union's external borders as illegal immigrants, and are also very often treated as criminals."
"This cannot and must not continue."
"We want to be able to continue to offer sanctuary in the European Union to those fleeing from armed conflict, sustained violence, or systematic or widespread violations of human rights."
"We believe it is right for all present and future Member States to contribute to fulfilling this humanitarian commitment."
"Ethnic or religious persecution can, however, also constitute grounds for refugee status."
"In my group, in any event, we agree that these grounds should also be accepted."
"This is also shown in the draft own-initiative report produced by my colleague, Mrs Lindeperg, which we will soon be debating."
"We are not disputing the fact that a restrictive interpretation of the Geneva Convention on Refugees has led to a gap in the protection offered to refugees of civil war in Europe."
"This must be closed, but not exclusively by means of the measures now on the table."
"I would therefore ask you to vote in favour of certain parts of the text originally proposed by the Commission, because we believe that some of the points it contains are better than some of the amendments."
"It makes absolutely no sense, in the event of a mass influx, actually to have a joint action offering refugees protection in the Union, and yet alongside this not to make any arrangements for how these people are actually going to reach the Union."
"Once the Member States have resolved to apply the joint actions, it is only logical that they should then disregard visa restrictions and dispense with the principle of safe third countries."
"On burden-sharing, the Commission's proposal gives priority to balancing out the financial burden over balancing out the distribution of people."
"I could also go along with this approach, precisely because of what we saw with the refugees in Germany: many came to Germany because they had personal contacts there, because they knew the language, because they had already been there as migrant workers, and had thus found sanctuary with families."
"They had become integrated to a certain extent through their knowledge of German, which meant that they were able to support themselves and earn their own living."
"I doubt whether this would have been possible in the same way if we had, from the outset, forcefully transported these people to an area where they did not have contacts of this kind, for example."
"Refugee quotas seem, therefore, on the basis of previous experience, to be rather counter-productive, and balancing out the financial burden is the right way forward."
"I do, however, endorse my group's opinion that it is possible, either before or when the refugees arrive, to allocate them to individual Member States."
"However, this requires very thorough planning, so as not to cause great personal and financial damage to the refugees, on the one hand, and to the citizens of the European Union on the other."
"Finally, I should like to say that I hope that the Council will soon be adopting practical proposals on how this is to be done."
"Mr President, having heard Mrs Zimmermann's speech, I cannot help wondering whether she was giving the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs, as announced, or whether she was speaking on behalf of the Socialist Group."
"I should like to ask Mrs Zimmermann to clarify that point."
"Mr President, I did say at the beginning that I would take the four minutes allocated to Mr Schulz, and I therefore spoke both for the Committee on Legal Affairs and for my group."
"Mrs Zimmermann, I think Mr Nassauer will have been satisfied by your answer."
"Mr President, I suppose I have four minutes' speaking time and I should like to make it immediately clear to Mr Nassauer that I will be speaking on behalf of the Socialist Group and not for any committee."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am very relieved that the European Parliament is after all managing to deal with the Commission proposal for temporary status during this part-session, because it must be clear to us all that time is very short."
"While everybody recognises that the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo are still being persecuted, that there has been a major political problem for many years and a war is being fought on Kosovan territory, there is still no European agreement to protect refugees from these areas."
"Yet all our Member States are confronted with the most harrowing circumstances of these refugees."
"Fleeing Kosovars are being plucked from lorries by the dozen and in some cases the Member States assume their responsibilities and initiate asylum procedures."
"In many other cases, people are simply expelled or abandoned to their fate."
"The only response which the Schengen countries could come up with when boatloads of Kurdish refugees arrived on the Italian coast, for example, was to call Italy to order and promptly close the borders."
"So I believe that it is high time the Union Member States assumed their joint responsibility and together approved this temporary status for displaced persons."
"Ladies and gentlemen, a number of warnings would not be amiss in this debate."
"First of all, this temporary status is intended to protect refugees and to grant them social rights solely in cases when the massive influx renders it impossible to handle individual asylum applications within a reasonable time-frame."
"It must not be the intention to use this so-called B status, which gives refugees fewer rights, in order to undermine the A status conferred under the Geneva Convention."
"Let us be very clear on this: the broad and humanitarian interpretation of the Geneva Convention has not been superseded, as the Austrian Presidency said with a slip of the tongue in its first document, but on the contrary also covers most situations of displaced persons, inter-ethnic conflicts and civil war."
"The problem lies principally with the European Council which in March 1996 itself gave a restrictive definition."
"This is why the European Parliament is sticking to the right of refugees to submit an individual request for asylum despite the temporary protection."
"Secondly, we believe that the temporary status must necessarily be coupled with solidarity among Member States in accepting the refugees."
"Not only financial solidarity, but above all solidarity in practice by actually agreeing to take the refugees."
"We naturally assume here that the Council is where the stumbling block lies in approving the proposal."
"Many Member States would prefer to buy an easy conscience, preferably by using money from the European refugee fund, than to actually accept the refugees."
"The Commission has nevertheless deemed it useful to separate the two proposals in order to give the proposal a chance of success."
"I now understand that Mr Nassauer and the PPE Group apparently want to recombine the two proposals in one text."
"This will certainly have an effect one way or another."
"Mr Nassauer, we all know that if we do this now it will indefinitely delay the whole matter of the temporary protection of displaced persons."
"This means we are giving the Council an excellent argument not to do anything more."
"Thirdly, the proposal states that temporary protection can be ended if the situation in the region of origin is safe."
"My group would like to add two further conditions."
"Firstly, the human rights of displaced persons must be respected and nobody can be discriminated against."
"Secondly, refugees must be able to return without problems to the place they came from and not just dropped off somewhere in the region."
"I believe there is good reason for this."
"I and many other colleagues are very shocked at the proposal by some of the political parties in the Netherlands to send back the Bosnians when some of the human rights organisations are saying that conditions are anything but safe there."
"These are the points we want to make clear in the Wiebenga report."
"Finally, Mr President, we hope that Parliament will not give the Council an excuse for failing to approve this temporary status and I hope that the House can agree on this."
"Mrs Van Lancker, you asked whether you had four minutes, so please stick to them if that is your allowance and do not just carry on as long as you like."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will begin by thanking Mr Wiebenga, our rapporteur, who as expected has produced an excellent, careful and very balanced report for Parliament."
"I should like to point out that - contrary to the impression which Mrs Zimmermann and Mrs Van Lancker sought to give - this is not a question of whether refugees are admitted into the EU or not."
"Of course refugees from civil wars are admitted into Europe, in their hundreds of thousands."
"The problem is burden-sharing."
"The question hiding under the title 'temporary protection of refugees' is essentially whether, as in the case of former Yugoslavia, two countries - namely Austria and Germany - should take in more than twice as many refugees as all the others put together, or whether a just way of sharing the burden should be found; that is the political problem."
"In any case, no one in this House who is to be taken seriously disputes the fact that people should be admitted under humane conditions."
"The problem has been an urgent one ever since the civil war in Yugoslavia put hundreds of thousands of people to flight."
"Since then there have been calls for burden-sharing."
"To briefly recap the course of events: some time ago, after prolonged hesitation and prolonged pressure on the part of the countries concerned, the Commission drafted an initial proposal on this subject."
"I do not wish to examine now why we deemed this to be inadequate, whether it was because the Commission did not dare to do more, or - and I have to grant you this, Mrs Gradin - because it saw clearly that this was all that could be achieved."
"The gist of this first draft on the actual important issue of burden-sharing was, however, as follows: in the event of a mass influx of refugees, the Council considers the appropriate measures, so not with the objective of approving assistance."
"No, it considers the appropriate measures and in doing so meets its commitments."
"This was an absurd way to settle the burden-sharing issue and thus also failed to be supported by a majority of the Council."
"The Commission has redrafted its paper and has now come up with a very peculiar idea."
"It has now proposed two legislative acts, the first on admitting refugees and the second on solidarity in the admission of refugees."
"If you take a closer look - something I strongly recommend - you will see that the decision to admit refugees is taken by a qualified majority; if necessary, therefore, this can even be decided if the particularly burdened country admitting the refugees votes against. You will also see, however, that the solidarity measures - the assistance - require unanimity to be approved and are not a binding stipulation; in the Commission proposal this is only a 'may' provision."
"That is decidedly too weak."
"This is not the solidarity of which the title speaks, but is clearly only the solidarity of those who wish to reject a fair system of burden-sharing."
"That is why we cannot accept these two proposals in this form."
"What we are calling for and what should be proposed is the following: the burden-sharing must take place at the same time as the refugees are admitted."
"When the refugees are admitted, it must be clear straight away which countries are to admit them and in what proportions, which should take into account the countries' capacity and economic performance."
"If that does not happen, there will not be any burden-sharing at any later stage."
"Certain details also ought to be mentioned."
"We place the emphasis on admitting the refugees into different countries, not on financial assistance."
"We would also ask you to consider, Mrs Gradin, whether five years is the right duration for the temporary admission regime."
"Five years is more of an indicator of immigration than temporary protection."
"From my own experience, I know that once someone has been there for five years, they will find it very difficult to leave their host country again."
"We will certainly have to discuss all the other details."
"I might mention the problem of family reunification."
"It would be better to give someone outside the Union the opportunity to come in, rather than giving someone who has already come in the possibility of bringing his whole family to join him straight away."
"That increases the number of those admitted and the corresponding burden."
"The question for us was a political one: is the progress being made here such that, despite all the criticism, we can approve it; or is it so little that, if we agreed to it, we would meet with the reproach in the future that it has already been settled?"
"We say that the progress being made here is so minimal that we cannot pronounce ourselves satisfied with it."
"That is why, Commissioner, we must unfortunately reject these two proposals."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by paying tribute to the work of Mr Wiebenga on temporary protection for displaced persons."
"The report he is presenting and the motion for a legislative resolution, if adopted by the Council, would provide an effective instrument for dealing with a migratory wave on the scale of that experienced in Bosnia and Herzegovina or, closer to home perhaps, a large-scale movement of displaced persons from Kosovo towards the Member States of the European Union."
"I use the conditional tense for the simple reason that we cannot be careful enough in what we say since, having been asked to reach a decision in December on the matter currently under discussion, the Council is far from unanimous with regard to the proposals that have just been put forward by Mr Wiebenga."
"The Commission's proposals for joint action on the temporary protection of displaced persons and solidarity in the reception and stay of those benefiting from such protection make up a whole."
"The rapporteur has clearly highlighted the manner in which the first section of his report complements the Geneva Convention on refugees."
"We are in complete agreement and we intend to keep up the pressure on all international bodies and all the authorities involved, with a view to influencing international law on this issue."
"Moreover, experience shows that an unequal distribution of burdens gives rise to many problems linked to the implementation of the right of asylum or the treatment of persons who, for one reason or another, see no other solution to their sad fate than to cross the borders of the European Union."
"We might remember the panic, which I would call ridiculous if the situation had not been so serious, that was caused by the arrival of a few Kurds in Italy last year, as though the presence of a few thousand Kurds in the territory of the European Union was likely to destabilise 350 million Europeans."
"It is obviously absurd."
"If the proposals contained in this report had been in force at that time, particularly those regarding burden-sharing in relation to the problem of displaced persons, the drama I have just mentioned would probably not have occurred."
"Burdens must be fairly distributed for reasons of morals, ethics or simply a fundamental need for solidarity."
"The example of the arrival of a few thousand Kurds in Bari effectively highlighted the weaknesses and gaps involving this issue and in terms of the application of existing rules."
"It also shows that if a larger number of refugees were to arrive on our territory, Europe would be ill-prepared to handle the situation."
"I would not, however, want this debate to lead to a dialogue of the deaf on this matter because, as it is, considerable progress has, in fact, been made. That is why I call on the House to adopt the measures proposed by our friend, Mr Wiebenga, whom I would again like to thank most sincerely."
"Mr President, it is always welcome when a rapporteur tries to make an already good report by the Commission even better."
"As in the past, when he proved successful, the rapporteur has tried to do this here too, and we can support the main thrust of his proposals."
"But we cannot support him on a very important point, namely Amendment No 5 to Article 3 concerning the maximum period during which this regulation would apply. Already set at five years in the proposal, he advocates further extending it, potentially by another five years."
"I have two major objections to this."
"First of all, I find the first period of five years already exceptionally long for temporary status."
"This is a measure providing protection for temporarily displaced persons. In the light of all such cases which have arisen in the past, five years is very long."
"If we are talking about a stable integration, a stable laying down of roots in a society, then people should not live for five years with the idea that the next day or perhaps at the end of this period they will have another status which may be much better, let alone that at the end of this five years they may find themselves facing another five years in this intolerable state of uncertainty."
"We would therefore most strongly oppose the rapporteur's proposal for temporary status to be extended to a maximum of 10 years."
"Another question, addressed not so much to the rapporteur as to the Commissioner, is that the precise role of the UNHCR remains unclear."
"Various comments are made, but for example the second proposal on financial solidarity in Article 2(2) says: can ask the UNHCR for advice."
"We believe this should be 'must' and in a number of explanations it has given it also seems as if that is what the Commission wants."
"I should therefore like some clarification from the Commissioner on this point."
"A good point in the proposal is that temporarily displaced persons are not going to be moved around."
"We are now seeing where this can lead, because with the Dublin agreements that can indeed happen with asylum-seekers. Following claims made on that basis very large groups of asylum-seekers are ending up on the street, even in the Netherlands, because the Netherlands refuses to admit them because they were previously in another European country."
"Fortunately, no such proposal is made in this case."
"Finally, the rapporteur would like to see the word 'solidarity' deleted from the report."
"He has good formal grounds for this."
"I would be very pleased not to see the concept of 'solidarity' or the sense of the concept of 'solidarity' disappear, but simply the word."
"I cannot help saying that it seems easier to pursue a liberal asylum policy in Europe than in the Netherlands."
"I refer to Mr Wiebenga who is a front-runner for the VVD in the coming European elections and I must say that I have every sympathy for his traditional liberal approach, as it has already been described."
"But that does not apply to his party in the Dutch Parliament."
"Mr President, it goes without saying that the Group of the European Radical Alliance will fully support the text presented by Mr Wiebenga, and we would like to congratulate him very sincerely on his tenacity in this matter."
"The problem today is that, on the one hand, refugees must enjoy a common system of protection and, on the other hand, the states and governments that take them in must themselves make similar efforts or at least employ comparable budgetary resources."
"However, this all goes without saying."
"The real problem lies in Europe's absence."
"Earlier, Mr Zimmermann, who is regrettably absent, referred to the desert-like appearance of this Hemicycle, which precisely reflects Europe's total absence from each of the current crises."
"Europe does not exist or, to be entirely accurate, Europe has failed to provide itself with the wherewithal to be present and active. It carries no weight in any of these crises."
"We see this clearly in the eastern Mediterranean, we saw it in Bosnia, and we see it in Kosovo."
"Europe's absence is a disaster, particularly since the United Nations itself has not been able to establish a form of intervention that allows it to preserve peace, to at least prevent armed conflicts from erupting, to prevent them from spreading when they do occur, and to protect civilian populations."
"This does not mean that we wish to become the policemen of the world following the example of another great power."
"However, it is our duty to promote the structures for action by an international police force, which would not necessarily be European. That is what we should work towards."
"Meanwhile, we will grant temporary shelter, we will provide protection for refugees, we will ease our consciences before sending them back home as soon as the situation in their country has changed, when it has become less heated or when our guilty consciences have become less acute."
"We support the Wiebenga report, but it is only a beginning."
"The bulk of the work remains to be done."
"Thank you, Mr Pradier."
"I would like to ask our friends in the galleries not to call out during the debates."
"I am afraid that is not allowed, and I would not wish to have to ask for the galleries to be cleared."
"If the speakers' words fire you with enthusiasm, please keep this to yourself and express it in a different place."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking Mr Wiebenga for his work."
"Even if I do not always agree with him, and there are indeed a number of points in his report that I do not agree with, I would be the first to acknowledge that he is a person who is extremely serious and most courteous in his work."
"Nonetheless, I find it surprising, and excessive, to consider temporary protection for five years, which may be doubled, thus totalling 10 years."
"This, in fact, is no longer a question of temporary protection but involves immigration, which is not the topic under debate today."
"Moreover, I am astonished at the proposal to replace unanimity, which has until now been used for decisions on solidarity mechanisms, with a qualified majority."
"If the system is to work, the countries involved must give their consent."
"However, I agree with Mr Pradier that this issue goes to the centre of the question of Europe's international influence."
"We are told that 'Europe means peace', but Europe does not mean peace, because we have unfortunately seen that there is war in Europe and that the European Union allows the United States to settle European conflicts."
"I wonder whether the unshakeable desire to have a common policy in diplomatic affairs is the right course and whether it would not have been preferable, particularly in settling the Yugoslavian conflict, to make use of the competences, traditions and historical relations of certain European nations, for instance between Germany and Croatia or between France and Serbia. This would have been better than trying in vain to achieve a unanimous position, which, at the end of the day, condemned Europe to a form of impotence that was deeply regrettable, both for the countries involved and for the European Union itself."
"Clearly, we have a duty to take in refugees."
"We have a duty in particular towards Central Europe."
"I will never be able to repeat enough that the countries of the European Union have enjoyed freedom and prosperity at the cost of 40 years of slavery and abject poverty suffered by the countries of Central Europe."
"Mr President, with a total of 90 seconds' speaking time I will confine myself to two interesting quotations. I would also briefly make the point that I continue to believe that Parliament leaves itself open to ridicule by limiting speaking time on such an important subject as asylum policy to such an extent that speakers are obliged to deal in superficialities."
"The first comes from the Dutch liberals, from Frits Bolkestein, and dates from before the last European elections."
"I quote: 'Refugees from outside Europe must find sanctuary in safe countries in their own part of the world."
"As soon as a country becomes safe again, all refugees from that country should return.'"
"Surprisingly enough I do not find this spirit present either in the report or in the words of our liberal colleague Mr Wiebenga, who was nevertheless elected on this programme."
"I therefore ask the question: Are there perhaps two VVD programmes, one for the electorate and one for the elected, one for the election campaign and one for afterwards?"
"The second quotation comes from the Flemish socialist Louis Tobback who in an election leaflet describes the majority of refugees in general as: 'Gulls who come to settle here on a rubbish tip, as that is easier than fishing or farming the land back home.'"
"These are not my words."
"It is not even my conviction."
"These are the words and the conviction of the leader of the socialists in Flanders."
"But the elected representatives for this party also sing another tune here in Parliament than their party leadership back home sing for their own voters."
"This is deceiving the voters and I will continue to denounce it."
"Mr President, Commissioner, in the last few months of this year, we have seen similarly steep and dramatic increases in the number of asylum seekers as we saw in 1991 and 1992."
"We note that the mass of asylum seekers is again concentrated on the selfsame countries as it was in 1991 and 1992."
"My colleague, Mr Nassauer, has already referred to the fact that two countries, Germany and Austria, admitted more than half of the refugees at that time."
"The burden placed on these two countries is huge."
"We know that their capacity to bear this burden and to integrate these people will reach its limit if this continues."
"That is why I strongly urge you to be reasonable, so that the burden of admitting these people can be shared in the future."
"The current situation is intolerable, and the proposals tabled thus far are not likely actually to solve the problem either."
"Burden-sharing is absolutely essential for Europe."
"I see the proposals presented as a ploy to prevent a real solution emerging."
"The decision to admit refugees is to be taken by a majority vote, which means that it can also be passed against the wishes of the countries concerned."
"The decision on distributing the refugees, which is then of course difficult, requires unanimity; we may as well assume then, that it will not happen."
"As a result, the countries facing the greatest influxes of refugees now will continue to do so in the future too."
"In addition, the whole business then has a multiplier effect: these are the countries which already received the most migrant workers in the past and integrated them along with their families, and so those seeking asylum go to those countries because they have relatives, acquaintances and friends there."
"If we do not find a solution quickly, I fear that these countries' capacity to bear this burden will not only reach its limit, but in some cases will be exceeded."
"None of us want that to happen."
"The second point is a completely unacceptable proposal from the Green Group;"
"Mr Voggenhuber thought that refugees should also immediately bring all their relations with them."
"We all know what that would mean."
"You can reckon on a four- or five-fold increase in numbers, and everyone can imagine the kind of problems that would cause."
"I also fail to understand - and here I have also received the support of the left side of the House, which is particularly pleasing - why a temporary right of asylum can, according to the proposal, be granted for five years."
"I know from experience that, during the last crisis, we in Austria admitted more than 60 000 asylum seekers from Kosovo and integrated a large proportion of them."
"We know from practical experience, however, how difficult it is, when people have already spent three years in a country, to make it possible for them to return home and to help them to reintegrate."
"It really is incredibly difficult."
"In my opinion, therefore, to make it possible for them to reintegrate, a temporary right of asylum should initially be granted for a maximum of three years and should only be extended in special cases."
"In so doing, we want to ensure that people who are, after all, uprooted and find themselves in other countries, are able to go back, and are not deprived of the opportunity of becoming part of their old communities again."
"The Wiebenga report has undoubtedly shown that we need solutions."
"The proposed plan is not yet adequate."
"I should like to see a solution on the table very soon, because time is pressing and we already have the problems."
"Mr President, Commissioner, what I have just heard makes me very unhappy."
"This is because I feel that an unholy alliance is being formed - one that we also see in other circumstances - in which one side claims it wished the best to be the enemy of the good."
"It is quite unacceptable that Parliament should run the risk of making a complete fool of itself by throwing out the proposal and achieving nothing."
"Then the Council would also be able to accuse us of not wanting to do anything."
"If that is what Parliament really wants, then we have to give some careful thought to our role!"
"In fact, I cannot help thinking that this is similar to the discussion we had regarding the Members' Statute."
"In that discussion, the same people employing the same argument tried to delay the work."
"Now - when there is comparative calm on our external borders - is the time to get on with it."
"I really hope we can reach an understanding and approve Mr Wiebenga's excellent initiative."
"I think that one of the most important aspects is that we should move to majority voting, since it would mean that Europe was really working."
"Clearly, we shall be able to take a decision in conjunction with the Member States affected by it, at least that cannot be prevented."
"I would also prefer to see my own country join the cooperation initiative. I am among those who think that Finland has taken very little responsibility in the refugee issue and that it has been very short-sighted in its policy."
"I should like to commend Mr Wiebenga on his report, and I hope we can all support it in order to avoid any unpleasant scenes when it comes to the vote."
"I have one small comment, namely that we should pay more attention to last year's Council resolution 13/48, in which the EU and the Commission are requested to cooperate with the Council on this type of issue."
"Mr President, I should also like to congratulate Mr Wiebenga."
"A generous policy towards refugees should be pursued as a matter of course in all democratic countries, and hence in all EU Member States."
"Unfortunately, there is still considerable room for improvement."
"There should be constructive cooperation to help people in need and those who are displaced."
"Such cooperation should involve a voluntary agreement on burden-sharing, but it should not be a matter for legislation."
"It should be painfully clear that this is a question of common humanity."
"To ensure that such a policy becomes firmly established in the Member States, a unanimous decision is vital."
"We in the Green Group would naturally like to see our amendment approved, and we believe that Commissioner Gradin's proposal on joint action to provide temporary protection is worth considering."
"The report reinforces the human dimension, but such an instrument must nevertheless be seen as complementing the Geneva Convention on Refugees and definitely not as an alternative."
"It is important for refugees to continue to have protection under the terms of the Convention - any other arrangement would be wholly unacceptable."
"Mr President, you cannot open a newspaper anywhere in Europe without being confronted with the dramatic issue of asylum-seekers and the major differences of opinion of governments on this."
"This is a huge problem and I must say that if what I learned at school was true, that to govern is to anticipate, then people have governed very badly in the various Member States and in Europe in recent times."
"The conflict in the former Yugoslavia was clearly going to create flows of refugees."
"The conflict presently raging in Kosovo could have been predicted two years ago."
"As early as 1997 there was talk of the need for a displaced person status."
"I am convinced of the need for this."
"I am interested to hear the different views, the differences of opinion and objections of all concerned, but I have to say that by trying to do what is best we can fail to do what is good."
"If at present we have no European solution then this means that there is no solution anywhere."
"Because when a solution is found in Germany which is different to the one found in the Netherlands, then the flows of refugees simply shift."
"We therefore need a European status and we must also ensure that solidarity is given an acceptable form."
"For this reason we will say 'yes' to the proposal, even if we are tempted to debate a number of aspects which are important but on which we will never reach unanimity and which must not prevent us from doing what must be done."
"But despite all this I still think it is scandalous that we have no common foreign policy worthy of the name."
"It is scandalous that the European countries are still failing to confront the real causes of these flows of people seeking security and a better life, because our development cooperation is no good and because we close our eyes to the need for a mobility policy which is also concerned with people and not just capital and goods."
"Mr President, the situation of the refugees from Kosovo does urgently require a solution, and this above all means having a fair system for distributing the people."
"Austria's response to the crises of recent years, as also acknowledged here, has been exemplary; it has admitted displaced persons, in particular from the stricken area of Bosnia, and has integrated most of them into society."
"In the meantime, however, - as Mr Pirker rightly said - the capacity of the Austrian population to bear this burden has reached its limit."
"If the word solidarity is not to be meaningless in the European Union, it is time for us to take action in pursuit of our common objectives."
"No Member State should be able to buy its way out of this responsibility."
"Each one should admit displaced persons in numbers corresponding to its size and population, and in so doing reveal the much flaunted European conscience."
"We believe - for the reasons already mentioned by Mr Nassauer - that dividing the proposal into two parts, and thus deferring the issue of burden-sharing, is unjustifiable."
"Only if a decision is taken as rapidly as possible on the whole package will we really do justice to the concerns of European citizens."
"Mr President, I did not wish to interrupt Mr Hager, but simply to say the following. At three minutes past four, I asked to make a point of order for the following reason."
"There are two possibilities: either you begin the topical and urgent debate at 4 p.m. precisely, or you take all the remaining speakers on the Wiebenga report after 4 p.m."
"What is unacceptable, however, is for you to give some colleagues the floor after 4 p.m. and postpone others' interventions to this evening."
"It has to be one thing or the other!"
"Mr Posselt, we had to complete the first round of speakers from all the political groups."
"That is why there has been a delay of three minutes."
"The debate on the Wiebenga report is suspended, and will continue after the voting on topical and urgent subjects."
"Mr President, I assume that the Commissioner, Mrs Gradin, can speak again in the course of this debate in order to reply to the points and questions we have raised."
"Mr Wiebenga, you must understand that the order of business has been established in advance and we are sticking to it exactly."
"The debate on your report will continue when voting has been completed."
"TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE"
"The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following seven motions for resolutions on food aid to Russia:"
"B4-1002/98 by Mr Väyrynen and Mrs Kjer Hansen, on behalf of the ELDR Group; -B4-1008/98 by Mr Swoboda and others, on behalf of the PSE Group; -B4-1018/98 by Mrs Carrère d'Encausse, on behalf of the UPE Group; -B4-1019/98 by Mr de Lassus Saint Geniès, on behalf of the ARE Group; -B4-1030/98 by Mrs Schroedter, Mr Lagendijk and Mrs Aelvoet, on behalf of the V Group; -B4-1034/98 by Mr Provan and others, on behalf of the PPE Group; -B4-1043/98 by Mr Seppänen and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group."
"Mr President, Commissioner, on the subject of the granting of aid to Russia, the Liberal Group wants the European Union to grant emergency aid to the Russian Federation."
"That is clear."
"The people of that country are facing an extremely difficult, precarious and cold situation."
"We must not close our eyes to the fate of the population and stubbornness on our part due to reasons of accounting is out of place in the face of such problems."
"But this does not alter the fact that the Russian Government must clearly understand that this positive signal from our side must meet with a positive signal from their side."
"A responsible financial policy and firm undertakings to the IMF are essential in order to find lasting solutions to the problems of the Russian economy."
"I know, these are just a lot of words, simple words, for a gigantic task."
"A serious approach to fraud is also very important."
"In this respect, in granting emergency aid the Union must also respect the Russian market as much as possible, which is why I call on the Council to approve the Commission proposal to make ECU 400 million available to the Russians."
"Finally, the Commission must consult Parliament when drawing up the memorandum of understanding."
"Thank you very much for the generous extra time."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the time available for topical and urgent debate is very short, as you know."
"So please stick to the time each speaker has been allocated for his or her speech."
"Mr President, the problem we are discussing today, food aid to Russia, is of the utmost importance."
"It is important because, in recent weeks and months, Russia has not only been experiencing an economic and financial crisis, but is also having to live with the effects of crop failure."
"In 1998, only half as much grain was harvested as had been expected; the potato harvest does not appear to have been much better; and in the allotments, which most Russians have - and which indeed they need for their basic food supplies - much poorer yields have also been produced."
"The decline of the rouble has compounded the problems."
"Most Russians can hardly afford to buy themselves food."
"They are living either below or on the poverty line."
"The need for aid is therefore beyond doubt, and I was able to see this for myself on visits to Russia in recent weeks."
"Children and the elderly, in particular, are urgently dependent on our help."
"Indeed, the first reports of people dying from starvation have already appeared in the media here."
"At the moment, only one thing is certain about the food aid which the Council and the Commission wish to provide: it is help for European farmers, who are no longer able to sell their products on the Russian market because of the devaluation of the rouble."
"Whether the food really does reach the orphanages, schools and hospitals, where people really need it, remains somewhat in doubt."
"Agricultural products should be sold at market price, and the income paid into a special fund in the Russian budget and later used for social purposes."
"There is no doubt that the Commission needs to consider once again here whether its approach is really the right one."
"We cannot allow food to appear on the black market, or even to become a Russian export."
"We want to support the poor in Russia and not the mafia."
"That is why, in the motion, we call for humanitarian aid, as well as food aid, to be provided."
"The Russian Red Cross, the churches and NGOs have pledged to help by identifying where need exists and distributing food and medicines, and they do have the required distribution systems."
"A further issue is financing the food aid."
"If it is indeed the case that this also helps and supports European farmers, then we believe that the funding should come out of the category on agricultural policy, Category 1, and should not be charged to external policies, even if it is benefiting Russia."
"I would urge the Commission to take the necessary decisions here."
"Food aid will not solve the structural problems in Russia."
"Russia needs to take action itself on that front, and finally present and implement the appropriate plans."
"Mr President, it is 2- here in Strasbourg and it has snowed, but we are nice and warm with good food to eat."
"That is why it is evident to me that we must help the Russians who are suffering extreme cold with nothing to eat."
"My motto is: Help the Russians through the winter."
"Of course we have not forgotten that billions granted in loans to Russia failed to achieve their objective and profited a rich elite."
"The recent visit by German Chancellor Schröder to President Yeltsin shows that German flexibility in granting loans is over."
"720 banks are on the verge of closure and the rest are unable to honour their undertakings."
"Russia must pursue a different policy if it wants to escape these distressing financial and economic circumstances."
"But this does not yet seem to be the case, because in his latest plans Prime Minister Primakov speaks of more State intervention."
"Which means he has totally rejected Mr Schröder's advice to follow the IMF rules."
"Despite this we cannot disregard an appeal by the International Red Cross for food aid for the poorest people living in the most remote areas."
"It is therefore an excellent thing for the Commission to have taken this initiative."
"But I believe the Russians should agree to tax-free imports, fraud controls and unrestricted distribution."
"Time is short."
"We want to help the Russians through the winter, but they must give us the scope to explain to Europe's taxpayers that their money is being used altruistically."
"We are helping the Russians through the winter, but with checks."
"Mr President, I think that what Mr Bertens has said diplomatically may be stated in a more direct manner."
"The truth of the matter is that we are today prisoners of our credits to Russia."
"It goes without saying that the Group of the European Radical Alliance will vote for this resolution in favour of humanitarian aid to Russia, given the current disastrous humanitarian situation in the country."
"But, in point of fact, we have no policy regarding Russia and it is not possible to have one because our credits and the power they indirectly give the Russians over our banks mean that the Russians may do as they like. They turn a deaf ear to the demands of the European Union."
"They do not undertake privatisations, particularly of land, which would place Russia in a position to produce what it needs for its own consumption."
"Thus, our hands are firmly tied and it is quite impossible to promote or strengthen a reform policy in Russia."
"Here again, the problem involves the lack of a European policy."
"Mr President, in the discussion on emergency aid the question is often raised as to whether or not it is really necessary."
"Is there really a food shortage in Russia?"
"To be honest, generally speaking this is a difficult question to answer."
"But what I am sure about is that there are most certainly major regions and major groups facing a real food shortage."
"Consider the regions in northern Russia."
"I read a newspaper report this very morning that the Eskimos in northern Russia are facing a severe food shortage and are moving south in large numbers."
"Then there are groups such as old people living alone, the homeless and prisoners who certainly do not have enough food."
"In addition to food, there is clearly also a shortage of medicines almost everywhere, which is why I believe it is a good idea to grant this emergency aid."
"I understand that the Commission's intention is not to give the food free of charge but to sell it and set up a social fund with the proceeds."
"It seems to me that one of the conditions for this must be not to set the prices too high as otherwise you will not help the people you want to help, who are mainly the people with the least money, while people with a lot of money will be able to buy the aid."
"What must be carefully avoided, and I say this on the basis of fairly close contact with the people in Russia over recent weeks, is that people in Russia, and also Europe, get the idea that this food aid is being used to dump Europe's surpluses."
"They must not think that the motivation is to serve Europe's interests by disposing of its surpluses rather than to help certain Russian regions and certain Russians to obtain sufficient food."
"This impression must be avoided at all costs."
"Finally, Mr President, a point which has been much repeated: distribution is a major problem."
"I can well imagine that the Commission also does not know for sure whether everything that is imported goes to precisely the right area."
"My suggestion would be to work principally with the regions rather than to try to reach everybody through a national distribution channel, because I am convinced that it is at regional level that there is the greatest certainty, the best chance of getting the food and the medicine through to where it is needed."
"Mr President, it is not often that somebody from this side of the House can get up and agree totally with what has just been said before by the Greens."
"I welcome very much what Mr Lagendijk has just said because I agree with him practically entirely."
"We are facing a very difficult position as I am sure you are aware yourself."
"Some of the difficulties that we are facing are because we are not sure of the actual facts and the information we are getting."
"When a number of us paid a visit to Moscow recently we were surprised to find a number of the NGOs and, since my return, the World Health Organisation saying that they are not really sure that food aid is what is required in Russia at the present time: maybe in one or two of the regions but not necessarily general food aid."
"The first essential to try to resolve the situation is to have proper political and economic stability within the country."
"As a result of 17 August all sorts of financial consequences are really impinging very greatly on people."
"Until 17 August we had also seen huge fraud and a huge incidence of crime."
"That is very much to be regretted and something that has to be stamped out if we are going to get proper aid programmes developed for the people in Russia here and now."
"The real problem is non-payment of pensions, of soldiers, doctors and teachers."
"We could go through a number of categories of people who are just not getting the income to be able to buy the food that may be available within the country itself."
"This is causing huge hardship to great sectors of the population and the lack of purchasing power therefore has a consequence on the food supply."
"The lack of cash for medicines has also to be tackled because the health problems that the people are beginning to face in Russia are severe."
"The government can no longer afford to import food from outside their own country."
"They have been depending on 40 % of their food supply coming from outside and that is the void that we are going to have to try and fill."
"It is really an economic problem."
"The banks are bankrupt."
"The issue is not necessarily food shortage and if we are to get the food distributed properly we have got to find ways at European level of making sure it is actually going to go to the regions that require it."
"The second essential is that we have to work closely with the United States on any programme we develop."
"It would be wrong for a 'divide and rule' policy to be undertaken by the Russian Government at the present time, which is what could happen."
"We must address all the questions of food, health, the economy and political stability in one programme, if that is possible."
"Mr President, Russia has made an abrupt switch from communism to capitalism."
"It has been a bit like making a U-turn at top speed."
"The nation has gone flying off the stage and into the mud, but the oligarchs sit safely strapped in by their state-issue seatbelts and wave their hats."
"The first condition of financial aid must be that it no longer goes to those engaged in shady dealings."
"Corruption at government level must be stopped."
"And so to the question of food aid: when you have problems in common, you have opportunities in common."
"I do not believe that aid should be given via a commercial chain and all at once, but gradually and through social organisations."
"We lost money the last time through using commercial networks of distribution."
"There are plenty of community organisations and they target a great number of different areas."
"There is even a TV programme called VID, which specialises in helping people."
"Let us use care links such as nursery schools and old people's homes, and then we will be able to exert effective control on three levels: the EU, the state and the ministry that deals with emergency aid, which has the means and resources."
"Mr President, as we have heard, there is a serious state of affairs in Russia, and the financial situation means that the scope for importing food has been greatly reduced."
"This should be seen in connection with the fact that Russia depends on imports for 40 % of its food supplies."
"It is therefore very welcome that the Commission is now ready to propose, after months of pressure from the European Parliament and elsewhere, that food aid should be provided with a value of more than DKR 3 billion."
"However, it is absolutely vital - not least in the light of the discussions currently taking place on the discharge - that this measure is implemented properly."
"This also means that we are insisting that the food aid must not distort the domestic market, and that it is targeted and given to those most in need."
"Finally, I should like to ask the Commissioner to appreciate that the implementation of this food aid measure will be closely followed by Parliament and also by the European public, and it is crucial that these things are carried out properly."
"I thank the honourable Members for their contribution, from which I clearly conclude that there is broad support for a food programme for Russia."
"I welcome the content of the motion for a resolution now before us and we also regard this as important support for our work in this field."
"It was not until 12 November that the Commission received a formal request from the Russian Government for a special food programme, although it had long been clear that such a request could be granted."
"As has been pointed out this afternoon, it is just that it is difficult to determine exactly how large and important the need for food aid really is."
"It also varies very much from one region to another."
"We are at present thinking in terms of a programme of between ECU 400 and 500 million for the supply of various products worth around ECU 400 to 500 million."
"As has also been correctly pointed out this afternoon, implementing the programme is a complicated business."
"This is why we very recently distributed for Parliament's information a Commission document which clearly sets out the background and bases for this action."
"It is indeed exceptionally important for the Russian Government to submit a detailed implementation plan as soon as possible for the regions needing aid and also concerning the distribution channels and the various checks and controls."
"The Commission also intends to attach a number of other stringent conditions, such as the immediate halting of distribution if there is any question of the goods being re-exported to other markets outside Russia."
"The goods must also be sold at local market prices and the proceeds must be transferred to a special provision in the Russian budget set aside to finance special programmes."
"The Commission will soon be having discussions with the Russian Government to draw up a memorandum of understanding."
"There have of course already been talks on this and a delegation visited Moscow."
"This memorandum of understanding must also set out the basic principles for the action to which I have just referred."
"It is also important to ensure the closest possible cooperation with our American partners who have also drawn up a food programme."
"Precisely because of the political as well as humanitarian importance of this whole operation, a specific draft regulation will be drawn up as soon as possible setting out all these basic principles for the information of the European Parliament."
"I should like to stress very clearly that this is not a zero risk operation."
"The whole programme is surrounded by far too many uncertainties which cannot be removed."
"All we can do is to provide the maximum protection against these risks by setting conditions, drawing up a memorandum of understanding with the Russian Government and exchanging experiences with other donors such as the Americans."
"We believe it to be a far greater risk to do nothing at all because of these uncertainties."
"That too we could not allow."
"When the regulation is submitted to you for consideration under the urgent procedure, I would also ask Parliament to give the necessary priority to delivering its approval or opinion so that we can act quickly."
"Winter has begun, stocks are shrinking and this is a case where we must be ready as quickly as possible."
"Finally a few words about the more specific humanitarian aid."
"This week the ECHO mission travelled to Russia and ECU 7 million will soon be made available to fund a number of projects already prepared by non-governmental organisations."
"In talks with the Russian Minister Bulkak, who will soon be visiting Brussels, I will once again be stressing the need for a solution to a number of barriers which currently stand in the way of providing effective aid, especially for these NGOs."
"The intention is for this aid to go mainly to hospitals, hospital supplies and similar."
"Mr President, we hope that we have at least made a gesture of solidarity towards Russia, but you can be sure that we will impress upon the authorities inside the country the need to closely monitor the programme's implementation."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following six motions for resolutions on nuclear disarmament:"
"B4-0998/98 by Mr Bertens, on behalf of the ELDR Group; -B4-1009/98 by Mrs Theorin, on behalf of the PSE Group; -B4-1031/98 by Mrs Schroedter and others, on behalf of the V Group; -B4-1035/98 by Mr Cushnahan, Mr Oostlander and Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, on behalf of the PPE Group; -B4-1040/98 by Mrs Ewing and Mrs Maes, on behalf of the ARE Group; -B4-1044/98 by Mr Carnero González and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group."
"Mr President, the liberals are very pleased at the initiative by the New Agenda Coalition."
"Eight countries from five different continents, very varied in terms of size and political relationships, are seeking to intervene in nuclear disarmament."
"My group wants initiatives to be taken which will break the deadlock on nuclear disarmament, certainly now that the world is no longer bipolar and locked in conflict."
"We are therefore very pleased that 12 of the 16 NATO countries have had the courage to depart from the stance of the nuclear superpowers and to opt for an unorthodox approach."
"They rightly raise a number of questions."
"When will START II be ratified?"
"When will negotiations on START III begin?"
"When will the nuclear nations begin real negotiations on nuclear disarmament?"
"That is why I am pleased that the UN First Committee voted by an overwhelming majority for a resolution calling for ratification of the CTBT and the de-alerting of nuclear weapons, cooperation with the IAEA and a moratorium on the production of nuclear material."
"There is nothing controversial in this and it does not contradict NATO doctrine."
"Finally, the UN resolution calls on the nuclear nations to consider additional measures, such as the promise not to be the first to use nuclear weapons."
"Finally, we support the original text which supports the UN resolution, but not the amendments tabled by the Greens."
"The Greens go further than the New Agenda Coalition, but that is not achievable and breaks the broad coalition."
"This resolution is designed to win a broad majority at the UN General Assembly."
"I believe the amendments tabled by the Greens will make this unlikely, and I therefore hope that the Greens will withdraw them."
"Mr President, on behalf of Mrs Theorin, who initiated this resolution, and my Group I would ask all Members to support it."
"Through their resolution in the UN Ireland and Sweden have taken the initiative in accordance with the Canberra Commission proposal for a nuclear weapon-free world."
"We support their demand that all nuclear weapons should be taken off alert."
"To have nuclear weapons on alert nine years after the end of the Cold War is unbelievable and creates great risks for us all."
"As Mr Bertens said, Parliament supports the initiatives taken by the eight countries in the New Agenda Coalition."
"The European Parliament has always made clear that it wants the European Union to be serious about the issue of nuclear disarmament and this particular initiative is one further step on the path to global nuclear disarmament."
"Looking at the detail of the resolution, we would call on the Member States which have not done so - which are abstaining - to vote 'yes' in the General Assembly."
"We call on those countries which possess nuclear weapons to fulfil their commitment to disarm by virtue of Article VI of the NPT."
"We also call on the non-nuclear weapons members of the NPT to fulfil their treaty commitments, i.e. not to receive, manufacture or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices."
"I hope this will have the wholehearted support of the House."
"Mr President, nuclear weapons are weapons of mass destruction which put the whole of humanity at risk."
"In an earlier resolution, Parliament has already clearly confirmed the judgment of the International Court of Justice which stated this, and that is why we should also remain consistent in our decisions here."
"All of us know the threat that nuclear weapons represent."
"It is absurd to want to continue to retain nuclear weapons or even the first-strike option."
"The significance of the New Agenda Coalition's success in the United Nations' First Committee must once again be strongly emphasised here."
"Out of 16 NATO countries, 12 voted in favour or abstained."
"That also sends out an important signal to the European Union's Member States to rethink their defence strategies."
"In this respect, we regret the fact that Slovenia has now left the group of eight."
"This country has the potential to play an important role in establishing a new security strategy in Europe."
"It is important to abolish the right of first use of nuclear weapons, a vestige of the Cold War, and here I refer once again to the new German Government's coalition agreement, bearing in mind that the German Government could perhaps take the lead on an initiative to further develop the common foreign and security policy."
"The new federal government wants to keep to its objective of the complete abolition of weapons of mass destruction, and will participate in initiatives to this end in cooperation with its partners and allies."
"It wishes to commit itself to achieving the aim of bringing nuclear disarmament to the fore and thus reducing the state of alert of nuclear weapons and abandoning the idea of first use."
"I think that this creates significant impetus."
"Mr President, I welcome the initiative taken by the New Agenda Coalition."
"It is particularly opportune and appropriate that such a development should occur in the post Cold War period."
"I would especially like to pay tribute to the current Irish Government for the pivotal and skilful role it has played in bringing this initiative to fruition."
"It was encouraging that the United Nations First Committee passed the New Agenda Coalition resolution last Friday."
"It was significant that members of the European Union either supported it or abstained."
"I hope those Member States that abstained and displayed such openness will be persuaded to vote for the resolution when it comes before the General Assembly for a final vote next month."
"Undoubtedly there are some Members who have some reservations about this resolution, particularly if they support the establishment of an EU defence policy."
"I would like to reassure them."
"Personally I support the establishment of an EU defence policy."
"I see it as a core component of European integration and I do not consider it inconsistent to support such a view whilst at the same time working for nuclear disarmament."
"It is also significant that the resolution before the United Nations in no way contradicts either existing EU or NATO policies."
"I welcome the broad support for this urgency but, on behalf of my group, I would like to indicate that we strongly oppose the two amendments tabled by the Green Group."
"I hope that at the end of this discussion we will have a resolution that will be overwhelmingly supported by this Parliament and, in its own way, will create an impetus for support for the overall resolution in the UN General Assembly."
"Mr President, we view this resolution as part of the general push towards disarmament, and nuclear disarmament in particular."
"We do not believe threats of suicide constitute effective defence - not even for those who still seek to defend the nuclear ideal of a deterrent."
"This is no longer responsible, because in the meantime the proliferation of nuclear weapons continues unabated."
"There must also be a stop to all nuclear tests and all research in this field."
"But none of this should make us blind to the terrible effects of other weapons, of chemical weapons which we also want to see banished from the world."
"Last week I was very struck by what I saw in the media concerning the development of biological weapons."
"What I mean to say is that a general push towards disarmament, including what are traditionally known as 'light weapons', must not make us forget that most countries seeking a new world want to banish nuclear weapons first and foremost, but that is only the beginning."
"We also need to take a good look at whether we in Europe should not put a stop to the smuggling of certain arms which still goes on in the Member States present here today."
"Mr President, the end of the Cold War led us to believe that nuclear arms had disappeared."
"They had perhaps disappeared from government priorities and also, regrettably, from the priorities of some sectors of public opinion, but in reality they continued to exist as the main threat to the survival of the planet."
"Almost 10 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, nuclear weapon stocks remain undiminished."
"We have even seen France carrying out tests as recently as 1995, while other countries, such as India and Pakistan, were testing only a short while ago."
"It is therefore absolutely vital that we continue to call for nuclear disarmament."
"And in this respect, we welcome the actions of those countries involved in the campaign urging the United Nations General Assembly to clearly indicate its position on this matter."
"I therefore believe that with this resolution, Parliament will support their efforts, in line with public opinion throughout Europe."
"Mr President, I would point out that this motion for a resolution is not directed at the Commission as we have no competence on this point."
"So I would limit my comments to supporting the call for the nuclear countries to determine to make systematic and progressive efforts to reduce the number of nuclear weapons in the world with the ultimate aim of banishing them entirely."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions on human rights:"
"Freedom of expression in Algeria and Serbia -B4-0995/98 by Mrs André-Léonard, on behalf of the ELDR Group; -B4-1012/98 by Mr Swoboda, on behalf of the PSE Group; -B4-1032/98 by Mr Cohn-Bendit, on behalf of the V Group; -B4-1036/98 by Mr Soulier, on behalf of the PPE Group; -B4-1045/98 by Mrs Ainardi and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group."
"International Criminal Court -B4-1006/98 by Mr Cars, Mr Bertens and Mr Nordmann, on behalf of the ELDR Group; -B4-1023/98 by Mr Dell'Alba, Mr Dupuis and Mr Hory, on behalf of the ARE Group; -B4-1027/98 by Mrs Aglietta and others, on behalf of the V Group; -B4-1050/98 by Mr Puerta and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group."
"Akin Birdal -B4-1000/98 by Mr Bertens, on behalf of the ELDR Group; -B4-1010/98 by Mr Titley, Mr Dankert and Mr Barros Moura, on behalf of the PSE Group; -B4-1016/98 by Mr Pasty, on behalf of the UPE Group; -B4-1025/98 by Mrs Aelvoet, Mrs Roth and Mr Tamino, on behalf of the V Group; -B4-1038/98 by Mr Langen and others, on behalf of the PPE Group; -B4-1051/98 by Mr Puerta and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group."
"Chalki seminary -B4-1013/98 by Mr Avgerinos and others, on behalf of the PSE Group; -B4-1017/98 by Mrs Daskalaki and others, on behalf of the UPE Group; -B4-1033/98 by Mrs Aelvoet and others, on behalf of the V Group; -B4-1039/98 by Mr Christodoulou and others, on behalf of the PPE Group; -B4-1049/98 by Mr Alavanos and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group."
"Anti-Semitism in Russia -B4-1004/98 by Mr Goerens and Mr Nordmann, on behalf of the ELDR Group; -B4-1007/98 by Mr Barón Crespo, on behalf of the PSE Group."
"Freedom of expression in Algeria and Serbia"
"Mr President, the joint resolution on the freedom of expression in Algeria is intended to demonstrate our solidarity with the Algerian press."
"The country's press, which plays a decisive role in combating the terrorist fundamentalism that rages in that country, has often paid a heavy price and too many journalists have died in the defence of freedom."
"We certainly have no intention of interfering in domestic affairs, but we do consider that it is our duty to defend, here and elsewhere, fundamental freedoms, which obviously include the freedom of the press."
"We must point out that the Algerian State has suspended the publication of a number of newspapers for several weeks, on the pretext of commercial disputes."
"These newspapers had made disturbing revelations that directly involved individuals close to the President, in particular General Betchine, who is accused of financial embezzlement in the Benboualia affair, and the Minister for Justice, Mr Adami, who had apparently brought pressure to bear on the courts."
"The fact that the authorities are able to take such action means that they have a de facto monopoly over the press, newsprint, the printing houses and advertising."
"In a state that claims to be democratic, the press must be free and cannot be subject to State control, even indirectly."
"We therefore call on Algeria to guarantee the freedom of the press, without any more pressure either from monopolies or the information code, and to carry out these reforms promptly."
"We are only a few months away from the presidential elections of April 1999, and we call urgently for fundamental freedoms to prevail and for the establishment of a transparent and pluralist democratic debate prior to the election."
"Mr President, of course I come from a country where the freedom of the press was not something we experienced, and we suffered greatly as a result."
"I therefore feel a deep sense of solidarity with the journalists in Serbia and, in particular, Algeria."
"It is typical of governments who are no longer trusted one hundred per cent by the population to employ a means of retaining power, and this is called restricting the freedom of the press."
"It is also very typical, and just as reprehensible, that methods such as a paper and printing monopoly are used to restrict press freedom."
"In this respect, I should like, on behalf of the Greens, to express my solidarity with the journalists in Algeria, who have the courage to fight against this and often pay for this courage with their lives."
"As the European Union, which puts democracy first - before economic relations - we need to insist on the freedom of the press being fully restored, both in Algeria and in Serbia, as the central pillar of democracy."
"We cannot turn a blind eye and say: fine, then of course we can bring the agreement into force, then of course we can continue to send economic aid to this country, unless the freedom of the press is established first."
"At this stage, I would ask Mr van den Broek how he sees the future of the Mediterranean Agreement with Algeria and what other measures Algeria will be required to take."
"My second question to you, Mr van den Broek, is this: against the background of the Dayton Agreement, how do you intend to respond to the obvious restrictions placed on the press in the Republic of Serbia?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, I have been to Algeria twice this year, and the Algerians were always very proud to point out that the press was free in their country, that there was even a very diverse press, and that is as it should be."
"In the light of this, the restrictions placed on the publication of several newspapers were all the more incomprehensible and serious."
"Although I know that behind all this there is also a power struggle - because the Algerians are again showing a certain pride here, that despite these restrictions two ministers have had to go - I still think that this internal power struggle should not and cannot be played out at the expense of journalists and newspapers."
"Democracy is indivisible, and the freedom of the press is part of it."
"I hope that the latest development, that these newspapers have all been published again, is a permanent one."
"I would call on the Algerian Government to ensure that there is complete freedom here."
"Personally, I see the situation in Yugoslavia as more serious."
"Whenever Milosevic has had to give way outside the country, he has increased the pressure at home."
"That is what he has now done with the universities and newspapers."
"That is completely unacceptable, and we need to do all we can to help those who are displaying any final remnant of freedom and of plurality in this country."
"In this context, I should like to ask you, Commissioner, to make a statement, here and now, that you will do everything in your power to ensure that the money and the support promised to the media there is actually delivered, and delivered in good time."
"Unfortunately, we have had to hear from editors in Serbia, in Yugoslavia, that they are waiting a very, very long time."
"I believe that until recently they were still waiting for money from the European Commission from 1997."
"It must not be the case that these newspapers are no longer able to be published not only because of Mr Milosevic, but possibly also because of the Commission's inefficiency."
"I would ask you to exercise your authority clearly here, Commissioner, to ensure that this help is given."
"Mr President, very briefly, on the subject of Serbia, I think that I will abstain."
"This is, yet again, a 'lukewarm' resolution and I am beginning to fear that my friends in the PPE have developed the Socialist group's syndrome, which is, as we all know, to never make waves and not to upset the governments."
"Of course, the PPE is no longer a part of many governments, which leaves me some hope."
"Nonetheless, I am beginning to fear that we will soon see an initiative supporting the award of the Nobel Prize to Mr Holbrooke and Mr Milosevic."
"That is just how desperate I think the situation has become."
"For our part, we will continue our campaign to ensure that charges are brought against Mr Milosevic."
"There can be no aid, there can be no possible reform in Serbia while that crook remains in power, and people must begin to accept that."
"There are already 120 of us who believe that in this Parliament."
"As far as Algeria is concerned, the situation there is completely outrageous."
"It is unfortunate that we must speak about this in the absence of one of our great contemporaries, Mr Cohn-Bendit, who initiated this resolution, together with others, such as Mrs André-Léonard."
"He is also our rapporteur on the Algerian question."
"It is madness!"
"The motives underpinning this resolution are disappearing."
"All the issues have been removed from the original text because they have meanwhile been settled by the Algerian editors, its government and its parliament."
"It is not just the Algerian Embassy that says so; there are documents that bear this out."
"The substance of this resolution is being removed, but it remains on Parliament's agenda."
"I believe that this manner of proceeding comes very close to the limits of our Rules of Procedure and, with all due respect to my very good friend Mrs André-Léonard, the situation of the press in Algeria is considerably better than in other countries, such as Tunisia, which is in the papers this morning, and perhaps also her own country."
"I believe that a particular form of indirect censorship is indeed carried out in Belgium, and we have been among those who have identified it in a number of matters that are corrupting the country."
"And it is not the only case in the Union, although I think that certain harmful developments there set it apart from other countries of the European Union."
"So, we are doing all we can to undermine the credibility of a country, in this case Algeria, that has a huge problem, that must tackle the transition from a communist regime to a multi-party regime and that has adopted a number of reforms."
"We are doing all we possibly can to prevent European investors from believing even for a moment in the possibility of a different future for that country."
"We systematically send absurd signals that are not understood either by public opinion in Algeria or by public opinion in Europe. In the same way, they are obviously not understood by investors and those who could contribute something positive to Algeria."
"It is outrageous!"
"Mr President, Mr Soulier was to address the House today."
"Unfortunately, he has been detained by unavoidable circumstances and so I will speak in his place."
"You will all remember that the European Parliament delegation, which visited Algeria in February and which was, in fact, led by Mr Soulier, had concluded that Algeria had embarked upon a democratic process following the election of President Amin Zeroual."
"Elections by universal suffrage made it possible to elect the National People's Assembly, marked by a multi-party system and freedom of debate."
"Elections were held a few months later, also by universal suffrage, throughout Algeria that allowed local authorities to be established."
"The members of the delegation had concluded that encouragement should be given to these efforts aimed at establishing democracy in Algeria."
"That opinion has been corroborated by the various subsequent missions to that country, including parliamentary delegations from Spain, France and Canada. These also included the panel appointed by the UN, which was led last summer by the former President of Portugal, Mr Mario Soares."
"However, while any obstacles to this progression towards democracy must be removed, we must not keep our concerns to ourselves or fail to offer the friendly advice that governments who wish to strengthen their relations should offer each other."
"And that is the nature of the motion for a resolution before the House today."
"In a few months time, Algeria will elect a new president."
"It is to be hoped, for the sake of Algeria and the European Union, that the verdict at the ballot box is unequivocal."
"The successful outcome of the negotiations culminating in the signature of the association agreement between Europe and Algeria depends on it."
"Freedom of the press is one of the conditions of democratic debate."
"All those who visited Algeria noticed the exceptional freedom in the tenor of the newspapers published in Algeria, both French and Arabic."
"It is essential for this freedom to be maintained and guaranteed."
"That naturally depends on constitutional guarantees, but also on the economic and financial conditions that must prevail in this sector that is part and parcel of democracy."
"Mr President, my group is very unhappy, to say the least, at the actions of Milosevic and the Parliament of the former Yugoslavia to suppress freedom of expression."
"By suppressing alternative information sources, Milosevic is trying to impose his will on the population."
"Everybody knows that his is the voice of the old communism and narrow-minded nationalism which was also the cause of the tragedy in Bosnia."
"If he gets the chance to pursue his dictatorial policy unpunished, the Kosovo question will also assume the same proportions."
"I know, I am pleased to say, that the European Commission is pursuing an active policy to promote the freedom of the press in the former Yugoslavia."
"I also understand that the Union does not have much influence over Milosevic's policy."
"Yet I hope that the Commission and the Member States will make an extra effort to promote free education and free media."
"The Council of Ministers must remain very vigilant when it comes to political and military developments in Kosovo and we must keep the military stick to hand if we want to lend force to our policy regarding Milosevic."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Milosevic has not only waged a war for nine years, a war which began in Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia."
"He is not only establishing an apartheid regime in Kosovo, he is not only responsible for driving people from their homes, for war and death in this region, he is also constantly visiting disaster upon his own people, the Serbs."
"He is violating his own people!"
"Since he came to power, despotism, fear and terror have reigned in Serbia."
"He has also methodically destroyed Serbian institutions."
"The Serbs feel like pariahs."
"Two very eminent Serbs have demonstrated, in an open letter to Mr Milosevic, what he has done to his people."
"He has made the university into a local farmers' club, they write."
"He has made the Academy of Arts and Sciences into a kind of nurses' home."
"He has devalued the media, the parliament, the legislation and the government."
"These are all quotations from this letter."
"He has allowed the citizens to become impoverished, but has made his wife, his cronies and himself rich."
"Hundreds of thousands of young people - the intelligentsia - are leaving the country."
"Milosevic is audacious, but the West is too timid, and incapable of putting an end to his activities."
"He is still courted and not punished, despite the fact that, firstly, following the result of the Holbrooke negotiations - which actually was not a result at all - he has done nothing to bring a political solution to the Kosovo problem any closer."
"Negotiations were supposed to start on 4 November - I did not see anything of the sort."
"Secondly, the day after these negotiations, Milosevic banned all independent media."
"Thirdly, a few days later, he whipped the undemocratic law on the press through a submissive parliament; this law gags all journalists."
"Fourthly, the law on universities contains provisions on making teaching conform to ideology, and that has huge significance."
"It is actually driving the intellectual élite out of the country, and those remaining in the country are in internal exile and far from Europe."
"The majority of the Serbs are waiting for a coup, which will give them back the air to breathe - the freedom to read, write and see."
"The Serbian people would take the next available opportunity to vote these criminals out of office, if they had or saw any alternative."
"We need to help to bring about this opportunity by supporting the independent media which can expose Milosevic, and we need to isolate Milosevic as an interlocutor."
"The best way to do this is to indict this despiser of humanity for war crimes in The Hague."
"That would be a clear sign."
"As a German, I can say that with Hitler, a democratic Germany could not have been built."
"With Milosevic, Serbia can never become a democracy!"
"Mr President, the closure of newspapers, the imposition of fines and the persecution of journalists once more show President Milosevic for what he is before the international community."
"However, experience shows that measures directed against freedom of the press will sooner or later, but with mathematical certainty, backfire precisely against those who adopt such measures."
"The government in Belgrade must understand that the tactics it is pursuing will not help to solve the enormous problems that prevail in the area."
"On the other hand, we must welcome the decision by the government of Montenegro, a decision which ensures complete freedom of expression for the mass media, both local and international."
"The European Parliament calls on Belgrade to change its attitude."
"We express our solidarity with the journalists and mass media facing persecution, and I would like to ask Mr van den Broek to cooperate with us in helping those who are fighting for freedom of thought."
"Mr President, the suppression of the universities and media in Serbia is, I believe, an encouraging sign, to the extent that it shows that there are forces for freedom there of which, unfortunately, too little is seen at international level."
"The Serbian people and Milosevic are still lumped together in accordance with a thesis of collective guilt, something from which other nations have also had to suffer."
"I should like to take up what Mrs Pack said."
"Precisely because I am German, I should like to emphasise that a distinction has to be drawn between dictators and the people."
"We need to support the liberal movements amongst the Serbian people with all our strength and we need to give more thorough consideration to the question: what will become of Serbia?"
"Of course, that is also closely connected with finding answers to the Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo questions, countries which have a right to develop independently."
"There will never be peace and freedom in the region unless Milosevic finally disappears and ends up before the International Court!"
"International Criminal Court"
"Mr President, the events of the last few days, from Pinochet to Priebke to Öcalan, confirm - if it were necessary - the need, in fact the urgent need, for an international criminal court capable of dealing with crimes against humanity."
"The increasingly tangible decline of the UN's traditional role as a world organisation able to guarantee order and peace calls for the creation, still under the aegis of the United Nations, of new, more flexible international bodies, designed to deal with monstrous crimes like genocide, xenophobia, torture and violations of human rights."
"So the decision taken on 17 July in Rome to establish the world's first international criminal court is of historic significance."
"No longer will justice be reserved only for the victors or the strongest - this is the beginning of real justice for the citizens of the world, all equal at last before an independent court."
"The European Parliament, and more generally the European Union, must therefore do their utmost to prevent the civilising efforts of the Rome Conference from being wasted, getting Member States which have not yet signed the Statute to do so, urging all the Member States of the Union to ratify the treaty and taking practical steps to increase the number of states supporting the initiative, as well as making European Union relations with third countries subject to signature."
"Finally, all the Community institutions must make it a priority to adopt the measures necessary for establishing the preparatory committee as soon as possible ..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, Commissioner van den Broek, I am particularly pleased that this debate is being held."
"The House is not very crowded, it is true - and I say that in view of the vote - but I hope Parliament will demonstrate once again, as it has done before, its attachment to this cause, and highlight the need for the Statute to be ratified so that it can come into force as soon as possible."
"We call for ratification by our governments, first and foremost, and by the other countries which decided to set up the court in the historic vote on 17 July in Rome."
"60 countries are needed: we ask, through Parliament, for 31 December 2000 to be the date this court comes into existence and ends the impunity now protecting so many tyrants and dictators - not just in retirement, like Pinochet, but active, like Slobodan Milosevic and others - through the arrival of international criminal justice handed down by a permanent criminal court."
"The European Union has been in the front line in this battle."
"A great victory was won in Rome, thanks not least to the commitment of the European Commission, a commitment shared by many non-governmental organisations, which are here together today, moreover, as a result of an initiative which we took with Mr Dupuis, the Radical Alliance and the 'No peace without justice' movement."
"So let us launch a great ratification campaign to get the court established on 1 January 2001!"
"Mr President, I would almost say that it seems like the devil's work, but in the light of recent events there have never been so many good reasons to set up a permanent international criminal court quickly."
"Mention has already been made of the Pinochet affair."
"It is clear to me that in this case, when a request has been made for extradition for crimes against humanity, a permanent international criminal court could certainly be very useful."
"The latest focus of attention, the extradition or request for extradition of Mr Ocalan, the former leader of the PKK, is somewhat more complicated."
"But there too I am convinced that an international court could do a good job, if only to determine what is political and what is criminal in this case."
"As far as we are concerned, recent events provide reason enough to set up this international court quickly."
"Mr President, the creation of the International Criminal Court has been a triumph of what could be called citizens' diplomacy. This huge movement of public opinion led in many countries to a large number of governments participating in the conference held in Rome, and, therefore, resulted in the creation of this Court."
"With its creation, the Court has been granted insufficient powers and competences, and there is a danger that it might become what I would term 'the dreamworld of the just' if enough governments do not quickly set up ratification instruments as well as, naturally, the mechanisms needed to enable the committee involved to set this Court in motion."
"What is more, this citizens' diplomacy, or public opinion, which led to the achievements in Rome, must be positively encouraged."
"This is especially important when there are cases pending that evidently show that an International Criminal Court is highly appropriate for judging, for example, criminals such as the Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet who, over the past few weeks, has sought refuge in the loopholes of national laws. I would like to take this opportunity to say that I sincerely hope that next Wednesday will be a day to commemorate as the day on which the decision was taken to extradite Pinochet to Spain, where he will be judged on the crimes he has been accused of, crimes that include genocide, torture and terrorism."
"This International Criminal Court is, in fact, needed to do away with this protective shield of impunity."
"It is quite incredible to think that such protection actually exists, given that the perpetrators of such crimes are known, yet the hand of justice cannot touch them."
"I therefore think that the Council and the Commission must once again to do all they can to ensure that the treaty drawn up in Rome is signed, so that the ratification instrument can be set up and so that the International Criminal Court can soon become a reality."
"Mr President, we have now debated three motions for resolutions, firstly on Algeria, then on Serbia and now on the International Criminal Court."
"For me, it was actually very telling that the word Milosevic occurred in nearly every intervention, regardless of which topic was being addressed."
"That should in fact show that we really do lack international criminal law and an institution such as an International Criminal Court."
"We have two 'mini criminal courts' dealing with Yugoslavia and Rwanda, but they undoubtedly do not have the scope which a well-funded International Criminal Court would have."
"They are not empowered - and would need to be - to intervene in national matters, if they see that these are to do with protecting human rights in a particular context."
"Nor are they able to become really involved in a case through a completely independent prosecutor."
"I believe that it is necessary for us, as Europeans, to bring our influence to bear on the countries which have not yet signed the Rome agreement."
"The United Kingdom and Germany, for example, are among them."
"We need their signatures."
"We want the Criminal Court to start on time!"
"Akin Birdal"
"Mr President, in its progress report on Turkey the Commission has already stated that human rights activist Akin Birdal most certainly did not receive a fair trial."
"If this case stands as an example of the behaviour of the Turkish government and justice, then I believe Turkey can forget about EU membership for the time being."
"Accession is linked to stringent, clear, strict and fair criteria."
"If Turkey wants to join, it must do some work in the field of democracy and human rights."
"I hope that President Demirel will see fit to grant a pardon to Mr Birdal, in the interests of democracy and good relations between the Union and Turkey."
"I also hope that the Turkish Parliament will shortly make the necessary and long promised legislative changes in order to guarantee democracy, respect for human rights and an independent constitutional state."
"My group trusts that the Commission and the Council will take steps to this end."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I met Akin Birdal about two weeks ago in Turkey."
"I saw that he is still suffering from the injuries he sustained in the assassination attempt."
"I listened to his speech to the human rights conference in Ankara, and responded to it."
"It was a very moderate speech."
"I would advise the Turkish Government really to make use of the present situation to talk to people like Akin Birdal, who display a balanced, reasonable attitude, and to solve the internal crisis in Turkey, in particular the Kurdish issue."
"I believe that Akin Birdal would also wish me to make a few fundamental remarks on the present critical situation."
"It has already been stated this morning in the House, by Mrs Green and others, that we reject Turkey's current position on the case of Mr Ocalan and his possible asylum."
"I of all people, who make every effort to build up decent relations between the European Union and Turkey - and have been to Turkey three times this year and held talks for that very reason - have to dismiss the Turkish stance."
"I should like to urge the Turkish Government once again to seize the opportunity now, so that even if the application for political asylum is accepted, neither side should resort to violence, and that also applies to the PKK and the Kurds' political representatives."
"There should be talks, which must not be held with the PKK, but with Akin Birdal, who is also quite prepared to take part in such talks, so that a solution can be reached providing linguistic and cultural autonomy within a unified Turkey."
"Akin Birdal and his organisation are fighting for this too."
"That is why I my belief is, in Akin Birdal's best interests, that the Turkish Government should take the opportunity to make the best of this crisis and work towards a peaceful internal solution to the Kurdish issue."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we are dealing with a specific case here."
"Considered in the light of the Kurdish issue in Turkey, Akin Birdal's sentence actually amounts to a ban from politics."
"That effectively blocks the situation."
"Secondly, we should not forget that the Turkish Parliament is in the process of amending the Criminal Code and deleting Articles 312 and 159, under the terms of which Akin Birdal was sentenced, and also Article 8 of the anti-terror law."
"In this situation, it is necessary firstly from a political point of view for Turkey to take the opportunity for dialogue, to which Akin Birdal has always referred; secondly, from a humanitarian point of view, it is necessary for Akin Birdal - the victim of a shady assassination attempt, as a result of which he is still suffering - to be given access to medical care in Europe too."
"It is with this in mind, as friends of Turkey, that we need to call on the Turkish Government to change its position."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when six groups in this House introduce a joint motion with the intention of adopting it, that must be a sign to the Turkish Government and the Turkish President that this issue, namely the sentencing of the President of the Human Rights Association of Turkey - whom many of us, for example Mr Swoboda, know from numerous discussions in recent years - is not simply a question which we are debating as a matter of course."
"For us, this issue is much more a touchstone of Turkey's ability to be democratic, and a touchstone of its compliance with human rights."
"Mr van den Broek did in fact recently present a report on the state of relations."
"We all still remember - from when we supported the customs union - the promises made by the then government on bringing their constitution and human rights practices into line, but these have not been fulfilled in the meantime. That is why I am convinced that we cannot hold out any specific prospects for Turkey's accession, while it is not possible for us to make real progress on these fundamental issues of freedom of expression and human rights."
"I am being very clear about this, although I am aware that we have noted a definite improvement in relations over the last few weeks."
"That is not enough."
"More progress is needed."
"The Turkish President, Mr Demirel, who after all appeared in Vienna just a few days ago, bearing demands relating to Turkey's inclusion in the group of applicant countries, must take the opportunity to pardon Akin Birdal."
"I think that this would be a practical test of Turkey's ability to have closer relations with Europe."
"Nothing else will take us any further."
"That is why we in the PPE Group support the joint motion."
"We hope that it will send out a positive signal, and that it will not introduce any further tensions into Europe-Turkey relations, as happened in the Ocalan case, for example."
"Mr President, firstly, the Birdal case concerns a sentence handed down by a Security Court in Turkey."
"Those courts, Commissioner, were described in a report by the Commission - evidently influenced by yourself on the grounds of experience, because you are well informed on Turkish issues - as inherently incapable of giving accused persons a fair trial."
"It was that kind of court which condemned him."
"Secondly, there is no possibility of appeal to a higher body."
"Consequently, the decision is irrevocable and all the consequences against Birdal will persist for the rest of his life, even the fact that he is not allowed to seek medical help, until he is even eliminated biologically, which they failed to do with the attempt against his life."
"The only way out is for Demirel to grant a pardon, and the only way that will happen is if the Commission brings pressure to bear for the pardon to be granted."
"This is not an issue which concerns Birdal alone."
"It concerns the freedoms of the Turkish people and even our own freedoms."
"The Ocalan problem is a similar one."
"We must resist Turkish and American pressure to have him extradited to Turkey, where he would be murdered either by execution or by being locked up in the Turkish prison camps, as often happens."
"Both men are symbols of the struggle for peace, freedom and democracy."
"Regarding Birdal in particular, I would point out that Turkey's Supreme Court stated as the reason why the Security Court condemned him, that his main preoccupation and orientation were freedom and peace."
"He is imprisoned because of that condemnation, and as Commissioners, you are morally responsible unless you intervene to secure him a pardon."
"Chalki seminary"
"Mr President, I am no longer surprised by acts of the Turkish state such as those we are talking about today, and I fear this will not be the last time we will have occasion to talk about such acts."
"Terrorism, flagrant violations of human rights and religious freedom, high-handed and unjustified decisions and even bomb attacks are just some of the elements which make up the picture of the Turkish state's tactics towards the Ecumenical Patriarchate, in other words the world-wide spiritual reference point for 300 million Orthodox Christians."
"The historical and traditional leader of the Orthodox Christians, the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, who usually prefers to keep a low profile, had this to say: 'we are not intercalated, transplanted or intrusive; we are the indigenous people of this land; the political equality, justice and religious freedom about which Turkish law speaks exist only on paper'."
"Turkey's motive in doing this is clear."
"It wishes to dispense with the Theological College of Halki once and for all."
"It wishes to get rid of the Christians in Turkey once and for all."
"It aims to terrorise those citizens, Turkish citizens, who happen to be Christians."
"The issue of the Theological College of Halki yet again highlights the more general problem of respect for human rights in Turkey."
"The European Union cannot play deaf when from the first day there has been an international outcry and condemnation of these unacceptable acts by Turkey."
"The European Union and specifically Mr van den Broek must demand protection for the Ecumenical Patriarchate and the Orthodox community, as required by the Treaty of Lausanne."
"Finally, he must also call for the protection of the Turkish people themselves, who are now daily being made victims of the Turkish state's tactics."
"Mr President, I believe that we need to draw a distinction here."
"We should not say that Turkey has a particular character, and then put all manner of things down to that."
"The demands are actually addressed to Turkey."
"The official act, by which the school was closed down, must be withdrawn."
"The Turkish Government has to make it clear here that freedom of religion - a fundamental human right - is guaranteed in Turkey."
"The Oecumenical Patriarchate demands that this official act be repealed, and here the European Union should make it perfectly clear that this is a basic condition for any further dialogue with Turkey."
"It is, after all, the highest seat of learning - if I may put it thus - of the branch of Orthodoxy centred on Constantinople, which does in fact exist throughout the world; given that respect for the rights of minorities has been enshrined in treaties, the way in which it has been treated is unacceptable."
"We should bear in mind, however, that behaviour of this kind also violates the laws of Islam, because freedom of religion is also one of the Prophet Mohammed's explicit commands; we should remember this ourselves and remind our counterparts of it."
"Mr President, the Ecumenical Patriarchate and the few remaining Greeks in Istanbul have been there for many centuries, long before first the Ottoman and then the Turkish State."
"As the Patriarch said, and Mr Roubatis too mentioned earlier, they are the indigenous people of the area, they belong to it; they did not come from elsewhere, they are neither foreigners nor intruders, no matter how much Turkey may have managed over the years to eliminate the Greek element with systematic machinations and every kind of violence."
"The most recent machination in the series is the illegal and unjustified dismissal of the members of the Supervisory Committee of the Theological College of Halki."
"The purpose of that is obvious: to confiscate the College's property and, mainly, to prevent it from working again."
"In substance, this is another act of terrorism by a country with no respect for human rights, and which has no hesitation in eliminating any kind of threat no matter what direction it comes from."
"We said the same thing this morning in a major debate on the events in Italy."
"I do not think it is necessary to say very much in order to stress the seriousness of the matter."
"Our joint resolution does that."
"I would simply like to say, in conclusion, that if Turkey continually defies and distances itself from European ideals, that is also happening because Europe, by constantly putting only economic interests and criteria first, has not made Turkey understand properly that human rights must have priority."
"Mr President, I am one of those who believe in a modern and progressive Turkey, which will at some time find its way into Europe."
"I have the impression, however, that Turkey itself does not believe that."
"One of the many indications we have is how Turkey is behaving towards the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, and how it has behaved in this specific case towards the Theological College of Halki."
"Turkey is blackening its own image, whereas it ought to understand that the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople brings prestige not only to Constantinople itself, but to Turkey as a state as well."
"Having essentially closed down the Halki College, Turkey is now taking action against the College's Supervisory Committee, which was the last sign that the College was still just about surviving, though not much more than that."
"You know that Congress in America has repeatedly shown concern about this specific issue."
"Today, at least, the European Parliament has woken up to it."
"Commissioner, I think the European Commission should do likewise."
"I understand Turkey's economic importance, I understand the importance of trade and economic agreements - in any event, there are businessmen all over who have relations with Turkey, even in my own country, and rightly so - but beyond that point, beyond trade, there are also human rights, there is also our civilisation, there is respect for diversity."
"Those things should not merely exist on paper, we must take action to demand them from the Turks, since it seems that they themselves have them in their constitution for the sake of appearances only, so that they can claim to respect human rights formally, whereas in substance they are violating them."
"Let us therefore respond to the call of Patriarch Bartholomew, who is a moderate religious leader, let us do something about this issue."
"I think it is important for our civilisation and for the values professed by the European Union."
"Mr President, I would say, first, that if we vote unanimously for this joint resolution, the Commission and the other institutions will be compelled to act at last, because now I hear that Uncle Sam has also said yes, and Congress is taking action."
"Do not be slow to imitate them when for once they are doing something positive."
"The second thing I want to say is that this act by the Turkish Government - I do not say Turkey, I distinguish Turkey, in other words the Turkish people, from the state, the reactionary and fascist regime in power - is undermining the operation of the Patriarchate by depriving it of its functional organ, the College of Halki."
"A college that was a beacon of ethics, culture, religion and peace for all peoples living in Asia Minor - as it happens I was born in the area, so I know this."
"So take action and put aside half-measures, put aside evasiveness, forget about investments, pipelines, oil and gas, and remember for once that you wish to be known as a democratic institution, a democratic organisation, the European Union."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the closing of the Halki School in Turkey is just one more stage in a process that has been continuing for years."
"Turkey takes liberties in a way that no other European country would, so we must demonstrate our opposition to what is a direct and totally unacceptable violation of religious freedom."
"What is happening in Turkey nowadays is exactly the same as in the past: persecution of the Kurds and the continuation of the war against them since 1984."
"The reaction of the Turkish Government against Italy today is in the same vein."
"The EU Member States must oppose such actions."
"We now have the opportunity to do so by requiring Turkey to comply with the undertaking it gave as part of the customs union agreement that we already have with it."
"We, as Member States of the European Union, must do our utmost to ensure that this agreement is adhered to, that the war against the Kurds is brought to an end, and that Mr Ocalan is given asylum in Italy."
"Anti-Semitism in Russia"
"Mr President, the primitive, irresponsible and even villainous nature of Makashov's statements revolt and worry us for more than one reason."
"The incitement given by former General Makashov to hate Jews responds to a system that is well tested."
"Although the economic, social and political situation is alarming, some people cannot resist the temptation to bolster political and national unity by issuing messages of hate and accusation against a particular community, in this case the Jewish community."
"It is worrying, first and foremost, to see that instead of unreservedly condemning the anti-Semitic utterances of one of its members, the Communist Party of the Russian Federation prefers to make solidarity its main concern and refuses to assume the responsibilities that ensue in such circumstances. In this instance, they would involve bringing a motion of censure against Makashov."
"This is all the more regrettable because there is no shortage of international mechanisms to show the Russian Federation what to do."
"The more the Duma fails to distance itself from such behaviour, the further it moves away from compliance with the principles to which the Russian Federation had committed itself when it became a member of the Council of Europe."
"We therefore call on the Duma to reverse its decision and to reconsider bringing a motion of censure."
"Mr President, I must present Mr Barros Moura's apologies."
"I should nevertheless like to say a few words on behalf of my group."
"I believe that the unfortunate events repeated here are unacceptable."
"Anti-Semitism is a form of racism which has done so much damage in Europe and further afield that we need to refute all such statements in the strongest possible terms."
"In particular, I am disturbed at the failure of the Duma, or the other party members, to respond in an appropriate way."
"When a major catastrophe has befallen the Jewish population on this continent, and when there have been various anti-Semitic actions and statements in Eastern Europe and Russia of all places, it is unacceptable for us to tolerate an anti-Semitic statement now."
"We must therefore refute this in the strongest possible terms, and call on the representatives in the Russian Parliament to tell their colleagues quite clearly that an anti-Semitic statement must not and never can be tolerated."
"Mr President, if you look at what is happening in Russia at the present time and listen to General Makashov's statements, a cold shiver really does run down your spine, because here it is obvious that the most evil, communist reactionaries of Stalinism are re-emerging, and that anti-Semitic statements are being made in such a way as to cause those in Russia towards whom they are directed to be genuinely afraid."
"I should like to remind you of one point: Russia is a country in which there is still a so-called autonomous Jewish area today."
"It is the region to which Stalin once sent many Jews."
"It is in eastern Siberia, and a small group of these Jews still lives there today, which really feels threatened and fears for its survival."
"These Jews are only one representative example of many others in Russia."
"We cannot simply remain silent!"
"In this century, we have already seen terrible acts of the utmost cruelty."
"We cannot accept this kind of thing, we cannot witness this kind of thing again!"
"Commissioner, earlier we also debated the issue of food aid."
"Perhaps this matter could be raised in that context!"
"Mr President, we started our look at topical events with the dramatic food situation in Russia and we are ending with a tragic aspect of spiritual life: anti-Semitism."
"It distresses me very much to find that after centuries of pogroms and impossible living conditions in the stettels , our colleagues in the Duma are not prepared to denounce violent expressions of anti-Semitism."
"It is difficult for Russian politicians of Jewish origin to make a career while retaining authentic Jewish names."
"This is why it was only recently revealed that it was for this reason that the Russian Prime Minister took the name Primakov."
"Since May rabbis and jeshiwa students have been beaten up and fire bombs thrown into synagogues."
"As a Parliament we must continue to urge the Duma to take steps to combat racism and xenophobia and to adopt the necessary laws to this end."
"At the same time the legislation within the European Union against political parties with such views is inadequate."
"Financial penalties and imprisonment do not work and banning a racist party only leads to another party being set up under a different name."
"I believe a good legal remedy is to take away rights to stand for election."
"Such a measure does not exist in my country but the French courts have clearly understood the need for this."
"The removal of the right of xenophobic parties to stand for election must be encouraged. At the Duma we must continue to stress the importance of point 9 against anti-Semitism in Russia."
"Mr President, everyone owes it to everyone else to respect their dignity."
"That applies equally in economic crises and when times are good."
"Anti-Semitism reminds us of our continent's darkest days, and of times when countless people treated these values with contempt."
"That is why it is our generation's common task to nip anti-Semitism in the bud."
"That is true both of our own countries and our partners."
"That is why we are calling on the Duma to be more sensitive and firmly to refute statements which are an affront to the dignity of Jews in Russia."
"The fact is that extreme nationalist groups in Russia are being courted by this kind of despicable populism on the part of a few politicians, and that presents a danger to democracy in the country."
"Mr van den Broek, we know that the grass-roots organisations in Moscow are the ones which are trying to take action on this."
"I ask you now: is it not possible to give the money on the TACIS democracy line which you have not yet spent to these groups, so that you really do spend the money where it is needed, as we discussed on Tuesday?"
"Mr President, the Alleanza Nazionale delegation supports the motion for a resolution on the resurgence of violent anti-Semitism in Russia."
"Unfortunately history seems to have taught us nothing, because this is not the first time so-called Jewish plots have been blamed when a country is in crisis."
"So we need to react with maximum firmness to isolate these expressions of political lunacy and put all the resources at our disposal into nipping this insurgence of hate and discrimination in the bud."
"This is why I am anxious that you should know, for your information, that General Makashov received - I am quoting an authoritative Italian daily, the Corriere della Sera - ' tumultuous applause during the parades on the 81st anniversary of the October Revolution'."
"Well, delegations from the two Italian communist parties were at those parades."
"Those parties are Rifondazione Comunista and the Partito dei Comunisti Italiani, the former part of the Prodi government's majority, the latter holding some ministries in the D'Alema government."
"And so far there does not seem to have been any request for clarification or disassociation from the President of the Italian Council to those who are in his government and at the same time march side by side with people - communists and ultranationalists - who incite others to ethnic and religious hatred."
"Mr President, the human rights debates in Parliament are never heartening, but they are nonetheless necessary."
"I should now like briefly to give my reactions to the items on the agenda, beginning with Algeria."
"It is clear to everyone, and I have also heard no voices to the contrary in this House, that while there might have been perhaps slight progress in the field of democratisation and freedom of the press in Algeria, an extraordinary amount remains to be done."
"This is precisely why, for some time now, the Commission and the European Union have been allocating considerable resources in order to promote the freedom of the press in Algeria."
"You will know that the Mediterranean countries are allocated a relatively generous budget, a large part of which goes to Algeria."
"It is somewhat distressing to be speaking of freedom of the press and in the same breath to be denouncing the unacceptable and constantly escalating violence in Algeria, with dozens of innocent civilians murdered in cold blood over recent weeks."
"That brings it home to us even more that a great deal has to change in Algeria before it will be possible to speak of a democratic state based on the rule of law."
"We know how complicated it is."
"We also know that the Union is trying to maintain dialogue with Algeria."
"It is even trying to conclude an association agreement which could also institutionalise political dialogue, a point on which Algeria is very reticent."
"I can agree with much of what has been said about Yugoslavia and President Milosevic, which is another subject on which we have exchanged views on many occasions. It is not for nothing that we are still maintaining a comprehensive and extensive sanctions policy against Yugoslavia."
"Our criticisms and objections also concern the freedom of the press. Most of the media in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia which are now also coming under pressure, such as Radio Index, Donas or Nasa Borba, have received financial assistance from the Community."
"In 1997 around ECU 4 million was allocated to support the independent media in Yugoslavia, while in 1998 the figure was more than ECU 5.6 million of the total amount of ECU 10 million provided for the whole country."
"It is therefore receiving every attention."
"You will understand why when we speak of Yugoslavia at the present time we place the emphasis on efforts to solve the serious problem of Kosovo."
"This does not mean, however, that we are paying any less attention to other aspects of democratisation and democracy in the Republic of Yugoslavia."
"But on that point too I must say that Mr Milosevic does not exactly give us grounds for much optimism."
"I agree with all that has been said about the International Criminal Court. The Commission is also naturally pleased at the successful conclusion of the conference which set up the Court."
"Although it was not possible to respect everybody's wishes, the rules governing the Court's statutes form the basis for an effective and credible tribunal which will mean that the most terrible crimes against humanity no longer need go unpunished while potential criminals, and this is certainly no less important, will also be discouraged."
"We therefore express the hope that the 60 ratifications required will be quickly reached."
"We have often discussed Turkey's political situation and more specifically its human rights performance."
"We share Parliament's concern at the sentencing of Akir Birdal and the recent dismissal of the management of the theological school in Chalki."
"Anybody who has already had the chance to see our progress report on the political situation in Turkey will see our concern clearly expressed."
"I was in contact very recently with the Turkish Foreign Minister and I said to him: look, you have asked the European Union to judge you for future membership of the European Union according to the Copenhagen criteria."
"So noblesse oblige , let us put it to the political test."
"Let us above all intensify the political dialogue in order to try and improve these often unacceptable situations. What I have mentioned here is part of this."
"Finally, I fully agree with all that has been said about the resurgence of anti-Semitism in Russia. Intolerable and unacceptable are the only words for it."
"Unfortunately it is not the first time in Russia's history that attempts have been made to use members of the Jewish population as scapegoats for a crisis. Against this background, the anti-Semitic statements of a member of the Duma, a member of the Communist Party, are all the more intolerable, especially now that members of this same Communist Party have taken steps to prevent the lifting of immunity for the said member."
"Fortunately, on the other hand, a number of prominent figures, including the Mayor of Moscow, Mr Luschkov, have distanced themselves from such statements as have a number of leading organisations in Russia. It is also encouraging, and we should give all due attention to this more positive side, that the Russian Public Prosecutor has said he will be investigating the matter and that the incident is being discussed with the Russian Security Council."
"Finally, in all probability the Duma will be returning to this question next week and I could well imagine that Members of the European Parliament, who have close contacts with members of the Duma within the Parliamentary Cooperation Council under the partnership agreement between the Union and Russia, will question their colleagues on this subject and express their concern, as we will also be doing in our regular contacts with the Russian Government. Thank you very much, Mr President, that concludes what I wanted to say on these matters."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"Do you have another question, Mr Swoboda?"
"Madam President, I asked the Commissioner quite specifically whether he was prepared to do everything in his power to ensure that the money set aside for the Serbian press or other media is also actually paid out quickly."
"Otherwise some media would not only have to stop operating because of Milosevic, but also because of the money arriving too late."
"Could you please give a brief reply, Commissioner?"
"Madam President, what I have to say relates to the forthcoming vote. The point is that something has once again happened this time which I already complained about months ago: the joint motions for resolutions are indeed available in all the language versions, but the original texts are not."
"You know how often joint motions are rejected here, and then the original texts have to be put to the vote."
"But then, according to Rule 102(1), that would not be possible, because they are not available in all the languages."
"After I complained last time, the situation was rectified."
"Today, for the first time, it is once again the case that we do not have the original texts, and I would ask for steps to be taken to ensure that the proper arrangements are made next time!"
"I can understand your objection, Mr Posselt, but you must bear in mind that there are a huge number of translations which might then have to be carried out."
"I shall bring this up again, but there is already a decision on the matter."
"Mr Roubatis, do you have another question for Mr van den Broek?"
"Madam President, in the last debate all the speakers asked Mr van den Broek to do something specific about the closure of the Theological College of Halki."
"Mr van den Broek did not tell us specifically what he intends to do, what specific action he will be taking, to ensure that the Turkish authorities allow the college to function as it ought to."
"Mr President, I promise you that the next time I am in contact with Turkey I will ask for this matter to be given attention and I will also convey the feelings of the Commission, which are the same as those of Parliament."
"Thank you, Mr van den Broek."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place in a few moments."
"We shall now proceed to the votes."
"VOTES"
"In our explanation of vote, we should like to focus attention on the importance of patent applications and other patent-processing procedures being carried out in all Member States' languages."
"Any other system would be detrimental to enterprise and initiative in business development within the European Union."
"We are delighted at the way in which the report highlights patent processing and language."
"The European patent system is based on the Munich Convention of 1973, which is an intergovernmental agreement."
"Patents issued under this Convention can be applied in all the countries which have ratified it, which include all the EU countries and many others."
"The Convention makes it possible to obtain patent protection in more than one state through a centralised procedure which is administered by the European Patent Office."
"Patents issued under this procedure are subject to the national law of the individual countries."
"There have subsequently been attempts to introduce two other patent conventions or agreements: the Luxembourg Convention of 1975 on the Community patent, supplemented by the 1989 Agreement relating to Community patents."
"These two instruments have still not entered into force."
"Now it is planned to create yet another Community patent, which will be valid throughout the EU."
"The Member States' courts will only have jurisdiction on questions of infringement of Community patents, and it is envisaged that the authority dealing with appeals will be the European Court of First Instance."
"We believe that the introduction of a Community patent is a completely superfluous arrangement."
"Since attempts have been made at agreements on Community patents which have still not entered into force after 23 years, why should we make the same mistake again now?"
"Moreover, a Community patent would be valid in fewer countries than a patent issued under the Munich Convention."
"We can fully endorse the recital in the report which states: 'the current combination of the European Patent Convention and the national patent systems presents a well-functioning and flexible patents system in the EEA'."
"The proposal to set up a Community patent system is an example of unnecessary regulation and duplication of bureaucracy at EU level."
"As is clearly stated in recital E, the present European system of national and international patents is working well."
"We have therefore voted against the report."
"A well-established international system for patents has existed in Europe for a long time."
"It functions very well and is linked to a major standardisation initiative."
"There is no reason to set up a new system for the sole purpose of introducing an EU symbol."
"Any reform should therefore be carried out to the present system in order to bring it up to date with modern industrial developments."
"The European Union has forged a reputation for itself in the aeronautical and space industry."
"Today, it is an economically competitive and promising sector that includes a number of successful companies. Airbus Industrie , which was established by France and Germany in 1970, now accounts for 50 % of the world market in its sector following the Asian crisis."
"Such results must not, however, blind us to the economic realities: as we approach the new century, we are losing ground."
"Our many national enterprises are no longer able to keep up with global competition on their own."
"The large American enterprises, in particular, are pursuing a relentless strategy of attack."
"Moreover, we are currently experiencing a situation whereby the national demands for military aircraft are falling and national defence spending is being restricted."
"Therefore, it is urgent for the sector to be restructured, as the Hoppenstedt report points out."
"This is the only possible solution if we wish to achieve a genuine concentration of production and a real synergy of financial investments, and to optimise the results of research and technology transfers from the military to the civilian sector."
"The European Union can provide this rapid and decisive momentum, which is all the more necessary since we have little time in which to implement this economic rationale."
"In this connection, we must today take the same steps that were taken over a decade ago by the United States: opening up the military and civilian industrial structures, globalising defence and space activities, etcetera."
"The fact that Europe has a potential viable base gives it all the more reason to commit itself more decisively."
"Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy has worked hard on this matter, showing due regard to the 'employment' dimension."
"It should never be forgotten that over 700 companies provide a livelihood for some 370 000 families throughout the European Union."
"We cannot therefore allow this sector of jobs to gradually disappear."
"Nor can we leave ourselves without this industry if we still wish to comply with our responsibilities in the area of foreign policy and international diplomacy."
"Consequently, I support Mr Hoppenstedt's report and the free choice he gives both to the enterprises involved and to Member States in regard to the action that should be taken."
"The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted overall in favour of the report by Mr Hoppenstedt on the European aerospace industry, because this sector will be an important source of employment for Europe in the future."
"No fewer than 377 510 people were directly employed in the sector in 1997, not counting the downstream employment in the form of jobs with subcontractors and so on."
"The proposal is aimed at securing increased cooperation in research and development in the European aerospace industry, cooperation which we regard as essential if this sector is to survive in competition with its American counterpart."
"The American aerospace industry benefits from the large orders placed by the US armed forces, and from the know-how which the military provides to private firms free of charge."
"However, the Hoppenstedt report also includes proposals for the joint development of military aircraft and for a restructuring of both the military and civil aerospace industry, with a view to encouraging the consolidation of the defence industries."
"This position conflicts with Denmark's stance on defence and security policy, and we have therefore abstained on paragraphs 6 and 7, since we do not wish to stand in the way of other Member States moving in this direction."
"I think that a distinction should be made between the research and industrial activities carried out in the civil branch of the aerospace sector and those carried out in the military branch."
"The EU should confine its activities to civilian matters, bearing in mind that, to date, the Treaty contains no provision for combining the two branches."
"Consequently, I do not support the Commission communication on the aerospace industry."
"I would prefer to see restrictions imposed on the industry's activities and clear rules established on how those activities should be carried out."
"This does not mean that I am totally opposed to research and industrial activities in this area, but I think that the situation with regard to military activities should be clarified."
"Nor am I in favour of the report's underlying view, which took shape following a meeting between six EU Defence Ministers earlier in the year to discuss integration and restructuring of the defence industry."
"It is particularly regrettable that representatives of the Swedish defence industry took part in the meeting, since Sweden is a non-aligned and neutral country."
"I shall support the amendment tabled by the Green Group, and I shall vote against the report in its entirety in the final vote."
"Of course it is a good idea to strengthen the aerospace industry."
"However it is difficult, if not downright impossible, for neutral and non-aligned countries to participate in any activity which links together the aerospace industry, Member States' defence industries and the CFSP."
"Nowadays, there is no longer any direct threat to the security of the European Union and its Member States."
"Against this background, they should be striving to reduce arms production, which not only deploys large amounts of resources that could be allocated to other important activities in the Member States, but also generates exports which deprive underdeveloped countries of vital resources that are needed above all to build up their social infrastructures."
"Thus the continuing manufacture of armaments in itself constitutes a potential threat, since the existence of more weapons only increases the likelihood of their being used."
"If, despite all this, the situation in the world develops in such a way in the future that the Member States democratically decide to increase their arms production, then I can see nothing to prevent the military aircraft industry from becoming a monopoly market, as is pointed out in the report."
"Nevertheless, it is of the utmost importance for the Union and its Member States to strive to reduce the aircraft industry's heavy dependence on military orders, otherwise manufacturing will not be able to develop on its own, regardless of the security situation."
"As the rapporteur on a related Commission communication on defence related industries, I warmly welcome Mr Hoppenstedt's Report on the aerospace sector."
"These two sectors of EU industry are so vital to the future economic success of us all that national and party political differences should be put aside as far as is possible when we discuss them."
"I share the report's desire to see strong EU wide industrial groups in aerospace manufacturing, not only to secure the many jobs and high skill levels they employ but also to maintain the EU's ability to choose when to compete with and when to cooperate with the USA in this field."
"If we do not give the companies concerned a clear green light to get on with the job of restructuring their operations to this end, we will have only ourselves to blame for the Hobson's Choice which would be ours - to buy American aircraft or to buy nothing."
"I am glad that British companies are belying the now inaccurate stereotype of my country as a nation of Eurosceptics by playing a leading role in cooperation - the managers and staff of Westland and British Aerospace are cooperating with EU partners for sound business reasons, rather than following the isolationist dogma of the Tory Party which once claimed to speak for British business."
"As this report points out, in the one sector of satellites alone, the world can expect 1500 launches in the next decade - as politicians we need to give our companies every chance to compete for those contracts, not tie them in red tape on the launchpad."
"I would like to begin by congratulating our rapporteur, Mr Hoppenstedt, on his excellent work."
"The communication from the European Commission analyses the current situation of the aerospace industry."
"It provides an overview without highlighting the specific problems of any given sector within this European industry."
"This is an interesting approach."
"However, the European aerospace market has evolved since this communication was published and Parliament's report has emphasised that change."
"Europe has genuine potential for the future."
"To take full advantage of this potential, the European industry must benefit from favourable conditions to enable it, in particular, to establish joint enterprise strategies."
"Such strategies will enable this high-tech sector to compete under equal conditions with the American industry. For its part, the US industry has the advantage of not having to contend with national divisions of the market and benefits from substantial national aid to research and development."
"I fully agree with our rapporteur's opinion on the statement by Germany, France and the United Kingdom of 9 December 1997, and on the letter of intent from the German, Spanish, French, Italian, Swedish and British Ministers for Defence."
"Indeed, their commitment to promoting the consolidation of defence industries is an essential political factor and a positive sign for European manufacturers."
"The proposed coordination of activities in the aerospace industry is commendable, but there should be no linkage with military activities as proposed in paragraph 6, which mentions the need to develop the next generation of military aircraft."
"Instead, we should be focusing on the importance of developing the aerospace industry entirely independently of the military sector."
"The FPÖ supports the political statements and the declarations of intent in this motion for a resolution, but is abstaining from the vote on the text as a whole, because the additional increase in financial and economic aid to this region, as called for in the motion, does not appear to be adequately structured or guaranteed to be efficient."
"Displaced persons (continuation)"
"The next item is the continuation of the debate on the report by Mr Wiebenga."
"Madam President, to add to what other speakers have been saying, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Wiebenga on the work he has carried out over several months that has been both efficient and courteous. Having said that, Madam President, my first comment relates to certain speeches that have been made that amount to nothing short of dangerous popularity seeking."
"Their only effect is to endanger and, of course, threaten the cause of those whom we are dealing with. And, indeed, all of us, when faced with the problem of offering adequate protection to those who need it at a given moment due to the unrest in their countries, must give a response that is appropriate, effective and balanced."
"In short, we must give a response that is in line with the area of freedom, security and justice we are in the process of building with the third pillar."
"Madam President, those who say that the Structural Funds or the Cohesion Fund should be restricted for those Member States that are allegedly hindering these measures are not helping matters either."
"This is true, firstly, because it amounts to a statement of intent and secondly, because although those countries advocate unanimity in decision-making, establishing this type of statement of intent would make no sense from either a political or legal point of view, because, as I said, in the final analysis, it would greatly hinder this report's progress."
"In relation to the two proposals put forward by the Commission, Madam President, I would like to congratulate the Commissioner."
"They are both very interesting and balanced proposals. I believe that they will make progress and I hope that we will see evidence of their results in the near future."
"And now, Madam President, allow me to fly the flag of those of us who maintain that decisions in this respect should be taken unanimously and explain why we are of this opinion."
"It is certainly not out of any desire to boost our popularity, less still because we do not wish these measures to be taken."
"It is simply that Mrs Gradin based the proposal on Article K.3(2)(b) and did so correctly , because that is the law currently in force."
"But we must obviously bear in mind that the Amsterdam Treaty - which has still not entered into force, but which represents a political decision of great importance - establishes that unanimity is required for this issue."
"It therefore cannot be ignored."
"I fully understand the stance taken by the Commissioner, but it should not be presumed that those who advocate unanimity do so because they are not prepared to go further."
"Those in favour of unanimity are merely showing that they are aware of the fact that, through hard work, 15 Member States reached a pact in Amsterdam that states that, for five years, decisions in this area must be taken unanimously."
"It is because we are keen to see this idea progress that we have put forward this proposal. This is something that needs to be achieved."
"My second remark is of a political nature."
"Clearly, the 15 Member States have to agree and this proposal will only progress if that happens."
"In this respect, Mr Nassauer is right."
"If one section of the proposal is agreed on by a qualified majority - as permitted by Article K.3 - yet the other section is agreed on unanimously, we will be left with a situation that is totally unbalanced and disproportionate from both a political and legal point of view."
"Therefore, Madam President, I repeat: we have tabled amendments in favour of unanimity and, realistically speaking, we want this proposal to move forward."
"We will politically support this proposal through our governments, but we believe that it will only move forward if we respect what was agreed at Amsterdam, and this requires the 15 Member States to reach an agreement rather than a qualified majority."
"Madam President, the Socialist side of the House is currently undergoing a very interesting process of change."
"This began with the governments, firstly with New Labour's new realistic attitude towards the issue of asylum, which admittedly does not yet go far enough, but the first signs of which are visible. It was followed by the discussion paper presented by the Austrian Home Affairs Minister, Mr Schlögl - also a Socialist - and now we have the German Home Affairs Minister, Mr Schily, all of a sudden saying that immigration into Germany and the influx of asylum seekers and refugees of civil war have exceeded both reasonable and manageable levels."
"He does not even say 'have reached'; he says 'have exceeded'."
"It is certainly interesting to see this, standing as it does in stark contrast to the point of view consistently represented by the left side of this House."
"This shows precisely the difference between ideology and practice."
"The practice is, of course, due to two points."
"Firstly, the figures, which Mr Pirker has already explained so impressively here."
"I really should like to say that Germany, for example, has, over a period of ten years, admitted an average of 50 % of all asylum seekers, and at times up to two thirds of all refugees of civil war."
"That really is an extreme situation."
"Secondly, this new attitude on the part of some ministers is of course also due to public opinion, and in politics we have to be realistic and take public opinion into account."
"We want to give shelter to the persecuted."
"We want to give them protection and security, but it is precisely when I want to do this that I need acceptance, and I can only win this acceptance if the burden of admitting the people is shared, so that quite rightly the burden falls equally on each of the Member States."
"We cannot content ourselves with a few set phrases on this, as this proposal - or pseudo-proposal - does; we need real burden-sharing based on definite quotas of people."
"The Bavarian Minister of the Interior, Günther Beckstein, has proposed to you, Commissioner, that a central European office should be established to set these definite quotas and allocate them."
"We are still a very long way from this; we would be happy if at least a first step were taken here towards more Europe, but this pseudo-proposal is a step towards less Europe."
"You see, it tries to avoid solidarity and at the same time to patch up this gap with words."
"That is why we must also reject both these proposals, because we believe that they would be more suitably entitled: missing the point."
"I really do believe that it is possible for any Member State to be faced with a disproportionate share of the burden, and I should like to say this to our Spanish Members, amongst others: it is actually not the case that this issue only concerns Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and one or two other countries."
"Something might blow up tomorrow in the Mediterranean area which then affects Spain, for example, in just the same way, and here too there will be calls for solidarity."
"Solidarity is reciprocal, though, and this problem can affect all Member States to different degrees and at different times."
"That is why, before the catastrophe overtakes us, before problems arise, a set of burdensharing instruments need to be created, and here I must add - and I am grateful to Mr Pradier for what he said on this subject today - that this would of course include prevention."
"We must not stand by and watch until the influxes of refugees descend upon us; instead, we must intervene in good time - as for example in Kosovo - to ensure that the conditions are created on the ground to enable people to live in safety in their homes."
"Thank you, Mrs Gradin."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m."
"Visas/Airport transit"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is certainly not the most important report of the week."
"It is, therefore, all the more intriguing that seven minutes' speaking time should have been allocated for such a relatively insignificant report, when at other times there is not enough speaking time."
"Quite honestly, I do not know what I can tell you about this report that would fill seven minutes. Allow me, therefore, to be somewhat more brief."
"You can already tell from the title, which the President read out, that this is essentially to do with technical problems, although these technical problems are not quite without their difficulties either, if you take a look at what the Council has asked us to decide on."
"The problems start with the part of the report concerning this uniform form for a visa, where the Council is obviously trying - in a departure from the provisions of the Treaty - to make its legal position more favourable for the individual Member States. It deals with the issues relating to the format of the form and the format of this visa under Article K.3 of the Treaty, despite there actually being a special provision in the Treaty, in Article 100c."
"The latter legal base also means that this is no longer a joint action and would in principle need to be implemented in the form of a directive. That is precisely what we have stated in the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs."
"The further problem with the Council's ideas is the fact that in a whole series of articles in the joint action, it defines itself as the executive authority."
"Here we have ensured that either the Commission or the Member States are named as the executive authority instead, at least in our report."
"This is simply because we believe this to be more correct than for the Council - which is in fact after all the co-legislator, or in this case the Community legislator - to assume that role itself, thus also, as it were, calling into question certain principles of the separation of powers."
"In the second part of the report, the airport transit visas, the same problem occurs, amongst others."
"At least the right legal base has, in our opinion, been selected here."
"It is, however, mainly about harmonising technical rules to combat illegal immigration and about better checks at airports."
"I should like to ask you to vote in favour, here in the plenary, of the corrections decided on by the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs, and on that note I would conclude my statement on this not especially important, but perhaps also not wholly insignificant report."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as far as the uniform format for the form is concerned, I agree with the rapporteur that this can actually be adopted as it stands following our vote in the committee."
"Since this is a form which is produced solely for the purpose of having a visa issued on it, Article 100c of the EC Treaty is the right legal base, even though the jurists were again unable to agree on whether this assessment was correct."
"We did actually have two reports on the subject."
"I think it is necessary, from a political point of view, for the uniform format for the form to be implemented on the basis of Article 100c."
"Parliament has always given priority to procedures which allow decisions to be taken by a qualified majority."
"With the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, unanimity will, unfortunately, be the rule in the case of visa arrangements for a further five years, before decisions are taken by a qualified majority."
"However, it is clear which direction we are going in."
"In the field of, 'visas, asylum, immigration and other policies related to free movement of persons', the Council will act by a qualified majority in the foreseeable future."
"I do not believe, however, that after another five years of unanimity, the Council will find it any easier to act by a qualified majority than it does now."
"I also support the rapporteur's view that we are in the business of adopting uniform arrangements in Europe in the fields covered by Title IV of the Amsterdam Treaty."
"In that sense, the European Commission's role will in any case need to be increased accordingly."
"That means that it is incumbent upon it, and not the Council, to present technical specifications for this form, and it is for the Member States to be available to discuss production centres."
"On the airport transit visa, the European Court of Justice has in fact delivered a very clear ruling to Parliament."
"The legal base of Article K.3 only provides for cooperation with the Member States in this field."
"That was already clear to us in the committee."
"We do, however, want to make the Council stronger than the Member States and thus help it to take common action, including on visas and illegal immigration."
"In the committee, we have already made both the arrangements applicable to statutory stateless persons and refugees and the exceptions to the requirement for a visa dependent on a joint decision in the Council."
"We wish to achieve the same thing for amendments to the joint list."
"I therefore also urge you to support the corresponding amendment to delete Article 4."
"Article 9 gives each individual Member State the possibility of suspending the positive lists."
"I believe, however, that given that we have common external borders, we need to have common rules on visas and visa stamps."
"That includes these transit visas."
"I think that if the main purpose of these visas is to combat illegal immigration, then it would be appropriate to have a uniform procedure."
"That is what is provided for in the Amsterdam Treaty."
"I would therefore urge you to continue on the path which Parliament has already chosen, and also to delete Article 9."
"Madam President, I would firstly like to say that I am speaking on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, and I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and say that the PPE will follow his advice and broadly support his report."
"Secondly, I would like to comment on these two proposals for joint action. Although they are not at the very heart of third pillar policies or generally part of the policy to build an area of freedom, security and justice, they are extremely interesting because they represent a very small step forward, a point of departure and, as such, a situation that will be repeated with other texts."
"Why am I referring to this?"
"I do so because it is basically an issue involving how we interpret our texts, general rules and exceptions to limited interpretations."
"We have the example of the ruling of 12 May, which has already been quoted, in which the Court of Justice of the European Communities strictly but - I believe - correctly interpreted Article 100c of the EC Treaty. It pointed out that this Treaty refers to entry visas and not transit visas."
"Given that this Article is an exception to Article K.1(3), it has to be interpreted separately."
"Why do we therefore want the other proposal - that on the visa format for exceptional cases when the person travelling has no documents - to be based on Article 100c?"
"We support this because it is Parliament's responsibility to do so."
"In the same way as I said before that we need to adapt to what was agreed in the Amsterdam Treaty in order to determine the rules relating to the issue we discussed a few moments ago, here Parliament's role is to go as far as the texts will allow."
"And it is evident that this visa, given to those who do not possess the correct, legal and legitimate documents, goes further than a visa itself. But there is no doubt that it is an incidental part of an identification document and one that therefore acts as a visa in terms of Regulation No 1683/95."
"Parliament must therefore vote in favour of interpreting Article 100c to include something that is not expressly stated in the text. But we are referring here to the particular case of entry visas and, in general terms, it is correct to take Article 100c as the legal basis for this."
"Therefore, Madam President, in my opinion - and here I am speaking from a purely personal point of view -, Parliament must act consistently. It must take legal texts to the limits of their interpretation, without of course resorting to sterile intransigence that simply means that proposals do not meet with success."
"Madam President, today we are examining two draft joint actions put forward by the Council aimed at harmonising some specific aspects of visa policy and airport transit policy."
"Although we are dealing with very formal issues, for example the uniform format of the forms for affixing visas, we should not forget that behind such formal issues lie some of the characteristics that are rapidly setting the tone of the immigration and asylum policy implemented recently by the Community authorities and Member States in the European Union."
"As regards the joint action concerning the uniform format of visas and, in particular, the analysis of the legal basis, we agree with the view of the rapporteur and the European Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs, which has studied the relevant legal basis for this action, that the proposal should come from the European Commission and not the Council."
"It should be a proposal for a directive rather than for joint action and thus come under the Community's immigration and asylum policy, as recommended in the Amsterdam Treaty, instead of within the context of a cooperation policy of the Member States."
"What is more - and here we are focusing on the content of the proposal -, it is no use giving a general description of a uniform format for visas at European level so that, ultimately, Member States can decide on the technical procedures they wish to use."
"In the same way, the form must be valid for all the countries of the European Union without the possibility of any exceptions."
"Would this not be an appropriate way of formulating a genuine Community policy on visas?"
"Apart from these legal and political issues, I should like to stress the fact that harmonising these aspects of Community visa policy must not lead to greater restrictions and limitations for the immigration and asylum policy, which are hidden behind the demands for increased bureaucracy and complex visa requests."
"We cannot allow this to make it more difficult for refugees and asylumseekers to reach a safe country."
"To sum up, the provisions being adopted in relation to a uniform visa format and airport transit must form part of a genuine Community policy on immigration and asylum. Within this policy, we must ensure that the various actions are subject to legal and democratic control and that the main principles involved are solidarity and respect for human rights, against the constant backdrop of the provisions of the Geneva Convention and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms."
"Madam President, the visa issue is a constant topic of debate in Parliament, a state of affairs which is attributable, amongst other things, to an inability to reach agreement on a way out of the problem."
"The question of visas for citizens of third countries, as well as the report on the same topic, are the product of the legal problems arising in committee."
"The Court of Justice has set aside the Council's decision on such matters as the grey list, naming the countries that are required to have visas."
"Despite this, the list is still in use and has been for nearly five years."
"In practical terms, this means that Romania, for example, has to arrange a visa for its negotiators to participate in top-level meetings in Brussels, since Romania is still on a list which, despite having been annulled, is still in operation."
"Such a situation is absurd!"
"Consequently, the overriding and all-important issue with regard to visas is still unresolved."
"At the same time, we now have to decide on the wording and appearance of the documents themselves, so that their format can be agreed and harmonised."
"I think this is the wrong approach."
"However, the main purpose of the report is to change the legal basis from the third pillar and intergovernmental cooperation to the first pillar and supranational control."
"The Swedish members of the Green Group do not agree with such a proposal, and support intergovernmental cooperation. However, the rest of the group view matters differently."
"I should like to recall yet again that Scandinavia has 40 years of expertise and experience in operating the Nordic Passport Union. Without centralisation, directives and harmonisation we have achieved a functioning passport union and a successful international visa policy."
"It is a pity that more outside attention has not been paid to this, since our experience could have been of value in developing the approach in this area."
"Finally, I should like to remind the House that the Amsterdam Treaty has still not come into force and therefore cannot be used as a reference in this context."
"Madam President, Mr Lehne was quite right when he told us earlier that his report was very technical, but other problems can be seen behind the technical considerations."
"Allow me to begin with the technical aspects of the document."
"I do not share his views on the legal basis."
"I believe that article K.3 of the Treaty on European Union was perfectly sound."
"Nor do I share his view that the Commission should play the role that was initially assigned to the Council with regard to a joint action."
"However, this purely technical matter does, in fact, raise another that is of an institutional nature and that must one day be tackled, that is, deciding what the respective powers of the Council and the Commission are and what they should be."
"I have the greatest respect for the Commission, for the Commissioners and for the 15 000 officials who work under them."
"But the fact remains that the Commissioners are appointed, and their democratic legitimacy is, shall I say, far from evident."
"In contrast, the Council, which is made up of the representatives of the governments, does have a certain democratic legitimacy."
"And this is the real problem in terms of the institutional evolution of the European Union."
"There is a desire to attach the traditional parliamentary relationships that exist in our nations to the European institutions and make the Commission a pseudo-government."
"However, the Commission is not a government."
"The Commission is not the choice of a majority."
"The Commission is not supported by a majority in the European Parliament."
"The Commission is an institution that is half political and half technocratic."
"And, therefore, I cannot agree with Mr Lehne, nor indeed the majority of this House, when they insist in, may I say, contesting the Council's powers, which are perfectly legitimate in democratic terms, for the benefit of a Commission that would be the future government of the future European State, on the basis of a hypothetical European people."
"In fact, Europe has not one but several peoples; it has several traditions, several histories and several languages."
"Therefore, where the institutional evolution of the European Union is concerned, it is essential that we should, on the one hand, restore greater political authority to the Council and, on the other, involve national parliaments in the European Parliament's work by extending its powers."
"That is how we will achieve a truly democratic Europe."
"Madam President, I wish to thank Mr Lehne for his valuable report on the two proposals for joint action relating to air transit and to a uniform format for documents for affixing visas."
"These two proposals form part of an ongoing process."
"The aim is to harmonise the rules governing the visa policy of the Member States."
"Not all aspects of visa policy are covered by Article 100c of the present Treaty."
"Some are adopted on the basis of Title VI."
"However, when the Amsterdam Treaty enters into force it will regroup all aspects of visa policy in the first pillar under Title IV."
"Let me outline to you the Commission's view on these two draft actions."
"Firstly, we have the new proposal from the Council for a joint action relating to air transit arrangements based on Article K.3."
"This proposal is an extension and an evolution of the existing one from 1996."
"The Court of Justice has confirmed in 1998 that this action falls under Article K.3."
"This new proposal for a joint action aims at incorporating two additional elements."
"Firstly, the common short list of countries is extended to include Bangladesh and Pakistan."
"Secondly, the proposal provides for an exception from the obligation of an air visa for nationals of countries who are holders of residence documents from certain other third countries, for example the United States and Switzerland."
"The Commission has no specific comment to make at the present stage."
"We will, however, look into the possibility of formulating a further proposal once the Amsterdam Treaty enters into force."
"We have to take into account the integration of Schengen arrangements into the Union acquis."
"The second proposal from the Council concerns a joint action for a uniform format for forms for affixing visas."
"The aim is to reach a certain level of harmonisation in order to upgrade security standards in two exceptional cases."
"One is when the visa sticker cannot be affixed in passports which are not recognised as a valid travel document; the other is when persons are not in possession of a valid travel document at all."
"The Commission has some concerns about the legal basis, which has been chosen for this proposal."
"There is no clear competence within the EC Treaty concerning when this form has to be delivered to persons holding no travel documents at all."
"However, it might also be argued that such a form constitutes an integral part of the uniform visa format itself."
"In that case Article 100c of the EC Treaty might apply."
"The discussion within the Council will be decisive for the final position of the Commission."
"It may be that the Commission will be called upon to make a declaration in the Council and, of course, then the Commission will convey the views expressed by the European Parliament to the Council."
"Thank you, Mrs Gradin."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m."
"(The sitting was closed at 6.55 p.m.)"
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Madam President, a point of order was raised on Tuesday."
"In it Mr Janssen van Raay commented on the voluntary pension system."
"He said: 'very briefly, unfortunately a number of Dutch people have indicated through their representative that they are happy with the system."
"That is what I wanted recorded in the Minutes yesterday.'"
"Madam President, I asked Mr Dankert if that was correct."
"He is the most senior of the 31 Dutch Members and he tells me that it is definitely not true."
"So I wanted to refute what Mr Janssen van Raay said here on Tuesday at the start of the day's proceedings."
"We take note of that, Mrs Maij-Weggen."
"Madam President, I should like to ask you to make sure that a copy of the complaint made by the Dutch authorities against the directive on patents is made available to Members of Parliament."
"We have discussed transparency at great length this week. However, it is not acceptable that proceedings are taken against the European Parliament and yet the individual Members are not allowed to obtain a copy of the complaint."
"I therefore cordially request you to ensure that Members who want a copy - and I think many Members are interested in this - are sent one as soon as possible, especially as the Parliament's Legal Service is already preparing an answer."
"I think we must also prove our own credibility in matters of transparency."
"I note that too, Mrs Breyer."
"We shall see what can be done."
"Madam President, I refer to Amendment No 49 on the McCarthy report."
"I am registered as voting against that amendment when, in fact, I wanted to vote in favour."
"Can that be put into the record."
"That will be corrected, Mr Hallam."
"Madam President, I just wanted to point out the fact that I voted in favour of Amendment No 7 of the McCarthy report by mistake."
"I wanted to vote against it."
"I informed the Bureau of this but I note that it has not been changed in the Minutes and I would like this to be rectified."
"That too will be corrected."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"VOTES"
"Madam President, I must point out that there is a textual error which distorts the meaning in various documents and in various language versions."
"In the report itself, Amendment No 5 relating to Article 3(2) reads accurately as follows: 'shall not exceed three years on aggregate and may be extended for no more than three years following a further decision.'"
"Extending five years to five years naturally distorts the meaning, as everyone recognises."
"We ask for this to be duly corrected."
"This error also appears, for instance, in the collection of proposed amendments to Amendment No 5; there it is incorrect."
"It is correct under Amendment No 5 in Mr Wiebenga's original."
"I should be grateful if this could be taken into account by the appropriate services."
"Thank you for pointing that out, Mr Nassauer."
"We shall take it into account."
"(In successive votes, Parliament adopted the two legislative resolutions)"
"The organisation of the external borders of the Union is an absolute necessity."
"They cannot be like open doors."
"The provisions adopted must, however, be in line with the spirit and the letter of the Geneva Convention and European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms."
"A third pillar is to be added to these two existing ones in the form of the additional measure provided for by the Treaty of Amsterdam, which will be implemented within five years of its entry into force and which authorises temporary stays within the Union for humanitarian reasons. This applies not only to individuals, but also to groups, who, strictly speaking, do not meet the terms of the aforementioned conventions, but whose physical or mental wellbeing can only be preserved through temporary protection in the Union."
"This measure is urgently needed, particularly because of the Union's inability to implement a genuine common foreign and security policy, even at its own borders!"
"That being the case, we must be clear on the need to share the burden of each influx of refugees."
"We must put an end to the complicated disputes that divide the Member States, which assure us that they have done all in their power to take in as many refugees as possible and more often than not lead us to believe that the other countries are still doing too little in this respect."
"Precise evaluation criteria must be defined."
"It should be pointed out once again that the temporary protection regime must, by its very nature, go hand in hand with an early examination of the conditions and resources needed to prepare for the decent return and successful reintegration of the refugees when they go back to their country of origin."
"We must ensure this when implementing this statute."
"The Danish Social Democrats have voted in favour of common rules for granting temporary refugee status, minimum rights for such refugees and more solidarity in distributing them among the Member States."
"The problem is that many displaced persons, such as the refugees from the war in former Yugoslavia, do not meet the conditions for refugee status laid down in the Geneva Convention, and that such refugees are being very unevenly distributed among the Member States."
"We need common rules on who should have refugee status, how long they will be allowed to stay in the Union and what conditions they are to live in while they are here."
"We have voted in favour of a temporary protection regime that will be invoked only in emergencies involving a sudden mass flight of refugees."
"The Geneva Convention should continue to be the starting-point, and human rights must be respected."
"This proposal is an excellent and much-needed one."
"There should be more sharing of responsibility when it comes to dealing with refugee crises in Europe."
"The proposal should be seen as complementing the Geneva Convention, which should always be respected."
"Solidarity with regard to refugees is not something that can be achieved through legislation or compulsion."
"Neither rules nor an enforced decision by a qualified majority are therefore to be recommended."
"Sharing the refugee burden has to be based on voluntarily agreed mutual responsibility."
"It is important to settle, in the most rational way possible, the question of procedures relating to access to countries for those holding no travel documents or those holding travel documents that are not recognised by the Member State asked for access authorisation."
"From this point of view, the use of a standard model form on which to affix visas might prove beneficial."
"But I can still only see this being of any real use if the introduction of such documents actually contributes to the emergence of a uniform European policy on visas."
"The introduction of a standard form is only one stage in this."
"Along with the members of our Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, I am prepared to believe that the introduction of a standard form for visas is in line with Community law, on the basis of Article 100c of the Treaty establishing the European Community rather than Article K.3(2) of the Treaty on European Union."
"In the case of airport transit, the Court of Justice settled the legal debate that set the Commission, supported by Parliament, against the Council in favour of the latter, since it judged that this issue was well and truly a matter for the third pillar."
"We can only hope that it does not do the same in the case of the standard form."
"Parliament's credibility in this area depends on it."
"I would like to state clearly that the organisation of our external borders is an absolute necessity and that it is out of the question to allow just anyone to enter the Union in whatever way they please."
"I also want to say that I agree with the rapporteur's belief that the necessary standardisation of the system cannot de facto override the provisions contained in the Geneva Convention and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms."
"Having made these observations, I support the two proposals as amended."
"The Danish Social Democrats have voted in favour of a joint action concerning a uniform format for forms for affixing visas and on airport transit arrangements."
"However, we have voted against the committee's recommendation that these joint actions should be replaced by a directive and a regulation under the first pillar."
"We believe that proposals such as these should form part of intergovernmental cooperation under the third pillar."
"The northern countries have nearly half a century's experience of operating the Nordic Passport Union, which functions at international level."
"It ought to serve as an example for the EU, since the Amsterdam Treaty has still not entered into force and therefore cannot be used as a reference."
"The legal base should not be changed to allow a qualified majority decision in the Council."
"I cannot support the Commission's ambition to become a kind of EU 'government'."
"It would be better to give more authority to Member States and to the Council."
"Madam President, yesterday I made a point regarding the camera crew in the Chamber."
"I asked whether that camera crew was here by permission and could it be investigated."
"Your secretariat said it would investigate it."
"Could you advise me if they had authority to film in the manner in which they did?"
"According to my information, a Member of the House had obtained permission to be filmed from the public gallery."
"It used to be that filming was not allowed in the Chamber area and in the gallery."
"I am at a loss to understand how this individual got permission."
"I should like to ask you, as a member of the Bureau, to raise it in the Bureau, because it is very important to treat this House with some kind of dignity."
"Cameramen are running all over the place outside the Chamber and if we start to allow them to come into the Chamber this place will soon be flooded with television cameras."
"I should like to ask you to refer this matter to the Bureau for investigation."
"I do not think your concern is really justified, Mr Falconer, but I will have the matter looked into once again."
"Madam President, on a not dissimilar point, when I left this Chamber, together with other Members, yesterday lunchtime at the time of the vote, people wearing T-shirts advertising the cause they were supporting were standing at the door thrusting pieces of paper into our hands."
"Some Members nearly tripped over as they left the Chamber."
"They were being invited to sign what I regard as a perfectly acceptable declaration, but that sort of demonstration has no place within Parliament's precincts."
"I would certainly ask you and the President to investigate what rules and regulations we have to stop manifestations of that nature operating within the precincts and indeed at the very doors of Parliament's Chamber."
"Those people yesterday caused me no particular offence in terms of the cause they were pursuing but the next time it might very well be people to whom I and other elected Members of this House would have very great objections."
"I have noted that, and we shall consider how to proceed in such cases."
"Illicit manufacture of drugs"
"The next item is the report (A4-0367/98) by Mr Pirker, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive amending Council Directive 92/109/EEC relating to the manufacturing and placing on the market of certain substances used in the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances (COM(98)0022 - C4-0081/98-98/0017(COD))."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is an instrument for combatting drugs which is intended to help us make the illicit diversion of precursors as difficult as possible and if possible to prevent it."
"These precursors are required for the manufacture of drugs, such as heroin and cocaine, but in particular for the manufacture of synthetic drugs, such as Ecstasy, ICE, LSD and amphetamines, because these drugs are manufactured exclusively from precursors."
"The reason why we need such an instrument is that consumption of drugs, particularly synthetic drugs, is increasing not only across Europe, but throughout the world."
"I have obtained a copy of the most recent figures, which indicate that around 2.5 million Ecstasy tablets were seized in 1997 in Europe alone, half of which were seized in the Netherlands."
"In the same year, 267 000 doses of LSD were seized, half of which again were seized in the Netherlands."
"The amounts seized show that drug use is currently on the increase."
"However, they also show that anti-drug strategies are taking effect, and that police measures are effective, namely because more synthetic drugs are being seized."
"These synthetic drugs are now being consumed by more than 5 million young people in Europe according to conservative estimates."
"The situation is therefore a dramatic one, particularly because these young people never know what substances the synthetic drugs they are consuming actually contain."
"That is to say, the mixture of substances varies constantly, in terms both of precursors and the strength of the dose."
"This means young people are exposed to extreme danger, and are therefore guinea-pigs for unscrupulous businessmen."
"We must do everything possible to find the best instruments for combatting drugs precisely for this reason, that is, to protect young people."
"A Council proposal is now available on amending a directive which dates from 1992. It contains a very practical proposal which may also be promising, particularly if we incorporate the amendments from the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs which is what I am requesting."
"The proposal was drawn up on the basis of expert hearings."
"We had representatives from the chemicals industry here, as well as representatives from the authorities, in order to sound out the most practical model and to draw conclusions from this."
"The Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs also shares the Council's view on nearly all issues, because its proposal is simply very consistent and very comprehensive, as well as very practical."
"What are the important points then?"
"I should like to single out the five most important points made in this proposal."
"Firstly, we had to decide between two possibilities: one was to draw up a fixed list, in which all precursors that are used to produce drugs are broken down into categories and monitored."
"At present, there are 22 of these. However, we would have to make the list much longer in order to introduce realistic checks because the substances used have changed, and there is a large number of them."
"If we had a fixed list, carrying out a check would be more or less impossible, with the result that we decided to take the other option."
"In reality, we have key substances which are fixed, and we can make the list longer and change it according to the substances that are currently being used to produce drugs."
"This means that we have a list of key substances which can be made longer and updated."
"We can use this to react to the present situation in the most effective way."
"The second point is that this list must not be made public. Otherwise, it would be quite possible for the producers to simply avoid the checks, because what is monitored is in any case well-known."
"The third point concerns the opportunity given to the Member States to prohibit trade in precursors where there is reason to assume that these precursors are being diverted for the production of drugs."
"The fourth point is quite an important one, because the system would probably not work otherwise; this system involves cooperation between the economic players - that is, the chemicals industry - and the authorities on a voluntary basis, but the Member States must prepare for this possible voluntary cooperation."
"That is to say, the economic players, or the chemicals industry, should provide information voluntarily when unusual transactions or orders are received, whilst the authorities are naturally given powers to obtain information, as well as to carry out spot checks on business premises."
"This system of voluntary cooperation is already in operation in some Member States, such as Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Ireland, where it is extremely successful."
"In Germany alone there were 6 000 notifications in the last year alone, and these were successfully investigated, in order to prevent the illicit diversion of precursors, and therefore the production of drugs as well."
"The fifth and very important point is that we must build up monitoring systems and integrate the countries of Central and Eastern Europe through the Phare programme when controlling precursors in the fight against drugs."
"The proposal provides that workers from the chemicals industry and the employees of the authorities be invited to Europe for training."
"This firstly guarantees that the money is not misused, as quite often happens, and also that we train people in the way we want and, at the same time, have contacts in these Member States as well."
"This constitutes a monitoring system that makes it practically impossible to shift procurement elsewhere, and enables cooperation to prevent the illicit diversion of precursors."
"With this package, we hope to successfully control the illicit diversion of precursors not only across Europe but, because this has been possible for two years, throughout the world as well, and to get our hands on an instrument that is essential in allowing us to successfully combat drugs, thereby protecting young people."
"I urge you to fully endorse and implement this proposal."
"Madam President, if you can brave the unrelenting noise of rave parties and the hordes of young people with apparently endless supplies of energy who attend them, you can detect a sign of the new era of synthetic drugs."
"It is now fashionable to go crazy, enter a frenzy, explode, drift into a trance, to show that you are in the blossom of youth."
"There are techno and house-music tribes looking for new rituals led by strangely charismatic nocturnal animals known as DJs."
"Their religion is based on the myth that the new electronic forms of music can only be appreciated under the effect of drugs."
"Sudden alterations of behaviour in apparently normal people - some of them familiarly normal, professional people - demonstrate the effects of these miraculous capsules of instantaneous performance, the key to voluptuous physical states and mental capacities."
"Although we have yet to say a final goodbye to the traditional heroin, cocaine or marijuana, we are facing a new reality that is about to erupt like a volcano."
"It has in its hold a planetary audience in the quest for new sensations, new radical experiences and new ways of coming to terms with a paradoxical world of opulence and poverty, culture and illiteracy, masters and slaves, privileged and marginal lifestyles."
"It is on this new danger and the widespread production of synthetic drugs that we are holding a debate today."
"It is not enough to control the old trade routes from South America, North Africa or the Far East."
"The factories producing Ecstasy and their substitutes are right next to consumers, cropping up like new arts and crafts shops."
"Even the Internet offers recipes for producing these super-drugs with potentially lethal effects."
"That is why we must control trade in the so-called precursors, or chemical substances used in the illicit manufacture of these types of narcotics."
"That is why we must step up voluntary cooperation between the authorities and the chemical and pharmaceutical companies to detect any suspicious acquisitions of substances on the list of products that are possible ingredients for these psychotropic substances."
"These lists should not be made public and they should be flexible, since the compounds used are changing so often and it is impossible to list all the latest precursors."
"Ecstasy has now existed for 10 years."
"Everyone is aware of the irreversible brain damage it can cause."
"In the meantime, the market novelties are called DOB, Golden Eagle, 4MTA, and flatliners, which are 33 times stronger than Ecstasy."
"The countries of Central and Eastern Europe should be included in the scope of this joint action so that they do not turn into alternative markets beyond our control."
"The European Parliament should take part in assessing voluntary cooperation."
"This is a matter endangering the future wellbeing of our society and we should be neither distracted nor tranquillised, and nor should we have hallucinations."
"Madam President, it is of course very important to monitor drug precursors and trafficking in them where new synthetic drugs are concerned; but only, of course, where necessary, because there are also synthetic drugs which are not dangerous."
"However, if they contain adulterating substances these must be identified."
"So we must not give too much weight to the problem, only where it is dangerous."
"Naturally, young people also need to be properly informed so that they know what they are getting."
"I think it would be a good idea to extend the voluntary cooperation we already have in our country and a number of other countries between the authorities and those in the market to other countries in Europe."
"We shall be voting for the amendments."
"But I do not think it is all that realistic to insist that the list of substances cannot be made public."
"I think that is too much to hope for."
"Lastly, Madam President, I think it is most important to achieve close cooperation with Central and Eastern Europe here."
"Otherwise we shall just be shifting the problem from Western to Eastern Europe."
"Mr President, I should like to offer my congratulations to Mr Pirker on his excellent report."
"The battle against drugs and drug abuse must be constant and far-reaching."
"To no less a degree, the problem of synthetic drugs is constantly increasing, since their chemical components, the so-called precursors, are quicker and simpler to change and thus evade legislation."
"The Commission's proposal to amend the present directive is not a solution, but it is an important step in combating the manufacture, and hence reducing the availability, of narcotic substances."
"The proposal is also in line with the decision taken by the UN General Assembly in New York last summer."
"Because of the nature of the problem, a flexible drugs list cannot be made official if it is to work."
"Constructive and voluntary cooperation between Member States and the chemical industry is especially welcome."
"The experience of countries where such a procedure exists has shown that it works very well."
"Mr President, I must firstly congratulate Mr Pirker on his excellent report."
"It has become a habit of his to present us with serious texts that are the fruit of meticulous work."
"The issue involved is of key importance for the future of the young people of Europe."
"As the rapporteur pointed out, synthetic drugs are used by five million young people and this gives us an idea of the extent of the danger."
"The risks are even greater because the chemical composition of these drugs constantly varies and because young people risk becoming guinea pigs and being used for experiments by particularly unscrupulous drug traffickers."
"A recent survey on the use of hashish among students in French schools shows that only 16 % of users are still at school at the age of 18, compared with 75 % of the rest of students, and that 60 % of them do not progress beyond secondary education."
"This is what calls into question the dubious distinction between supposedly soft drugs and other drugs, which also applies, of course, to synthetic drugs."
"The dangers of these drugs are recognised but they are played down, and even denied, by certain showbiz personalities or politicians in an extremely irresponsible manner."
"I also call on those who support the cause of individual freedom in order to justify the free consumption of drugs to consider that true freedom is responsible and that it begins with freeing us from the influence of alienating substances."
"The principles set out by the Commission and in the report by Mr Pirker do seem to be realistic."
"The principle of promoting voluntary cooperation between operators, producers and distributors seems to be a step in the right direction, based as it is on the desire to give a sense of responsibility to all those involved, and all policies aimed at giving us a sense of responsibility are good policies."
"I would like to say, in conclusion, that in this debate we must put the welfare of young people first. They are the main victims of these synthetic drugs and suffer because of a corrupt idea of supposedly recreational or communal pleasures."
"This is all due to reasons that I would call - without beating around the bush - base mercenary reasons, which treat the real welfare of young people with disdain. We must therefore appeal to the sense of responsibility of young people, but also to the sense of responsibility of those who, in the name of a false idea of freedom, lead them to play down the fact that the consumption of drugs is alienating and degrading."
"This is all about defending the dignity of our young people. For us, as responsible politicians, this fight is an urgent obligation."
"Mr President, we have followed the work here in Parliament of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs and we have noted that its attitude as expressed in Hedy d'Ancona's report is very liberal."
"This is a more serious issue than soft drugs; it is a matter of synthetic drugs and their precursors, which are chemical substances."
"Voluntary monitoring is a very soft option."
"I would like to turn your attention, however, to the fact that the rapporteur has recommended cooperation with non-member countries, but only with regard to central and eastern European countries."
"Finland's neighbour is Russia."
"Russia belongs to the Confederation of Independent States, and cooperation with that country is at least as important as with the central and eastern European states."
"A great deal of traffic, some of it in transit, enters the European Union area from Russia."
"I would hope that the rapporteur takes this into account next time."
"Mr President, today we are once again discussing suggestions for improvements in the fight against synthetic drugs."
"I have repeatedly pointed out why these drugs are particularly dangerous."
"The report's proposals, particularly to make the lists more flexible, constitute one step further along a difficult path."
"Probably as a result of the very clear opinions formulated in the expert hearing, the debate in committee revealed a rare consensus of opinion, with which I would also identify."
"However, this consensus must not be allowed to give a false sense of security or draw attention away from actual developments."
"I have followed with great concern the new German Government's intention to start experiments to control the sale of hard drugs in Hamburg and Frankfurt, and to decide on a legal framework for the sale of heroin at national level."
"We should really have learnt more from pilot projects that came to nothing."
"Drugs constitute a dangerous threat to the health of our children, and liberalisation of these drugs increases this further."
"Mr President, Mr Pirker's report now under discussion touches on a very timely subject, that of drugs."
"There has been an explosive growth in their trade, due among other things to the relaxation of border controls."
"It is easier than before to smuggle illicit substances across borders."
"Presumably only a small proportion of drugs is ever seized."
"The European Union has always championed the free movement of people internationally."
"For that reason it has an immense responsibility to prevent any adverse effects which might ensue."
"The second pillar of the EU, cooperation in internal and legal affairs, owes its greatest justification perhaps to the fight against drugs."
"The traffic and sale of narcotic and psychotropic precursors is also an indication of how important it is to develop a common ID system in the EU."
"Apart from reducing the avoidance of customs tariffs and taxes, it would promote better monitoring and control of drug precursors."
"For this reason the system should be introduced as soon as possible."
"Mr President, the use of synthetic drugs such as ecstasy has spread rapidly, especially among young people."
"This is confirmed by the fact that apart from marijuana they are the most consumed drugs in the European Union."
"I welcome the intention of the Commission to extend the scope of the 1992 directive on the control of illicit narcotics to include precursors used in the manufacture of these new drugs."
"I recognise that it is not an easy task because chemical precursors have a legal use as well as being a key part of illicit drug production."
"Cooperation to tackle this problem is imperative."
"The action plan agreed at the General Assembly of the United Nations in June of this year is a step in the right direction."
"We in the European Union must build upon this."
"The rapporteur correctly underlines the importance of international cooperation, especially in relation to Central and Eastern Europe where we can exert significant influence."
"The manufacture of synthetic drugs is a growth business in Central and Eastern Europe."
"We can use the PHARE programme, as he suggests, to build up an appropriate monitoring system."
"However, we can take it one step further by making it clear to those countries which hope to become members of the European Union that we expect their full cooperation and commitment to take firm and decisive action."
"A failure to do so would effect our attitude to their eventual accession."
"I support this report and the proposals contained therein."
"I hope that it makes an important contribution to addressing the drugs problem which shatters so many of the lives of our young citizens."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Commission, allow me to firstly thank Mr Pirker very sincerely for his excellent report and for what seems to me to be his very convincing support for our proposal for a directive."
"It is thanks to his efforts, and others, that this proposal has rapidly been brought before the European Parliament for a first reading."
"The development of synthetic drugs is an extremely serious problem, not only for the European Community but also for the rest of the world."
"Current Community legislation on precursors for synthetic drugs only allows us to monitor 22 chemical substances that are classified by UN conventions."
"Moreover, the illegal manufacture of these drugs makes increasing use of other products that can be easily substituted and that are not scheduled."
"However, it would be counterproductive to extend the strict measures that are currently applied to the 22 scheduled precursors to other possible precursors because of the widespread commercial use of these chemical products."
"Only an appropriate system is feasible."
"The aim of the amendment proposed by the Commission is therefore to make the Member States establish a system of cooperation. This system would mean that economic operators would voluntarily notify the competent authorities of transactions that they suspect involve substances that are not currently covered by the directive but that are, nonetheless, used on a large scale in the illegal manufacture of synthetic drugs."
"Although the number of substances involved is very high, only a targeted approach is conceivable."
"A 'precursors' committee that already assists the Commission with existing legislation will be given the task of establishing and updating lists of the products to be monitored."
"The work of this committee is, of course, confidential."
"Let us now look at the amendments tabled by the European Parliament."
"The Commission welcomes, and therefore accepts, Amendments Nos 1 and 3 because it shares Parliament's wish to strive for greater security in terms of monitoring precursors and drugs."
"As regards Amendment No 4, the Commission understands Parliament's desire to have a tool for assessing the monitoring measures for drugs precursors."
"At the moment, the Commission is already preparing an annual report for the International Narcotics Control Board - which is, as you know, a UN body - on the basis of the information it receives from the Member States."
"The Commission therefore has doubts as to the validity of the request for an additional report and as to how this special European Parliament report would differ from that drawn up or to be drawn up for the INCB."
"We must also be aware that the information currently provided by the Member States is unfortunately patchy and does not allow us to assess the effectiveness of the system currently in place within the framework of the existing directive."
"The assessment of a system that is not as yet operational will only be even more risky."
"Therefore, the Commission cannot undertake to produce such a special report, but it is naturally happy to provide the European Parliament with the annual report for the INCB."
"The rapporteur has already been sent this information this year."
"Parliament's desire in Amendment No 5 to ensure that the lists of products to be monitored are not made public is already implicitly included in the Commission's proposal."
"In fact, given that these lists are to be drawn up by the precursors committee, whose work is not published, this addition seems unnecessary."
"The second part of the amendment relating to the continuous adaptation of Community and national legislation does seem, however, to be very useful."
"For the Commission, accepting the amendment authorising the optional introduction of the monitoring measures would be tantamount to negating the substance of the Commission's proposal."
"In addition, a system where certain Member States applied the directive and others did not would inevitably lead to a distortion of competition within the single market."
"Therefore, the Commission cannot accept this final amendment."
"As for the rest, I must once again congratulate the rapporteur wholeheartedly, along with those who helped him, on the report that he presented to us today in such an extremely convincing manner."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"Before we proceed to the vote on the report by Mr Pirker, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to inform you of something I am sure you will be pleased to hear."
"On Monday, 16 November, the Bureau adopted a decision to take the technical and budgetary measures to also allow the Friday morning sittings to be filmed."
"This is something that many of you had repeatedly called for and I think that the Bureau was right to give a positive response to your request."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"WTO: financial services"
"The next item is the report (A4-0420/98) by Mr Kittelmann, on behalf of the Committee on External Economic Relations, on the proposal for a Council Decision concerning the conclusion on behalf of the European Community, as regards matters within its competence, of the results of the World Trade Organisation negotiations on financial services (COM(98)0440 - C4-0489/98-98/0239(CNS))."
"I give the floor first to Mr Habsburg-Lothringen, who is deputising for Mr Kittelmann."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am deputising for the rapporteur, Mr Kittelmann, who has put a great deal of work into this report in the Committee on External Economic Relations, finally securing unanimous support for it, a point which is very important."
"When we examine the report and look at how the WTO negotiations on this have been delayed, we should really assume that a happy outcome is also worth waiting for, at least in this case, thank goodness!"
"Once again it was the United States that was strongly opposed to this area of competence at the start, but then adopted a more flexible position following the 1995 interim agreement."
"We have seen that, as soon as Parliament and the Commission exerted enough pressure on the USA, it gave way, and did not play the international policeman, as is otherwise usually the case in many areas of the WTO, but recognised this to be the sensible solution."
"What is this report about?"
"It is mainly a question of dismantling barriers to trade and also allowing financial services to be offered worldwide without being subject to discrimination."
"We have referred to this area of competence in various reports several times in Parliament, and not least this week in Mrs Mann's report on transatlantic relations."
"This also concluded that a situation which is better for the economy on the whole, and therefore for jobs too, of course, can only be created by dismantling barriers to trade."
"In the last month, for instance, we have also closely examined Mrs Mosiek-Urbahn's report on the insurance directive, and it came to similar conclusions against discrimination on another Community problem."
"I believe that it is very important for us to not only apply this to countries in the European Union, but also to particularly endeavour to raise this at the WTO negotiations."
"The report deals exclusively with how the WTO Agreement is to be implemented from a purely technical point of view."
"Perhaps then I could say a few words on the procedure: alongside the general negotiations, specific market access was negotiated for individual services which are recognised in addition to the GATS Agreement."
"These are, in particular, the areas of basic telecommunications and financial services."
"Even before expiry of this deadline, it emerged that the USA viewed as inadequate the offers submitted by the approximately 30 WTO members - with the 15 Member States of the European Union counting as one -, stating that it was not prepared to extend its offer in accordance with the most-favoured nation status to all WTO members."
"The USA practically baulked and jibbed at it."
"The negotiations on the agreement were then successfully concluded on 12 December 1997."
"70 member countries submitted improved lists of offers concerning market access and national treatment."
"The whole agreement in its present form is a considerable improvement on the 1995 interim agreement."
"In addition to the inclusion of the USA, many WTO members are involved in the agreement, and its scope is considerable."
"It guarantees substantially free market access and national treatment for foreign financial institutions in more than 95 % of all worldwide trade in financial services."
"Equity trading covered by liberalisation alone represents an enormous market."
"The basis of the agreement is the 1996 data, which show that equity trading alone covers USD 14.8 trillion, and total banking assets amount to USD 41.2 trillion."
"At the same time, the agreement also ensures that EU financial institutions can operate on similarly favourable conditions in third country markets, as is possible for third countries on the territory of the European Union."
"The procedure proposed by the Commission, involving consultation of the European Parliament under Article 228(3), first subparagraph, of the EC Treaty, is certainly something Parliament can accept."
"I do not want to add much more here, because the reasoning behind these decisions is contained in the explanatory statements."
"I would like to explain one more point."
"I consider it to be particularly important that Parliament is successfully tackling this today so that we simply keep to our timetable."
"It must be concluded promptly so that the date of 1 March 1999 set for its entry into force can be adhered to."
"Mr President, the world economy has changed fundamentally over the last decade."
"Market forces have become increasingly liberated from the political decision-making process."
"The agreement on financial services that we are discussing today is, in our view, basically a sound agreement."
"It is important that the other agreements concluded between the EU and the WTO do not work to the detriment of European consumers."
"That would jeopardise the public's understanding of these agreements."
"And I think it is important to emphasise precisely that point - public understanding."
"Moreover, this agreement comes at a good time."
"The financial crises which have recently been affecting the Asian countries have made it even more important to send out a signal that economic stability is crucial to our ability to create fresh growth throughout the world."
"It is therefore particularly welcome that a large number of countries have subscribed to this agreement."
"It cannot be stressed often enough that international cooperation is essential."
"There are many examples of challenges which are best resolved by the international community: green taxes and duties, eco-labelling, trade instruments with an environmental aim, facilitating market access for the developing countries, protecting intellectual property rights and the fight against technical barriers to trade."
"Our responsibility as politicians is to ensure that there is no giving way on the rights of individual consumers."
"We must therefore work together to see that the democratic control over the WTO is as strict as that applied to the EU."
"That is our task for the future."
"Mr President, I think that today we have seen how without the EU we should have not reached this binding agreement."
"We should also remember the work of the cross-border 'financial leaders group' in bringing it about."
"It is a tactic that we need to consider for future WTO negotiations."
"It could be the case that economic interests facilitated cooperation, while political prestige did not play so large a part."
"Like Mr Iversen, I think this is important for achieving stability."
"The market is in a strange mood at present, partly on account of closed domestic markets and partly because of the large flows of capital that move around the world and lead to speculation."
"Achieving stability and transparency is an important means of putting an end to speculation, for example by creating a climate that stimulates domestic saving in South-East Asia."
"The agreement also comes at an important moment for Europe, for instance enabling us to invest in Japan's pensions market, and in view of all the infrastructure investment that is being made in many different fields."
"It is also clear that this agreement has significant implications for developing countries that have achieved a certain level of development, enabling them to increase their savings."
"Nevertheless, there are some problems."
"I think it would also be extremely worthwhile to tie in the money-laundering issue and ensure that the BIS international rules are rigorously enforced."
"The problem with Japan was that we did not know what the rules were and how they were being applied."
"That is also one of the aims of increased competition."
"Now we will have a way of knowing which rules are applicable."
"I also hope that we make real progress on a new negotiating mandate when Finland takes over the presidency next autumn."
"Mr President, politicians would appear to have an easy job today."
"It seems as if we are only needed to liberalise the trade in goods and services."
"We have to disentangle as much as possible as rapidly as possible from the protective structures that different countries set up for the protection of people and the environment."
"Thus it would seem that today policy controls only people, but not goods or capital, and as a result, policy has lost its credibility."
"Free citizens cannot trust in a policy that casts everyone in the same mould and turns the electorate into mere consumers."
"The liberalisation of goods and services is being discussed in the WTO, and that is the right place for international agreements."
"For that reason, we naturally have no other option than to approve the agreement now being discussed just as Mr Kittelmann suggests in his report."
"However, I would like to address another aspect of the issue."
"It is not at all self-evident that market forces operating blindly in a free financial market will comply with the generally accepted rules of the game."
"In the present true capitalist system, which is global and electronic, the methods of monitoring financial institutions have not kept pace with the freeing-up of markets."
"For that reason, the markets are not free."
"The money market is a dictator of market forces, as it is not really monitored openly."
"This is a problem that has not been mentioned in any of the international conferences and there is not one UN organisation which deals with it."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, imagine you are asked for your opinion as Members of Parliament, and it is an important matter."
"To put it more precisely, it involves nothing less than the GATS, the General Agreement on Trade in Services under the umbrella of the WTO, the World Trade Organisation, and therefore once again, the financial services."
"Imagine then that your role is purely to applaud."
"I am certain you would not be satisfied with this."
"However, this is precisely the case today."
"This is a turnkey agreement which guarantees free market access and national treatment in more than 95 % of worldwide trade in financial services."
"Significant progress has therefore been made once again through the unhindered and uncontrolled activity of banks and other financial institutions, and indeed, in exactly 102 countries throughout the world."
"Not only that, but shares can also be rotated even more quickly."
"As Mr Kittelmann so beautifully puts it in his report, and I quote: 'The volume of equity trading covered by liberalisation commitments alone represented USD 14.8 trillion in 1996."
"Total banking assets in the countries that are parties to the agreement amounted to USD 41.2 trillion in 1995.' Entire countries are therefore being driven into ruin because uncontrolled financial flows cause the national budget to collapse."
"We are therefore calling for urgent reforms in the international financial system."
"And we are talking about wanting to incorporate safety nets, set up early-warning systems, take accompanying measures, or even promote development policy."
"At the same time, we are supposed to applaud because the Commission has once again made a successful attempt at liberalisation, without asking our opinion."
"There is an urgent need for reform here."
"In the European Union we need Parliament to exert an influence in issuing mandates and following approval procedures in all agreements of global economic importance."
"The WTO must also be reformed."
"Its sole commitment to liberalisation at all costs is a mistake."
"The financial crises of recent months speak volumes about this."
"For this reason we do not endorse the report that was submitted."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Kittelmann for his excellent report and also for the very convincing presentation by Mr Habsburg-Lothringen."
"The successful conclusion of GATT negotiations on financial services on 12 December last year was indeed a major achievement which reinforced the World Trade Organisation as a framework for multilateral service negotiations."
"Today we can see the benefits of having this sort of environment where things can be settled and be discussed instead of having to cope with unilateral action."
"By including financial services on a permanent, most favoured nation and non-discriminatory basis between WTO countries, which is the basis here, and by securing effective market access to some 96 % of the WTO financial markets, the EC's main negotiating objective has been achieved."
"Ratification and subsequent entry into force of the agreement is now the EU's main priority."
"We are taking all the steps necessary to ensure that the agreement is ratified promptly both by the EEC and by its Member States so that it can enter into force by the agreed date of 1 March next year."
"We also expect other countries who participated in the negotiations to complete their internal procedures before the deadline of 29 January next year."
"Financial service liberalisation will remain an essential element in the development of efficient financial services world-wide which is the prerequisite for sound economic development."
"We are therefore confident that the economic crisis affecting certain countries will not result either now or in the future, impede future negotiations starting in the year 2000, nor will it lead to moves towards more protectionism."
"I was listening very carefully to what some of the Members of Parliament said."
"We should make a distinction between having free markets designed to function well and efficiently and rules which need to be there and need to be enforced."
"Part of the problem in Asia and elsewhere lies in the fact that there are no adequate rules."
"If there are rules they are not properly enforced."
"There is a lack of rules even in states like Japan and hitherto the international institutions have not been given sufficient powers to ensure that rules, if they exist, are enforced efficiently."
"That is a major challenge but that should not lead to the conclusion that we should not continue to liberalise financial services."
"That is a different story."
"I would readily accept the need, as some of you said, for more efficient rules world-wide or on a national basis and authorities - sufficiently independent authorities - to impose the rules of the game."
"That is the price that has to be paid for having a stable system and taking full advantage of liberalisation which has been discussed and has been agreed to."
"Thanks to all Members of Parliament for their contributions and I would like to wind up by saying that I take it for granted that all Member States and the European Union will ratify the text in due course."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to have your attention again briefly."
"I would like to ask Mr HabsburgLothringen to convey our congratulations to Mr Kittelmann on the quality of his report."
"And, as I am mentioning the name Habsburg, I would like to remind you all that this Friday, Mr Otto von Habsburg, quite unusually, is not here with us."
"We know that he is unable to attend due to illness but we also know that he is now on the road to recovery."
"However, today is a very special day for Mr Otto von Habsburg because it is his birthday."
"Today, he celebrates 86 wonderful and fruitful years."
"Therefore, on behalf of everyone, allow me to send him our congratulations and our best wishes for a speedy recovery because we do indeed need him here with us on Fridays."
"Mr Van Miert, you have the floor."
"Mr President, I would like to say on behalf of the Commission that I agree with what you said."
"I am sure that my colleagues fully appreciate the true value of your words and, on their behalf, I would also like to echo them."
"Book pricing in Germany and Austria"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following oral questions to the Commission:"
"B4-0704/98 by Mrs Hawlicek, Mrs Junker and Mr Tannert, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the complaint procedure against the cross-border net price system for books between Germany and Austria; -B4-0706/98 by Mr Ebner, Mrs Günther, Mrs Pack and Mr Habsburg-Lothringen, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, on the complaint by the Commission against the cross-border fixed price agreement for books between Austria and Germany; -B4-0707/98 by Mr Frischenschlager, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, on the complaint concerning the cross-border fixing of the prices of books between Austria and Germany; -B4-0708/98 by Mrs Pailler, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, on retail price controls on books; -B4-0709/98 by Mr Kerr, Mrs Soltwedel-Schäfer, Mr Voggenhuber, Mr Cohn-Bendit, Mr Lagendijk and Mr Wolf, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament, on the infringement procedure involving the cross-border net price system for books between Germany and Austria.I have received three motions for resolutions tabled pursuant to Rule 40(5)."
"I give the floor first to Mr Elchlepp, who has four minutes to move his question."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at a first glance, the system of fixed book prices in the Germanspeaking area of Europe may appear antiquated."
"However, if you consider the far-reaching consequences it would have if it were discontinued, then you should be far more sensitive towards this pressing matter of cultural policy."
"I would on principle have expected the Commission, as an advocate of cultural diversity and also a promoter of jobs in Europe, to take into account all the objectives of the European Treaties in its examination of the book pricing system from the point of view of competition law."
"Freedom of competition is neither an absolute asset nor an objective in itself."
"In my opinion the preservation of cultural diversity, laid down in Article 128(4), is in this case a more valuable asset."
"Did the Commission think when carrying out its competition law analysis that in labour-intensive small businesses in the book trade possibly up to 200 000 jobs and also thousands of training places could be lost by abolishing fixed prices?"
"Finally, many scientific studies fear that the number of bookshops would drop from 4 000 to just 800 in the event of this regulation being abolished."
"Commissioner, in the village where I live in the Black Forest, it would certainly no longer be possible to run a bookshop."
"The number of publishing houses could also decrease sharply because greater proceeds from best-sellers sold at fixed prices reduce the commercial risk of promoting cultural goods."
"The example of the USA should serve as a warning to us; prices for reference books and for fiction and poetry are higher there than in Germany, and the book trade there is limited to a small number of traders who belong to chains of shops, which themselves depend on the big publishing houses."
"Books should therefore not be subject to the laws of uncontrolled competition!"
"Surely the main aim cannot be to sell culture more cheaply but to protect its diversity."
"The consumers want good advice and a wide range of titles, and this is guaranteed by fixed book prices."
"In my country alone, 75 000 new books are published every year compared with only 55 000 in the much larger US market."
"The readers also want rapid availability of books, and our system guarantees this."
"I should just like to say, Commissioner, in order to make myself quite clear, that I am not against EU competition law or the completion of the internal market in Europe."
"However, it is precisely because of this that we need to maintain the price-fixing system for books."
"Fixed prices allow a wide range of suppliers and titles and protect against competition."
"They guarantee cultural and literary diversity on a market economy basis, and without subsidies."
"I repeat: the issues are also the cultural identity of linguistic areas and cultural diversity in Europe."
"Furthermore, there remains considerable doubt as to whether the Commission should refer to a report when how it came about raises more questions than it has given answers."
"The Commission must also state why it did not want to be monitored by a Permanent Advisory Committee on Books, as it actually wanted to ten years ago."
"Mr President, Commissioner, if a few chains of shops and unfortunately also the European Commission have their way, the book pricing system is to be abolished."
"At present, publishing houses in Austria and in some other countries of the Union have the possibility of selling their products at a fixed minimum price."
"This is said to contradict the spirit of the European Treaties because it can lead to cartel-like structures."
"This argument is probably right from a purely economic point of view."
"In spite of lower prices, so-called best-sellers make a significant turnover for the publishing houses because of the large number of copies published."
"Even at a lower price hardly any specialist books would be sold."
"Certainly, a book is not a commodity like other household goods and appliances."
"Books are part of a country's culture."
"Workers' educational associations, municipal libraries, school libraries, book clubs, and so on, have been trying since the last century to motivate people to educate themselves more by reading quality literature."
"Many books would not be published if publishing houses could not make a profit with best-sellers, which subsidise the publishers' other products."
"The diversity in literature is a sign of intellectual independence."
"Just as every residential area needs its local supply of everyday things, the bookshop is part of the local supply of intellectual commodities."
"It is the intellectual 'grocer's shop', as we would say in Austria, or in Germany, the 'corner shop' for the mind."
"I apologise to the translators for using these peculiar expressions."
"Unlike the big stationer's shops, the bookshop also provides services, such as specialist advice or ordering books that are not really among the top sellers."
"However, it could not survive without fixed prices, since it cannot buy at such good prices as the big chains of shops, and can therefore only sell at higher prices."
"Apart from this, the book pricing system does not involve any obligations."
"There are books that come onto the market with no fixed price."
"In many cases, a considerably cheaper paperback edition is already available after one year; there are the special-offer book weeks and the second-hand trade in modern books."
"There are therefore many opportunities for making fixed prices drop very quickly in reality."
"If I hold up a book, such as this book here, then what I have in my hand is, of course, first and foremost a commodity."
"However, as soon as I leaf through the book and start reading its contents, then I am no longer using just any household good or appliance, but I am using reading as a means to find out about culture."
"This particular one is a book about telecommunications which belongs to my colleague, Mr Rübig, and it is quite heavy going."
"I am reading it due to circumstances, but also for enjoyment, to broaden my mind, sometimes it makes me angry as well, of course, but I am reading it to acquire knowledge at any rate."
"As long as we regard a book only as a commodity, it is completely justified to curb or abolish fixed prices, no matter whether nationally or internationally."
"This would certainly be a very restricted way of looking at things and would not do justice to the true value of books."
"The packaging, which represents the true character of a book, is not particularly crucial, but the contents are, and these clearly belong in the field of culture and science."
"We do not necessarily, or rather we do not always, buy books because of a pretty picture on the cover, but first and foremost because we would like to read the print."
"The diversity of the book market shows that the culture of a country, and of a linguistic area, has developed."
"However, in order to have this diversity we also need to have a variety of publishing houses and bookshops."
"Not every book becomes a best-seller."
"There are books that are aimed only at a specialist audience or a special interest group."
"Money cannot be made from a small number of copies."
"It must be made from those works which also sell well."
"These best-sellers subsidise from within the system the diversity necessary in cultural policy."
"If an entrepreneur today manages to sell a square soup dish by means of a very good marketing strategy, and then all manufacturers of round soup dishes have to close down, this will have no effect on culinary diversity."
"However, every publishing house that has to close down means a loss of books, books that are then no longer printed because other publishing houses follow different agendas."
"Every bookshop that has to close down because it cannot keep up with the cheap goods supplied by a big stationer's shop, is a loss for the region's local supply of intellectual commodities."
"Commissioner, you will understand that we are asking you - and I know we are certain of the support of virtually the whole of Parliament - to really take Parliament's observations on this into consideration so that this cultural dimension of our continent is really taken into account."
"Mr President, it sometimes seems that only one thing counts in Europe - our economy."
"If the euro is a success, integration will soon follow."
"Yet there are so many other things in Europe which make Europe unique to our citizens."
"The article on culture in the Treaty, Article 128, also stresses that Europe is about more than just the economy."
"The debate on book pricing drags on."
"So far the European Commission has very one-sidedly applied the economic criterion in determining its position."
"The Commission is currently very much attacking book pricing between Germany and Austria and pricing within the Netherlands itself."
"It is alleged to contravene the Treaty rules on competition."
"For years now, I and many other honourable Members too have been arguing in written questions, articles, letters and resolutions that a review of book pricing should be based in a balanced way on a range of both economic and cultural arguments."
"The advantages of this have been broadly summarised by the two speakers before me."
"But think too of the minority language regions, where the range of titles available in bookshops is also very important and has to be large, in order to guarantee cultural diversity through specialist books being available, and not just the best-sellers which sell easily."
"Think of the lip-service paid, as well as the actual practice of stimulating small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Once we scrap book pricing, as another Member has already said, the small booksellers will disappear."
"Just look at the United Kingdom."
"In short, book pricing promotes cultural development in Europe without the need for subsidies."
"That is an argument which the Commissioner will have to address."
"We do not want mergers and concentration, which damages cultural diversity."
"As for disadvantages, studies have shown that the existence or otherwise of book pricing has no economic impact on the book market."
"So if it has these cultural advantages, why scrap it?"
"Happily, and we are pleased about this, the Commission decided to wait before pronouncing definitively on the Austro-German and Dutch cases until the results of this study were forthcoming."
"I have made a point of asking the Commission in written questions to do that."
"Perhaps, ladies and gentlemen, we have now reached a turning point."
"I say perhaps, because no final decisions have been taken yet."
"Commissioners Van Miert and Oreja have indicated in a letter to the culture ministers, following a study, that for demonstrable cultural reasons it might be possible to retain book pricing, including for cross-border agreements in the same linguistic region."
"The Commission will not interfere with national arrangements of the kind we have in the Netherlands if it can be shown that there is no discernible effect on trade between the Member States."
"We wholeheartedly welcome this development."
"I hope Commissioner Van Miert will continue with this line in the decisions he takes at the beginning of next year."
"My group too favours an advisory committee on the book trade."
"A standing consultative body made up of interested parties from all sectors to advise the Commission will be a useful thing."
"I very much hope that the Commission will listen to the tenor of the joint resolution tabled by five of our groups including, of course, the European Liberals."
"It is not the first time."
"We are clear on this and always have been."
"Book pricing, including pricing across borders within the same linguistic region, must be possible under a derogation to Article 85(3) of the Treaty, in the interests of our citizens."
"The interpreters will not need to translate my closing sentence. Why do we only support agriculture and don't want to do anything for culture?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner van Miert, I know, of course, that the market's invisible hand which controls and resolves everything finds no more faithful a group of followers than the Commission."
"In a manner of speaking, it is the Vatican of free competition, and I know, of course, that you are the Grand Inquisitor of this free market economy."
"I also know, of course, that this inquisitor scrutinises the European market every day in order to find heretics of all kinds, trends towards the formation of cartels, and distortions of sacred competition, and as soon as his scrutinising eyes fall on anything confusing, or on anyone wishing to obstruct this invisible market force, the process of the Holy Inquisition is initiated."
"Commissioner, I would sometimes like matters pertaining to environmental protection, social affairs or civil rights to be scrutinised in this way."
"Unfortunately, the Commission does not regard itself as the Grand Inquisitor of this Union for these matters."
"Its eyes have therefore now fallen on a small matter under the heading of books."
"The Commission has now discovered for certain that underhand dealings are going on in this area."
"You have this in common with the Vatican's history."
"You are now placing this book on the index of free competition because people do not know how to handle it properly."
"They do not sell it like drawing pins or computers but have a complex, inscrutable, and even precariously erotic relationship with it."
"Commissioner, when Beckett received the Nobel prize for 'Waiting for Godot', all 300 copies of this book were sold in the German-speaking area of Europe."
"I understand that you believe that it is not worth the expense and that it would probably have been better not to publish these 300 copies, since there is obviously no demand for them."
"You are right to say that a book has something in common with a good, and that is supply, but it is not subject to demand."
"A book's search for its readers is involved and mysterious."
"Sometimes it lasts decades, and I think that it lacks culture to reduce this complex search simply to the way the market works, and what lacks culture quickly becomes barbaric."
"Forgive me if I speak in the language of my own culture."
"It is indeed an advantage to be able to speak several languages."
"It sits well with the European ideal too, there is a cultural dimension to knowing more than just one language."
"It is indeed a matter of culture."
"I say that for the benefit of those who think one only needs to speak one language to be cultured."
"I am of course flattered that you compare me with the pope."
"Unfortunately, there is another candidate."
"I gather that Oskar Lafontaine wants to be pope too."
"I would not wish to measure myself against him, to fight him for the job."
"Let us leave it at that."
"I just wanted to say exactly what the issues are here."
"Firstly, the attitude which the Commission and I have adopted is absolutely the same as the one the Commission adopted previously and which was also confirmed by a judgment of the Court."
"The primary function of the Commission is indeed to ensure that the judgment of the Court is respected in such cases."
"It is somewhat facile to ask us under the cloak of culture not to respect the law."
"The first point, then, is that it is our duty to ensure that the pronouncements of the Court, as made on several occasions, are respected."
"The second point is that I would remind you that my benevolent eye did not just happen to light upon the subject of books one day; we took action because we were receiving complaints, more specifically from Austria: complaints from Libero, complaints from a number of universities which were having real problems over the rapidly rising cost of the books they had to buy."
"So the complaints were coming from academic circles too, as well as from other bookshops."
"If complaints are made, the Commission has to investigate them."
"That too is part of our job and our remit."
"What kind of system of justice would that be if I were able to say: I'll push that to one side, we won't deal with that."
"So what do you want?"
"Let us be honest, we live in a legally constituted state, in a community based on the rule of law."
"Secondly, there is not one case - and I have been responsible for competition policy for six years now - where we have taken so much time and shown so much willingness to talk to the parties concerned."
"I have even done something which was perhaps not right in legal terms."
"I once wrote a letter of comfort to allow us a period of time - enough time, a few years - to discuss the matter and find solutions which were legally watertight."
"And what thanks did the Commission get for this goodwill gesture?"
"Firstly, a number of conditions attached to it were not respected by publishers and, secondly, over a period of two or three years, I think it was three years, instead of seeking a solution all people did was exert political pressure and lobby people left, right and centre."
"They lobbied people, because the Commission was supposedly ignoring the situation and ignoring the judgments of the Court of Justice."
"Well, I will not accept that."
"Let us be quite clear about it."
"What we do want, and we have always said so, is to see account taken of the cultural dimension but also the true facts, not as they are constantly projected but as they are, the reality."
"Well, what the Court of Justice said at the time was this, and I am quoting Advocate-General Lenz:"
"'The same is true as regards the references made to the fact that, when the decision was being adopted, the Commission should have taken account of the cultural aspects of this issue."
"The obligation to take these aspects into consideration was already provided for by the case-law of the Court in accordance with the Treaty on European Union."
"This obligation is henceforth expressly included in the EC Treaty."
"However, given that this comes under paragraph 75 of its decision, the Commission has in no way disregarded these cultural aspects.'"
"(NL) That is what the Court says."
"Let us just look at the facts."
"To start with: we are told that if the system is not preserved, the publishing of quality books and literature will suffer greatly as a result."
"That surprises me, because there are plenty of countries in the world which do not have book price fixing - the United States, the United Kingdom too now and a number of European countries as well."
"In others, the system is in the process of being dismantled."
"Is there no great literary production in those countries, may I ask?"
"I would remind you that 40 to 45 % of the literary works published in Germany are translations, mostly from the English-speaking world."
"Those are facts."
"And then I would ask why, if the system is so good, there is no obligation on publishers to do that?"
"There is no obligation of any kind."
"There is one publisher who never ever publishes books to do with literature or quality subjects, and he too benefits from book price fixing.."
"There is no obligation of any kind."
"We should start by placing an obligation on publishers who benefit from price fixing to publish quality works."
"There is no such obligation at the moment."
"We are also told that only book price fixing allows there to be enough variety in titles."
"I am sorry, but the facts do not bear that out."
"With or without price fixing, happily, more and more titles are being published."
"The reason is technology."
"Nowadays it is easier to produce books and in smaller editions than before."
"Whether you have book price fixing everywhere or not, that is the trend."
"You do not need book price fixing for that."
"That too is a general trend."
"Once again, I have to live with the facts, because before we can grant a derogation, we must have arguments and facts which warrant a challenge to the judgments of the Court, if there are new facts which enable us to prove that."
"Otherwise it cannot be done."
"Then too we are told that, without book price fixing, a lot of smaller bookshops will go under."
"Ladies and gentlemen, look at the facts in all countries."
"Even where there is book price fixing, the small bookshops are in decline, everywhere, in the Netherlands too, in France too, everywhere."
"That is the trend."
"To my surprise, I even found - rather to my surprise I have to say - that a recent report by Francis Fishwick on the situation in the United Kingdom reaches the following conclusion."
"For what it is worth I will read it out, rather than have you take it on trust, just so we understand one another."
"What this very recent report says is this: 'The main gain from abandonment of retail price maintenance in the UK has been an improvement in distribution, particularly through smaller booksellers who are now able to replenish stocks and fulfil special orders in a very short time through an expanded and revitalised wholesale system.'"
"Ladies and gentlemen, the small booksellers have been tied hand and foot."
"Why, if a book really is selling badly, can they not offer it at a cut price?"
"Why not?"
"Why do they have to stockpile it?"
"Why not give them that freedom?"
"In the case of small booksellers, why not allow them bigger discounts rather than the bigger shop?"
"It is all very well starting to introduce a policy which favours the small bookseller."
"But it is not happening."
"May I point out that in countries which have book price fixing, such as France, 25 % of books sold are currently sold in department stores."
"In Spain, which also has price fixing, cheaper books - and the market share of these is increasing - are sold at newsagents' kiosks."
"Because the longer it goes on, the more this strict system leads to practices which in any case look for a way round the problem."
"You spoke of company mergers."
"Well, in the Netherlands the Commission blocked a large-scale merger."
"True or not?"
"The big merger which was in the balance between the big companies, you all know them - Elsevier, Wolters, Kluwer - well, it was the Commission's ruling which stopped it from going through."
"We shall probably have to turn our attention shortly to the new move by Bertelsmann and Springer."
"This process of mergers, in book price fixing too, is happening anyway."
"Only the Commission is in a position to stop it."
"Pope or Vatican, that is the reality."
"Ladies and gentlemen, have you thought about what will happen soon with the Internet?"
"I hear Bertelsmann, a firm which benefits from book price fixing in Germany, saying that it wants to be number one in the world in selling books on the Internet."
"I have no objection to that."
"But can we at least have the honesty to give some thought to the consequences of what is developing?"
"You regularly approve resolutions aimed at promoting that."
"Here we are trying to do something against it, but companies in the countries themselves are hard at work trying to penetrate and conquer that market."
"Can we for once face up to the reality of what is happening?"
"I am keen to have that debate."
"I have advocated it for years and it has not come about."
"People have fixed ideas."
"They defend sacred cows."
"They shy away from a debate based on facts."
"I remain willing, not least in the light of the Treaty article on culture - and I have repeatedly said so - to look for solutions which can also work across borders, because there is no question of interfering with national systems."
"The Commission accepted that long ago."
"That is not what it is about."
"It is about cross-border effects or practices which, as in the Dutch case, were totally unacceptable."
"That is an altogether protectionist system favouring Dutch companies."
"How do you expect the Commission to sympathise with that, as if it were not a question of economic interest."
"That is the reality."
"If you want to have that debate, I am at your disposal, just as I have been available to the publishers to discuss it for five years already."
"But all we get is political pressure because the Commission is supposedly ignoring both the judgments of the Court and the facts."
"I am sorry, but I will not accept that!"
"Mr President, Commissioner van Miert, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Voggenhuber has just called Commissioner van Miert the Grand Inquisitor of competition."
"This is naturally a very nice image for Karel van Miert."
"I believe that it does not quite do justice to the reality, because I believe what Karel van Miert does is a service for the people in the European Union."
"What purpose does competition actually serve?"
"Competition serves to break the power of monopolies, to ensure a variety of suppliers of goods and services, and thus to provide people with these goods and services under favourable conditions, and books are also amongst these."
"In this respect, I agree with Karel van Miert."
"I therefore would not call him the Grand Inquisitor, but a type of arbitrator who has our approval particularly when he fights against monopolies in the service of the people, against there only being one supplier for certain goods and services because this renders us powerless against that supplier as citizens and consumers."
"As chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, I should therefore also like particularly to express my appreciation to Karel van Miert for his work."
"We discuss these issues a great deal in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"Occasionally, we agree, and occasionally we disagree."
"That is part of democracy."
"I should like to take this opportunity to say that my opinion differs to that of Karel van Miert with regard to fixed book prices."
"Personally, I am in favour of fixed book prices."
"It has involved a great deal of discussion."
"We have repeatedly asked ourselves whether we should treat cultural objects in the same way as goods and services."
"This was a very difficult question to answer in the case of television, for example."
"Television is regarded as a cultural object."
"This is the prevailing opinion, although when I switch on the television I occasionally have my doubts about whether it can be called a cultural object."
"However, there is no doubt that books are cultural objects, and that they are an inherent part of our European culture."
"I would say that this applies not only to books but also to small bookshops."
"I must also declare a personal interest in this."
"The only shops in which I like to spend considerable time are small bookshops."
"I also consider them to be a completely essential part of our culture."
"I believe these small bookshops depend very strongly on this issue of fixed book prices."
"I believe that fixed prices do indeed offer these small bookshops a certain degree of protection."
"I therefore believe that we should maintain the book pricing system."
"As chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, I would be very pleased if Karel van Miert would consider this issue carefully once again."
"I hope that you and the Commissioner, after yesterday evening with all the political excitement of amendments and voting, ended the day with a nice glass of French, German, Spanish, Portuguese or Italian wine, a little bit of agriculture."
"I do not suppose that afterwards, legs outstretched, you seriously thought of sitting at your computer and surfing the Internet."
"Maybe you picked up a book, a piece of literary beauty which you only find in quality publications."
"If you did not, I will bring that beauty to mind in the form of a quotation, and I would ask the interpreters to follow me faithfully."
"Mr President, tears of nostalgia for my grandfather clouded my eyes."
"I rose from the big empty chair and began to wander through the rooms of my house."
"It was the big villa I had bought after I had grown up, had buried grandfather and his comrades in the orchard, become rich and left the village."
"The one sentence 'but you and Baruch still have each other' kept surfacing in my mind and refused to sink down to the floor of my memory."
"I heard the murmur of the waves, ran outside and lay down on the freshly mown meadow, my face turned to the sea."
"That is a translation from the Russian novel by Meir Shalev."
"There has been much talk in the transatlantic partnership this week about the need to safeguard our culture."
"In other debates, on employment for example, lip-service is paid to protecting small businesses because of their importance for jobs."
"Well, it seems to me, and following everything you have said, that abandoning book price fixing sounds the death knell for the small bookseller, for quality books and for jobs."
"Large retail chains are taking over the sector by means of price wars."
"In the Netherlands, there is no question of book price fixing of the kind we are discussing here."
"But people are worried."
"We already have a liberalised market."
"Chains such as Bertelsmann and Smith are already in Amsterdam and Alkmaar."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we cannot let our children grow up with nothing but cartoon strips, television series, e-mail, Internet, ready-cooked rice and potatoes, without knowing the enriching pleasure of a good book."
"I worry about this."
"I do not regard you as the grand inquisitor, Commissioner."
"I see you more as a judge, as Mr von Wogau said."
"You say we must make use of liberalisation, but let us not allow it to go too far."
"As the honourable Member on the other side of the House puts it: liberalisation is not an end in itself."
"You have said a great deal about the situation in the Netherlands."
"Since an investigation is still continuing into book price fixing in the Netherlands, I should like to know what more the Commission intends?"
"Are you going to raise the issue of book price fixing in the Netherlands again?"
"What is the position?"
"You are someone from my own linguistic region, and I hope you will give me a prompt answer."
"Mr President, the argument of multilingualism was the only good argument I heard the Commissioner offer."
"For the rest, he did not succeed in convincing me."
"I am in favour of book price fixing, because I believe that books are primarily a cultural commodity, a cultural product and, in most cases, a vehicle for culture."
"There are also some less serious things in the book trade."
"Belgium has never had book price fixing, even though it would have been very much in Flanders' interest, given that it is part of a small linguistic region."
"The whole Flemish government which has responsibility for culture was in favour of it."
"Just come and see what the results are."
"A catastrophic under-provision of services in Flanders as regards specialist booksellers - not just small ones - specialist bookshops and publishers, is the outcome."
"Because you will not find the poems of Nolens at a news-stand."
"We are moving towards a situation where books are bought at department stores and specialist bookshops are disappearing."
"With them goes the chance to bring specialist publications to the man in the street."
"The production of less commercial and specialist publications is therefore coming under pressure."
"In French-speaking Belgium, the main interest was after all quite different, and the finance minister is French-speaking."
"This is part of a large linguistic region where there was a market for cheap books exported from Belgium to France, because France does have book price fixing."
"The same thing happened from Flanders, by the way."
"Books were imported into the Netherlands, but these were actually phoney imports because Dutch publishers came to Belgium to do their printing and distorted the market."
"Culturally speaking, it is in our interest to have book price fixing."
"The fact that Belgium does not have it has simply facilitated distortions of competition on the part of the Dutch and French book market."
"We hope the Commission will abandon its efforts to attack book price fixing schemes, but rather see them as a way of integrating homogeneous linguistic regions and creating a European cultural area in which the wealth of European culture can find expression in all its diversity and quality."
"We hope too that the Council will address the subject, encouraged by a presidency which is now making culture a priority."
"The market needs to be put right not only in its social aspects, Mr Van Miert, but in its cultural aspects too."
"Book price fixing is an absolute must for linguistic regions like the Dutch-speaking region which are homogeneous, span borders and constitute a market for the sale of books in the language in question."
"We shall thus be voting for this resolution, even though it merely repeats what is so often called for by the culture ministers and is also a little bit detached from what is going on in the real decision-making bodies because, Mr President, we are talking here about a resolution whilst the Council meeting of 17 November specifically had book price fixing on its agenda."
"But I hope that Parliament will not remain a voice crying in the wilderness."
"Mr President, the arguments have been on the debating table for a long time."
"The issue of whether a report on the issue of fixed book prices has been drawn up yet has almost become a bon mot in legal circles in Vienna."
"Many renowned legal firms have given their expert opinions on this issue, approximately half of which were in favour of it and half against, depending on the client's point of view."
"This alone probably allows us to draw conclusions as to the complexity of the subject matter."
"If we therefore assume that the arguments are more or less equally good on both sides, the problem is reduced to judging the book either as a commercial good or a cultural object."
"I do not consider myself in any way to be a champion of the book trade, but a champion of books."
"In the battle of competition versus culture I have simply decided in favour of culture on the basis of Article 128(4)."
"This is because I would like to continue to be given informed advice in the bookshop and not to pick from stacks of books like a fast-food service."
"I should like to continue to find quality books in the bookshops and not only paperback best-sellers."
"Commissioner, you did not manage to convince me that fixed book prices or their abolition would not change anything."
"However, perhaps I read the wrong half of the reports."
"If we accept that the development of the Union into an integrated economic power requires cultural diversity and cultural differences, we can only oppose the abolition of fixed book prices, which I would consider to be a declaration of the cultural failure of the Union."
"Mr President, over the last five years I have sadly found on many occasions that it seems hard to have a sensible discussion."
"Whether or not I read a book before I go to bed, Mrs van Bladel, is not your business."
"It is my own affair."
"I have my library, and in fact I enjoy reading."
"But I also find, when I go to a bookshop, any bookshop, that the range of quality books on offer is usually limited, even in Europe."
"You are making it sound here as if all books are quality books."
"What kind of misrepresentation is that?"
"Let us just take a closer look at what exactly the issues are."
"Am I to understand from the many speeches which have been made here that where there is no book price fixing there is no culture, no quality range of books on offer?"
"Just travel the world a little, and you will see that the reality is quite different."
"You will see that with or without book price fixing, mergers are occurring everywhere, that the small booksellers have their backs to the wall, and I wanted to say something more on that."
"I am sorry, Mr von Wogau, but it is indeed one of life's pleasures to have time to walk around, browse through a few books, buy something and then read them, either on the way to Strasbourg in the car - I am lucky enough to have a chauffeur so I can read in the car and do not have to leave it until bedtime."
"It is a pleasure, it is an indulgence, it enriches you culturally."
"But you can do that just as well in a country which has no book price fixing."
"Are you saying it cannot be done in Sweden or Finland, in the United Kingdom or the United States?"
"Let us talk seriously now."
"So yes, what about these proposals in favour of the small bookseller?"
"Apart from the fact that it is high time, Mrs Maes, to desist from these practices which so distort competition and are spilling over from the Netherlands to other countries too."
"Because the Netherlands had a powerful machinery of protectionism."
"It was not just book price fixing, it was a kind of inbreeding."
"Because you had to belong to the club or you did not get a look in."
"However good your books were, if you did not accept the club rules, so to speak, you were nowhere and you could not sell your quality books."
"That was how it worked."
"Happily, this has now been recognised and it is beginning to change."
"Why?"
"Because the Commission is indeed studying the matter."
"That is why, that is the reality."
"A start has been made on changing things, on clearing out a few things, that is the reality."
"I am more than happy to explain to anyone why that was necessary and why the Dutch, the organisations concerned, also shifted ground in the end."
"They were not concerned with books, they were not concerned with culture, they were concerned with their economic interest."
"That is a fact."
"That is how the system was."
"And now, as far as the small bookseller is concerned, I have been urging the book fairs for years to do something for the small bookseller, to give him more flexibility, to let him tailor his services more to his clients and, if it suits him, to sell his books at slightly lower prices."
"Have you ever checked with public opinion how hard it is for a lot of people to pay those high prices?"
"Can we just think a bit about the circumstances of those buying?"
"Or whether they would like to buy books?"
"Can we bear that in mind?"
"Is that perhaps what was meant by the references to the Vatican?"
"Can we at least think of the people who have to buy the books?"
"That too is a dimension which has to be borne in mind and which, Mrs Maes, is all too often overlooked when you talk to culture ministers."
"Thought is given to publishers, thought is given to authors, but too little thought is given to those who have to read the books."
"That is my experience."
"Once again, I would invite you to draft a resolution which seeks to strengthen the position of the small bookseller in a meaningful way."
"Give him more flexibility instead of placing obligations on him."
"Give him greater discounts than you give to the bigger bookseller."
"May I ask you to do that?"
"If you are serious about helping small booksellers, do something instead of coming here complaining and attacking the Commission."
"I suggest you do that, Mr von Wogau, and I shall be happy to accept your invitation to discuss it further but meanwhile, Mrs Maes, we have lawsuits pending, the Commission is threatened with being taken before the Court for not taking action, for not fulfilling our responsibilities."
"That threat is hanging over us."
"I do not care, as long as I have the feeling that we can reach a solution."
"But for five years now, I have been asking for proposals so that things can perhaps be resolved to the benefit of small booksellers, and I am still waiting."
"The only thing I feel is constant political pressure to close my eyes to the law and ignore obvious realities."
"As I have already said, I will not do that!"
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to ask one further question. Are you prepared to think about this again and also to talk with those affected about whether abolishing fixed book prices could, as is claimed, negatively affect small bookshops' costings, the result being not more competition but the emergence of monopoly-type situations brought about by distribution chains, as has already happened in other areas of the retail trade?"
"Could you please also take into account once again that if this occurred a large number of local bookshops would disappear, the advice offered could deteriorate, and a large number of training places, which are urgently needed, and part-time jobs - particularly in my country - would also disappear."
"Thank you, Mr Elchlepp."
"Ladies and gentlemen, others have expressed a wish to speak but we are not going to reopen the debate."
"The debate is already closed."
"In any event, Mr Elchlepp was given the floor as an exception as author of the question, but we are not going to open the debate again."
"With that speech by Mr Elchlepp, the debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"I would inform the House that motions for resolutions B4-0984/98 and B4-0986/98 have been withdrawn."
"I would also point out that Mrs Maes has added her signature, on behalf of the Green Group, to motion for a resolution B4-0991/98, which I now put to the vote."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Mr President, since I had no other opportunity, I must use the explanation of vote to express my opinion."
"I did not participate in this debate because I am personally affected, and a low profile should then be kept as a rule."
"I owned a retail bookshop in Germany for 12 years before I was elected to Parliament, so the topic which you have been discussing with such commitment affects me personally."
"I must say that you have a different perception of reality than I do."
"For future reference, the main mistake you are making is as follows: small bookshops are of course protected by fixed prices because it is quite clear that this competition arises the moment the current principle of exclusion of price competition - whereby a small shop's prices may not be undercut by a large shop - ceases to apply, when fixed prices decrease."
"No small business has then a chance of competing against Bertelsmann."
"That is the case!"
"Now you ask - and in principle you are right - why we should not give the small bookshop the chance of higher discounts so that it has flexibility in costing."
"Do you not know who has to guarantee the discounts for the small bookshop?"
"Bertelsmann!"
"It is also the big publishing houses which guarantee these discounts."
"Do you believe they are suddenly giving bookshops greater discounts only because you are abolishing fixed prices?"
"The result will be that fixed prices will decrease, and the lack of discounts will continue, and in the end, 5 0-6 000 bookshops in Germany will cross the great divide."
"Why?"
"So that in the end - and I am firmly convinced of this - the niche culture will also be preserved."
"There will continue to be expensive folios and books, but do you know what form they will take?"
"They will be exclusive and more expensive than they are today!"
"When all is said and done, you are not thinking of the consumers, whom you have in mind; rather, you are running the business of the big companies, even though you do not really want to."
"Perhaps you think about this once again."
"Thank you, Mr Schulz."
"Adjournment of the session"
"Ladies and gentlemen, before closing the parliamentary part-session, as is customary and, what is more, a pleasure, allow me to say a few words of thanks to all of Parliament's services."
"And, as on previous occasions, I would particularly like to thank those who do not have a direct relationship with us, including the interpreters."
"We can actually see them, despite the fact that they are inside 'goldfish bowls', and beyond the coldness of those warm goldfish bowls, we do have a direct relationship with them."
"I would also like to thank the ushers who kindly meet our every need and the Presidency's services who improve our work and always ensure that we make fewer mistakes than we would otherwise make."
"There are, however, others with whom we do not have such direct contact. I am referring here to the translation services, who translate 4 000 pages a day, and also the anonymous collaborators who, on a daily basis, struggle to make sense of our speeches in the Rainbow ."
"To all of these people, especially the latter, we offer our sincere thanks."
"And, ladies and gentlemen, as Spanish folklore says: 'A white year is a good year'."
"It has snowed this week and I am a great believer in folklore."
"I am sure that this snowfall will bring us good fortune, perhaps not all year - since it has only snowed a little - but maybe at least for this weekend, which I hope will be a pleasant one for you all."
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"(The sitting was closed at 11.42 a.m.)"
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 20 November 1998."
"Welcome"
"I should like to welcome a group of members of the United States Congress, led by Mr Jim Kolbe, who are now with us in the official gallery."
"We are very glad to receive these visitors to Parliament."
"Mr Valdivielso de Cué has the floor."
"Mr President, I should like to mention something we are forever requesting at Plenary sessions: that Members should refrain from using mobile phones, as this disrupts proceedings in the House."
"I urge the President to take appropriate action to ensure that proceedings in the House and in committees are not disrupted in this way. We are here to deal with the issues entrusted to us by our constituents, and we need the right environment in which to do so."
"Indeed, we are fortunate in receiving certain allowances enabling us to engage assistants. Should something really urgent arise, an assistant can pass us a note and we can then deal with the matter."
"I am most anxious for a permanent solution to be found to prevent further disruption."
"Thank you."
"Thank you, Mr Valdivielso."
"We shall ask the College of Quaestors to take the necessary steps to overcome this problem."
"Agenda"
"The order of business for today and tomorrow has been adopted."
"However, the following changes have been proposed:"
"Wednesday: The report by Mr Tillich and Lord Tomlinson on draft supplementary and amending budget No 1/98 concerning Section III - Commission, which it was decided during the last part-session to include on today's agenda, will not be taken because the Council has not adopted the draft budget."
"This item will therefore be placed on the agenda for the December part-session in Strasbourg."
"Mr President, I should like to make a suggestion on behalf of my group concerning the first item on the agenda for today's sitting."
"Mr Santer is to make a concrete proposal here as part of Question Time regarding a new anti-fraud instrument for the European Union."
"The problem is that the Committee on Budgetary Control asked the European Commission some time ago to produce concrete proposals and put them to the Committee on Budgetary Control on 1 December."
"That has not happened."
"Meanwhile, the Commission is indeed doing so here today, but during Question Time when we cannot have a proper substantive debate."
"Consequently our group is proposing that, after Mr Santer's statement, each group should first be given three minutes in which it can at least express an opinion on the substance."
"I can tell you, Mr President, that the Committee on Budgetary Control was unanimously of the view that it was particularly unfortunate not to be able to address so fundamental a subject in a proper debate."
"I would therefore ask you to put my proposal to the House."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome this proposal."
"We have just received the document which forms the basis for the new Fraud Office, and I have to say that we are extremely surprised to receive it now, having had very intensive meetings yesterday and the day before."
"I do not want to be difficult about the timing, but given that it has already been printed up in all the languages, I would have thought that it should have been submitted to the Committee on Budgetary Control as the committee responsible the day before yesterday, or at the latest yesterday, so that we could have discussed it."
"This is important for the 1996 discharge, and I have to say that I am very disappointed that this procedure has been adopted, given that the documents are all ready and complete."
"We should have had a proper debate!"
"(Applause)"
"- According to my information, Mrs Theato, the document in question was only adopted by the Commission this morning."
"When we receive it through the official channels, we shall follow the normal procedure. The document will be passed to the Committee on Budgetary Control, and at the appropriate time, the House will take a decision on that committee's report."
"What we cannot do is depart from normal procedure and replace the committee's report, any amendments and the ensuing debate with an improvised debate held here and now, in which each of the political groups would be allowed three minutes."
"I cannot do that, it is against the Rules of Procedure."
"In any case, the President of the Commission is asking for the floor and I must give it to him as he has been referred to."
"Mr President, I am rather surprised at what I am hearing."
"Since my appointment in 1995, the Commission has repeatedly been asked to inform Parliament first about the decisions we take on Wednesday mornings."
"This is exactly what we are doing today, with Parliament therefore being the first to be informed of the discussion."
"Would you rather I had sent it for printing this morning, so that Parliament would not have received it until tomorrow or the day after?"
"In this case, the Commission really is informing Parliament first and I believe that we must also abide by the institutional and parliamentary rules which exist in our Member States."
"Thursday:"
"I would remind the House that the entire morning will be given over to voting, with the following items being added:"
"pursuant to Rule 66(7), a recommendation in the form of a letter concerning the marketing of fertilisers containing cadmium in Austria, Finland and Sweden (Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy); -pursuant to Rule 99, the report (A4-0434/98) by Mrs Schierhuber on inland waterway transport (Committee on Transport and Tourism); -pursuant to Rule 99, the report (A4-0440/98) by Mr Langen on extending the temporary derogation applicable to Germany and Austria (Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy); -the report (A4-0400/98) by Mr Ferri on supplementary pensions, the vote on which was postponed during the November partsession (Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights); -the motions for resolutions on various budget headings concerning human rights and democracy in Chapter B7-70, the debate on which took place on 17 November.If there are no comments, these changes are approved."
"Pursuant to Rule 97, the Council has requested the application of urgent procedure for the draft Council Regulation laying down the requirements for the implementation of development cooperation operations which contribute to the general objective of developing and consolidating democracy and the rule of law and to that of respecting human rights and fundamental freedoms (9581/98 - C4-0507/98-97/0191(SYN))."
"The Committee on Development and Cooperation has adopted a report on this subject by Mr Torres Couto which is due to be included on the agenda for the next part-session."
"I give the floor to Mr Rocard to express the opinion of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, as the committee responsible."
"Mr President, the Committee on Development and Cooperation is rather embarrassed about this request."
"I must stress to you and to all our colleagues that the Torres Couto report is important. Having discussed this in detail and amended many points, we are proud to propose this report to Parliament."
"We also believe that its adoption is urgent in terms of the policy guidelines of the European Union."
"When we learnt that the Austrian Presidency particularly wanted to have done with this issue and to adopt the decision before the end of its presidency, we applauded this desire and indicated our support."
"We hoped that the parliamentary deadlines would allow this to happen, thus leading me to support this request now."
"Furthermore, in its extraordinary sitting yesterday - and I must thank you for prompting this, Mr President - the Commission voted on this unanimously."
"However, it appears that there is very little time available in today's sitting and that the rapporteur is not completely ready, which would prevent an urgent debate from proceeding under the optimum conditions."
"Therefore, in my role as committee chairman, I am forced to say to the members of our committee who yesterday voted for the urgent procedure that they should feel free to follow their consciences in terms of the contradiction between the problem of ensuring a proper and comprehensive debate, which we cannot have, and the concern for parliamentary effectiveness which might prompt us to vote almost without discussion."
"I can only say that the members of the committee should have a free vote, and as for the rest of Parliament, I shall trust in your wisdom."
"We understand the Austrian Presidency's desire to use the urgent procedure in order to conclude this issue, but this would involve a discussion this evening and a vote tomorrow."
"As the conditions are not entirely suitable, I am trusting in Parliament's wisdom."
"Does anyone wish to speak against?"
"I give the floor to Mr Galeote Quecedo."
"Mr President, I feel Mr Rocard has put forward the main argument against the request for urgent procedure very clearly: Mr Torres Couto, the rapporteur, is not present at this sitting because there were no plans to vote on his report during this sitting."
"If only out of deference to the rapporteur, therefore, I feel we cannot accelerate the procedure to that stage."
"As a supporting argument, I should like to mention a fundamental issue."
"Through Commissioner van den Broek, and at the eleventh hour, the European Commission has raised a problem concerning the financing of the Bureaux d'Assistance Technique , such as the European Foundation for Human Rights."
"This cannot be resolved through an addition to the existing remarks in the 1999 budget. On the contrary, a specific amendment is required."
"A satisfactory solution must be found to such a serious issue, and we need adequate time to debate it. I therefore feel it would be inappropriate to vote in haste tomorrow on such an important resolution."
"Thank you, Mr Galeote."
"I put the request for urgent procedure to the vote."
"(Parliament rejected the request for urgent procedure)"
"Pursuant to Rule 99(2), I have received an objection from 31 Members to the Porto report being dealt with under the procedure without debate."
"In accordance with Rule 99, this report will therefore be placed on the draft agenda of a subsequent part-session with debate."
"The Commission of Tomorrow"
"The next item is the communication by the Commission on 'Tomorrow's Commission'."
"I give the floor to Mr Santer, President of the Commission."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have come here today to talk about two issues which have been the subject of much discussion recently and which are of the greatest concern to this House, as we have heard from the preliminary discussions."
"These are the future of UCLAF and the discharge procedure for 1996."
"As there are direct links between these two issues and the way in which the Commission operates, I must take this opportunity to mention the extensive internal reforms which I started and which I will conclude in 1999."
"The starting point for our discussion must be to acknowledge that Europe is doing well, that good progress is being made on the major issues and that an extremely high level of integration has been achieved."
"Europe's very successes present a challenge and require changes to be made in our operating methods and working practices."
"The unification of Europe must involve a constant process of construction and consolidation."
"The institutions are both the heart of this process and the means of achieving it."
"All the more reason then for us to ensure an atmosphere of confidence between the institutions and to manage our relations with each other in a responsible manner."
"The atmosphere surrounding the discussion of certain issues worries me."
"I myself want to help re-establish an atmosphere of calm which is conducive to achieving our common goal of a Europe looking resolutely to the future."
"The debate on the Bösch report last October was an opportunity to ask certain questions about the future of fraud prevention in the Union."
"Major progress has been made in this area since 1995."
"UCLAF's powers have been increased and in 1997 it was given the status of a task force."
"In July this year we adopted a comprehensive framework for its activities which will shortly be followed by detailed rules of application."
"Thanks to UCLAF's efficient work a number of cases involving Commission officials have come to light."
"Despite this, Parliament has repeatedly questioned the autonomy and independence of our investigators."
"I must reaffirm, with some force, that they have always had complete freedom."
"Nevertheless, a clear separation between inspectors and those they inspect is healthy."
"To remove any doubts, we must not stop half-way, and the discussion about externalising the service must be taken to its logical end."
"We have therefore come to the conclusion that creating a completely independent Anti-Fraud Office which is not in any way subordinate to the Commission or to any other institution is the most effective and most defensible way of achieving the goal set out in the Bösch report. We are in total agreement on this."
"However, two important points must be clarified."
"Firstly, the future Office will have the sole task of carrying out investigations both in the Member States and within all the Community institutions and bodies."
"It will not be involved in proposing legislation or in coordinating with the Member States the fight against fraud affecting the financial interests of the Union."
"These tasks, as stipulated in the Treaty, will continue to be performed by the Commission."
"Next, I must stress that, until the new structure comes into operation, the current UCLAF will continue its work to track down those guilty of fraud, within the framework laid down by the Commission last July."
"Our proposal, which was approved yesterday evening, is now before Parliament and the Council."
"In addition to detailing the aims and administrative structure of the Office, it sets out the basic principles for the conduct of investigations, the rules governing relations with the institutions and the controls for ensuring that the Office's activities are legal."
"Everyone must now assume their responsibilities as I have done."
"It is now the turn of Parliament and the Council to play their part."
"If the political will exists, the decision could be adopted within six months."
"I was encouraged by the very positive reception given to my statement on this issue by the Heads of State and Government at Pörtschach."
"I am also sure that this House, which has made the fight against fraud affecting the EU's interests one of its main objectives, will make every effort to ensure that this crucial issue moves forward."
"Fraud prevention is one of the aspects raised in the debate on the discharge, and we will have an opportunity to discuss it during the December part-session."
"However, I must say a few words about it now as it has already become a matter of public debate."
"In its resolution adopted on 31 March this year, Parliament made the discharge for the 1996 budget conditional on a whole range of conditions, some connected with that particular year and others of a more general nature."
"The Commission gave clear and constructive answers to all your questions and a detailed note is available."
"I see no reason why this should not be circulated to all the MEPs, in fact I would welcome this."
"There are still two or three controversial points on which I cannot accept Parliament's requests."
"You know that we have prosecuted whenever UCLAF has suspected fraud."
"I have never compromised on this principle and I never will."
"As far as the MED programme is concerned, I simply cannot agree to hand over the whole file to the judicial authorities, because UCLAF has not established a presumption of fraud."
"To do so would be an abdication of our responsibilities and would hardly be compatible with the rule of law as I understand it."
"As for Parliament's right of access to the information needed to exercise its power of scrutiny, clearly this is an inviolable democratic principle which I fully support."
"I am in favour of as much openness as possible but this must be compatible with the law and the proper handling of cases."
"I have made considerable efforts to maintain this principle, including having had documents sent to Parliament which would not, in my long experience, have been sent to national parliaments."
"However, we must distinguish between the situation in which Parliament's general right to information must prevail in the interest of effective scrutiny and the situation in which individual cases need to be handled confidentially."
"With regard to Parliament's general right to information, I can confirm the Commission's desire to cooperate fully with Parliament to ensure that the latter can exercise its powers of political and budgetary scrutiny."
"However, in relation to cases subject to legal or disciplinary proceedings, I would remind you of a universally recognised legal principle: the confidentiality of preparatory inquiries."
"Nothing must be done to jeopardise these inquiries."
"The same applies to cases subject to confidentiality rules involving trade secrets and respect for privacy. In such cases the Commission has a particular responsibility which it cannot ignore."
"This is why the names were blanked out in the UCLAF report on ECHO which you were sent."
"I admit that the form of this document invited criticism, which is why I had it redrafted to make it easier to read."
"The Commission has most certainly not tried to hide anything."
"I would also remind you that the chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control and the rapporteurs were able to consult the full document in situ ."
"Over the years, relations between Parliament and the Commission regarding access to information have always been based on mutual trust."
"The problems of recent months must not make us lose sight of the fundamentals."
"The time has come to put these events into perspective and to find ways of rebuilding that trust."
"It was in this spirit that I suggested to Mr Gil Robles that a code of conduct should be drawn up in order to clarify the situation and to meet the respective needs of the two institutions."
"The discussions on the 1996 discharge have been going on for months."
"ECOFIN set out its position on 9 March, in the context of the provisions of Article 206 of the Treaty, which provide for a recommendation from the Council."
"The Council gave a favourable recommendation and the time has now come to settle the matter."
"I personally feel that all the objective criteria for giving discharge have been met."
"There is a direct link between the issues which I have just raised and the initiative entitled 'The Commission of Tomorrow' which will be one of my main priorities for 1999."
"The component parts of this initiative actually date back to 1995 and the beginning of my term of office."
"I am thinking in particular here of improvements in financial management and the checks on the use of public funding in the context of SEM 2000 - the System of Sound and Efficient Financial Management."
"In this respect we have, for example, established a clear distinction between decision-makers and financial managers."
"This is something of a first in our organisation."
"We have also created a joint structure for external assistance."
"I must also mention the MAP 2000 programme - the Modernisation of Administration and Personnel - which was launched in 1997 and which is increasing the autonomy which the Directors-General have over the structure of their departments, appointments and management."
"This represents real progress towards giving Commission staff more responsibility."
"However, it is only really since the beginning of this year that we have developed a more comprehensive, more coherent and higher profile approach, involving all staff more directly."
"'The Commission of Tomorrow' initiative has a simple aim which is to eliminate the weaknesses and develop the strengths of our institution in order to leave everything in order for our successors."
"We are looking at three areas: firstly, the future role and tasks of the Commission; secondly, the structures and operating methods of the Commission, and thirdly, internal management."
"On the first point, I believe that we must try to answer some basic questions which, albeit with some differences here and there, apply to all the institutions and Member States."
"How can we cope with the high degree of integration which the Union has achieved?"
"How can we manage the new fields of action such as employment, health and justice and home affairs?"
"How do we establish our priorities in an enlarged Union?"
"How can the concepts of subsidiarity and proportionality be developed in an intelligent manner?"
"It is in this context that the Commission's structures are being examined."
"In order to prepare the ground, I have launched a major screening exercise which will provide a clear and comprehensive view of the current situation."
"In the first half of 1999 I will draw up an overall plan for the structure of the portfolios and the organisation of the departments."
"I have actually come to the conclusion that this type of reform should have been undertaken a long time ago."
"The structures must be adapted to cope with the dramatic growth in the number of tasks."
"This leads me to the third point on the future of the Commission: internal management, in the broad sense of the term."
"In the last few years a great deal has been accomplished."
"Thanks to the current reforms in financial management, the Commission will gradually be able to eliminate practices from the past linked to the massive increase in the tasks to be performed and the appropriations to be managed."
"In this context, I must draw your attention to an important point."
"The Commission cannot be constantly asked to take on new tasks without considering the human resources which it has to carry out these tasks."
"In truth, the Commission itself has too often overlooked this aspect in the past."
"We are therefore all responsible to some extent."
"I would hope that we can consider together how best to resolve the problems resulting from the gap between the objectives and the means to achieve them."
"I consider that the approach adopted recently in terms of legal bases and mini-budgets is positive."
"There is a golden rule which we must use to guide us: absolute openness and clear rules."
"Management reform clearly involves more than just financial matters."
"Together with our staff and their representatives we are currently discussing ways of improving recruitment, training, assessment, internal communication, disciplinary measures and many other questions."
"A joint working party composed of representatives of staff and administration has produced a very interesting report which has just been circulated within the Commission and which has been the subject of extensive consultation."
"The other institutions are also currently being contacted about this."
"I expect to be able to draw the necessary conclusions from this process in the first half of 1999, which will include amending the Staff Regulations where necessary."
"This is a brief outline of the reforms which I am preparing with my colleagues, several of whom were keen to accompany me here today."
"After the reform of the Treaty, the introduction of the euro, the employment strategy and Agenda 2000, I hope to tackle this other major challenge successfully."
"I am doing this because action needs to be taken, because I believe in the central role of the Commission and because I am confident in the future of the European civil service."
"I have accepted my responsibilities as President."
"I have initiated reforms."
"I believe that we are on course and I intend to stay there."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, you began by saying you hoped for a Europe which looked to the future."
"Now, I would like to ask you: when do you want it by?"
"When will we be allowed to study the information you provide for us with the help of an interpreter and in the presence of a member of Parliament's administration?"
"When will it cease to be necessary for Parliament to apply pressure to obtain a response from the Commission?"
"When will UCLAF be able to work free from pressure by the Commission?"
"Mr President of the Commission, you were complaining of too much pressure from Parliament."
"I can but point out to you that institutions without checks and balances are condemned to self-destruction."
"In political terms, the easy answer to Mr Fabra Vallés' question is that we are already looking to the future."
"In less than thirty days the euro will be introduced. This will allow Europe to assert itself with regard to the outside world and to take its place on the world stage."
"We also decided yesterday in ECOFIN on the external representation of the euro."
"This is our Europe of the future, one which can establish its predominance at international level."
"You asked about information. I refuse to believe that UCLAF has been put under any pressure by the Commission and this is confirmed by my discussions with the director of UCLAF."
"This is why I am now saying that if this is the case, then we should set up what the Commission is proposing: an anti-fraud office which is not only truly independent of all the institutions but which also has the power to act in respect of all the institutions."
"This will ensure a truly neutral authority in the eyes of Parliament, the Commission and the other institutions."
"This is why, after long and careful consideration and with the assistance of Parliament, I can say - given that I took part in the debate on the Bösch report at the beginning of October - that we have truly started on the road to the future in terms of information."
"This is precisely the aim of our proposal for a new UCLAF."
"Its name is not at issue here; what is important is the body itself, its independence and neutrality and also the reciprocal neutrality of the bodies consulted."
"This is the way in which we are looking forward, so please do not say that Europe is not looking to the future."
"I know what I am talking about and I can say that Europe is now in a much better position than when I was appointed as President of the Commission in January 1995."
"Mr President of the Commission, if information policy is so important, then why does your proposal - which we will naturally be examining very carefully - not say anything about how the European Parliament is to be kept informed by the new office that is to be set up?"
"This is something that struck me immediately."
"How can we hope to bring about improvements with the new office if Parliament is to be even less well informed?"
"My second point is this: the central provisions of your proposal are contained in Article 3 on the office's right of inspection."
"But there is a very strange contradiction here."
"Article 3(1) on external controls says that the office can itself apply to the Commission to carry out an inspection anywhere in a Member State."
"But Article 3(2) is much more interesting ..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"I am well aware that the honourable Member has not been able to examine the substance of the proposal, which is why she has questions."
"And we are here to answer them, since they raise a number of fair points which we have also considered."
"You must not think that we have overlooked them."
"This is why I am happy to answer your questions."
"Firstly, the European Parliament, like all the other institutions, is a full member of the Administrative Board and if you read the other provisions in the proposal - which you must have done because you are quoting them - the final paragraph of Article 9 states that the Administrative Board, including Parliament, draws up an annual report and sends this to the institutions."
"Clearly, this new office, its director and its various departments will be available to Parliament and all the other institutions which are also required to carry out checks and investigations."
"In answer to your second question, the new office will be responsible solely for carrying out investigations."
"The Commission remains politically responsible for referring cases to the Anti-Fraud Office and for monitoring investigations."
"This is indicated in the provisions."
"I would therefore agree that you will have to examine the various carefully constructed proposals in detail in cooperation with our legal services in order to get an idea of the general organisation of this body."
"You can be sure that we wanted to respond to the objective set out in the Bösch report of a fraud prevention body with real independence and autonomy."
"This was your objective and we have looked for the ways and means to achieve it."
"I cannot therefore see any difference in attitude between Parliament and the Commission."
"On the contrary, I believe that by improving fraud prevention this office can guide us in the future in order to ensure greater openness and to eliminate criticisms like those which have been made recently."
"I continue to refute that the Commission has exerted or is exerting any pressure on UCLAF."
"Mr President, we must say to Mr Santer that it is encouraging to see that he is proposing certain reforms."
"Of course, that is important but it is also very important to have the will of the majority."
"In view of yesterday's decision in Ecofin where now a majority of nine Member States are in favour of, or abstaining on, the question of an extension of duty-free, will the Commission now bow to the pressure of that majority and agree to carry out its long-awaited study into the effects on employment of abolition."
"This is especially relevant in view of the remarks of the French Finance Minister with regard to the impact of abolition on employment and the stated intention of the incoming German presidency who said that they will push for a lengthy delay."
"Maybe the Commission will tell us how they will get out of the dilemma now that they are clearly out of touch with people."
"I could talk at length about this problem."
"It is just as well that duty free is not yet under investigation by UCLAF and so I will answer the question."
"It is a bit like the Loch Ness monster which keeps coming up."
"You should remember that duty free was abolished by a unanimous decision of the finance ministers in 1991,"
"which must be implemented in 1999."
"An eight-year period was provided precisely for the purpose of carrying out various studies and adopting legislation."
"This was the reason for the arrangements made and length of the deadlines set at the time by the twelve finance ministers."
"I have a clear memory of this discussion which I followed closely because this decision was taken during our presidency of the Council."
"I must stress that the decision was unanimous."
"Now that I am on the other side of the fence, as President of the Commission I must stress that the Commission is the guardian of the Treaty and it must implement the decisions unanimously adopted by the Council of Ministers."
"If there were now unanimous agreement on another avenue I would be the last person to stand in the way, but the Council is not unanimous on any other proposal."
"It was a unanimous decision which transposed the directive in 1991 and you approved it."
"So we must be consistent ourselves, and with regard to the provisions governing our institutions, so that we can remain credible."
"We must implement the decisions which have been taken."
"Where would we be if, every time a decision was taken or a directive adopted, the Commission started wondering how to sidestep it or how to scrutinise its application?"
"I believe that we have a constitutional and institutional role to play which we must fulfil."
"The Commission cannot do anything else in this respect."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, you had two thousand permanent posts still unfilled at the beginning of 1998, so it was not because of the lack of posts that you were not able to keep checks."
"Secondly, a Member of the Commission has told me that the UCLAF used Stasi methods, on the lines of East Germany's former security service."
"I think that firstly he is not in a position to judge and, secondly, he should not make such statements."
"In my view, this proposed OLAF regulation is simply designed to punish UCLAF for the work it has done up to now, which your services have failed to follow up."
"This is why I believe you must think we are stupid, because suggesting that OLAF should carry out checks only when instructed to do so by the Commission is tantamount to shelving any controls, at least in your own institution, which you would have us believe is so transparent."
"Just how do you intend to ensure that the Commission really is transparent?"
"I can tell you quite honestly that I have never in my life - and I have been in politics a long time, I became a member of my government in 1972 - thought that any Member of Parliament was stupid."
"That is something I would like to make very clear."
"I very much respect Parliament, and as the President of the Commission I very much respect this House, and that is why I absolutely refuse to let anyone say or imply such things about me."
"Mr President, I spoke in German so that there was no need to translate."
"I must say that I myself have never criticised the operation of UCLAF."
"On the contrary, it was when I became President of the Commission in January 1995 that UCLAF was launched, and thanks to the cooperation with Parliament we have constantly improved its operation."
"In 1997 we decided to establish a task force to assist UCLAF in its duties."
"I have never accused UCLAF of using Stasi-like methods."
"Anyone making such claims must show me the proof."
"I have great respect for the difficult work carried out by the Commission officials and I must say that, if certain investigations have been discussed within Parliament and also in the press, then this is because, thanks to UCLAF, certain incidents of fraud have been detected, dating back to before the present Commission."
"It is therefore due to the activities of our own departments that we are now in this situation which certain MEPs are criticising."
"There is a saying in my local dialect which I will say in German because you speak German and will therefore understand it better: 'Gutheit ist ein Stück von Dummheit'."
"This is perhaps what has happened with us."
"We have to some extent become victims of our own initiatives."
"This is why you must read our proposals, whose broad outlines the Council has approved and whose direction the Heads of State and Government have deemed reasonable, with a clear and independent mind and without accusing us of crimes based on assumptions rather than facts."
"So please reserve making a judgment, which must be calm and unprejudiced, until you have studied the Commission's communication in detail."
"Mr President, there is not a great deal of agreement between the proposal which the Commission is now presenting and the call made by Parliament with a very large majority for UCLAF to be strengthened."
"What surprises me so much, Mr Santer, is how you can talk about an independent office."
"How can the new UCLAF be independent when it will still be the Commission that decides what investigations are to be carried out?"
"How can there be any talk of an independent office when it will still be the Commission that decides how the investigations are followed up?"
"The fact is that we are not talking about independence at all, but about the Commission still completely controlling what happens in terms of inquiries."
"Is it not more a question of people wanting to shed responsibility and trying to run away from the responsibilities which they have in connection with precisely the kind of things we have been dealing with here recently?"
"So, Mr Santer, it is extremely disappointing that you have not been willing to engage in a debate with us on the proposal which has now been put forward."
"Mr President, Parliament will clearly have plenty of time to discuss this point in depth, and when you do, you will see that UCLAF really is an autonomous body with its own legal status."
"It will be entrusted with the task of carrying out investigations as part of the fight against fraud against the Community budget, both in the Member States and within the Community institutions or independent bodies."
"This is how it is defined."
"The Commission is not alone in being able to ask UCLAF to carry out an investigation, although it is the main institution involved in the investigations."
"Furthermore, the bulk of UCLAF's current investigations are being carried out in the Member States as this is its main job."
"This is why we thought it necessary also to include the Council in UCLAF."
"All the institutions have the right to ask UCLAF to carry out an investigation and the future UCLAF may initiate investigations on its own initiative."
"I believe that you must read the document and you will then understand that what you have just said is simply not true, and I am not saying this lightly."
"You must look at the document, which was written by lawyers and which covers all the points which you are calling into question."
"The Commission did not want to be the only institution with the right to order investigations by UCLAF, so all the institutions are entitled to do this, just as all the institutions are in general represented on the Administrative Board."
"This is the best possible proof of the neutrality and autonomy of this body in which Parliament has a say like all the other institutions."
"I believe that this is the best way of guaranteeing the effectiveness of the new office."
"Mr Santer, the Bösch report to which you have referred is not the one I wrote, because what you have made of it has nothing to do with the Bösch report adopted by Parliament."
"I would like to tell you something about what has happened and why this suggestion has been made."
"Commissioner Gradin promised us in July that Parliament would be involved in a comprehensive reform of UCLAF."
"Parliament's President reminded you of this in writing at the end of November, I think."
"But nothing has happened."
"Now you have presented us with a proposal and told us to read what you have put in it."
"Is this how you intend to restore confidence between our institutions, Mr Santer?"
"There is another point I would like to make about the substance of the proposal."
"The Bösch report to which you referred called for UCLAF to be strengthened."
"You are now destroying all the work the Commission has done up to now to combat fraud."
"Is this how you mean to restore the public's confidence in the Commission's anti-fraud policy?"
"Those were the two questions I wanted to put to you."
"I can answer these questions very easily."
"The clear objective of your report - ensuring the independence of UCLAF - is one to which I subscribe, as I have said on many occasions, even back in October during the debate."
"However, the independence of UCLAF will never be guaranteed if it remains a department of the Commission, managed by Parliament."
"This is not viable and cannot be considered either legally or institutionally."
"This is why we went beyond your proposals while maintaining the same objective."
"Consider this: our proposal undoubtedly goes beyond your own report, but it remains in an interinstitutional framework, which I believe is important."
"The purpose of UCLAF is not to conduct internal investigations just within the Commission."
"It is currently involved in over 900 investigations in the Member States where the majority of the investigations are needed."
"Within the Commission there are only 27 ongoing investigations."
"So you can see that the majority of the investigations involve the Member States."
"The Council and all the other institutions must therefore be integrated into the new body and I cannot see any connection between your question and our proposal which encompasses and exceeds your objective by placing it in an interinstitutional framework, thus increasing the confidence of citizens in the supervisory bodies."
"This will be the future for UCLAF as a European anti-fraud office and an independent body with its own legal status, assisted by top experts who will be independent and who will offer all the guarantees of independence."
"I really believe that in this way UCLAF and its independence will be strengthened."
"Mr President, Mr Santer, a year ago Parliament approved an amendment to the budget on a minor matter of the appointment of a deputy director for an agency answerable to the Commission."
"Neither Commissioner Papoutsis, who was responsible for the body in question, nor Commissioner Liikanen, as head of personnel, have been able to persuade the director, who has refused to apply the vote of this House."
"Such a case does not require an UCLAF investigation but simply proves that some of your commissioners are not able to make their officials obey them, and that these officials do not give two hoots about votes in this House."
"This is why our group does not currently feel able to give discharge as we feel that the fraud detected simply points to an all-powerful technocracy, cut off from reality and which, to some extent, does exactly as it pleases."
"My question is: if we refuse to give discharge, are you ready to ask the commissioner for the portfolio where real embezzlement has been discovered - namely ECHO - to resign?"
"In other words, are you ready to sanction incompetence, because, in this specific case, I trust in the personal honesty of the commissioner in question."
"I regret that I cannot answer the question about the appointment of a deputy director."
"There must be reasons for what happened."
"I will check on this and let you know the reasons for our appointments."
"However, you must realise that directors are not appointed by votes in this House, given that the separation of powers exists."
"It is the Commission which decides on appointments made within its departments, and we do not ask the European Parliament whom it has appointed as its directors."
"There are some interinstitutional rules which must be respected."
"With regard to the refusal to give discharge to the Commission, I would say that the discharge procedure is taking place as stipulated in the provisions of Article 206 of the Treaty."
"This article says that Parliament gives discharge to the Commission on the Council's recommendation."
"I said just now that the Council has recommended that Parliament should give discharge."
"Therefore, ECOFIN, which knows what it is talking about, has already made a recommendation to Parliament."
"It must not be forgotten that the Council is a branch of the budget authority"
"As for the resignation of certain commissioners, the constitutional and institutional provisions of the Treaty are clear and I am satisfied with these."
"The Commission is the guardian of the Treaty and I will abide by its provisions, nothing more and nothing less."
"This is my duty and my right and I will not move on this point."
"Mr President, I have a feeling that you are trying to shut the stable door when the horse has already bolted."
"You have said to the House this afternoon that you have transmitted documents to the Parliament which nobody would have transmitted to national parliaments."
"Well, no national parliament would have ever accepted a report with asterisks or censorship from a bureaucracy to a directly elected parliament."
"Secondly, in the framework of the discharge for 1996, for which I am rapporteur, there is a feeling that the flaws in management organisation at the top of the Commission have led to a whole ream of irregularities and misdemeanours at lower levels in implementing policies."
"You have come forward with some ideas on screening."
"We asked for that in 1995 and yet it is now nearly 1999."
"We have not even seen the report on the statute that was asked for by the last parliament."
"We have never seen anything in that respect."
"Lastly, you say you are nominating high-level officials."
"We all know that is unbridled cronyism to get level of access to top jobs."
"There is a feeling that many have in this House, that you are in office but you are not in control of the overall system."
"So how can we today have confidence that you can deliver next year on all the reforms that you have come to this House with today."
"Mr President, I still believe that we have provided Parliament with reports which would not have been given to national parliaments."
"This is absolutely clear."
"So, Mr Elles, I maintain my position, and I have been in politics long enough to know what it should be."
"We are also required to respect the confidentiality of preparatory inquiries and the right to privacy of individuals and officials under investigation."
"This applies in all countries."
"I would be amazed if in the United Kingdom, which is also a guardian of human rights, these rights were not respected."
"(Mixed reactions) Yes!"
"I continue to believe this and I insist on saying it."
"You can file a motion of censure against me if you like, but I will say it."
"Secondly, with regard to the Staff Regulations for officials, we cannot take decisions on these unilaterally."
"Decisions must be taken in consultation with staff representatives and trade unions."
"We set up a joint committee chaired by the former Secretary-General, Mr Williamson, who submitted his proposal some weeks ago."
"I regret that this is rather late but we only took up our posts in 1995 and the screening could not be carried out overnight."
"We must all be reasonable, sometimes even this House too."
"Mr President, I must return to the document submitted to us on the Anti-Fraud Office - OLAF - as there is some uncertainty and confusion about this."
"Perhaps you can clarify the way in which the Office might initiate investigations."
"As things stand, the present UCLAF can and does launch investigations on its own initiative."
"Apparently, according to this document - I do not see this myself but my colleagues do and I should therefore like you to clarify this point - it would seem that the Office can act only on the instructions of the institution which it is supposed to inspect."
"Could you clarify this point?"
"Also, with regard to confidentiality, I am concerned that the present UCLAF, in my opinion, has failed to respect this confidentiality in many cases and that some case files have been disclosed."
"Could you tell us what exactly are the measures used to guarantee that UCLAF itself ensures the confidentiality of investigations?"
"Mr President, this is a precise question to which I will give a precise answer."
"I would refer to Article 3 of the proposal which states that, on its own initiative and also at the request of a Member State or of the Office, the Commission can ask the Office to carry out an investigation."
"It is also clear from paragraphs 6 and 12 of the explanatory statement that the Office is to be closely involved in the launching - to use your word - of investigations (this is contained in paragraph 6) by allowing the Office to initiate an investigation on its own initiative."
"Therefore, the Office can initiate an investigation on its own initiative."
"Clearly, all the institutions can also ask the Office to carry out investigations and you will see that other provisions of the Office's statute contain certain precautions to ensure that confidentiality is maintained."
"Based on experience gained during the operation of UCLAF, we have sought to rectify certain failings which exist in the current UCLAF statute and we have achieved this in the document submitted to you."
"You now have time to examine and scrutinise this and to make comments and amendments so that our work together can produce a joint result."
"Mr President, you told us that you take your responsibility seriously as the President of the Commission and we want to take our responsibility seriously as a parliament."
"That responsibility includes holding the Commission to account."
"That is very difficult when documents are not passed on to us."
"Can you make a commitment to us today that you will give us a list of all the investigations of alleged fraud and corruption on a regular basis, not on the piecemeal grudging basis as we receive them now and answer when, at the latest, we will see the new Fraud Office operational?"
"How can we be assured that you are not just kicking the ball into touch here?"
"Will it be running during this Commission's ten years and, if so, by when?"
"Mr President, I believe I can say that there is no problem about providing a list of investigations launched by UCLAF."
"I cannot see any reason why this should not happen."
"However, these investigations will not necessarily lead to the discovery of irregularities or fraud, and the list cannot be published without due regard."
"The initiation of an investigation by UCLAF does not necessarily mean that an irregularity, incident of fraud or anything else has actually occurred."
"Generalisations are sometimes made public, which is a great disservice to the operation of UCLAF."
"We have tried to take all this into account in our proposal."
"Secondly, you wanted to know when this new Anti-Fraud Office might start work."
"I have asked for the goodwill of all the institutions in bringing this into operation and we consider that, if the political will is there, it could be operational within six to seven months."
"Mr Santer, I read with great interest the discussion paper distributed under your authority and entitled 'The Commission of Tomorrow'."
"I noted on page 4 the Commission's intention, in future years, to concentrate more on the main policy areas of external relations, the single currency, internal security, the single market, economic and social cohesion and common policies, in other words the powers of a government of a sovereign state."
"My questions in this respect are: what powers will the national governments still have and does the next paragraph, which says that consideration should be given to greater delegation of simple management tasks, actually apply to these national governments?"
"Mr President, this document sets out the future of the European Union as a whole."
"I will gladly make a statement on this and in fact I have already done so in the debates on the Union."
"In my opinion, the European Union of the future will always remain bound to the Member States which, while retaining their national identity, will be integrated into the political union."
"We do not want to build a United States of Europe along the lines of the United States of America."
"This is not our intention."
"Economic rules can be harmonised to create a single internal market but the individual nations can never be harmonised."
"Therefore, national identity must always remain a part of the future Union."
"However, thanks to this Union, the Member States have an opportunity to transfer part of their sovereignty to supranational bodies, such as the Commission and the European Central Bank, in order to exercise this sovereignty jointly and equally and in order to become stronger and more powerful on the international stage."
"The Member States will not just be left with management powers."
"On the contrary, the Member States must realise that they will have a role to play in the future within the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality. These are the essential principles on which the European Union is built."
"Mr President, I have two questions."
"Earlier, when Mr Fabra asked about the future of Europe, you said it was the euro."
"Do you really think that the euro represents Europe's future?"
"Secondly, you said in your speech that we are now going the right way about handling the legal bases issue - which we are not talking about here - and the mini-budgets."
"Do you realise that the budgetary authority, in other words the Council and Parliament on the one hand and the Commission on the other, agreed as early as the 1993 budget to abolish the mini-budgets, and that we are therefore not going about things in the right way, but have actually defaulted on this agreement in a totally unacceptable manner?"
"Europe is clearly not just about the euro; it is not just a single market but much more besides."
"However, the euro will be a powerful factor in the economic integration of Europe, firstly by allowing the internal market to be perfected, because I do not know of any internal market in the world which can operate with fourteen different currencies without any distortion of competition."
"The euro will also be a powerful factor in political integration as it will give Europe and the internal market a European identity."
"Thirdly, it will contribute to establishing a zone of monetary stability and will therefore be a stabilising factor in our international monetary relations."
"For all these reasons, the euro is a powerful factor in our integration."
"We are delighted that the euro will soon be introduced in eleven of our Member States and we obviously hope that it will be accepted in the other four countries which are not yet members of the euro zone."
"With regard to the mini-budgets, certain decisions were indeed taken in 1993."
"It was then that cases of fraud were discovered."
"The existence of the mini-budgets allowed UCLAF to discover cases of fraud in four ECHO contracts."
"The procedure which was initiated at the time and which is intended to gradually eliminate these mini-budgets under very difficult conditions was made possible due to agreement between Parliament and the Commission, and this is how we should continue."
"Furthermore, if you read the reports of the Court of Auditors of the Member States, you will find many irregularities revealed in this way."
"I had the idea of looking at the report of the Court of Auditors of the German Federal Republic and I could not see much difference between its report and that of the European Court of Auditors."
"Mr Santer, do not rely on the Council when it comes to recommending the discharge."
"You are the board of directors for project Europe and we are the general meeting, and I would therefore repeat that Article 3 of the proposal has nothing to do with Parliament's original proposal and is completely unacceptable."
"In the context of the transparency you have talked about, can you confirm or deny that, following inquiries by the Belgian authorities, the Commission's Legal Service recommended that if Commission officials were asked whether social contributions had been paid as part of Commission contracts with firms, they should claim immunity and carry on the contracts as before?"
"Do these documents exist?"
"If so, would you be prepared to let the Committee on Budgetary Control have them, in confidence of course?"
"With regard to the first question, I shall simply say to the honourable Member that the Council is an institution of the European Union and should not be underestimated, and that a Council representative is here today."
"As you have probably noticed, we have several European institutions."
"I am perfectly happy with the current operation of the institutions within our European Union, which is my right and my obligation."
"In reply to your second question, all I can say is that I do not know nothing about it and therefore cannot give you an answer."
"If you have any other details, you have the opportunity to tell the House about them."
"However, as President of the Commission, I cannot answer your question."
"Thank you, Mr Santer."
"That concludes this first item on the agenda."
"European Council"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in just over a week the Austrian Presidency of the Council will culminate with the European Council meeting in Vienna."
"As the first European Council to be held in Austria, it is of course of very particular significance to us."
"This European Council is also important to all the Member States of the Union, in view of the major issues that are currently being discussed and negotiated in all the Union forums; but first and foremost, these issues are also of major and direct importance to the citizens of our countries."
"With regard to many of these questions, we are facing decisions of principle which will determine the course of Europe over the coming years and decades."
"But in the last few years as well, the European Union has taken a number of forward-looking decisions that now need to be implemented."
"Here, 1 January 1999 will be an historic date."
"With the imminent introduction of the common currency, we shall be giving European integration a new dimension."
"The euro, the only currency which, as the German President Mr Herzog put it, has already become the most stable one in the world even before its introduction, represents the culmination of a success story that goes back nearly five decades."
"So what are the core elements of this unique experiment in the history of our continent?"
"They are unity in diversity, solidarity instead of domination, and the common exercise of sovereignty in common institutions."
"But the introduction of the euro certainly does not nearly complete our task, because however enormous the achievements of the Union and its Member States, of which we are rightly proud, people today still tend to have confused perceptions of our common future."
"The new structure of Europe following the end of the east-west confrontation and the increasingly rapid process of globalisation have triggered a tremendous dynamic force."
"In the space of just a few years, some of the cornerstones of our international political system have collapsed."
"The international economic landscape is changing day by day."
"The individual states and the international community need to take measures to cope with the new technologies and their impact on man and the environment."
"Social changes and an unheard-of international mobility are breaking up the structures of the past."
"This produces new challenges every day, for which the recipes of the past are no longer appropriate."
"If we wish to preserve the achievements of the past five decades during this time of radical change, we must be open to reforms and adjustments."
"The real danger - and let me emphasise this - lies not in change, but in persistent clinging to the past."
"So the Union needs new impetus."
"Its strategic concept must be redefined."
"I believe that is the main purpose of the process of discussion on the future of Europe that was begun in Cardiff and continued under the Austrian Presidency at the informal Council meeting in Pörtschach in October."
"In my view, this process of reflection has resulted in two distinct approaches."
"The first is a clear commitment to the dynamic continuation of the process of European integration."
"The challenges facing us call for more rather than less Europe."
"But we also need more ability to act, better instruments and more willingness to apply them on a basis of solidarity."
"The second is that we must focus Union activity more specifically on subjects that directly affect and also interest the citizens of Europe."
"But if we wish to make sure that the people support the further development of the Union, then our priority must be to put employment, a clean environment and security at the top of the European agenda."
"These considerations will also influence the preparations for the Vienna European Council on 11 and 12 December this year."
"So we will have to discuss a wide range of important subjects in Vienna."
"Employment remains the first priority."
"Here we can at last see a change for the better."
"Unemployment in Europe has now fallen below 10 %."
"So more jobs were created in Europe last year than in the United States."
"That is no reason to relax our efforts, but it is a sign that things can improve."
"The coordination mechanism agreed in Luxembourg has therefore passed its first test."
"The general assessment of the implementation of the national employment plans shows that the governments are making great efforts to genuinely achieve their projects."
"This encouraging trend should spur us on to pursue the road we have embarked on with determination."
"The Union's future employment strategy should be based on three pillars."
"The first is the employment policy guidelines, which are aimed at making the labour market more flexible and adaptable and making it easier to create jobs in new undertakings."
"The draft employment policy guidelines for 1999 will be submitted to the European Council in Vienna; they point the way forward, putting the emphasis on equal rights for men and women, lifelong learning, older workers and means of promoting an entrepreneurial spirit."
"The second is economic structural reform, to make the markets in goods and labour more competitive and promote the capacity to innovate."
"The third is a macro-economic policy that effectively underpins and promotes growth."
"One very important aspect of economic policy is the external representation of the Union in questions of economic and monetary union."
"Europe must speak with a single voice in the international financial institutions and in the G7 and assert its major economic influence more effectively than in the past."
"That important issue must finally be resolved now that the third stage is due to enter into force in a few weeks' time."
"At present, as you know, the finance ministers are engaged in intensive discussions."
"We expect practical results to be achieved by the time of the European Council."
"The introduction of the euro also makes it all the more necessary to coordinate tax policy more closely."
"We expect Vienna to provide an impetus towards speeding up the work on these questions."
"The finance ministers will also be submitting a report on the reform of the international financial architecture to the European Council."
"In recent months, it has become clear that our capacity to manage financial crises is no longer anywhere near to matching the challenges of a globalised world economy."
"Europe has an important contribution to make in this respect."
"Other areas of economic policy to be discussed in Vienna are improved financing instruments for the trans-European networks and further steps towards fully implementing and utilising the single market."
"As regards environmental policy, the European Council will concentrate on the concept of integrating environmental aspects in the various EU policy areas."
"Initial reports have been drawn up on transport, energy and agriculture."
"At Vienna, it will have to be decided how to pursue this important process further."
"Of course, Agenda 2000 is a central area of the presidency's activity."
"In my statement to the House on 18 November, I reported on the progress achieved here."
"This morning, I myself held talks with European Parliament representatives on the pre-accession instruments, with a view to intensifying the dialogue and the exchange of information between the Council and Parliament, as we had agreed in the trilogue."
"There is extremely wide agreement in the Council on the pre-accession instruments, the TENs and the Guarantee Fund regulation."
"The technical work on these legal texts is nearing completion."
"With regard to structural policy, a number of key political questions are emerging and the outlines of a solution have at least been established."
"Clear trends have also emerged from the agriculture ministers' report adopted on 23 November, which means that agreement should be within reach by March 1999."
"In terms of the financial perspective, our aim was to establish options for solutions that take account of the dual challenge, namely budgetary discipline on the one hand and guaranteeing the necessary resources for the further development of the Union's policy on the other."
"At the foreign ministers' conclave on 6 December, we shall endeavour to make further headway in clarifying the key elements and in this way to create a good basis for the European Council's deliberations in Vienna."
"By its nature Agenda 2000 is an overall package, which means that it will not be possible to take major decisions on individual questions of substance."
"But we believe that the progress made during the Austrian Presidency can, as a whole, form a basis for ensuring that the decisive end game in the negotiations can commence right at the start of 1999."
"Good progress has been made with the enlargement process over the past five months."
"The beginning of concrete accession negotiations with the '5 + 1', the progress in the acquis screening with the Eleven and the implementation of the accession partnerships show that the Union, and also our future partners, are approaching these great challenges with both energy and circumspection."
"The Commission's report on the applicant states' progress contains an open and sound analysis of the degree to which the Copenhagen criteria have been fulfilled, and both the Member States and the applicant states viewed it positively."
"This report will also represent the main basis for the discussions on enlargement in Vienna."
"We wish to give a clear signal of the Union's commitment to successful enlargement, a signal that encourages our partners to pursue their reform efforts in a positive and active manner."
"Another important component of the Pörtschach message was that Europe must become more capable of action in the fields of internal security and foreign and security policy."
"Three reports by the justice and home affairs ministers will be before the European Council in Vienna."
"Firstly, an action plan to establish an area of freedom, security and justice."
"Secondly, a report on the implementation of the action plan to combat organised crime and, thirdly, a report on drugs."
"Other questions will concern implementing the integration of Schengen into the EU Treaty and providing impetus to strengthen cooperation in the field of migration policy."
"The ministers decided in Pörtschach to schedule a meeting in Tampere in the second half of the year, which will help focus strong attention on internal security in the year 1999."
"The Vienna European Council will consider important foreign and security policy issues, such as the situation in Russia, the peace process in the Middle East and developments in the western Balkans."
"It will also consider structural questions, such as preparing for the implementation of the common foreign and security policy instruments provided for in the Amsterdam Treaty and continuing the discussion on security and defence policy issues, which have been given fresh impetus during the Austrian Presidency."
"I have given you a brief overview of the most important themes of the Vienna summit."
"As you can see, it is an extensive and demanding programme, which reflects the dynamic stage the integration process has now reached."
"In this context, I also wish to express my personal thanks for the good cooperation with the European Parliament during the Austrian Presidency."
"The ambitious European agenda has given us ample opportunity to work together."
"Here I am thinking primarily of the regular exchange of views on topical foreign policy issues, the opening of the informal dialogue on Agenda 2000, the flow of information on progress in the enlargement process, as well as the agreement on the fifth framework research programme."
"I hope we will also manage to adopt the EU budget for 1999 in good time, before the end of the year."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that in the relations between the institutions it is essential to remember the great aims and interests of our citizens, and not to delay our work with problems that can be avoided."
"That requires an open discussion, which I am happy to engage in now."
"Today the Union is perhaps facing greater challenges than it ever has done in previous decades."
"In the past, it has repeatedly proved able to summon up the necessary creativity and will to overcome great challenges."
"I am convinced that will also be the case now, on the threshold of the new millennium, and I hope the European Council in Vienna will play its part."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, the Vienna European Council will conclude the six-month term of the Austrian Presidency."
"It is the first six-month presidency of the Federal Republic of Austria, and I pay tribute to the work that presidency has accomplished."
"The presidency was marked in particular by the informal Pörtschach meeting, where the Heads of State and Government succeeded in coordinating their views on the future of the European Union more closely."
"On 21 October this year, I concluded my statement to the House on the Pörtschach summit with the following words, and I quote: 'As always in the history of the Community, the main challenge is to translate ideas on Europe's future into action'."
"Obviously, I will start with enlargement."
"The Council will examine the Commission's first report on the progress made by the applicant states, as requested by the Cardiff European Council."
"This report shows that the process as a whole is now under way."
"The Commission's analysis also shows how the situations differ in the various countries."
"It points to the dynamic nature of this enlargement process."
"We judge the progress of the applicant states by the Copenhagen and Madrid criteria."
"The Council will point out that all the applicant states must make sustained efforts towards achieving the goal of accession."
"Alongside this, as you know, the negotiations on Agenda 2000, have begun to progress, thanks also to Parliament's cooperation."
"We are about to embark on an important stage along the road which will lead us, before the end of the current legislative term, to the adoption of all the measures proposed in the context of Agenda 2000."
"The Cardiff European Council and the Heads of State and Government at their informal Pörtschach meeting have stated their political resolve to conclude the Agenda 2000 negotiations at the special summit next March."
"I think there are several reasons why we should conclude them in March."
"First of all, the coming European Parliament elections will have an impact on your activities as from March or April, and I note that even now they are having certain effects on parliamentary activity."
"Secondly, a delay would damage the credibility of and confidence in the Union; and lastly, there are the practical considerations associated with planning the Structural Funds and establishing the appropriate policies, together with the adverse effect which any delay in implementing the pre-accession instruments would have on the pre-accession process as such."
"Naturally, the question which then arises is whether we can conclude them in March."
"I believe we can, because all the data is on the table: the 19 detailed Commission proposals, as well as the Commission's report on own resources."
"As one of the two arms of the budgetary authority, you will also be signatories to a new interinstitutional budgetary agreement."
"Of course, the conclusion of a new agreement that satisfies both arms of the budgetary authority will form an integral part of Agenda 2000."
"Mr President, I hope this European Council will provide a good point of departure for the discussions that are due to be concluded under the German Presidency."
"Obviously, until there is agreement on the total package, there will be no individual agreements."
"Subject to that reservation, I hope we will manage to achieve three things."
"Firstly, we must reach agreement on the many 'technical' aspects, as I would call them, of the legislative texts."
"In that context, I welcome the recent successes in relation to the Structural Funds, the Cohesion Fund, the pre-accession strategy and the trans-European networks."
"Next, we must try to make headway in the political field."
"Here I am thinking, for example, of some aspects of the agricultural reforms and rural development, of the structural actions and the format of the financial perspectives."
"Lastly, we must sketch out the broad lines of a final package which must, above all, concentrate on the financial implications of the reforms and the related budgetary issues."
"Two items on the Council's agenda are regarded as priorities by the people: employment and an area of freedom, security and justice."
"Let me begin with employment."
"In Vienna, the European Council will for the first time evaluate the progress made by the Member States in implementing their national employment plans under the Luxembourg strategy."
"Who would have thought, two years ago, that we would receive such support from the Member States and the social partners, that we would have European guidelines and national action plans?"
"Who would have believed that the Member States would accept having their employment measures examined, evaluated and even judged by their peers, and who would have believed that an exemplary dynamic process would be created, which can now be driven along by the new wind blowing through Europe?"
"First we discussed that strategy with the Member State governments, and it was together with them that we established the follow-up mechanisms, the exchanges of information and the benchmarking mechanisms."
"On the basis of the Member States' analysis in Vienna, the Commission will draft proposals on adjusting the guidelines for 1999."
"I must admit that they were minimal."
"I believe that what is most important is to consolidate the process."
"The national action plans form part of a medium-term strategy, but it is important to give the process new impetus."
"We are pursuing our strategy for a more entrepreneurial Europe, with a pan-European risk capital market, which will give our undertakings the same advantages as American firms and make up for our delay in harnessing information technology."
"We have also asked the Member States to amend their unemployment benefit and tax systems and, in particular, to review their early retirement policies."
"As regards the area of freedom, security and justice, as you know we decided at Pörtschach to hold a first special European Council on the subject on 15 October 1999, under the Finnish Presidency."
"That decision reflects my determination, ever since I was appointed, to give priority to this question."
"With the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty and the entry into operation of Europol, we shall be able to register real progress in cooperation on judicial, police, asylum and immigration questions, all areas where the people of our countries have high expectations."
"We can only frame such policies, which remain national, in a European context."
"The practical problems relating to asylum, immigration, police cooperation and extradition cooperation that have faced us in recent months make it clear that we must approach these problems at Community level; and I hope the action plan the Council and the Commission will be submitting in Vienna will represent a milestone in the preparations for the Tampere summit."
"We will also be having an exchange of views on the development of the European and international economic situation in Vienna."
"The advent of new governments in some Member States and the acceleration of the international financial crisis after the events of August in Russia have sparked off an intense debate on economic, financial and monetary policies, at both European and international level."
"The international crisis has abated a little, but that does not mean it has been resolved, so we must remain vigilant and bear in mind the results of our debates."
"These results, which will no doubt be discussed in Vienna, are as follows."
"Firstly, I note that following the debates on interest rates, we have agreed that all the conditions have now been fulfilled for having low interest rates as soon as the euro is born."
"The dialogue that has already been conducted with the European Central Bank has shown that budgetary rigour would facilitate a monetary policy which, apart from the priority objective of price stability, could take account more generally of the economic situation."
"It seems to me that since the most recent discussions among the Eleven, there is now broad agreement on this policy mix, and I am sure this dialogue will move forward in a satisfactory way once the euro has been established."
"Secondly, I have noted a general desire for closer coordination of economic, financial and social policies, and I feel that real progress is being made in this regard within the group of Eleven, as well as at Council level."
"At the same time, there are clear signs of a wish to coordinate our fiscal policies."
"We reported on that yesterday, at the ECOFIN Council, and here too marked progress has been made, although we must always remain realistic when we discuss fiscal matters."
"The discussions this autumn also drew attention to the importance of infrastructures to the economic fabric, and to the role of public investment in that context."
"I am happy to note that while emphasising the importance of these investments, no one called into question the principles of the stability and growth pact."
"However, some ideas emerged from the discussions on the instruments that could influence investment and I am pleased to be able to tell you that, this morning in fact, the Commission has adopted a document on the subject, which we will of course be forwarding to the European Council in Vienna."
"I have only three remarks to make on the subject."
"The first concerns the European Investment Bank."
"After the success of the Amsterdam special action programme, I believe the Bank could enhance its role by broadening its range of instruments to promote infrastructure projects and, in particular, the trans-European networks."
"This could take the form of a special system by which the Bank could, in various ways, encourage risk sharing between the private and the public sector and thereby encourage them to take more part in financing infrastructure projects."
"In the same context, it would be advisable to broaden the European Investment Fund's eligibility criteria, which would increase the Fund's impact on the development of infrastructure in the broad sense of the term."
"Secondly, we must recognise that some trans-European infrastructure projects can be accomplished only with the aid of subsidies if they are not sufficiently profitable in financial terms."
"Within the general Agenda 2000 framework, our proposed new draft financial regulation for the trans-European networks is currently under discussion."
"Apart from the proposal for substantial funding, this draft contains a number of innovative ideas."
"I am thinking in particular of the idea of introducing multiannual budgetary allocations, the idea of using risk capital funds, and the possibility of cofinancing up to 20 % of the total cost of projects instead of the current 10 %."
"Lastly, there is the matter of the obstacles that are preventing the emergence of a genuine - and I mean genuine - pan-European capital investment market, which Cardiff called for and which could be a real source of job creation because of the capital it could generate for innovative undertakings."
"Turning to the international situation, there is now broad agreement that with the advent of the euro, the Union will bear a greater responsibility with regard to the international financial situation and will have to speak with a single voice."
"We agreed at Vienna that all the outstanding questions on the external representation of the euro must be resolved, including the question of the Commission's participation in international forums."
"In that context, I am glad that the ECOFIN Council managed to reach general agreement on this matter yesterday, in other words well before the Vienna European Council, and I am also glad that the European Parliament has supported us here."
"Lastly, I am thinking of the functioning of the international financial institutions as such, and of our responsibility as the largest donor of development aid."
"But we must not confine ourselves to financial aspects, and I hope we shall also discuss wider issues in Vienna, such as Europe's role in relation to globalisation, which affects every dimension of our societies."
"With the new impetus provided by the euro and the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Union cannot remain silent in the face of a world that is waiting for a response, the response of a Europe that speaks with a single voice."
"Mr President, these are the main points that we will certainly be discussing in Vienna."
"However, I would not wish to end my statement to the House without pointing out that we shall be celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Vienna."
"That too will be an opportunity to call on the Union to take resolute action to defend the values of that declaration."
"The European summit in Vienna will, therefore, be a summit that sets out the practical and fundamental approaches to follow so that we can meet the challenges of the twenty-first century."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating the Austrian Presidency on its excellent work in recent months."
"In particular, I would like to say that the special summit at Pörtschach proved a pleasant surprise for Members of the European Parliament. By contrast with previous European Councils, at Pörtschach there was talk of more Europe rather than of less Europe."
"The name Vienna has a fascinating ring and this European Council might be the moment for Europe to make some sort of declaration of a very general nature. According to the statement by the Austrian Presidency, however, specific achievements are being sought."
"The Austrian Presidency has stressed that at present, it is the public who are of prime importance: our citizens who voted for us and who trust that their problems will be resolved."
"As the Austrian Presidency has also highlighted, the main problem is unemployment, which is currently the European Union's top priority."
"Any other problem pales into insignificance against 10 % unemployment, that is, almost 20 million people out of work."
"The special summit at Luxembourg, instigated by President Santer, did of course make significant progress in this area. However, it failed to provide the funding required."
"In my view, the arrangements made at Luxembourg, namely ECU 10 000 from the European Investment Bank and ECU 450 million from the Community budget over three years, are inadequate."
"It is certainly clear is that if we wish to fight unemployment, we must resort to other methods."
"My question to the Council is as follows: would it not now be possible to consider other proposals for the release of funds?"
"Clearly, investment is needed at present."
"This situation also calls into question what seemed to be one of the key principles underpinning the building of Europe: linking the euro to a stability pact in which inflation was the most important issue."
"At present deflation, not inflation, seems to be the issue, and the world seems to be threatened by an economic crisis. Consequently, the question we are asking ourselves here, in the European Parliament, in the Council and in the Commission is whether it would not be appropriate to take steps to encourage investment."
"Does it really make sense to reduce expenditure - including investment - and, for instance, to cut investment, through the stability pact?"
"My view is that the stability pact should be complemented by an employment pact which would allow resources to be made available to combat unemployment."
"Finally, the President-in-Office of the Council has also referred to the financial outlook."
"As we in the Parliament see it, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, there is a danger of aiming for less Europe rather that more Europe because of the financial outlook."
"I trust that the Vienna European Council, inspired by the helpful conclusions of the Pörtschach European Council, will move towards more Europe. Without more Europe, it will not be possible to build the Europe we, the citizens of the Community, are hoping for."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in our opinion the recent informal summit in Pörtschach demonstrated, regrettably, that Europe is still in search of an identity."
"Whereas Europe is now a recognised world power in economic terms - and will soon have a single currency - our governments are being too cautious and tentative about giving it a more dynamic, more political role, both internally and internationally."
"On this point, I should like on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party to recall the problem - already referred to by the Austrian Presidency - of ensuring that the eleven member countries of the euro zone are properly represented in international forums."
"So far, convergence has been achieved in only one of the areas under discussion: the balance between stability and growth."
"Several countries have referred to the need for a dialogue with the European Central Bank."
"We would now ask the Council whether this is a euphemistic way of covering up difficulties in the relations between the governments and the Central Bank or, as we would hope, confirmation of the resolve to protect the role and independence of that institution."
"Furthermore, the painful sacrifices which all our countries have had to make to create a strong and viable single currency cannot and must not be thwarted by second thoughts or, worse still, by dangerous interference which could result in a weak currency without sound prospects."
"The governments are well aware that a healthy monetary policy is a precondition for the creation of sound growth and development, but clearly there is also a need for appropriate economic policies - albeit coordinated ones - to promote a recovery of the economy and above all of employment, the most urgent issue facing Europe."
"This is a task which the governments must on no account shirk."
"Unfortunately, concerning the other items on the agenda of the informal summit, our expectations were not met."
"Apart from vows and promises, nothing new emerged in respect of foreign policy, for example on the common foreign and security policy, even though we do welcome Mr Blair's openness on the question of integrating the WEU into the European Union; nothing whatsoever on justice and home affairs, nor on crime and illegal immigration; and finally, nothing whatsoever on the launching of institutional reforms."
"I would conclude by adding that the scale of the challenges lying ahead of us over the next few years calls for political vision and a fresh input of ideas."
"We therefore hope that the forthcoming European Council in Vienna will live up to our expectations and those of all our citizens, thereby fulfilling the hopes expressed by the Austrian Presidency."
"I nevertheless believe that the European Parliament - the democratic, representative voice of our peoples - also has a crucial, leading role to play in this context, naturally alongside the other institutions."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office, you have given us a long list of subjects."
"No subject of any importance was omitted, in point of fact."
"Of course, that makes it difficult to identify the main issues."
"I believe it is vitally important that we see a political breakthrough at this Vienna summit on one central issue, namely Agenda 2000."
"We must wrap up this matter - which is important to enlargement, but also to the internal cohesion of the Europe of 15 - during these six months leading up to the campaign for the European elections."
"I regard this as the decisive issue and hope it will be tackled successfully."
"Another matter you did not mention and which really does affect us Members very strongly is the Statute for Members."
"It is vital that the Vienna summit should resolve this issue too."
"That is partly Parliament's responsibility, but in the end it is also the responsibility of the Council."
"It is not just a question of creating a sound working foundation for Members."
"However, we are going through a difficult phase."
"There have been scandals and accusations."
"It is vital that Members can enter the campaign for these democratic elections with a clear conscience, and can discuss European issues rather than having to counter accusations."
"I would ask you to take this matter seriously and to ensure on 12 December that the subject is dealt with in a sensible way and can be removed from the agenda before the elections, for our sake, as Parliament will, I hope, propose tomorrow."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, according to the Treaties the Council is not a decision-making body, but is the Union institution which can most legitimately carry out the vital task of providing a political impetus, since all the Heads of State and Government are directly accountable to their respective parliaments."
"Prior to a European Council meeting, all we can do is to formulate wishes."
"However, we must be careful not to draw up an exhaustive list of all our wishes, like the poet Prévert, since that would inevitably lead to disappointment and disenchantment, but try to confine ourselves to a few priorities."
"I for my part will name three of them."
"The first priority is the reforms in Agenda 2000 and the future financing of the Union."
"We are in fact hearing at the highest level in a growing number of Union countries, including the more powerful ones, that a country's contribution to the Union budget should match the financial benefits it gains from it; this means the general application of the 'fair returns' principle for which Mrs Thatcher became famous in her day."
"That is at the very least a curious conception of European solidarity on the part of governments which claim to be champions of the utmost social justice."
"The Union has never before seen so many governments of a socialist persuasion or with socialist participation; and yet never before has the principle of solidarity been so much denied, at least in statements of intent, despite the fact that it acts as the binding force of joint action and is the key to the prosperity of all the Union countries."
"Here I would solemnly warn that cofinancing the common agricultural policy would risk dismantling it."
"I would also warn that any reduction in the appropriations allocated to the Structural Funds, the Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund would put the economic and social stability of our regions at risk."
"The second priority is enlargement of the Union."
"As we have said before, as a political symbol and by virtue of its social, economic and commercial implications, this enlargement goes immeasurably further than the preceding ones."
"Let us beware of excluding certain states on the basis of questionable pretexts and thereby recreating artificial divisions between the applicant countries."
"Let us also beware of underestimating the major difficulties awaiting the economic players both of the Fifteen and of the applicant countries."
"The last priority I would highlight on the eve of the European Council is reform of the institutions."
"It is a reform linked to the enlargements that are to come, and it is vital that it is carried out before any further enlargement, but without being used as a pretext for delaying that enlargement."
"The ball is indeed in the court of the Heads of State and Government."
"So let us be exacting, ladies and gentlemen, and solemnly call on the Heads of State and Government of the Fifteen to discuss, without taboos or ulterior motives, the real reforms on which Europe must embark if it wants to go on living and developing."
"Mr President, I agree entirely with Mrs Ferrero-Waldner that the Vienna European Council will represent a turning point in our struggle to resolve the fundamental problems involved in the building of Europe."
"Chief amongst these is employment."
"It is for this reason that our group places such great importance on support for employment policies which go beyond the coordination of national policies and Community guidelines."
"Dare we hope that we shall have a European employment policy after the Vienna Summit?"
"We should make as great an effort to achieve such a policy as we did when setting up the single currency. Indeed, in our judgment, the stability pact and the severity with which it is implemented hinders the creation of employment and does not promote the best interests of our citizens."
"We cannot agree with the statement made recently by Tony Blair and José María Aznar, the Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom and Spain, concerning greater flexibility on the labour market and cutting unemployment cover. The aim, apparently, is to dissuade the unemployed from relying on benefits."
"However, such a philosophy and such measures will not promote employment policies or justify the European social model."
"We find the French Government's philosophy more positive, with its proposal for a 35-hour week. Oskar Lafontaine's proposals are also encouraging, and could result in substantial investment, particularly in the European transport, communications and energy networks."
"We are prone to criticise the Commission, but it too has put forward interesting proposals which have, to date, been blocked by the Council. I shall mention just two: the reduction of value-added tax on labour-intensive services, and the introduction of an environmental levy to finance policies for employment creation."
"With regard to Agenda 2000, Madam President-in-Office, we are concerned about the failure of the ECOFIN Council."
"Agenda 2000 as a whole has been postponed, along with the report on own resources, the allocation of funds and external representation of the euro."
"In addition, the Austrian Presidency's proposal to freeze expenditure in percentage terms and set it at ECU 85 000 million for next year seems to us to be a step backwards where internal solidarity is concerned. The suggestions made by certain Member States are even more alarming."
"A reduction of the Community budget in real terms has been proposed, which would bring it down to 1.10 % of Community GDP. This would create major uncertainties for enlargement."
"As I conclude, Mr President, I should like to mention the need for clear guidelines where relations with Turkey are concerned. We must also show our solidarity with Central America, and come up with a strategic response to the enormous problems facing the region."
"Lastly, I feel I should mention the problem of the European Parliament."
"We urgently need to reach agreement, once and for all, on a statute for Members of the European Parliament, to facilitate seriousness and transparency within the House and before European public opinion."
"Welcome"
"I should like to welcome Mr Gundars Bojars, chairman of Latvia's delegation to the EU-Latvia Joint Parliamentary Committee, and Mr Edvins Inkens, chairman of the European Affairs Committee, who have taken their seats in the official gallery to follow the debate that will be taking place shortly on the reports from the Committee on Foreign Affairs on the accession of the applicant countries."
"I welcome them to the House."
"European Council (continuation)"
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office, more and more people in Europe are alarmed at finding themselves greeted on the eve of the twenty-first century by the face of the nineteenth century."
"An increasingly aggressive neoclassical economic ideology is evidently trying to force us into this withdrawal into the past."
"This neo-liberalism regards unemployment almost as an indicator of modernisation, seeing workers' falling incomes as progress."
"Deregulation has become a kind of pseudo-religious commandment."
"Meanwhile, the financial markets are reacting quite euphorically to announcements of staff cuts and redundancies."
"The havoc which this ideology has wrought in recent years in South-East Asia, in the newly industrialised countries and in Russia has obviously made little impression."
"Anyone who does not want to return to the nineteenth century is branded a reactionary."
"Politics has been concerned for years with mass unemployment and growing poverty."
"But this has produced little, apart from the literature of political commitment and social poetry."
"One cannot avoid the impression that some sectors of European policymaking seem to regard themselves almost as the acolytes of this aggressive ideology."
"So we call emphatically on the Vienna summit to decide on practical actions at last and to stop creating taboos around the central issues of reform."
"We are calling for quantified and quantifiable objectives with well-defined time-scales and evaluation procedures."
"We are calling for an end to ruinous European fiscal dumping, for the harmonisation of tax systems, for moves towards ecological tax reform, and for the European Central Bank to carry out its duty of supporting European economic policy objectives within the framework of price stability."
"We are calling for the regulation of the financial markets and for job-creating investment not to be taken into account within the context of the stability pact."
"Finally, we wish there to be a debate on the fair distribution of work through reductions in working hours."
"Let us move on at last from political poetry to responsible actions!"
"Mr President, the citizens of Europe, and in particular the unemployed and the young, are indeed expecting a great deal of the European social model and hoping to benefit from the historic opportunity offered by the coming to power of left-wing governments in most of the European countries."
"Ultimately, these governments do not have the right to fail to implement a policy that lives up to the hopes of our citizens."
"Faced with the reality of today, we can no longer confine ourselves to generous statements or expressions of sympathy."
"The moment has indeed come, with the Vienna summit, to make social Europe our ideal by ensuring that the people feel they are involved in a grand social plan, in one which - I am tempted to say - is worthy of our democratic and progressive traditions."
"What concerns them most is unemployment, as the minister said."
"That is where we need to take strong action, and even though we welcome the trend towards falling unemployment in Europe, it is essential that we now implement the proposals made in Luxembourg in November 1997, at the summit on employment, which set as a major priority that no young person must remain out of work for more than six months and no adult for more than a year."
"Let us follow that road, and let us go further by creating a new welfare state that promotes employment and lifelong training for every citizen of the Union."
"Let us indeed ensure that any dismissal or period out of work automatically gives rise to a statutory paid training scheme, which must not represent a kind of 'marking time' period."
"In my view, this is a way of banishing the term 'unemployment' from our vocabulary."
"Paying benefits is sometimes a necessity, but there is no point in this unless it is linked to a programme of training and reintegration into work."
"Throughout his or her life, the individual must alternate between work and training, moving from one to the other without any unwanted break."
"That is a great innovative project. It is a project that the governments of the Union countries have a duty to support, not just at the Vienna summit but also at the forthcoming European elections in June 1999."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on the subject of foreign policy, a sector relevant to this discussion, I would take the liberty of flagging up the Ocalan affair to highlight the Community's shortcomings."
"The Europe of the left is making the worst possible start: the amateurism and demagogy of some members of the Italian Government have contrasted sharply with the hypocrisy and cowardice - to quote a headline in the 'Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung ' - of the German Government, which preferred to leave the hot potato, as it were, in the hands of their Italian progressive comrades, even though the judiciary had issued an international arrest warrant for the leader of the PKK."
"Added to this, the Greek Prime Minister, Kostas Simitis - whose government had previously, albeit unofficially, refused to take in Ocalan - came out in favour of granting political asylum to the PKK leader but leaving this 'honour' to Italy, a country which, in his words, was 'handling the matter very well'."
"I am tempted to say that, if this is how parties belonging to the Socialist International demonstrate solidarity on matters of foreign policy, it is to be hoped that such unedifying conduct is not transferred to the handling of Community affairs."
"Linked to the Ocalan case is the problem of pressure, threats and acts of terrorism perpetrated or merely threatened by well-organised ethnic and religious groups which have a huge following in Europe, as reported by no less a figure than a leading German left-wing intellectual, Peter Schneider, who states: 'It is clear that Turkey is striving to manoeuvre the Turkish minority in Germany, like a sort of fifth column."
"The Kurds appear to be behaving in the same way.'"
"What is more, these immigrants could be incited not only to violence but also to unscrupulous behaviour at election time, casting their votes for citizens or coalitions who promise to protect their interests."
"In the view of the Alleanza Nazionale delegation, therefore, the Ocalan case has revealed the current limitations of the Community edifice, namely its immaturity as regards the common foreign and security policy and its non-existence in the field of international justice and jurisdiction."
"This has been a timely crisis, demonstrating the individual Member States' inadequacies and unwillingness to seek solutions to particular problems which could have serious repercussions in terms of law and order, diplomatic and trading relations."
"This, then, is yet another reason to adopt at long last a real common foreign policy and to establish a proper European Court, which could be entrusted with finding legal solutions to cases such as that of Ocalan."
"Mr President, I should like to return to the real subject, the Vienna summit, and address two points which in my view will decide whether or not that summit is a success, namely employment and foreign policy."
"On employment, several speakers have already expressed their views."
"That is not because we cannot think of anything better to talk about; it is because this is an issue of such immense importance to Europe, with its unacceptably high level of unemployment, that we must keep formulating new employment initiatives."
"We have achieved much with the Amsterdam Treaty."
"It was confirmed in Cardiff and in particular in Pörtschach that we need to focus more strongly on employment policy."
"The Commission has examined the individual Member States' national employment plans."
"I must say that they have been treated very gently, and I also know that the Commission would have liked to deal with some Member States a little more roughly."
"I hope this was only the gentleness of the first wave, because I am absolutely convinced that the Commission, and probably also the Council, must take a firmer approach to those Member States which are in fact not matching up to their plans, ideas and objectives."
"We must carry out the measures that have already been referred to, notably by Mr Medina Ortega."
"What about investment in Europe?"
"Are the measures announced in Pörtschach, and which were already contained in the Delors White Paper, actually being implemented now?"
"What about cooperation between Member States on fiscal matters?"
"Do we really have a coordinated tax policy for the whole economy?"
"I sometimes get the impression that members of the Council and some countries are afraid to have the courage of their convictions."
"They say they want to do something, but as soon as a practical proposal is put before them, they find good excuses for wriggling out of it again. So I wish to state quite clearly and plainly once again that I consider employment policy, more clearly defined guidelines on employment and stricter examination of the various countries by the Commission as of the utmost importance."
"I turn now to foreign policy."
"A good deal has been said on this, and I am glad that Commissioner van den Broek at least is here, who may perhaps be glad in the short term that none of his colleagues from the Council is here to talk to him about foreign policy."
"But let me remind you that it was stated clearly in Cardiff that Vienna is to decide on a Mr or Mrs CFSP."
"That was confirmed in Pörtschach."
"But now I hear rumours that the Council is in favour in principle but cannot agree on names, and that once again it is shying away from the decision actually to appoint a high representative."
"Either the Council realises that it is important to appoint a representative, and then it must do so - and do so soon, after all the negative experiences we have had; or the Council does not consider it important, in which case it should delete these provisions from the Amsterdam Treaty."
"The second option is wholly unacceptable, not least to this Parliament."
"We are told: yes, Mr or Mrs CFSP is an important figure."
"We must tie that up in a package with the Commission president and other individuals."
"My question is this: does the Council, do the Member States not know that in future this Parliament will also be appointing the president of the Commission, but that this will only happen at a later date?"
"Has the Council not realised that the balance of decision-making has changed, and that it has to take the important decision on whom to appoint as the foreign policy representative, in other words on the person who will be the contact and discussion partner for Mr van den Broek and the other Commissioners?"
"This decision must now to be taken."
"The Council would be giving a clear sign of weakness, a sign that it remains as indecisive as ever in foreign policy matters, if it did not take these decisions in Vienna. I believe this Parliament should say loud and clear that if the European Union's foreign policy is to be changed and rendered more efficient, then we need a high representative of the Council, and that decision must be taken in Vienna!"
"Mr President, again it is a pity that the President of the Council is no longer here."
"We sort of have a custom nowadays to play to the gallery."
"I would like to speak on two subjects."
"One is the question of financial aspects of the Agenda 2000."
"If the report of the Ecofin of yesterday and the day before is at all correct, then the European Community unfortunately seems to be in quite a disarray."
"It says in the Agence Europe that the draft inclusions for submission to the Vienna European Council were challenged vehemently by Spain."
"That shows that, indeed, on this point not much progress is in sight."
"If the President of the Council were here I would ask her what the strategy of the presidency is in this respect."
"Secondly, the issue of the third pillar: In Cardiff there was a lot of talk about progress in justice and home affairs."
"But frankly speaking, very little progress has occurred since that time."
"This is quite a major point."
"We were present at the Civil Liberties Committee yesterday where the President of the Council, the Minister for Interior Affairs, spoke."
"The integration of the Schengen Accord into the EU treaty framework about 16 months after the signing in Amsterdam should now be in place."
"It is not."
"We still do not know at this particular moment what part will go to the first pillar and the third pillar."
"The danger is, if we are ratifying Amsterdam and nothing has happened, the result will be that everything will remain in the third pillar."
"To add insult to injury, it seems now that in the Justice and Home Affairs Council there is talk of setting up a special committee to monitor justice affairs which is not foreseen by the first pillar."
"In the first pillar it is COREPER, it is the Commission, but not the K4 Committee, the Special Committee on Justice and Home Affairs."
"We would like to ask what is the position of the presidency on this?"
"Will it resist?"
"What is the attitude of the Commission?"
"I see Commissioner van den Broek here."
"I hope that he could reply that the Commission would not accept any non-legal situations concerning justice and home affairs."
"In particular, on this committee it is quite important that it will be this traditional structure and it will not be the third pillar and in the governmental structure."
"Mr President, employment is indeed a key concern of the Union's citizens and everything possible must be done to combat unemployment effectively and create jobs, especially for young people and the long-term unemployed."
"The Pörtschach summit was marked by a change of tone, new ideas and greater emphasis on growth and employment."
"It has to be said that the elections which have recently taken place in some Union countries have all reflected a rejection of liberalism and an aspiration towards a more humane society."
"The statements of intent must now be turned into practical action."
"That is what our citizens expect from the forthcoming Vienna summit."
"I heard everything that Mr Santer said a moment ago, but when I look at some of the employment policy guidelines for 1999 which the Commission is submitting to the Heads of State and Government, I feel a little disturbed."
"The Commission is still giving precedence to measures to encourage labour flexibility and social moderation in the name of competitiveness."
"The recent European day of action by railway workers in protest at the Commission's deregulation proposals clearly reflected the demand for public services which can respond to current needs and requirements in the Union."
"The recent Franco-German summit reaffirmed the will to create a stronger European social model."
"It even advocated stringent and verifiable objectives."
"Very well then, the Vienna summit must now move from words to deeds."
"I think there are three essential conditions if actions are to measure up to intentions."
"Firstly, we must redefine the powers and tasks of the European Central Bank, which must come under the democratic control of the European Parliament and the national parliaments."
"Secondly, interest rates must of course be lowered, but on a selective basis to encourage job-creation projects."
"Thirdly, the current stability pact must be replaced by a genuine pact on growth and employment."
"In the end, there will be no progress unless the people are involved."
"There is certainly a need for a genuine social dialogue, for a great public debate on the major European issue of employment."
"An annual conference on economic and employment policy could make a contribution here by checking what results have been achieved and proposing adjustments to employment policies, if necessary with binding quantitative criteria."
"Mr President, given the abundance of important and weighty subjects on the agenda of the Vienna summit - and the President-in-Office has presented us with very much a mixed bag - we can only wish the Austrian Presidency good heart in the discussions and much success."
"It will be essential to determine the right steps to take in a few key areas, for example enlargement and Agenda 2000."
"In view of the many crucial but unresolved questions in the agricultural and structural fields, I wonder how it will be possible to keep to the timetable."
"I am asking this partly because this is after all - and that is what makes it so difficult - a question of interests rather than visions."
"So the Austrian Presidency must make sure it engages the right gear and steers in the right direction."
"That is a difficult task."
"It is pursuing the right course in focusing on employment policy, but this needs to be implemented more efficiently."
"There is no shortage of analyses and dossiers."
"Here too time is pressing, because there is a long and difficult way to go from taking decisions to achieving practical results, namely more jobs and fewer people without them."
"Mr President, although there are no leading figures from the presidency here present, I would still like to pay tribute to the work which the Austrian Presidency has carried out to date."
"It has made headway on many outstanding issues and helped to ensure that results and decisions can be achieved rapidly when it now hands over to the German Presidency."
"That would seem almost impossible, given the multitude of tasks, as many here have said, but let me point out quite firmly that no doubts must be voiced - and especially not in Vienna, prior to the handover of the presidency - about whether it will be possible to keep to the Agenda 2000 timetable in the first six months."
"Parliament will organise its work in such a way as to give the Council no excuses."
"It will be difficult, we will have to pull together, but that is only to be expected."
"With Agenda 2000, with the many problems to be resolved - and it would be a good idea for this to be perfectly clear in Vienna - the forthcoming presidency must not forget to do its homework, including preparations for the necessary institutional reforms."
"We know it cannot complete and carry out this work until there is a further intergovernmental conference, but it must not wait until that new intergovernmental conference to embark on it."
"It must tackle the work now."
"Proposals and options must be put on the table in order to push forward the internal reforms, especially the institutional reforms."
"For what is the use of making progress on the agricultural and Structural Fund aspects of Agenda 2000 - even if only on a basis of compromise - and of the negotiations reaching a stage where the accession of new members at some point can be discussed, if the institutional reforms have not yet been carried out?"
"Parliament will find that difficult to accept, and we know that all our groups argue that the institutional reforms in particular must also be completed before the first wave of new applicants are accepted."
"I would like to add a further point. Of course employment will be on the agenda in Vienna."
"But it would be a good idea if the somewhat unspeakable way in which these matters are discussed in the UK, whipped up by sections of the press, were to come to an end, with the help of all the institutions and also of all the Members."
"It is not a question here of harmonising taxes in the sense of levelling them down."
"It is quite simply a question, with regard to employment too, of the Member States finding a way of agreeing on how they can promote investment, naturally also by means of their fiscal policy."
"We must determine how the labour factor can be relieved a little more of what is in some Member States a quite substantial tax burden, through a rational, agreed and joint approach to taxation, so that it would be worthwhile to create jobs, not just through investment but also through investment plus the numbers of people in employment."
"We should try together to make this clear."
"If we are honest, we would surely agree that the way we operate in the European Union is not that different from the way things sometimes go in neighbouring communities."
"Each side tries to drive away the other sides's investors by means of lower charges and cheaper land."
"We do not need to do that in the European Union, but what we do desperately need is an arrangement, so that everyone can have a piece of the employment cake!"
"I fully agree with Mr Swoboda."
"The Council should appoint the Council's representative for the common foreign and security policy as soon as possible."
"It should do so as soon as possible, but it should not try to tie up everything that needs to be resolved in the coming months in terms of appointments into one huge package."
"I would ask it to think again, and to remember that - thanks to Amsterdam - Parliament really does have a say on some appointments."
"It should bear that in mind, in view of the European elections in June next year."
"Mr President, I would like to start with the point that Mr Görlach finished on and that is the fact that we have elections in the European Union to the European Parliament next year."
"The Vienna summit meeting will play a crucial role in setting the agenda for the first six months of next year."
"It will not only be the agenda of the German presidency."
"We also need to demonstrate that in Vienna there is a commitment to reconnecting the people of Europe with the project of the European Union."
"As we know from our own Member States we have failed in recent years to do that."
"That is why the issue of employment, which was discussed at the informal summit meeting, must be a critical point in the discussions in Vienna."
"The Socialist Group insists that we get concrete measures aimed at lifelong learning, at education initiatives, trying to give our people a better basic education but also giving them the skills to do value-added types of jobs."
"Employment must be the core of that agenda."
"If we want to engage young people in the European Union project then we have to make sure that we are offering something to them."
"Most young people today across the European Union, whether they live in Germany, in Finland, in the United Kingdom, in the South of Europe are concerned about their future and they are concerned about their future job, or their future role in society."
"So we hope that when the Vienna summit meeting is concluded there are concrete measures linked to the employment action plans of each Member State that will help to bring down the overall unemployment level, but particularly long-term unemployment and unemployment amongst young people."
"It is also important in reconnecting Europe with its people that we look at our global role."
"We have suffered in recent months and over the last year from the global economic crisis."
"We have seen major problems in many markets around the world and of course our own economy has suffered as a consequence."
"It is extremely important that the Vienna summit meeting send a strong signal that Europe intends to play its part in helping to bring stability to the global economy."
"That means we need to press the point again in Vienna for an increase in the transparency and resilience of the international financial system."
"We have to improve the surveillance processes of national policies."
"We have to define how emerging market countries can protect themselves from excessive financial instability."
"Europe cannot only look inward during these meetings, we have to look externally."
"With the coming Euro the European Union will be a centre of stability in the global economy."
"I also want to say something about the labour market and the need for labour market flexibility."
"There is a big debate in the European Union about whether or not we need labour market flexibility."
"One of my colleagues mentioned it a moment ago."
"In a dynamic global economy we have to have labour market flexibility."
"We have to have employability."
"The idea that we operate our labour market the way that we operated it ten years ago, or even five years ago, will lead to higher unemployment."
"Can I also touch on the question of taxation since Mr Görlach mentioned it in his speech."
"We know that the Austrian presidency has tried to pursue some measures on tax coordination and I also know that the German presidency will be looking at strengthening tax coordination."
"But the word is 'coordination'. It is not 'harmonisation'."
"I am very grateful that Commissioner Mario Monti has changed the agenda in Europe on this matter."
"We do not look for a single currency and a single market with tax harmonisation."
"We look to coordinate where it can benefit employment and where it can benefit investment."
"I think it would be very helpful if the British media, in particular, could learn the difference, particularly since the words exist in English, between the description and definition of coordination and harmonisation."
"Mr President, I have just three minutes and so just two comments to make and a question to put as chairman of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs."
"My first comment concerns the reluctance of the ministers concerned to liaise with us."
"Ministers Michalek and Schlögl have always been at pains to consult with us."
"They do so both at and away from our committee meetings, and only the day before yesterday both ministers travelled to Brussels to discuss things with the committee."
"But our satisfaction with this informal arrangement does not, regrettably, extend to the more formal side of things."
"Article 6 of the Maastricht Treaty requires us to be consulted on a number of important matters, something which has happened under previous presidencies, but it is not happening at present."
"We are not being consulted on the very important and topical issue of asylum and refugee policy."
"The so-called 'Austrian strategy document' came to us quite by chance."
"How can Parliament's voice possibly be ignored over this socially sensitive dossier?"
"The other example is more disgraceful still."
"It concerns an action plan to set up an area of freedom, security and justice, that is to say a plan for the future."
"But again Parliament is not being asked for its opinion."
"In short, of the four topics which we have just heard will be raised at the Vienna summit - and in addition to the two I mentioned there are also drugs and organised crime - on not one of these four topics has Parliament been asked to give its opinion."
"That is a breach of Article 6 of the Maastricht Treaty."
"Hence my question to the Council President, though sadly she has vanished from the Chamber: when will Parliament's opinion be sought on the action plan and also on that other important strategy document?"
"Mr President, I have three things to say."
"Firstly, I think the Vienna summit should take serious note of all the issues brought up by the German, French, Italian or other governments, issues related to correcting the course set by Maastricht, issues concerning the relationship between politics and bankers, interest rates, and whether all that matters is monetary stability or whether we should also look to development and employment, the taxation of capital movements, and other such issues. A debate has commenced."
"My second point concerns Agenda 2000, which is certainly an issue which is not going to go away."
"What I wish to say is that if there are some who - perhaps rightly - would like the European Union to enlarge towards Central and Eastern Europe, they must also be prepared to meet a substantial part of the costs involved, not just pass them on to the south of the European Union and so do away with acquired rights."
"My last point is that we should turn our attention to the issues of foreign policy, especially in relation to Turkey."
"Cardiff was an unpleasant episode and we must return to the Luxembourg criteria concerning the Kurdish problem - a topical issued indeed - the Cyprus problem, relations with our neighbours and human rights."
"I think the Vienna summit has a duty to do that."
"Thank you, Mr Alavanos."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m."
"Applications for membership"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"A4-0430/98 by Mr Caccavale, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, on Latvia's application for membership of the European Union, with a view to the Vienna European Council (11-12 December 1998) (COM(97)2005 - C4-0377/97); -A4-0428/98 by Mr Bernard-Reymond, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, on Romania's application for membership of the European Union, with a view to the Vienna European Council (11-12 December 1998) (COM(97)2003 - C4-0375/97); -A4-0427/98 by Mr Wiersma, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, on Slovakia's application for membership of the European Union, with a view to the Vienna European Council (11-12 December 1998) (COM(97)2004 - C4-0376/97); -A4-0431/98 by Mr Kristoffersen, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, on Lithuania's application for membership of the European Union, with a view to the Vienna European Council (11-12 December 1998) (COM(97)2007 - C4-0379/97); -A4-0429/98 by Mrs Aelvoet, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, on Bulgaria's application for membership of the European Union, with a view to the Vienna European Council (11-12 December 1998) (COM(97)2008 - C4-0380/97)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I must begin with one general comment."
"The Commission - and I am pleased to see Mr van den Broek here in the House - made a mistake concerning the accession procedure."
"As the European Parliament stated plainly at the time, it was wrong to divide the applicant countries into two groups, albeit with the linguistic distinction between 'ins' and 'pre-ins'."
"I think this is clear to everyone, and we are of course glad that the Commission itself has recognised this."
"As far as Latvia is concerned, the matter is a straightforward one."
"This country has taken giant economic strides in the past few years: its inflation has plummeted and is now running at around 7 %; its GDP growth is between 8 and 9 %; its budget has been balanced for the past two years - something I would like to see in several EU Member States; and finally, the privatisation process was launched very rapidly and is almost complete."
"It therefore seems to me that Latvia complies in full with all the requirements for an immediate start to the negotiations for accession."
"Concerning the political criteria, in my opinion democracy in Latvia is a fait accompli , not only because a series of elections has been held in entirely peaceful circumstances and with total respect for democratic principles, but also given the outcome of the much-publicised referendum a few weeks ago."
"The referendum asked the citizens to decide whether to endorse the new law on citizenship - allowing so-called non-citizens, stateless persons, to acquire Latvian citizenship - or whether to abrogate it."
"It was an act of great courage and democratic strength, an important sign of democracy."
"I wonder how many EU countries would have seen fit to entrust their citizens with such a sensitive decision, on a matter directly affecting all the inhabitants of Latvia, citizens and non-citizens alike."
"There do of course remain some outstanding problems: not all the non-citizens have been integrated yet, meaning that roughly 25 % of the resident population still has no passport and remains in an ambiguous position harking back to the former Soviet situation; the administration is still outdated and unable to meet the citizens' needs; the judicial apparatus is still shaky, with statutes that are about to be rewritten and senior judges and lawyers who are not yet equal to their task."
"In short, the legal order is still in the process of being established."
"Mr President, we must not forget the fact that only seven years ago - I repeat, seven years ago, not seventy - the highest flagpole in the land was flying the red flag bearing the hammer and sickle of the Soviet Union."
"Latvia was an integral part of the Soviet Union, a regime which had abolished all the people's rights, stifled any possible development, and which of course has left behind a terrible legacy."
"Unless we take this into account - as well as the deportations and the military occupation of the country - we certainly cannot understand why the inherited state administration and legal system has been so ruinous and so damaging."
"That is why, arguably, the winds of Europe are blowing more strongly, intensely and vigorously in Riga than in Rome, Paris or London."
"I believe that we are facing an extraordinary challenge: that of allowing these countries to embark immediately on the negotiations leading to accession."
"Opening negotiations by no means implies that they will be completed overnight; it does however mean bringing these countries to the negotiating table on a par with the other states, Poland, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary and so on. On this point my report, as adopted by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, clearly indicates to the Council and Commission that they should reassess their verdict on Latvia and initiate negotiations with this country without further delay."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Romania is currently going through a fairly difficult period, in terms of its economy, for example."
"The country's GNP fell by more than 6 % in 1997 and has unfortunately continued to drop in 1998."
"Despite major progress, inflation remains very high and the currency has lost 25 % of its value since the beginning of the year."
"The budget deficit is growing, foreign debt is increasing and the social climate is deteriorating."
"None of these macro-economic indices is very encouraging, and this will make it even more difficult for Romania to carry out the vital and urgent structural reforms that are needed."
"This situation is due to a very large extent to its extremely burdensome inheritance, undoubtedly the most burdensome of all the former people's democracies of eastern Europe."
"But it is also due to the difficulties faced by the government in ensuring the coherence and continuity of its actions, the heterogeneous nature of the ruling coalition and the extremely fickle parliamentary majority."
"It is against this background that we must examine the situation in Romania with regard to the Copenhagen criteria and in the light of the Commission report of 4 November."
"Politically speaking, there is no doubt that Romania has made considerable efforts. If that were the only criterion that counted Romania would now be on the verge of joining the European Union."
"There is still progress to be made in the areas of protecting street children, the control of judicial power by the police, the independence of journalists, detention conditions in prisons, fighting corruption, and the situation of the Rom community."
"But there is no doubt that the government is determined to do something about these issues and we are quite certain that each year we will see more progress made in these various fields."
"In terms of the economy, while the government has lowered customs duties, liberalised most prices and the exchange market and speeded up privatisation, the legislative framework necessary for developing the market economy is far from complete."
"As for the transposition of the 'acquis communautaire' there is no doubt that Romania has made very laudable efforts, but substantial reforms are still required."
"This being the case, it seems that Romania ought to work on a comprehensive policy in four areas."
"First of all it must restore a balance in all the main economic aggregates, a sine qua non for any development."
"At the same time, Romania must determinedly continue with the structural reform of its economy, in particular privatisation, the reform of the banking system, the restructuring of large conglomerates and the modernisation of farming."
"The third area relates to the human aspect of these structural reforms and involves reforming the administration, fighting corruption and making government action more coherent."
"These three areas are vital tools if Romania is to make progress towards accession."
"Finally, as I was saying earlier, Romania must pursue its modernisation efforts to meet the first Copenhagen criterion, since in this field nothing is ever completely finished."
"We can therefore see in these circumstances that it is premature to envisage opening up accession negotiations with Romania."
"It is with considerable regret that we say this since Romania is close to us - it is European culturally, historically and geographically - and it has returned to democracy."
"There is no doubt that, in the end, it will be able to join, but the road to accession involves major reforms that the Romanian government must pursue or has even yet to start."
"The European Union should lend it its full support."
"Mr President, a year ago Parliament concluded that Slovakia was not sufficiently democratic to join the group of applicants for EU membership with which negotiations could begin."
"The country satisfied all other criteria bar this one, the most important one, and I think that was a sad day for the people of Slovakia."
"I believe the decision by Parliament and by the Commission and the Council was the right one."
"The government of the time was making a pig's ear of things as far as democracy was concerned, and that was why we agreed with the decision that Slovakia, although it met the economic criteria at the time, should not be included in the group of countries with which negotiations would be started in due course."
"But yesterday, a year down the line, I was in Bratislava attending a parliamentary debate on Slovakia's ambitions in a newly elected parliament, with a new government which is doing everything possible to make us forget the previous one."
"Slovakia once more features on the map of Europe, following the September elections in which the coalition government which caused us so many difficulties was kicked out."
"Slovakia's voters voted for Europe and against isolation."
"Today we are talking about Slovakia again, and what a difference!"
"Last year we were distancing ourselves from her critically, but now we can engage with her in a positive way."
"Our criticism helped to bring about the change."
"So now we have a duty to send out a positive signal."
"Today's debate on Slovakia is therefore political in nature and must have a political emphasis, partly because of the history of Parliament's relations with this country in recent years."
"The new government is now in place and its first actions are promising."
"Its plans, as stated in the coalition agreement, sound very hopeful."
"Slovakia has changed course, towards a normal democratic system in which there is respect for the constitution, acceptance of opposition, a directly elected president, a transparent society with a place for every citizen, including the Hungarian minority which is represented in the new government and, most importantly, where there is an attitude of openness towards the European Union."
"The new government is getting on with things fast."
"It has a constitutional majority."
"We must support it where we can."
"But not only does democracy need revitalising, the economy too needs attention."
"The last government was irresponsible in allowing deficits to accumulate. It left behind a poisonous economic legacy."
"With help from the EU and others and with macro-economic indicators which remain relatively favourable, Slovakia should be able to solve its economic problems."
"We hope to see the government taking prompt measures towards that end, as recommended by the Commission."
"These include tackling financial problems, tackling the inefficient banking sector, transparency in the economy and faster adoption of the acquis communautaire ."
"I have an observation to make here about my own report, concerning the economic situation."
"We are asking the Slovak Government to pursue a critical policy on energy, an energy policy aimed at shutting down unsafe nuclear reactors."
"I think that is an important point."
"But I see that this is only mentioned in the report on Bulgaria."
"It is important to me that if I agree to that point being in my report, then it should also feature in other reports as well, so as to avoid the impression that we are only concerned about this in the case of Slovakia and Bulgaria."
"I think it should apply to other countries too."
"But that is just a comment in passing."
"Slovakia would have liked to see us now recommending to the European Council that accession negotiations should begin."
"I should like nothing more, but enlargement is a serious matter, and intentions have to be tested against policy."
"That is not possible at the moment, and it is not a reproach to anyone."
"The Slovak Government is making a start today on translating words into deeds."
"As I understand it, a vote of confidence in the new government is being held now or this evening in the Slovak Parliament."
"The Commission is thus right to recommend that we wait a while."
"But the Brussels waiting rooms are large, and waiting times uncertain."
"I think Slovakia is entitled to a second chance, a chance to sit the exam again."
"That second chance should carry a clear time frame and not a 'we shall see in the year 2000'."
"The new Slovak Government is ready to go the extra mile."
"The European Union must respond by reassessing it in the spring of 1999."
"That is the message which I put before Parliament in my report."
"The Slovaks appreciate the risks, but are eager for this further chance."
"Negative pressure now needs to be followed by positive encouragement."
"Let us not tie the destiny of Slovakia to that of Lithuania or Latvia, but to the energy and resolve of the Slovak people, which deserves individual treatment."
"We should look at the results for each applicant country, and where we can speed things up we must do so."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is in fact the reunification of Europe which is now at issue with the enlargement of the European Union, and this reunification also includes the countries bordering on the Baltic Sea."
"These are the three Baltic states which were brought into the Soviet sphere of interest when Hitler and Stalin divided up Europe at the end of the 1930s through the notorious pact signed by Molotov and Ribbentrop, the foreign ministers from Moscow and Berlin."
"Now things are opening up between East and West, it will soon be ten years since the Berlin Wall came down, and we have a platform which can help us to bring Europe together again, that is if we have the courage to do so and the real political will to use this platform provided by the enlargement of the European Union."
"That is the clear direction that we should be indicating here in the European Parliament with a view to the forthcoming summit in Vienna."
"As a Dane, it is natural for me to look across the Baltic, a sea which has once again become a source of connections and cooperation."
"The Baltic area is developing rapidly, and this applies to the three countries of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania - all three of them."
"They have regained and rediscovered their identity as independent countries after half a century of Soviet occupation."
"As rapporteur on Lithuania's application for membership of the EU, I see no reason for placing Lithuania in a different position from the two other Baltic states, even though these are of course individual negotiations and it is not necessarily the case that they will all join at the same time."
"It is of the utmost importance for Lithuania - both politically and psychologically - that the positive attitude and atmosphere are maintained, and it is also right to send a clear signal to Lithuania that the EU fully recognises the considerable progress made in terms of economic reforms, the quality and achievements of democracy and the administrative sector, even if there is still some work to be done in that field."
"Overall, these developments are enabling Lithuania to meet the requirements known as the Copenhagen criteria, and thus also to help ensure the regional stability of the area."
"In the resolution on Lithuania which is contained in the report I have drawn up, there is also a reference to the need for progress with regard to Lithuania's long-term energy strategy."
"This concerns above all the Ignalina nuclear power plant and what is to happen to it."
"The Lithuanian Government - I am pleased to tell you - is fully aware of the seriousness of the matter, and wishes to cooperate with the EU in setting up a group of experts to assess the options."
"According to the latest information that I have from Vilnius, the government is to submit a proposal to the Lithuanian Parliament that an expert group should be set up, and the discussions also point to the possibility of shutting down the plant or reducing its activity, but at the same time an assessment will also be carried out of the scope for improving safety."
"In any event, the debate on Ignalina has now reached a very practical stage."
"In the dialogue with the government in Vilnius, the question has also been raised of how far the EU is willing and able to participate in the financial costs."
"However, clarifying the situation and taking a final decision on Ignalina are not expected to be a precondition for the opening of intensive negotiations on Lithuania's membership."
"I therefore also call in my report for the accession process to be speeded up, so that intensive negotiations can begin shortly."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the demands of the various applicant countries undoubtedly have to be analysed against a new background."
"Following the informal summit in Pörtschach, a good many observers commented - rightly, in my view - that they had the feeling that the Council had been stepping on the brake pedal rather than the accelerator as regards enlargement."
"So we must watch with some concern to see what happens at the Council meeting in Vienna."
"We also see that the enlargement process is taking place against the background of an international financial crisis, and an economic crisis too which affects not only South-East Asia or Russia or Japan, but is gradually spreading to the whole of the world."
"It is indeed a long time since so many voices were heard calling at IMF and World Bank level for clear international rules to define and demarcate the framework within which market forces operate."
"Clearer still is the demand of ordinary people, in the European Union too, for action on the part of government or the state, not to take responsibility for everything but certainly to lay down rules."
"This international background also prompts us to look carefully at the difficult and demanding processes of transition which the applicant countries are having to go through."
"The Copenhagen criteria set out not only political criteria - a state based on the rule of law, human rights, democracy - but also a smoothly functioning free market economy."
"So in most of these countries the share of the private sector really needs to grow, otherwise you cannot talk about a free market."
"But it is of paramount importance that the privatisation process taking place there should be transparent and more socially responsible."
"Otherwise the call for rapid privatisation may easily lead to a 'gold rush' situation where some people grab the national wealth whilst the majority are left far behind."
"One need only look at Russia for an example of that."
"We believe the Council and Commission must monitor the progress of privatisation very carefully."
"We were very happy with the Commission's announcement at the beginning of November concerning the reports on the applicant countries and the related proposals for accession."
"We in the European Parliament were especially pleased to see the Commission really keen to sustain the tempo by holding out the prospect of negotiations in the relatively near future to Latvia, Lithuania and Slovakia."
"I hope the Council will move at the same speed."
"As regards the Commission report on Bulgaria, as rapporteur for Bulgaria I am very glad that credit is being given to the efforts which this country has made. Macro-economic stability has largely been achieved, inflation has been drastically lowered, the banking sector has been brought under control, and a higher priority is to be given to agricultural reform and the promotion of SMEs."
"The parliament has already approved all the new legislation needed for administrative reform."
"The challenge now is to implement this reform on the ground without giving the impression that the restructuring is being done on the basis of party affiliation."
"Major legislative initiatives have also been taken to promote decentralisation."
"There are two points of particular difficulty between the European Union and Bulgaria."
"Firstly there is the visa requirement, the fact that they are on the negative list."
"Parliament and the Commission are pulling together on this, but the Council will not easily be persuaded to relax its policy."
"So we in Parliament are continuing to send very clear political signals for a political solution, but we know that some adjustments may be needed to simplify administrative procedures as far as possible, so that things can be made easier for Bulgaria's citizens pending a general relaxation of policy."
"The second stumbling-block is of course Bulgaria's energy policy."
"Parliament is aware of the efforts made here at least to secure an energy strategy for the medium term, but we are absolutely not in agreement with the government's suggestion that the decommissioning dates for the four first-generation units at Kozloduy should be put off, possibly to the year 2012, which is altogether unacceptable."
"We believe it is in the interest of the safety of the Bulgarian people in the first instance, but also of course of all other Europeans too, that efforts should be made towards specific and proper implementation of the 1993 Nuclear Safety Account."
"We hope that the process of accession for the Bulgarian Government and people will be dynamic and rapid, and we very much hope that in Vienna the Council will match the pace set by the Commission, so that enlargement is not delayed but moves forward swiftly."
"- Mr President, on 4 November I had the honour to announce here the publication of the first set of regular reports on the 12 candidate countries that are progressing towards EU membership."
"Since 4 November the Commission's reports have been the subject of intense scrutiny, notably by the candidates themselves but also by the Member States and the European Parliament."
"I am pleased to say that with the exception of one or two mild and somewhat understandable expressions of disappointment on the part of some candidates, their reaction to the Commission's work has been positive."
"Indeed, the candidates have for the most part shown their readiness to respond constructively to the Commission's analysis."
"I welcome this opportunity for a more in-depth debate on enlargement in Parliament."
"We have heard, and I have welcomed very much, the reports by the rapporteurs which we have heard this afternoon."
"They have presented their draft resolutions on each of the five pre-ins from Central Europe."
"I would like to say something more now about the Commission's standpoint on these five candidates and I will also be pleased to respond at the end of this debate to any points or questions raised by honourable Members."
"I would begin by recalling that enlargement is a process that concerns not five countries but thirteen."
"In that respect I would say to Mr Caccavale that for us the difference between ins and pre-ins does not lead us to think in terms of various waves of candidates."
"I will come back to that point at the end of my intervention."
"The Commission published as a result 12 regular reports covering the 10 candidates from Central and Eastern Europe, Turkey and Cyprus."
"The thirteenth country, Malta, reactivated its application for membership in September."
"Of course we can only welcome this."
"As you know, it has been announced that we will finalise the update of the 1993 opinion on Malta, I hope by mid-February of next year."
"Turning now to the regular reports on the Central European countries, I should like to emphasise right at the outset that the Commission's analysis was conducted in an objective and impartial manner and free of all political prejudice."
"Our assessment was based on exactly the same Copenhagen and Madrid criteria as last year's opinions."
"In order to treat all candidates fairly, the reports cover only decisions or measures that have actually been taken or implemented since last year's opinions."
"Legislation in the pipeline will, when adopted, be highlighted in forthcoming reports."
"Our analysis shows that the all-inclusive enlargement process remains broadly on track and that the momentum of the candidates towards enlargement is grosso modo being maintained."
"I shall now give a short resume of our findings per country."
"In broad terms the Commission is very much encouraged by the achievements of the countries in question."
"I shall take Slovakia first."
"Last year the Commission considered that Slovakia was the only candidate that did not fulfil the Copenhagen political criteria."
"However, following last month's general election a new government has taken office and a new impetus for political and economic reform is palpable."
"That was also our experience when representatives of the new government visited Brussels not long ago under the leadership of the new Prime Minister Mr Dzurinda."
"The new political situation in Slovakia following the recent parliamentary elections brings that country an important step closer to EU membership."
"I must underline, however, that Slovakia will continue to be treated in exactly the same way as the other candidates, namely on the basis of the Copenhagen criteria."
"In consequence, the Commission will recommend the opening of negotiations on condition that its political institutions demonstrate their ability to function in a stable and democratic manner."
"It will also be necessary before opening negotiations to verify that Slovakia has undertaken measures to remedy its economic situation and that it also has introduced greater transparency into its operation."
"You know that was one of the main features regarding the economic criteria criticised in our report - or at least we said that the new government would have to address the situation it had inherited."
"It is also against that background that, although I very much welcome and understand the plea of Mr Wiersma to have an interim report from the Commission, it would be very difficult for us to produce an interim report on activities which would have to start in the coming months and to reach precise conclusions on the economic points which currently do not allow us to recommend the opening of negotiations."
"I fully agree with the rapporteur that the political change that seems to be developing after the parliamentary elections gives us hope, as we have concluded in our report, that in the foreseeable future the recommendations for negotiations can be made."
"I refer you to the conclusions of the report on that point."
"On Latvia, the Commission's opinion last year concluded that this country met the political criteria for membership, although we said then that a number of shortcomings had been identified, notably concerning the integration of non-citizens."
"The rapporteur also referred to that."
"This year we have highlighted in the report the positive result in the referendum on the citizenship law which gave an important boost to this process of integration."
"It will certainly ease the way for the naturalisation of non-citizens and stateless children."
"After this referendum we issued a statement to that effect."
"As far as its economy is concerned, Latvia has made some impressive progress in the past twelve months."
"GDP growth is high and inflation continues to fall."
"Latvia now comes close to fulfilling the criterion of being a functioning market economy."
"But it still falls short because its track record of reform is not quite substantial enough."
"It still has to plug gaps in its regulatory framework, especially in the financial sector, and it will also need to simplify the legal environment for enterprises and consolidate macro-economic stability."
"But if the momentum of reform in Latvia is maintained, it should be possible to confirm next year that Latvia would be regarded as meeting the economic criteria and hence to also propose at the end of next year that negotiations be opened."
"I also agree with the rapporteur that Lithuania has recently made significant progress."
"The Commission confirmed its view in the opinion that Lithuania fulfils the political criteria though it should intensify the fight against corruption and pursue reforms of the judiciary."
"There were advances in economic reform, although it is fair to say that after their analysis our experts came to the conclusion that Lithuania cannot yet be regarded as fully satisfying the economic criteria, especially as many policy decisions have only recently been taken and because it lacks a sufficiently sustained track record in reform."
"So, additional measures are needed and some recent developments still need to be tested in practice."
"Privatisation needs to be completed and to mention one example, its bankruptcy law has not been functioning long enough to assess the impact of that very important new law."
"As far as the nuclear power plant in Ignalina is concerned, the Commission's general conclusion on Lithuania was not predicated on the situation regarding that power plant."
"I have set out in brief the reasons why Lithuania still does not yet meet the economic criteria for the opening of negotiations."
"On the other hand, we would hope that Lithuania will present a satisfactory comprehensive energy strategy and will re-state a firm commitment that there will be no re-channelling of Unit 1 of Ignalina."
"However, I say again that it was not the state of this power plant that led us to the conclusion that negotiations should not yet be opened."
"When you look at the conclusions for Lithuania in our report, you will discover that there is a clear incentive that opens the prospect in the foreseeable future for negotiations."
"Bulgaria meets the political criteria and is making progress in filling the other criteria for membership."
"It has made advances, most notably in the fight against corruption and judicial reform but needs to broaden its efforts further."
"It has also stepped up the pace of its preparations on the acquis and made clear progress in the enforcement of intellectual property rights and on financial services, critical points of last year."
"But, in general, Bulgaria has to ensure the implementation of legislation after its adoption."
"The rapporteur Mrs Aelvoet mentioned the energy sector and we hope that Bulgaria will step up its efforts to adapt this sector in preparation of EU integration and in particular the closure commitments for the Kozloduy nuclear plant have not been appropriately addressed yet."
"We are in close contact with the authorities in Bulgaria to reach the right conclusions on this."
"Bulgaria does not yet fulfill the economic conditions and still has considerable work ahead."
"At the same time the significant progress that has been made is a cause for satisfaction, in particular the overall stabilisation of the economy."
"The government continues to show determination in its commitment to reforms."
"Priorities in the coming period should include transparent privatisation and also industrial restructuring."
"Last but not least, Romania meets the political criteria, but needs to make a concerted effort to root out corruption and strengthen its public administration."
"Particular attention should also be paid to improving the work of the courts and protecting individual liberties and the rights of the Roma."
"I hasten to say that as far as the rights of the Roma are concerned, many of the candidate countries still have to do quite a lot of work to ensure that social exclusion and discrimination is abolished."
"The Romanian economy, unfortunately, has weakened since the opinion."
"This was also the conclusion reached by the rapporteur, Mr Bernard-Raymond, and the regular report sets out in some detail what needs to be done."
"We know that the Romanian authorities are aware of the urgency and importance of the problem and we are working very closely with them to help them put in place the required measures."
"Obviously I could go into more detail but honourable Members have in their possession the very detailed reports so I will conclude by saying that on the basis of our various assessments, the Commission did not deem it necessary to make new recommendations for the opening of negotiations."
"However, it has tried to give clear perspectives to that effect and these were incorporated in our conclusions."
"We can say that the candidates have made efforts to maintain the momentum and the Commission has also played its part and will continue to do so."
"I would like to repeat that the only way to preserve the credibility of the process, not to mention the credibility of the Commission, is to continue to work on the agreed basis that each candidate country is judged on its own merits."
"In that sense, I repeat that we do not speak about pre-ins and ins as belonging to two different groups which will always remain separate."
"The opening of negotiations has to be recommended when the applicant country has made sufficient preparations to warrant this."
"Obviously the same goes for membership which should happen when each candidate is ready."
"Finally, like the rapporteurs, I hope very much that the Vienna Summit next week will give further encouragement and express its wish to maintain the momentum of the enlargement process and reconfirm its firm commitment to this process."
"I hope that in the coming months under the next presidency the Member States will realise the preparations they have to make towards enlargement."
"That would be the most encouraging signal to the candidate countries because from reading their newspapers they could have the impression that the European Union is so focused on its internal problems that it is failing to maintain the momentum on its part to respond positively to the efforts of the candidates to keep the whole enlargement process on track."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by reiterating that the Socialist Group welcomes enlargement and believes that it should be an all-inclusive process with no reserve positions, no closed groups, and with every country being judged entirely on its own merits regardless of what is happening elsewhere."
"However, we must recognise that it is not a 100 metres sprint but a marathon we are engaged in."
"A country sprinting ahead at the moment may not last the pace."
"Equally, a country lagging behind at the moment may eventually outpace the others."
"Therefore, we cannot be unduly influenced by sudden short-term initiatives but rather should make our judgments entirely on the long-term measures that governments are taking and the sustainability of their reform programmes."
"To do anything else would be to raise unreasonable expectations both in the candidate countries and among the peoples of the European Union."
"We must realise and remember that whatever solutions we come up with must be acceptable to the peoples of the European Union and the applicant countries and will often have to be approved by referendum."
"Slovakia has made huge political progress which we must recognise."
"But we need to see whether its new government is able to fulfil its commitments."
"Similarly, Latvia has made huge progress, in particular in relation to the referendum on citizenship."
"But, again, we must see if this new government is able to sustain that progress."
"Latvia and Lithuania have made enormous progress economically but, as Commissioner van den Broek has indicated, we must see if they can sustain that."
"Similarly, Bulgaria has made great progress after a poor start but we noticed a Commission opinion that it is beginning to fall back."
"We must ensure that there is proper implementation and enforcement of the European Union acquis ."
"It is not enough to take on the legislation, you have to be able to enforce it."
"That is why I do not agree with those who claim that we should start now to negotiate with Latvia and Lithuania."
"We should be flexible; we should seek the opportunity to open negotiations as soon as possible but let us not rush this process for fear of undermining it."
"There are two issues which must be of concern."
"Firstly, nuclear safety."
"We know the Soviet-designed reactors in Central and Eastern Europe cannot be upgraded safely at reasonable cost."
"All countries must have a comprehensive energy strategy which is fully in line with nuclear safety account agreements before they can join the European Union."
"Mr Kristoffersen has mentioned Ignalina."
"Lithuania has agreed to close Ignalina for good when the pressure tubes need replacing."
"Talk of expert groups must not be allowed to distract us from that."
"There can be no re-channelling."
"Finally, I should like to emphasise what Mr van den Broek said about corruption."
"Citizens will not accept an enlarged Europe if it is only going to give opportunities to corrupt officials, drug barons, gangsters and paedophiles."
"We must take action there."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, I should like to thank Commissioner van den Broek for his efficient work in the Commission."
"I should also like to congratulate the new government of Slovakia and especially the Slovakian people, who elected their government democratically."
"The prospects for Slovakia's accession have begun to change since October, and in its first statement to the European Parliament in Strasbourg, the new government under Prime Minister Dzurinda declared that it wanted to speed up the accession process."
"We must now respond to its efforts."
"The democratic forces in Slovakia need a clear signal from the European Community confirming that it is on the right path, and the forthcoming summit in Vienna is the right occasion to give this."
"It must make it clear that if Slovakia achieves sustained political stability it can join the group of countries which have already started negotiations as soon as possible."
"Instead of the Commission producing a final report on Slovakia, the Council should deliver its opinion on Slovakia's application to join as part of an extra Commission report during the first six months of 1999."
"The Copenhagen criteria, which have hitherto been a deciding factor in assessing applications to join, should be met as soon as possible."
"I think that Slovakia marks a genuine breakthrough in European history!"
"Mr President, the Liberal Group is full of praise for the work the Commission has done, and its progress reports on the applicant countries rightly make it clear that all the applicants still have a good deal of work to do."
"The fact that negotiations begin is of course no guarantee that accession will be granted."
"It is merely an acknowledgement of the progress that has been made, and the Czech and Slovenian governments have to take on board the fact that they have not yet made sufficient progress."
"The Commission warns against complacency, and rightly so."
"The approach which has been chosen is leading to greater dynamism and can resolve difficult stalemates, of the kind seen over citizenship in Latvia, for example."
"There is some confusion in Parliament as regards the progress of negotiations."
"We must be careful not to send out the wrong signal to the applicant countries."
"Our response must be encouraging, but based on real expectations."
"In accordance with our own resolution of exactly a year ago, we receive annual progress reports."
"The desire of some groups in this House for reports every six months is, to my mind, the result of woolly thinking."
"My group is against unnecessary work, and in my view the Commission would be hard pressed to produce a report of this kind every six months."
"Nor must we give the impression that being part of group 2 means that applicants are being put on ice."
"That is clear from progress in Lithuania and Latvia."
"All things considered, my group is in favour of starting negotiations with Latvia and Lithuania now."
"They have, after all, reached the point Estonia was at in July 1997."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the legislative elections which took place in Slovakia at the end of September confirmed what I personally never doubted - that Slovakia's politicians, like the Slovak people, were profoundly attached to the rules of democracy and respect for basic freedoms."
"It is true that, in the recent past, the ruling party and the opposition had sometimes clashed over differences of opinion, but is that not welcome proof of democratic vitality?"
"Now that this has been demonstrated, I, like the rapporteur, Mr Wiersma, hope that by the middle of 1999 Slovakia will be able to join the group of Central and Eastern European countries with which the European Union is officially due to start accession negotiations. We all know that the Slovak people, or at least the overwhelming majority of them, want to join the European Union because their country's history and culture belong to the Greater Europe that we are trying to build together."
"If their accession were to be slower than that of their close neighbours it would have disastrous psychological and political consequences which are to be avoided at all costs."
"I have no doubt of the Slovak people's desire to comply with the accession criteria defined at the Copenhagen summit."
"On the question of the protection of minorities and, in particular, of the Hungarian minority, I would point out that it has always been represented in the Slovak Parliament in ratio to its numerical size, which is not always the case with minorities in other Central and Eastern European countries."
"Of course, the rights - in particular language rights - of that minority should be guaranteed."
"But that minority should also show more determination to be integrated into the Slovak nation and give up any separatist inclinations;"
"I welcome the fact that elected representatives of the Hungarian minority are part of the new government."
"Furthermore, like the other applicant countries, Slovakia needs to continue to make huge efforts to reform its economy if it is to succeed in making the difficult transition from a state-run economy to a market economy; we Europeans have a responsibility to help our Slovak friends overcome these difficulties."
"To conclude, we welcome the fact, along with the rapporteur, that the road is now open for Slovakia to join the vanguard of countries applying to join the European Union."
"We need to help our Slovak friends to overcome the remaining hurdles lying ahead, provided that they - and I do not doubt this - make the necessary effort to join us."
"Mr President, I intend to speak in particular about the situation of the Romanies, or gypsies, in the applicant countries currently under discussion."
"Some of these reports have mentioned the status of Romanies and other ethnic minorities and have also raised the issue of sexual minorities with respect to the situation in Romania."
"However, I fear we shall have problems if we are merely to examine the status of gypsies on a country-by-country basis in the enlargement negotiations."
"The gypsies, or Romanies, are a very large minority in Europe."
"There is a Romany minority in all applicant countries, including Latvia, which is represented here today, although it is quite a small one in that particular country."
"The problems of the Romanies are nevertheless cause for much concern."
"For example, in the Czech Republic, which is in first place among the applicant countries, there are immense problems."
"I hope the European Union will be able to increase cooperation with the Council to improve the status of Romanies."
"Mr President, Commissioner, it was with pleasure that I read the reports on the five applicant countries which the Commission has placed in the second group for accession, even if, Commissioner, you reject that expression."
"These reports emphasise the progress made in at least four of them; the fifth, Romania, is unfortunately still encountering major difficulties."
"The progress made means that the differences between the countries in the first group and those in the second seem to be diminishing."
"I am glad because I have frequently regretted the way this has been presented, as decided by the Commission and confirmed by the European Council in Luxembourg in 1997, since it risked opening up dangerous rivalries and conflicts and discouraging countries in the sensitive area of Central Europe."
"But current trends seem to be reducing that gap, which I very much welcome."
"I hope that we can begin negotiations with these new countries as soon as possible even if there has to be a new report in the meantime, as you have requested, Commissioner."
"Against this satisfactory overall background the rapporteurs have naturally emphasised particular features in each country - the spectacular economic performance in Bulgaria, where the economy was lagging far behind, the political developments in Slovakia, giving it a much more encouraging outlook, intensive efforts in Latvia to improve the treatment of the Russian minority, etc. In a word, there is progress everywhere."
"But we should not think that these developments mean that there is still not a lot of ground to be covered, and we would be doing all of the applicant countries a disservice - whether they are in the first or second group - if we confused the progress they have achieved with ultimate success."
"It is one thing to adopt reforms and another thing to put them into practice."
"This is true, for example, of the reforms in the public administration and the civil service."
"It takes time to eliminate the political pressures and political selection criteria that were normal under the former regimes."
"The delays in the administration and civil service reforms, along with various other problems, are tending to hinder the proper preparation of negotiations and documents submitted to the Commission."
"We could be equally pessimistic about the independence of the judiciary, a notion that is taking time to sink in in some countries."
"I should like to make one more point."
"The efforts demanded of the people living in the applicant countries are considerable, and the risk is that the European Union might seem to be the main cause of the sometimes dramatic difficulties encountered by many people in these countries."
"We are well aware of the danger that Europe might become the scapegoat."
"Commissioner, could not the Commission channel more aid into social programmes targeting the most disadvantaged groups of the population?"
"Joining the European family will not be a success if the man in the street ends up associating Europe with suffering and pain."
"Mr President, following the launch of the accession process on 30 March 1998 in Brussels under the British presidency, EU enlargement is gathering ever greater pace."
"The initial fear of a separation between the ins and pre-ins is being overtaken by the logic of the screening process and the EU's pre-accession strategy."
"There should be no discrimination between any of the applicant countries as they endeavour to meet the Copenhagen criteria, tackle absorbing the acquis communautaire and prepare for the single market and the euro."
"However, as the reports before us today show, and as the Commission has indicated in its composite paper and regular reports, not all applicant countries are proceeding at the same speed towards meeting the criteria for membership."
"In looking at the Baltic states, for example, I do not accept the argument that we are looking at three peas in a pod."
"Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have different cultures, traditions, economies and experiences although they have also much shared history and cooperation."
"We should recognise progress where this has been made, as the Commissioner said earlier in this debate."
"With this in mind, I believe it is right to highlight the progress made by Latvia so that a decision can be made to start negotiations with Riga before the end of the German presidency."
"Latvia has made real progress in its citizenship laws, with the economy, in administration and in preparing for the implementation of the acquis ."
"Lithuanian progress has also been remarkable, but less impressive, in the field of nuclear energy, privatisation, institution-building, the judiciary and the establishment of a system of standards and certification."
"Estonia has continued to make steady improvements in most fields but has made disappointing progress on its legal treatment of the Russian-speaking minority."
"For its part, the EU must press on with its reforms to lay the groundwork for enlargement."
"Mr President, I would like to draw the House's attention to the issue of nuclear safety, which is one of Agenda 2000's priorities."
"With the accident at Chernobyl, the nightmare which almost the whole of Europe lived through has revealed the true scale of the dangers associated with the operation of nuclear plants and has brought to the fore matters such as safe operation and the storage and treatment of radioactive waste."
"This has made it necessary to work out a more specific policy for the safety of nuclear installations, a need made more urgent still in light of the accession procedure and the beginning of agreements with the countries of the former Soviet Union."
"The Commission's position, as expressed in its related statement about the applicant countries, is that reactors which do not conform with safety requirements and which cannot be upgraded to an acceptable level should cease to operate."
"Bulgaria was the first country to receive financial aid, while at the same time undertaking a clear and legally binding commitment to carry out short-term improvements, and then, by 2000, to shut down four reactors."
"Bulgaria has already requested a review of the agreement and an extension, while the Commission is very rightly opposed to that request."
"We cannot afford the luxury of sitting here just twiddling our thumbs."
"The European Parliament asks that the agreement on shutting down the dangerous reactors at Koslodui should be adhered to, an issue which must certainly also be raised at the European Council in Vienna."
"It must be made clear to the Bulgarian Government that any request to extend or depart from that course would be an extremely dangerous position which would sabotage its efforts to accede to the Union."
"There is nothing more important to Europe's citizens than avoiding another Chernobyl."
"A second point concerns Romania."
"Today, we are asking the Romanian government and parliament to reach a final and fair solution in the matter of property restitution."
"Mr President, the new Social Democrat Chancellor, Gerhard Schröder, and his 'green' Foreign Minister, Joschka Fischer, have intimated that the enlargement process should not take place too quickly."
"I find such a remark disturbing."
"Together with the other Liberals, I firmly believe that enlargement is taking place too slowly rather than too quickly."
"The Commission is trying very hard to support the efforts of the applicant countries to improve their legal and administrative systems and their economies."
"We welcome what is being done."
"As soon as the applicant countries fulfil the basic requirements, the EU should open wide its doors to them."
"The EU must therefore speed up its own reform process."
"Those politicians who regard it as their duty to throw stones into the EU machinery should take careful note of that."
"Flaws in the EU institutions should not keep others out."
"We, as Members of the European Parliament, also have to try to overcome the reluctance, sometimes even opposition, of the citizens of most Member States as regards enlargement."
"We have to show them that enlargement will bring much greater benefits for everyone."
"The Liberals hope that Mr Schröder, Mr Fischer and the others will adopt a more constructive tone, and that the Commission will not tire in its efforts to create a Europe that is both complete and sound in body."
"Mr President, I wish to speak as a member of the joint delegation with Romania in giving my opinion on the excellent report drafted by our colleague, Pierre Bernard-Reymond."
"I agree with his entire analysis, which is extremely objective, and I particularly share his regret that the structural economic reforms have slowed down, leading to an increase in macro-economic imbalances."
"In a country where, for nearly half a century, economic power was confused with political power, people are psychologically illprepared for assimilating the acquis communautaire and for turning Romania into a market economy."
"I have to say that President Emil Constantinescu is to be praised for his fierce and constant determination to link his country with the European Union."
"Two successive prime ministers, Victor Ciorbea and Radu Vasile, have kept the same man, Mr Alexandru Herlea, in the extremely sensitive post of minister responsible for European integration for two years, and he has managed to forge a relationship of mutual respect and considerable confidence with the Commission's advisor and with this House."
"He has displayed an excellent knowledge of the issues as well as a extremely laudable intellectual honesty."
"In the light of his analysis, the rapporteur concludes that Parliament cannot recommend the opening of accession negotiations with Romania."
"For my part I would ask for special efforts to be made in 1999 to find PHARE programme funding for this country."
"It is the only applicant country, a former member of the Warsaw Pact, which does not border on any of the 15 Member States of the European Union, and it has suffered from a kind of insularity handicap in that from the early 1950s until 1990, whichever way it turned, it had no neighbours to negotiate with apart from those subservient to Moscow."
"Bulgaria, Serbia, Hungary and Ukraine were hardly models of democracy."
"We have a special responsibility towards Romania, once a member of the Latin Union, and we should bear take that in mind."
"Mr President, I think it is very important, as Commissioner van den Broek has stressed once again, that we should regard the accession process as a dynamic process."
"The groups must not be seen as closed, and above all the countries must not be divided into different categories."
"I would make this point particularly with regard to Romania and Bulgaria."
"On the other hand, we agree with the Commission's criticism that there has been a marked decline in Romania's political efforts."
"We are concerned at the restrictions on press freedom, and the European Parliament is particularly critical of the criminalisation of and discrimination against homosexuality in Romania."
"We call on Romania to take decisive steps to restore the dignity and human rights of these people."
"We also call on the Commission to come up with more than just fine words, and to give a clear signal that it wishes to negotiate in partnership."
"One such signal would be to review our visa policy towards Romania and to restore partnership and equal treatment."
"The colossal enterprise of enlarging the European Union, an enterprise on an historic scale and which has gone past the point of no return, ought really to be a foregone conclusion being implemented already, not a vision to be implemented sometime in the future."
"I believe that today's procedure to a certain extent confirms just that choice and I would like to believe that the Vienna summit will make it official."
"Moreover, this procedure today is a paradoxical vindication of the European Parliament's insistence that the accession procedure should take place for all eleven candidate countries from a common starting point, Mr van den Broek."
"The countries we are talking about as a group today, taken together, prove the correctness of our choice."
"As regards Bulgaria, I am glad to hear confirmation of the European Parliament's support for Bulgaria's accession, as expressed in the Commission's positive progress report."
"Congratulations are due to Bulgaria, to the Bulgarian government and all the political parties, the Bulgarian state, Bulgarian society and the Bulgarian people."
"However, we must not overlook the large amount of work that still needs to be done."
"Here are three indicative points: firstly, the completion and practical implementation of the legislation on public administration and judicial authority, to ensure that it will be real, effective, independent, transparent and fair; secondly, social protection and social policy, and the establishment of real social dialogue; and thirdly, of course, Koslodui, on which Bulgaria undertook a political commitment to the European Union's authorities for the progressive shutdown of the four units which cannot be upgraded or restored."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as chairman of the European Parliament delegation to the EU-Latvia Joint Parliamentary Committee, I should like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Caccavale, who has given a very detailed account of the most recent developments in Latvia's progress towards joining the European Union."
"He has drawn some very necessary conclusions and given clear reasons for them, which is why his report and the motion for a resolution deserve our full support."
"The report quite rightly draws attention to the progress which Latvia has made over the last few months and years."
"3 October this year was a particularly important, perhaps even historic date, when there were not only parliamentary elections, but the public were also asked to take part in a referendum on proposed changes to the citizenship laws."
"The fact that they voted in favour can be seen as proof of Latvia's political maturity, and it should enable the relatively large Russian population to be integrated more successfully than has previously been possible."
"Any efforts to increase the number of true citizens and to combat disintegration deserve our support."
"The decision to make it easier and simpler to gain Latvian citizenship has clearly been taken with an eye to the future, and is all the more important when one thinks of the country's dark and tragic history, since the ethnic mix of its population is partly the result of decades of occupation."
"So the clear majority in favour of relaxing the citizenship laws is not just an expression of political maturity, it is also evidence of human greatness."
"It is precisely because the decision taken by the people of Latvia was such a complex one that it deserves recognition."
"Latvia deserves our support, and this would also be in our own interest."
"Mr President, Commissioner van den Broek, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to offer my warmest thanks to Mr Wiersma and the Committee on Foreign Affairs for their report on Slovakia and our relations with that country."
"It gives a very clear account of the new situation in Slovakia since the parliamentary elections at the end of September."
"Commissioner, if the process of enlargement really is to be seen as a dynamic and open one, as the Commission has always insisted, then events in Slovakia must surely put this theory to the test."
"Why should we not be dynamic and open when a country like Slovakia shows, with an election turn-out of 85 %, that it wants to come in from the cold and join its neighbours in the first group for accession?"
"We quite understand that the assessment you have presented to us, Commissioner, has not been able to take account of the most recent developments in Slovakian politics and society, which is why the rapporteur's demand - which I am sure will have the support of the overwhelming majority in this House - is all the more important that we should agree to re-evaluate Slovakia's position in the spring of next year, in order to do justice to its new situation."
"I would strongly urge you to do so."
"I think this would be in the interests of the Union as a whole, and would encourage further positive developments in the Slovak Republic."
"Mr President, the European Union has given the applicant countries a very thorough examination."
"Our preliminary findings were recorded in the avis , and the acquis screening is now a further stage in the evaluation of these countries."
"I would be glad to see the Central and Eastern European countries turning the tables and delivering an avis to the Union on how well we are doing in making the necessary reforms and preparing the conditions for accession."
"I think their report on our efforts would be fairly damning."
"It would note our many failings, how we are dragging our feet on institutional reform - which, to tell the truth, we have not even started yet - the never-ending negotiations on agricultural reform, and our inability to react appropriately to new developments such as those in Slovakia."
"Mr President, the preamble to the Treaty of Rome establishes that the foundations should be laid for an ever closer union among the peoples of Europe and that the barriers which divide our continent should be removed."
"It is a triumph for the EU that it has now reached the point where ten countries that were once cut off by an iron curtain are now endeavouring to establish democratic regimes, freedom and reforms within the European Union."
"We have given rights and made promises to those countries and we cannot let them down."
"We welcome the Commission's reports."
"The country which has made most progress during the last 18 months, namely Latvia, will be invited to take part in membership negotiations next year, provided nothing unforeseen occurs."
"Lithuania has also made noticeable progress."
"This gives further encouragement to the reform process in the other Central and Eastern European countries which have not achieved quite so much."
"The effect of all these countries striving to qualify for EU membership has already been very advantageous for the Member States."
"Their efforts to step up democracy and improve human rights has fostered peace in Europe."
"We should be aware that it is not just in the former Yugoslavia that a complex pattern of ethnic rivalry has sparked off serious conflict."
"Timely reforms have led to more stable economies and improved markets."
"The budgetary cost arising from expansion towards Eastern Europe is negligible in comparison with the economic and political gains for those countries, as well as for us."
"I hope that the Council of Ministers, with its present socialist bias, will not decide to apply the brakes to the enlargement process."
"It is a matter of some concern that the political leaders who opposed German unification are now adopting a tone which could be interpreted, rightly or wrongly, as favouring a slowing-down of the enlargement process."
"The Socialists probably find it more difficult than the Conservatives and Christian Democrats to see the outstanding advantages for peace and prosperity of replacing communism with a market economy."
"Pressing on with enlargement is thus a major obligation for the European Parliament."
"Mr President, as a member of the Joint Parliamentary Committee with Romania, I would like to share a few of my thoughts."
"As the rapporteur, Mr Bernard-Reymond, says in his very fair report, Romania has experienced a range of difficulties and has probably not moved as far along the road to accession as we or they would have hoped."
"I have visited Romania several times over the last ten years and in that context it is impossible not to recognise and acknowledge the huge progress and massive changes that have taken place in Romanian society, business and education, much of this in conjunction with EU partners and the TEMPUS programme for example."
"The rapporteur has already referred to the economic situation but, with reference to Parliament, Romania has many difficult decisions to make."
"Its legislators are not yet sufficiently progressive to meet the challenges ahead."
"For example, they must be prepared to rescind Article 200."
"They must improve their judiciary processes and, contrary to what Mrs Schroedter said, I feel they could pre-empt the EU by abolishing the necessity for EU citizens to have visas to visit Romania."
"That being said, Romania is unquestionably European by its history, culture and language."
"It has had a turbulent past but has now turned the corner and I look forward to still being a Member of the European Parliament when we welcome our Romanian colleagues here."
"Mr President, the action and the ambitions of the new Slovakian Government, led by the Christian Democrats, are designed to ensure that Slovakia is included as soon as possible in the group of applicants currently negotiating accession."
"Its programme of reforms is designed to strengthen its constitutional institutions and to give fresh impetus to a pluralist society and the economy."
"It is now vital to use funding from the PHARE programme to give whatever support is needed for the democratic development of the organs of state and government."
"Rapid progress is being made in the creation of democratic structures and there is a clear desire for reform."
"What is now needed is to provide rapid and appropriate support for putting these reforms into practice, including the establishment of a statute for minorities."
"Our economic support should focus on the setting-up of businesses and providing better opportunities for starting up small and medium-sized firms."
"The Slovakian administration is more than prepared to adopt the acquis communautaire as soon as possible, so we should ensure that intensive training and information is provided by our management and administration colleges."
"It is now important for the Commission to give the political signal at the Vienna summit that Slovakia is making rapid progress with its political reforms."
"It should also confirm Slovakia's positive economic developments in an interim report some time over the next few months, so that Slovakia can be included in the first group of applicant countries next summer."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is a very important debate."
"It is important because we are making it clear that the EU is considering not six, but eleven applicant countries with great interest."
"One of these is Romania, which is a country I think we need to look at very carefully."
"It is true that the pace of reform has slowed, particularly the economic reforms."
"It is true that there is more corruption, that the shadow economy has grown once again, that there are delays in the structural economic reforms and that the IMF has blocked loans."
"But it is also true that Romania and its people want to join the European Union, and I think that we in the Union should do everything we can to support this process."
"We must be determined to provide constructive support for Romania's development, and this involves more than just money."
"I think we must make it quite clear that when the applicant countries encounter difficulties, which are only to be expected, these difficulties must not be exploited by those who have never wanted enlargement to be a success and who have always tried to delay it."
"I am very confident that Romania will one day become a member of the European Union - there is every likelihood of this happening - and that we in the European Union are only doing what we have always wanted, which is to make the western European Union into a pan-European Union."
"Mr President, I am very pleased that this report supports Slovakia's accession."
"Slovakia is a particularly dear neighbour of Austria's and therefore of the European Union, and I hope that it will be allowed to join as soon as possible."
"There are two problems, however: Mochovce and Bohunice."
"Mochovce is certain to attract our attention, and Bohunice is a permanent source of concern and worry for the public."
"I would be against making the closure of Bohunice a condition for accession negotiations to start, but I certainly cannot imagine this House agreeing to the accession of Slovakia while Bohunice is still in operation."
"Mr President, I will respond very briefly."
"First of all, I am grateful for Parliament's very constructive comments, from which I conclude that it is fair to say that Parliament broadly endorses the conclusions of our reports as well as the content, the analysis."
"I think it is most important, as far as the applicant countries are concerned, that this should be combined with a message of further encouragement, and then I think the speed and momentum of the process can be sustained and consolidated."
"I have taken due note of the concern which persists here and there about forms of differentiation - different groups and so on."
"Let me say this. Apart from the fact that - like you, I would imagine - we stand by the principle that each applicant must be assessed on its merits, rewarded for the progress it has made and not kept back with those who have advanced more slowly, we are all in favour of the fact that those very countries which, through no fault of their own, have more work to do, for example before they can open negotiations, deserve extra attention and extra assistance from us."
"I would remind you that I told you last year that it was precisely for this reason that we created the catch-up facility within the PHARE programme."
"I can also tell you that applicants which have not yet opened negotiations will, in the first quarter of the year, in terms of the screening process too, move from multilateral to bilateral screening and thus into a process which is more akin to that in the first group, if I can put it like that."
"Lastly, I would reiterate that what counts is what the countries themselves achieve. You may well find - and I am picking up the thread here of what Mr Titley said this evening - that a difference will soon become apparent amongst the countries which are already negotiating between those which are moving forward faster and those which are slower."
"Whilst tactically we do exactly the same as regards the number of chapters dealt with, the number of chapters completed and so on, differences may of course develop in the course of the year, and some negotiations may make more progress than others."
"Credit has to be given accordingly, and we feel that the Commission - and the Council too, which leads the negotiations - must adapt and allow for any such differences."
"So we agree on that."
"My final comment is this: several speakers this evening have again referred to the importance of closing down unsafe nuclear reactors."
"I can assure you that the three applicant countries which face this phenomenon and its troublesome political, economic and social implications are well aware of the pressure there is from Parliament, the Council and the Commission to address the problem and devise programmes for decommissioning these plants."
"We shall liaise closely with these applicants towards that end."
"Thank you for those clear answers, Commissioner."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m."
"EU/Turkey relations"
"The next item is the report (A4-0432/98) by Mr Swoboda, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, on the communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on the further development of relations with Turkey (COM(97)0394 - C4-0490/97) and on the communication from the Commission to the Council: European Strategy for Turkey - The Commission's initial operational proposals (COM(98)0124 - C4-0634/98)."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this was really not a very easy report to write, and it is also not a very easy time for me to be presenting it."
"I would like to mention ten points which I feel are seminal to this report, and which I hope you think are too."
"First of all, I think that relations between the European Union and Turkey should become less tense despite the current difficulties, and I agree with the Commission that our relations should be developed on the basis of the Customs Union and the Commission's strategy paper, which has been very positively received in Turkey."
"This is the way forward."
"Secondly, Turkey should also clearly recognise, as I say in my report, that the door is open."
"There is absolutely no doubt about this, and Turkey should acknowledge the fact."
"Thirdly, we also want to have Turkey as a member because we think that it can play an important part in establishing security in Europe and in Europe's economic and social development."
"Fourthly, financial relations between Turkey and Europe must therefore be well regulated."
"I welcome the fact that the Commission has put forward proposals on this which Parliament is to examine separately, and I would suggest that we should also consider which EU programmes, particularly those for the East European applicant countries, could also be applied to Turkey."
"Fifth, I would stress that the Copenhagen criteria also clearly apply to Turkey, of course."
"Sixth, we - that is to say, the Council, the Commission and Parliament - feel that Turkey has a long way to go - some people would say that it is getting even longer - to meet the Copenhagen criteria, particularly the requirements of democracy, the rule of law and respect for the rights of minorities, whether these be sizeable minorities like the Kurds or smaller ones like the Armenians and the Greeks."
"Turkey must respect the rights of all its citizens."
"Seventh, my report works on the assumption that Turkey itself should propose how and when it intends to meet the conditions set by the European Union, particularly the political criteria."
"I would like to get away from the situation where we make demands and then have to examine whether they are good for Turkey and whether Turkey has done anything about them."
"No, if Turkey accepts - and this is the condition it must meet if its application to join the European Union is to be considered - that it has to meet the Copenhagen criteria, then it must itself come up with some proposals very soon on how it intends to try to fulfil the individual requirements relating to democracy, the rule of law and recognising the rights of minorities."
"Eighth, it is very important for us that Turkey should have good neighbourly relations with all its neighbours, including Greece, of course."
"As I have repeatedly said, Turkey, which itself understands the importance of family relationships, should not be surprised if we support one of the members of our family here in the European Union, namely Greece, in its efforts to establish good and fair relations with its neighbour."
"I also support Greece's proposals on how to solve the present disputes, proposals which are entirely acceptable and fair towards Turkey."
"Ninth, the Cyprus problem is something we want to get to grips with, and for this we need Turkey's cooperation."
"We want to find a fair solution, and we do not want the matter to be resolved unilaterally."
"The Turkish inhabitants of Cyprus should be given every opportunity to cooperate and to have their say, but this must be within the context of a joint solution for both the Greek and Turkish populations, and it must also be clear that Parliament wholeheartedly supports Cyprus's efforts to become a member of the European Union."
"Tenth is the Kurdish question, which has sadly become a particularly topical issue over the last few days."
"Let me make this quite clear: we want to see a peaceful solution to the Kurdish problem."
"We reject any form of terrorism or violence, and we also reject any solution that would compromise or destroy Turkey's unity and integrity."
"We fully recognise Turkey's right to have and its interest in having a unified state, but within this unified state the Kurdish people must be able to uphold their cultural rights and in particular their language and its use in the media, books and so on."
"I think that in spite of the Ocalan crisis, Turkey can still find a way to resolve its Kurdish problem once and for all, and the European Union should help it to find a peaceful solution to this problem and to combat terrorism."
"We in the European Union and in this House will certainly not support terrorism, particularly if Turkey is prepared to find a peaceful solution to the Kurdish question."
"It was on this basis that I wrote my report, and it is on this basis that I think that we can make a new start, resolve a number of thorny issues and achieve open relations with Turkey. But we must make it perfectly clear to Turkey that the political and economic criteria have to be met if Turkey wishes to become a member of the European Union."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz is obviously making it difficult for us to discuss the development of relations with Turkey dispassionately and to come up with coherent proposals for the European Union sine ira et studio ."
"Threats against the government of one of the Member States, Italy, a boycott on Italian goods and political attacks on the European Union are, I think we would all agree, hardly the best way for the largest of our associated countries, Turkey, to achieve closer relations with us."
"However, we should not allow the excellent report by Mr Swoboda, which could provide guidelines for our partnership strategy, to be swamped by the reactions to the issue of the handing-over of the Kurdish leader Mr Ocalan."
"I also welcome the Commission's decision to issue its usual annual report on the state of relations between the European Union and Turkey in the same form as the progress report produced for the other applicant countries."
"This means that we will have a clear list of the progress, or lack of it, that Turkey has made on the political, economic and social requirements."
"We in the Committee on External Economic Relations feel that it is important in the medium term progressively to consolidate and intensify economic and political cooperation with Turkey in a spirit of partnership."
"For the European Union this means - as its side of the partnership - fulfilling its financial commitments in the context of the Customs Union, including Turkey in European programmes such as Leonardo, Socrates and Youth, and coordinating policies on energy, transport, the environment and combating drugs."
"I would agree with Mr Swoboda that we should not issue Turkey with a list of demands; it simply needs to have a kind of action plan on Europe to improve the coordination of all its efforts in the fields of democracy, the rule of law and human rights, including also the accompanying economic conditions and the adoption of the acquis communautaire , and it should raise the profile of these efforts, which are its guideline for intensifying cooperation."
"If the Swoboda report can be used, as before, in a positive spirit to tackle the problems which exist between Turkey and the European Union, assuming that it is adopted by Parliament tomorrow, then we feel able to vote for it as a set of guidelines."
"However, we feel that if it becomes excessively bogged down in certain issues, it will simply be counterproductive."
"Mr President, a very important event in EU-Turkey relations is occurring at this very moment."
"It may come as a surprise to parliamentarians that it is not taking place in this Chamber but in Turkey because at this very moment Galatasaray are playing Juventus."
"If that becomes the occasion for mob violence against Italian citizens, I would submit that it would set back EU-Turkey relations a long way."
"Having seen what happened to Manchester United when they visited Turkey a few years ago, I fear the worst this evening."
"The Socialist Group condemns absolutely the hysteria which is being whipped up against Italy by sections of Turkish society over the Ocalan affair."
"We condemn any interference in the decisions of the judiciary in a Member State governed by the rule of law."
"I want it to be said loud and clear that those of us who want to see a more positive policy towards Turkey will have our voice silenced if the Turkish Government or Turkish society encourages mob rule against citizens of the European Union."
"An attack on one country of the EU is an attack on us all."
"Having said that, we welcome the Swoboda report and in particular the way the rapporteur has drawn on the expertise of various organisations in Turkey such as unions and human rights groups to make a positive and constructive contribution to the development of EU-Turkey relationships."
"The Socialist Group has been consistent in its line on Turkey's application for membership of the EU."
"We believe that Turkey would make a valuable contribution to the peace and security of our region."
"We do not accept religious or cultural reasons as an obstacle to Turkey's accession to the European Union."
"However Turkey must be judged on the same basis as any other country."
"It must adhere to the Copenhagen criteria and the Commission's report makes it very clear that it does not."
"I support the rapporteur's suggestion that it is now up to Turkey to give us a timetable for concrete reforms to demonstrate just how serious they are with their application."
"Turkey also has to accept the EU's right to negotiate admission with any country it feels fit to negotiate with."
"However, it is important that we are not passive in relations with Turkey."
"We must try and help find a political solution to the Kurdish problem which in many ways is the cause of much of Turkey's paranoia and insecurity."
"We know that Turkey's problem is that the government is weak and the state is strong."
"Therefore we should be looking to strengthen the government by support for reform of the public administration, by improved interpretation facilities and by ensuring the democratic organisation work at grassroots."
"Mr President, first of all may I compliment Mr Swoboda on his balanced, tactful and thorough report."
"It sets the scene for the European Union's relations with Turkey."
"Firstly, it confirms that Turkey can in principle accede to the Treaty of Rome, as can any democratic and constitutional state, on the basis of the political values which we in the Union hold in common."
"That in no way means, of course, that a state with a large Islamic population cannot join."
"Nor, for example, would we be opposed to a Bosnia with a large Islamic population group if at some stage it applied for membership of the European Union."
"I would like to make that point emphatically, so that no one can pretend there is any difficulty on the European Union side."
"But we must insist that a country wishing to join does indeed meet the criteria, just like any other country."
"Because we are not joining another country; other countries are joining the Union."
"The Union expects countries expressing the wish to join the Union to take real steps in the right direction, not only economic measures for their own economic structure, but primarily steps to secure the political values which obtain in a constitutional state and a democracy."
"Union members have to be constructive in resolving their own minority problems."
"They have to be constructive in helping to promote international peace and the rule of law."
"In that respect, Turkey currently leaves much to be desired, because she is oppressing her own minorities, has problems along her eastern borders and has nothing constructive to offer towards a settlement of the Cyprus question."
"Turkey's government must not act as if it can demand membership of the European Union on its own terms."
"It cannot ignore the measures which remain to be taken."
"I think we would do well to ask Turkey to draw up a time-scale, as the report also suggests, with a plan for taking the political measures required by the European Union."
"If they do not do that, there will be no further progress, but if they do, those measures will be warmly welcomed."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Swoboda's report importantly confirms Turkey's eligibility for membership of the EU, provided she satisfies the economic and political criteria."
"In that respect, the analysis of the situation in Turkey has not materially changed since we concluded the Customs Union with her."
"Once again, we have here a list of wishes which we know from experience and having dealt with three Turkish governments will not be satisfied in a hurry, however desirable that may be."
"I therefore warmly welcome the Commission's initiative of a European strategy for Turkey."
"The Commission, and I have to say the Commissioner in particular, has to my mind always played a constructively critical role in this difficult relationship with Turkey."
"As a result, the Union and Turkey have never been totally cut off from one another."
"I hope that role will bear fruit within the foreseeable future."
"An hour ago, Mr Swoboda presented his contribution to preparations for the Vienna summit, but I did not hear him say anything as rapporteur about the priority which should be given at that summit to discussing the European strategy for Turkey."
"I think that certainly is a priority, because otherwise there is a danger that all these well-prepared operational proposals, the deepening of the Customs Union, will be lost sight of."
"The arrival in Rome of the PKK leader Mr Ocalan and the question of whether or not this terrorist leader should be tried may perhaps be at the forefront of people's minds at the summit."
"So this obstacle must be removed prior to the summit, by action of the kind that befits a constitutional state of the EU; this means that Germany, as the next holder of the Union presidency, must uphold the detention order so that Mr Ocalan can be put on trial."
"Packing him off to Moscow would be to funk the issue, and would merely further complicate and frustrate our relations with Turkey unnecessarily."
"Mr President, the rapporteur has obviously made an effort to add gloss to this report, but I do not think he has succeeded."
"His report is biased, it is full of suspicious omissions and is governed throughout by a syndrome of unprincipled and unjustified goodwill towards Turkey."
"You want examples of omissions?"
"Not a word about the negative consequences of the deluge of millions of Turks if the negotiations on enlargement and accession go ahead and Turkey gains access to the Community's labour market."
"Does he say anything about a constitution or about penal law?"
"Not a word about the torture, the disappearances, the murder of detainees under the penal code in force."
"True, he says something about the Cyprus and Kurdish problems, but he deliberately ignores Turkey's expansionist declarations about the Aegean, which are accompanied by threats of violence."
"It is also characteristic that he tries to legitimise the de facto dominant position of the Turkish military government in Turkey's public life when, in paragraph 18, he calls for talks on accession, negotiations etc., to be held with the armed forces. Where before has such a thing ever been proposed?"
"In what country?"
"Why does he propose this for the Turkish military government in paragraph 18?"
"For those reasons and many others, for which one minute is not enough ..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, we do not wish to see any torture or executions in Turkey, and we are therefore grateful for the balanced tone and clear goals set out in Mr Swoboda's report."
"He opens the door for Turkey to become a member of the European Union and urges that a timetable should be drawn up for democratic reforms there."
"He thus spells out in very practical terms the basic requirements for membership of the European Union."
"I very much regret that such clear thinking was not possible a year ago in Luxembourg."
"This has strengthened forces in Turkey which detect a spirit of the crusades within the Union and want Turkey to change, whereas the forces of democracy have been weakened."
"The Member States now have another chance to give a sign in Vienna that will strengthen democracy in Turkey, and I hope they will be guided by Mr Swoboda's report."
"I think the ball is now in Turkey's court."
"After a report like this it really has to put its cards on the table, and this is why I am very glad that we too have another chance to do so now."
"Thank you, Mr Ceyhun, and congratulations on your maiden speech here in Parliament."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the Swoboda report is certainly heading in the right direction."
"However, I am slightly uneasy about its general criticisms concerning the rule of law in Turkey."
"More than one Member State - and Mr Ephremidis should not feel that I am getting at him because I am not thinking of his country in particular - should be doing some very deep soul-searching about the rule of law at the moment, and I am thinking here particularly of the host country of the European Parliament."
"That said, what is undoubtedly missing from the Swoboda report is the whole issue of the Council's clumsy treatment of Turkey over enlargement, excluding Turkey for no reason from the list of countries that will one day become members of the European Union."
"And one thing that is really not playing the game is the unilateral cancellation of our side of the Customs Union."
"When there is an agreement you cannot unilaterally delete part of it and only keep the parts that, as we have seen, are beneficial to the European Union."
"However, I think that there are a certain number of good things in this report and I must congratulate Mr Swoboda on setting a timetable."
"What is vital is making sure that relations between the European Union and Turkey are based on a calendar of reforms leading to accession."
"I would urge - and I think the Commission would agree with this - that the timetable should be fixed as soon as possible so that we can start working towards a particular target instead of remaining in this state of flux, which has unfortunately already been going on far too long."
"Mr President, I would first like to congratulate Mr Swoboda on the very meticulous report he has presented and on his thorough work."
"He has prepared a report which is on the right lines, because our aim here is not to make things difficult for Turkey, but rather, to make them easier, and to help Turkey along in the procedure which it has requested, so that its application to join the European Union can one day be taken seriously."
"But what is the European Union?"
"I think this is something that Turkey will have to understand."
"It is not just an economic community, but above all an association of free countries and their citizens, who share certain values in common."
"What are those values?"
"Democracy, respect for the individual and his rights, freedom of thought, the protection of minorities and respect for diversity."
"I am afraid that in Turkey there are many who do not understand what those values mean, and I think this report will help them do so."
"In Europe we suffered the trials of the war."
"Turkey, which was neutral during the last war, perhaps does not understand what peace means to us."
"Perhaps that is why Turkey so easily and so often threatens peace, threatens to take up arms even against members of the European Union itself."
"Of course, in the EU we are not perfect when it comes to protecting the rights of our citizens, but we recognise what Turkey does not recognise: that democracy's greatest imperative is respect for our citizens, who must not be exposed to high-handedness, torture and disappearances."
"Genocide must never be used as a weapon for the subjugation of a minority group."
"As I said, Turkey itself requested membership of the European Union and certainly has the right to reconsider."
"But if it does not wish to reconsider its application, it must respect the principles I mentioned."
"And another thing: Turkey must take immediate steps to renounce war, to accept the process of the International Court at The Hague and to accept that it must stop the war against its own citizens."
"That is when it will find that it has friends here in the European Union, friends who are interested in helping it forward, friends who want the Turkish people to progress to a point where one day they will be much closer to Europe."
"Yet again, I wish to congratulate Mr Swoboda."
"This report is a very important one and I hope it will not be misunderstood in Turkey, because it was prepared by people who want to help that country finally move into the twenty-first century."
"Mr President, taking up the last point made by the previous speaker, I would say that our intention is to help Turkey move closer to the European Union."
"I believe, moreover, that Parliament, the Council and the Commission have always pursued this goal."
"We are conscious of Turkey's central geopolitical position and the role which it can play in creating the conditions for peace in a particularly sensitive region."
"However, Turkey must also understand the reasons for certain objections, opposition and criticisms raised in the course of the negotiations."
"One outstanding issue which obviously cannot be overlooked is the Kurdish question: although we respect Turkey's territorial integrity, this cannot be considered a purely domestic problem, not least because it is crucial in terms of protecting minority rights."
"On the other hand, harsh and violent attitudes will not resolve the matter either, and the terms in which Turkey has referred to Italy are not always palatable."
"In our opinion, this is not the way to solve such problems."
"Only through dialogue and conflict settlement can these goals be achieved, goals which the European Union must pursue with determination and by common accord."
"Sometimes, I must say, we have felt isolated, even though at the end of the day the European Council - through the Austrian Presidency - and the Commission did speak out in solidarity. These are problems which can only be tackled by all of us together."
"Mr President, in my opinion Mr Swoboda has produced a good report: it is well-balanced, clear and also firm where it needs to be."
"All of us - I do not believe that we differ on this point - are keen to keep the door of the European Union open to Turkey, and consider that - as Mr Bianco has just said - Turkey could in theory make a major political contribution to the EU."
"But the problem is that certain obstacles still exist at the present time, and it is on these that we must focus."
"The principal obstacles are above all political ones, concerning democratic guarantees, law and order, and minorities."
"It has to be said that, on balance, the domestic situation within Turkey is unacceptable: unacceptable both to us and in the light of the Copenhagen criteria."
"This is Turkey's problem, and it is Turkey which must adapt its structures and its conduct."
"Mr Swoboda is right to say that we must ask Turkey and its government what it intends to do, when and how."
"We must now enter a new phase: we can no longer merely utter declarations of principle, repeating that Turkey is important and that we are keeping the door open; it is now up to Turkey, if it wishes to join the European Union, to say precisely what it intends to change, when and by what means, and how it intends to adapt its structures which conflict with the Copenhagen criteria."
"That is the point!"
"Turkey's recent attitude to Italy has, to my mind, been a serious error of judgement on the part of the government and society at large, because its aggressive, even violent attitude has created a very poor impression not only in Italy but throughout the EU at an awkward moment for Turkey."
"It has thus made a serious mistake."
"The Italian Government did what was necessary, as everyone has acknowledged."
"It arrested Ocalan, because an international arrest warrant had been issued by Germany, and acted in accordance with its constitution: neither in the past, present or future can anyone be extradited to a country which carries out the death penalty and does not furnish adequate human rights guarantees."
"This is Italy's position and that of all the Member States of the European Union."
"Turkey has a further problem, over and above those already mentioned: it cannot say that there is solely a problem of terrorism and not a Kurdish problem."
"This is a key point: until Turkey admits that there is a Kurdish problem, and not just a terrorist problem, it will not be able to comply with the Copenhagen criteria or to give us satisfactory answers."
"There are other issues apart from the Kurdish question, but this is typical of Turkey's attitude."
"Now is the time to put our detailed criticisms to Turkey and to demand answers."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Western European Union in Paris yesterday, I had the opportunity to listen to Turkey's Foreign Minister, Mr Cem."
"Turkey is obviously glad of any opportunity to appear at any forum on the European stage."
"It was significant that Mr Cem thought that he detected a change of position in Turkey's favour in the last Commission report, which described Turkey as a candidate and not - as it suddenly was in Luxembourg - a 'non-candidate' pushed out in the cold."
"This was the impression he had had, and it is a positive sign that relations are improving between the European Union and Turkey."
"At the same time, it was striking that Mr Cem refused to be deflected from the terrorism problem as Turkey defines it, and he said not a word about the Kurdish problem."
"This is why I very much welcome the fact that the European Parliament report clearly addresses this issue and demands that Turkey should explain its position very clearly, because Turkey must be judged by the same standards as all the other applicant countries."
"I am convinced that we now have a major opportunity to find a political solution to the Kurdish problem, because with the agreement between Turkey and Syria, the forthcoming agreement between Turkey and Israel and the shelving of the Ocalan issue, there is a real chance of ending the 15-year guerrilla war that has claimed so many Turkish and Kurdish victims, and there is now a window of opportunity to find a political solution to the problem."
"I think that we too must do everything we can to urge Turkey to get to grips with the problem and find a political solution to it."
"Mr President, I think that any steps which are likely to improve relations with Turkey are both right and proper, and I therefore unreservedly support the main elements of the Swoboda report, together with the Commission's proposals and the progress report."
"There are just three points on which I have reservations."
"The first is the lack of openness in our dealings with Turkey, which is why I hesitate about the wording of paragraphs 1 and 29 of Mr Swoboda's report holding out the prospect of membership once again, whereas all the facts and every practical consideration indicate that this is misleading."
"Everyone would surely agree with me that Turkey belongs to the family of western democracies and must be part of that family."
"For this reason, it should not have to see its application to join put off indefinitely once again."
"The 1963 Ankara agreement, signed 35 years ago, does admittedly say that the possibility of Turkey's accession to the Community would be examined, not as an obligation on the Community, only as an expression of its willingness to do so."
"But if we now give Turkey the impression once again that accession is imminent, we are being misleading, we are not being honest or open and, as so often happens here in Parliament, we are simply leading it up the garden path."
"I would be in favour of developing a special relationship with Turkey."
"I fought tooth and nail for the Customs Union here in Parliament and I am a member of the Joint Parliamentary Committee, but raising the bar again now and offering the prospect of accession under far more stringent conditions than applied to any of the others who have joined is simply unrealistic and unfair."
"There is one further point which this report does not mention."
"Parliament would be well advised to deliver a clear opinion on the failure to implement the financial protocol of the Customs Union."
"How can we make demands of Turkey if we cannot eliminate the obstacles that we ourselves have created through Greece's permanent veto?"
"Mr President, from this platform I have repeatedly stressed that if there is one country among the European Union's 15 Member States which would be delighted if Turkey joined the Union, that country is Greece."
"This is because geography dictates that Greece is Turkey's neighbour. If those two countries were to work closely together, given that they occupy sensitive positions at the crossroads between Europe and Asia and between the Balkans and the Mediterranean, that cooperation would be valuable, productive and constructive for the whole of Europe and, I would say, for the security of the world as a whole."
"But an essential prerequisite for that, obviously, is that relations between those two countries should be friendly and based upon the principles of international law."
"Unfortunately, while Greece, along with the other 14 countries, was prompt to subscribe to the Customs Union, Turkey, as if emboldened by that fact, has increased its provocativeness, aggressiveness and rashness towards Greece, to the point that its territorial claims are constantly on the increase."
"Consequently, it is no mere quibbling that makes Greece decline to sign the financial protocol."
"It is because the conditions of the Luxembourg Council's decision requiring Turkey to demonstrate a truly European orientation have not been satisfied."
"Mr President, may I begin by thanking Mr Swoboda most warmly for his thorough and in my view balanced report."
"I think I can say that the Commission to a large extent agrees with the rapporteur's analysis, and his conclusions too."
"I too was in fact anticipating this debate with mixed feelings just now, given recent developments in our relations with Turkey and specifically following the detention of the PKK leader Mr Ocalan."
"Nevertheless, I think we need to take a rather longer view and bear in mind that in recent times - beginning in 1995 with the conclusion of a Customs Union, but also more recently with the devising of a separate European strategy for Turkey - the European Union has chosen to measure the situation in Turkey against the Copenhagen criteria - easily identifiable in terms of Turkey's desire to be recognised as an applicant for membership."
"A progress report has been drawn up, in other words the European Union has I think clearly manifested its good intentions and also its political belief that it is important to further develop a lasting institutional tie with Turkey."
"We can certainly try, through assistance and cooperation - and there are proposals for that - to improve the economic position, to broaden and deepen the Customs Union, and to further align Turkey's laws with those of the European Union, but one thing we cannot do is dictate to Turkey how it should manage the political criteria laid down in Copenhagen."
"In that respect, the Union has set the standard at exactly the same level for all applicants."
"Noblesse oblige."
"That holds good in this case for Turkey too."
"In view of the time, I shall come to an end. I do in fact hope that on one of the major issues, the Kurdish question, which has caused us no end of trouble in our whole assessment of human rights in Turkey, the beginnings of a political solution may now be in sight, a solution which certainly can only be possible once the problem as such is acknowledged to be a problem."
"We have not really got to that stage yet with Turkey."
"But can we not say here that the European Union is willing to look, together with Turkey, at ways of resolving this very important problem?"
"The prospect of a solution would give a huge boost to Turkey's whole relationship with the European Union, it would improve the relationship enormously and also considerably improve the chances of solving other similarly important problems such as Cyprus, relations with Greece and the Aegean."
"The recent developments and complications over the detention of the PKK leader have in any case made two things abundantly clear: how important it is that we should actually get an international criminal court which can deal with this kind of thing and, secondly, how important it is that we should now start to look seriously for a political solution to the Kurdish question."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"I think that Mr Swoboda can be pleased with this debate."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m."
"(The sitting was suspended at 8.05 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)"
"Members' Statute"
"The next item is the report (A4-0426/98) by Mr Rothley, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, on the draft Statute for Members of the European Parliament."
"Mr Fabre-Aubrespy has the floor for a point of order."
"Mr President, pursuant to Rule 128 of the Rules of Procedure, I should like to table a motion for the debate on the this item to be declared inadmissible for three reasons."
"The first reason is that the report draws upon the Amsterdam Treaty, which is mentioned in the preamble in recitals B, D and E. This Treaty has not yet been ratified, it has not yet entered into force."
"It is an affront to French Members and Senators to apply this text before it has even been ratified, particularly as, only yesterday, they debated the constitutional reform preceding the ratification of this Treaty."
"The second reason is that the draft Statute included in this report adds provisions to the Treaty establishing the European Community, to the 1976 Act and to the Protocol on the privileges and immunities of the European Communities - something it does not have the power to do."
"For this reason, the provisions which aim to penalise MEPs holding other parliamentary mandates are inadmissible."
"The third reason, Mr President, is that this report is an own-initiative report."
"It must therefore respect Rule 148, intended as a legal basis, and Rule 50, which applies in accordance with paragraph 6 of that Rule."
"Therefore, the proposal that it contains must, and I quote, 'respect the principle of subsidiarity and the fundamental rights of citizens', which is not the case in this instance."
"It must also respect paragraph 4 of the same Rule: 'Where a proposal has financial implications, Parliament shall indicate how sufficient financial resources can be provided'."
"This requirement has clearly not been met; this proposal does have financial implications for the Community budget and there has been no suggestion of how to finance it."
"These are the three reasons why I am calling for this text to be declared inadmissible and this is why I am questioning it now."
"Thank you very much, Mr Fabre-Aubrespy."
"The Chair believes that the report we are about to debate is admissible as the Council has expressly asked for our opinion on this matter and, according to the Rules, this is a valid way to give our opinion."
"Therefore, the Chair believes that it is not inadmissible and, as it is not inadmissible, we will begin debating it and, at the appropriate point, we will vote on it."
"Mr President, your point of view is most interesting, but it is not up to you to give it on the motion I have tabled."
"It is, however, up to you to ask whether there is a speaker for and against this motion before putting it to the vote, as stated in Rule 128 of the Rules of Procedure."
"Mr Fabre-Aubrespy, I know that you are very familiar with the Rules but at this moment in time the Presidency is applying these rules and believes that there is no need for a debate and vote on your proposal as the report is admissible."
"If, Mr Fabre-Aubrespy, you do not agree, you can appeal to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities, of which you are not only a member, but a very well-known member."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Chair has decided on its position."
"This position, Mr Fabre-Aubrespy, may be wrong, and you all know how to appeal against it."
"But, in any case, the Chair will begin the debate as it believes that the report is admissible."
"I have explained my reasons for this: although the changes to the Amsterdam Treaty have not been adopted in all the Member States, Parliament's comments on future-related matters are valid, and all the more so as the Council has asked for our opinion on this matter."
"I shall now give the floor to the rapporteur, Mr Rothley."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Members' Statute represents an opportunity for Parliament."
"It can take on a new profile: more independent, more self-reliant; it can come of age as a Parliament whose members are accountable to the electorate and to the European Union."
"One aspect of this new profile is that Members would be paid by the European Parliament itself."
"Equal pay for equal work."
"Which brings us to the first problem."
"There will always be governments and members of national parliaments who maintain that the Members of the European Parliament must on no account earn more than the members of their own national parliament."
"And there will always be Members of the European Parliament who consider it unacceptable that they should earn less than national MPs."
"That is just how things are, and they will be no different two years, five years or 20 years from now."
"For that reason we must address the problem now."
"I do not believe we can achieve this aim in one fell swoop."
"That is why we in the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights are proposing a transitional system."
"The Members who are elected for the first time next June will receive the average salary, which will be compulsory for all new Members."
"Why?"
"Because the average is a token of our respect for the democratic decisions of national parliaments."
"It makes no sense for the Italian Government to attack the Spanish Parliament for paying its members too little."
"Nor does it make any sense for the Spanish Government to attack the Italian Parliament for paying its members too much."
"That would be utter nonsense."
"Europe cannot function if any one country forces its own system on all the others. In short, the use of the EU average is a mark of democratic respect."
"For the Members who are re-elected, there will be problems in terms of pensions and fiscal legislation, and that is why they should have the right to choose between the new system and the present system, but only for a five-year period."
"During the next Parliament, we shall take a decision that will apply uniformly to all Members for the sixth legislative term, beginning in the year 2004."
"If you share my earnest wish that we should have a statute before the elections in June of next year, the proposal tabled by Parliament must be moderate, it must be immediately convincing, it must be obviously sensible, and it must be entirely selfexplanatory."
"So what are the other proposals?"
"There is the idea of linking MEPs' salaries to those of judges or Commissioners."
"Almost all our governments grumble about civil servants' and judges' salaries."
"If we say we want a percentage of a civil servant's, judge's or Commissioner's salary, the Council will immediately lower the portcullis."
"So anyone who wishes to kill off the Statute need only propose this sort of linkage."
"There is another reason. A Member of Parliament is an independent political player who is accountable to his or her electorate and to the European Union."
"No part of me is a judge at the European Court of Justice, nor should I ever wish that upon myself!"
"Hiding behind the pay packet of a civil servant or a judge, rubbing our hands with glee whenever civil servants or judges are awarded a rise and shrugging off any responsibility, may be cunning but it is not prudent."
"The European Parliament should decide freely, independently and confidently about the remuneration of its Members."
"This alone befits the dignity of Parliament."
"The other disadvantage of the linkage proposal is that it does not name any figure."
"That is no way to solve the problem facing the European Parliament, and there is indeed a problem facing us."
"This issue has set people talking about Parliament; it must not bring us into disrepute."
"As for travel expenses, it is high time we solved that problem."
"We must not create the impression that we only take action if the big stick is wielded."
"But we can only solve the problem if we talk about pay."
"No one can expect a Member of Parliament to work here for ECU 2 827."
"That is not realistic."
"This is why rates of pay and the system of reimbursement for travel expenses are inextricably linked."
"This is why we must name a figure and include the following sentence in our resolution: 'The Bureau shall decide in the light of the Statute'."
"The fact is that having a statute will enable us to put our House in order."
"In other words, the political logic behind our proposal is that we are prepared to solve our problem, and now it is up to you in the Council to play your part."
"That is the political rationale of this proposal."
"Some say there are too many details."
"The Dutch fiscal authorities are taxing our colleagues to the hilt, and some say these are mere details that do not interest us."
"No, these are not trivial details."
"We have heard enough fine words."
"We have heard enough political rhetoric."
"We have a problem to solve."
"Politics is all about solving problems."
"That is why we are here."
"I have often been thinking lately of one of Churchill's delightful witticisms: democracy, he said, is the worst form of government except for all the others."
"That is also what I should like to say of this proposal."
"It is the worst proposal except for all the others, and that is why I would ask you to approve it."
"(Laughter and applause)"
"on Institutional Affairs. (ES) Mr President, I trust that after the 109 amendments we are to vote on tomorrow, this statute, currently only in draft form, will prove a great step forward from what we have in place at present."
"I most earnestly hope so."
"Indeed I am sure this will be the case, for one simple reason: this statute is of crucial importance to Parliament."
"It represents a success for Parliament, which listed it amongst its priorities when negotiating the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"No one thought the requirement for a statute would be included in the Treaty, but we managed to ensure that it was."
"That was the first success."
"Secondly: this statute is very important for Parliament because it serves as its charter."
"The Statute is about much more than just our salary."
"It lays down the rules by which we must regulate our conduct, as representatives directly elected by the citizens."
"Therefore, the proposal we must take to the Council, which has to approve it unanimously, ought to be a reasonable proposal, as Mr Rothley has said. If it is not, it will fail because of the requirement for unanimity."
"In that case, the success achieved so far would turn into failure."
"In its opinion, the Committee on Institutional Affairs, which I have the honour to represent, has made three requests. First, that the rules adopted be transparent, so that the citizens can be aware of the rules governing the conduct of Members of the European Parliament."
"In my view, the present state of affairs, which results from a previous situation, no longer makes much sense. After all, we are all elected representatives and we are all doing the same job."
"This is why I believe that if we vote for a reasonable text tomorrow, we shall prove the strength of our conviction, the political strength we acquired at Amsterdam."
"I trust, Mr President, that we shall indeed be able to do so."
"Mr President, this report is, in my group's view, of the utmost importance in the development of the democratic legitimacy and the credibility of this House."
"Of course, it should not be so."
"We should be judged here on the way we carry out our functions, to legislate, to monitor the work of the Commission and the Council and to set the budget of the Union."
"Sadly, that function, which I believe has been developed and carried out in a constructive and progressive manner during this parliamentary term, has been obscured by a barrage of criticism in all our countries in recent years."
"That criticism which reaches a crescendo in our press with monotonous regularity centres on the system of allowances and expenses accruing to Members of this House."
"I want to pay tribute to the two Presidents of our Parliament during this parliamentary term."
"Firstly, Klaus Hänsch and now José Maria Gil-Robles have worked to introduce the reforms necessary to restore to this House and its Members a degree of dignity and public acceptability."
"This is the first time I have taken the floor for my group on this issue in this chamber."
"In the last four and a half years I have been engaged in a continuous round of discussions within my own group and with my counterparts in the other groups of this House to ensure that we can now take the fundamental decisions necessary to solve this problem."
"This, in my view, represents the last opportunity in this parliamentary term to end, once and for all, this most damaging public vilification."
"I for one hope passionately that tomorrow this House will adopt an appropriate package of reforms."
"We all know that there will be some out there who will argue that whatever we do it will not be enough."
"Sadly, there are some in this House who, over recent years, have deliberately and dishonestly added to the debate by misrepresenting and misreporting detail and motivation."
"Let us therefore do what we believe is right, what we believe is defensible and what we believe our citizens will see as reasonable."
"Let us also be entirely open."
"It is clear that the issue of the expenses regime could not be solved until we also dealt with the inequality of Members' salaries."
"The gross disparity between the salaries of Members doing identical jobs in equally trying circumstances in terms of travel, hours, inconvenience, the disruption of family life and so on, is simply not acceptable. It was of critical importance, therefore, that the intergovernmental conference in Amsterdam in June of last year included a request that the European Parliament bring forward a proposal for a Members' Statute."
"The Rothley report is our response to that request."
"In my group's view it is not acceptable to propose a Members' Statute which simply pulls together the varying conditions, immunities and privileges of the 15 national parliaments of the European Union, collates them and then calls the result a statute for Members of the European Parliament."
"If this statute is to have some integrity and credibility it must look at the role of a Member of the European Parliament."
"We must define a statute which is appropriate for the work we do, the environment in which we work, the travel which is an integral part of our job and the incompatibilities which result."
"I want to congratulate Mr Rothley for the extremely effective job he has done in this respect."
"I must say that there is probably no single Member in this House who will be satisfied with every aspect of Mr Rothley's proposals and I conclude therefore that he has got it about right."
"We cannot dodge the important issue of a Member's salary so I propose to deal with it now."
"It is simply a fact that Members of this House should be paid the same salary."
"In any similar environment with working colleagues coming together it would not be acceptable that salaries with such diversities are commonplace."
"It runs counter to all logic and common sense and lies at the base of all our problems."
"The big question has been just what is an appropriate salary for MEPs?"
"Mr Rothley's average of the salary of all our national parliamentarians is an ingenious solution."
"It is not by any means the highest salary to be found amongst national parliaments nor the highest salary we could have proposed."
"Yet it represents an appropriate salary."
"It has the virtue of being transparent and understandable and my group rejects other formulations as being opaque and opening up the criticism that we are manoeuvring for some super, inflated wage."
"In order to facilitate the clear problems for those colleagues who would suffer a substantial loss of salary under this system Mr Rothley proposes a transitional period, whereby in the next parliamentary term colleagues who are reelected can choose either the new salary or an existing one."
"While some colleagues are unhappy with that transitional phase, and I put myself in that category, it has to be recognised that we are talking in terms of a considerable downward movement of some Members' personal income."
"Such a transitional period would at least give them the ability to plan their future."
"New Members will of course enter this parliament under the new system immediately."
"The report proposes that salary should be subject to Community rates of taxation."
"This is a controversial proposal which I believe divides most groups in this House, and mine is no exception."
"Many Members feel that they wish to continue to pay the same tax rates as those fellow-citizens whom they represent."
"Others feel that they will be receiving a European salary and are entitled like others employed directly by the European Union to pay European Union tax rates."
"I think this one will come out in the wash, ie it is difficult to predict what the result of the vote in this House will be on this issue."
"The other side of the coin of a single salary is a system of reimbursement of travel costs based on actual expenditure."
"For me this is fundamental."
"I cannot accept that we adopt a common salary and in the same breath continue to allow an expenses regime which is based on anything other than actual cost."
"I have no doubt that such a proposal would be entirely unacceptable to our citizens, our voters and indeed to our governments."
"Mr Rothley's proposals in this respect are excellent and I hope they will be supported."
"The compromise amendment tabled by my group and the Liberal Group with the rapporteur's active support, I believe, adds even greater transparency and clarity to this issue and I hope that it will command support."
"The other and major section of this draft Statute is that of the incompatibilities and other elements which define our rights and responsibilities, our mandate and independence as Members of Parliament."
"A series of amendments in the names of many groups, mine amongst them, have been tabled which add balance to the report and I hope they too will be adopted."
"If tomorrow we succeed in producing a draft statute we will have taken a first and major step to solve this long running and open sore."
"It will then be up to the Council to acknowledge the commitment of the Parliament and its Members, to take the very tough decisions which I hope we will do tomorrow."
"It will then be up to the Council to indicate that they are prepared to give the green light to the next stage, ie detailed interinstitutional negotiations so that a statute can become a reality before the European elections in June of next year."
"Time is short."
"Consensus on an issue of this sort is extraordinarily difficult to secure."
"We will tomorrow, I hope, secure the majority we need."
"Let us hope that in Vienna the Council can do likewise."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, over the past few weeks, the report by our colleague Mr Willi Rothley has caused much ink and many words to flow."
"But what should surprise us most yet has been passed over almost in complete silence, is the fact that for almost twenty years now MEPs - who are elected by universal suffrage as everyone knows - have been waiting in vain for a common statute."
"Commissioners have a statute, the judges at the Court of Justice, the advisers to the Court of Auditors, the Ombudsman - thanks to our efforts - our officials and, of course, the members of our national parliaments all have a statute but the Council does not deem it necessary for an MEP to have one."
"Nonetheless, if ever there was a situation which was so complex that it needed appropriate measures to be taken from the outset, it is that of the MEP."
"The reality for MEPs is indeed complex in many respects."
"Their parliamentary allowances are aligned with those of their national colleagues but, as everyone knows, the differences according to nationality range from the same amount to triple the amount - not to mention the substantial differences in tax systems."
"This unfairness is compounded by the fact that members of national parliaments in some Member States - on paper the lowest paid in the Union - receive direct compensation in their country which their European counterparts are not entitled to."
"The second element of this diverse and complex reality is that of distance."
"Some colleagues live close to our places of work - Brussels and Strasbourg - and some are even on site."
"Others, in contrast, live on the periphery and spend a day or even longer travelling to these places, sometimes having to use several forms of transport."
"Also, the lack of a common electoral system - and we are awaiting the results of the report from our colleague Mr Anastassopoulos on this - leads to further injustices."
"Some of our colleagues are elected representatives in Member States whose size allows them to travel around relatively easily to visit their constituents."
"Other colleagues are elected representatives in vast constituencies where they have to be particularly thorough on the election trail because they also face a preferential system."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should simply like to say to those who have avidly studied this matter for some time now that they would gain more respect if they were sufficiently objective to take the realities of the life of an MEP into account."
"But perhaps this is too much to ask from those who clearly still aim to discredit MEPs systematically."
"Every person in this House would sincerely like to see transparency in all expenses payments."
"Every person is also aware - as Mrs Green said a few moments ago - that the disparities I have highlighted cannot be tolerated amongst colleagues who sit on the same benches and who do a job that is often exhausting but which, unfortunately, is only appreciated by those in the know because of the lack of media coverage of their work."
"Every one of us has reached the conclusion that only a common statute for Members would let us respond to the demand for both transparency and equality, which go hand in hand."
"This is the reason why - I have almost finished, Mr President - I am delighted that the Council has finally agreed to incorporate the principle of a statute in the Amsterdam Treaty."
"I should like to congratulate our President, Mr José-María Gil-Robles, for having achieved this."
"I am very pleased that the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights and its rapporteur worked towards this, along with the PPE Group."
"And I should like to thank those colleagues who actively cooperated in the deliberations of the working party we set up."
"I hope that, tomorrow, we will vote through a text on which there is the greatest possible consensus and that in adopting it later the Council will at last both accept its responsibilities and strengthen the dignity of our institution."
"Mr President, my group attaches the highest priority to this report and to the work done by our colleague Mr Rothley."
"We do so for political and institutional and not for personal reasons because some will gain and some will lose under this system."
"Frankly, if we were to be paid nothing there are some begrudgers and commentators who would still raise questions."
"We are also acknowledging that this Parliament has been dogged constantly by debilitating, negative publicity especially on the issue of allowances and Members' expenses."
"It is damaging our credibility."
"It is reducing our legitimacy in the eyes of citizens and we have to fight back."
"Too often many of us scramble to defend the system that we really do not believe in and for some of us is really indefensible."
"Our current system is complex and reflects the fact that the issue was fudged 20 years ago with direct elections."
"We now have the power of Amsterdam and I am pleased to see that with an accelerated pace we have responded to the challenge of the Cardiff conclusions."
"I hope tomorrow that we will, in a final vote, deliver a very strong message from this House into the hands of our President to respond to the challenge of Cardiff to say we have listened, we have paid attention and the ball is now firmly in the Council's court."
"In particular I congratulate the rapporteur."
"Many thought this could not be done and certainly could not be done in the timescale."
"He has done it."
"He has done it with the colleagues and the Committee of Legal Affairs."
"I would also congratulate my own colleague, Willy De Clercq for his role in chairing that."
"On the detail, briefly, my group wishes to add dimensions other than the economic and that now is clearly a matter of consensus."
"My group wishes to support the final vote of the Statute, even if there are things in it we would have preferred to see otherwise, because we want to get the message over."
"My group will support the explicit salary that is referred to by the rapporteur and the majority of my group will support the European tax conclusion."
"Overall we believe in equal work for pay of equal value."
"There are other details but I will skip them."
"Ultimately we support this draft because it gives us the capacity as politicians before our electorate, before the next election, I hope, to shift the focus from the politics of envy, from the politics of allowances and expenses, to the politics of the Union itself, which is our vocation and which is our mission."
"To advance that, I have already initiated a round of meetings through my group with senior Members of the Council because they are now the ones, I hope from tomorrow, who must bear their responsibility to help us to rid ourselves of a yoke that for too long we have been stuck with."
"Mr President, I speak today on behalf of my group with regard to the proposal put before this House."
"At the outset I want to pay a very particular and special tribute to our rapporteur, Mr Rothley, who had a very difficult task and who has come forward with his own, honest opinion with regard to what would be achievable in the overall context."
"Unfortunately, I do not agree fully with what he has written in his report."
"However, I can state at the outset that my group fully supports the idea of having a common statute for Members and for putting forward a motion for a resolution containing a proposal for a common statute."
"Where we diverge somewhat, is with regard to what should actually be in that final resolution and draft Statute."
"On the question of principle, no Member of this House surely has so little respect for him or herself that they feel they should not be paid a proper salary at a level common to each and every one of us."
"Unfortunately, due to errors in the past, and due to a lack of political will in the past, not by Members of this House, but by the Council, we have failed to get agreement with regard to that common salary and common situation."
"There has been much negative publicity foisted on this House, some of it generated from Members within this House for their own political gain and political beliefs and some from former Members who have attacked the parliament to gain themselves a higher national profile for cabinet positions and so on."
"So we must show respect for ourselves by being willing first and foremost to lay down guiding principles and secure the agreement of the Council and then decide on what the exact remuneration should be."
"By stating explicitly now what we feel the common average should be we allow the Council to say: that is too high."
"With a transitional period we would ensure that the inequalities will be continued and that Members who are reelected to this House, who presently earn two times or two and a half times what I earn at the moment will continue that inequality."
"If we truly believe and truly want a common statute there should be no transitional system."
"There are other actuarial methods and accounting methods for dealing with pension contributions, health questions and so on."
"Finally, I want to draw Members' attention to one other point."
"The voting list which will be put before us tomorrow has been drawn up in a very unusual way."
"We have on the voting list questions related to the draft Statute and questions related to the annex."
"But the amendments relating to the draft Statute and the points of principle of the draft Statute are put onto the annex side and the questions relating to the annex side are put on the draft Statute side."
"So we are not being given the right to determine first whether we agree with the principle or not and vote on all the amendments related to that."
"I would ask the services to please ensure that we are given a proper voting list tomorrow morning."
"Mr President, when commenting on the report on the draft Statute for Members of the European Parliament, one must first recognise that the rapporteur must have been working against a deadline."
"Nevertheless, he contrived to incorporate into his work - quite rightly, in my opinion - absolutely essential provisions to safeguard independence and transparency."
"However, in just the same way as I am bound to recognise the merits of his work and the areas where we agree, I am also bound to state where I differ. In particular, my differences centre on three main issues, namely the proposal for determining Members' salaries, recourse to external assessment to determine the latter and setting up optional transitional arrangements during the fifth legislative period."
"Why do I differ?"
"As regards the proposal for Members' salaries, I accept the rapporteur's view on the need to achieve equal treatment. However, it must be borne in mind that in some Member States, implementation of his methods will result in the return of inequalities between Members of the European Parliament and Members of national parliaments."
"Concerning external assessment, it does not seem appropriate to assess Parliament's operation by applying business standards, because Parliament is not a business."
"Resorting to external assessment in this way may be interpreted as an attempt to avoid responsibility for the salary determined."
"Finally, in connection with the transitional arrangements, I differ because, as I see it, the same status, in this case that of a directly elected parliamentarian, can bring with it different rights."
"In conclusion, I should like to make it clear that although I recognise the obvious merits of this report, I could not vote in its favour unless the amendments concerning the issues I mentioned are adopted"
"Mr President, the worst thing which can happen to us, ladies and gentlemen, is to muddle on with the existing arrangement, which is untenable because it leads to a different income for the same work and is also tied to laughable travel expenses which provide some Members with a second and third income on which they pay not a cent in tax."
"That is indefensible."
"Let us now push for a good and decent system."
"So I hope Mr Rothley's proposal is adopted and that average earnings will be the model, because it would not make sense to hide behind a percentage of something else, it would make no sense and it would be cowardly, and I hope too that immunity and incompatibility will be part of the Statute."
"There are of course a few points in it which we shall find hard to bear, but we are prepared to accept those in the circumstances in order to escape from the bad system we have at present, for example the transitional period, the fact that we are still making the reimbursement of travel expenses conditional on approval of the Statute, and the voluntary supplementary pension."
"I hope in any event that we shall get this settled tomorrow, and then perhaps we shall be able to use the shower cubicles and wash off the mud."
"Mr President, the great virtue of Mr Rothley's report is that it exists at all."
"There will doubtless be quite a debate on it, and we too have one or two comments."
"On behalf of our group, we wish to put ourselves firmly alongside those who favour a common European statute for Members of the European Parliament, simply out of respect for the parliamentary office we hold and which our successors will hold after us."
"We are convinced that the European Parliament has an image problem, but we believe the Council must at last understand the necessity of applying once and for all this principle of equal pay for equal work, not least in the case of the European Parliament."
"Our group also feels that the enacting of a statute of this kind is a clear manifestation of the desire for European integration and of the great symbolic significance which a European Parliament can have, a real parliament acting as the cornerstone of European unity and as a symbol."
"We therefore think that a transparent arrangement is needed which is based on reimbursement of the actual costs incurred and which precludes the possibility of abuse."
"One wonders - and a number of members of our group have asked the question, Mr Rothley - whether everything needed to be set out in so much detail in the report, or whether a few things might not have been covered in an annex."
"On the other hand, we fully appreciate that there must be no doubt concerning the basic salary, and an average of the kind you propose is acceptable to many of our group's members, although it must be linked to a system of European tax rules, because otherwise you will have equal pay but inequality again due to different national rules on tax."
"Lastly, we cannot agree to a transitional arrangement."
"I appreciate that you put that in for reasons of pragmatism, but we think in principle that anyone running for European office next time should do so in full awareness of the situation and acceptance of the new Statute."
"On supplementary pensions, you have made three proposals."
"Some of us, myself included, really want these provisions on supplementary pensions to be left out."
"We would prefer to see nothing regulated and paid by the European Parliament, but instead a proper social statute, of the kind you suggest, forming part of the Statute as a matter of course."
"Mr President, to us and to every Member of the European Parliament, it is not the money which matters most."
"European parliamentary office is an important office."
"It will need to be more important still in future."
"The power of this Parliament needs to grow, and its lack of a statute has certainly held it back in the past."
"We hope the choice we make tomorrow will be a common choice for a common statute, and that notwithstanding our differing opinions we shall prove that this choice, which is made out of principle, is the right one."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, here we are meeting to discuss our future statute at a Brussels mini-session on a Wednesday evening at 9 p.m. with no public present."
"What a wonderful example of transparency and democratic legitimacy we are setting at the end of what has been an exceptional procedure - and I am not even talking about the astonishing casualness which you have demonstrated, Mr President, with regard to the Rules."
"On three occasions during this procedure it has been necessary for the Conference of Presidents to intervene."
"It first intervened to authorise what is and what can be nothing but an own-initiative report, on the basis of Rule 148."
"It then intervened to impose a rushed timetable, marked in particular by an extraordinary meeting of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights - a six hour meeting held in Strasbourg on 17 November."
"Lastly, it intervened to correct - literally - the report by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights in an exceptional meeting held here last Wednesday at 8 p.m."
"I might add that several meetings of the secretaries-general have been given over to this report."
"Why such urgency?"
"Why such attention?"
"Why such concern amongst the group chairmen?"
"Because, ladies and gentlemen, it was absolutely essential that a text be drawn up at all costs, no matter what its contents, before the Vienna summit."
"Because the ball had to be thrown back into the Council's court to hide our own inability to change the current system for reimbursing travel expenses - a system quite rightly criticised because it is shocking - and to make the Council take responsibility for the status quo ."
"This is what we are being asked to do, and we are doing it by flouting rules, by applying a Treaty which has not been ratified and by adding to texts of the highest legal level."
"We are doing it by failing to exercise our future powers."
"A proper statute should cover the different requirements which apply to Members. A proper statute should not only address financial matters, of course, but also incompatibilities, privileges and allowances, and rules of conduct."
"A proper statute should provide a legal basis - which currently does not exist - for the system for reimbursing expenses and paying allowances for the exercise of office, and should also give this system the transparency it is sorely lacking."
"Such was the aim of the draft Statute that we tabled in Amendment No 106."
"In place of this, the draft from the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights is a collection of incoherent, outrageous and ridiculous measures."
"The incoherency arises from stating, in recital A, that any difference in the Statute for Members on grounds of nationality shall be prohibited, yet it also refers to national systems when these are more beneficial."
"The outrage lies in mentioning the need to avoid difficult personal situations and to preserve already acquired rights, or those being acquired, by implementing a transitional system and a dual scale for salaries."
"No one is forcing Members to stand again and, ladies and gentlemen of the Socialist or Social-Democrat Groups, as you claim to be, you are simply trying to obtain something which is denied to employees in companies in your respective countries."
"Lastly, the ridiculous nature of this statute lies in stating that the parliamentary allowance will be paid in advance, to prepare for any eventuality."
"As a general rule, all work merits pay but, in this case, all pay merits work."
"This statute will not protect Parliament's image."
"I have never seen such a pathetic display of national sentiment, such a display of willingness to take one's personal situation into account."
"The European Parliament has never seemed to me so far removed from the concerns of public opinion."
"Mr President, this House is about to perform an act of great courage and far-sightedness."
"It has been our ambition for some time - and it might now come about at last - to have a statute laying down the rights and obligations of Members of the European Parliament, the nature and prerogatives of their mandate, and the precise means of exercising it."
"This has been made possible by the Amsterdam Treaty which, although not yet in force, is the frame of reference for our discussion and for the expeditious, enthusiastic work of the rapporteur, Mr Rothley, who is a past master with difficult dossiers."
"We owe it to ourselves to perform this act."
"The resolution on a uniform electoral system and the blueprint contained in it - the rapporteur was Mr Anastassopoulos - was likewise a significant step forward in highlighting the urgent need to endow Parliament with its own autonomy and hence with a form of democratic legitimacy, ensuring that it is no longer a gathering of national representatives but a forum which allows the peoples of Europe to have their say in a process inspired by solidarity and federalism."
"A uniform electoral system is a precondition if the work of all MEPs is to be comparable."
"What will the Council do about it?"
"That is by no means a peripheral question."
"We also owe it to public opinion, to the peoples of Europe, to take this decision."
"All too often our Parliament, or certain of its Members, have been the focus of malicious rumours, of disparaging and insidious campaigns by the press."
"Full transparency is therefore required about everything, not merely out of defensiveness but because there should be nothing to hide."
"Finally, this act of ours is a challenge to the Council and the Union's other institutions: they too must clarify the conditions under which not only political appointees but also officials of all grades perform their duties."
"Given that I agree with the overall structure of the texts being put forward here, I shall merely touch on certain points where I and other members of the Socialist Group would like to see additions or express doubts or dissent."
"The first of these is the temporary nature of the provisions outlined, but I shall not dwell on this point."
"Next, it would be useful to investigate the incompatibilities more thoroughly, including not only that of exercising the office of member of a national parliament but also, for example, that of mayor of a city or community having more than 100 000 inhabitants."
"I know that this is a matter to be settled under electoral legislation, but it would nevertheless be helpful to offer some guidance in this respect, for example along the lines set out in Amendment No 89."
"Clearly the content of the annexes will have to become operational once the Statute itself has come into effect, in the light of the provisions contained in it, and will have to be implemented on more than just a mechanical basis."
"As far as Members' allowances are concerned, I do not think it right, even provisionally, to apply the criterion of a mathematical average of the allowances in force today - or whenever the sum is fixed - in the national parliaments."
"Why should the average of such dissimilar amounts, for duties so different from ours, miraculously produce a fair and acceptable result?"
"It would be preferable to link this calculation to allowances granted for the exercise of offices or duties in another European institution and to a deliberate, straightforward and carefully weighted assessment, equal for every one of us and subject to Community taxation: Amendment No 13 is very pertinent in this regard."
"A figure can be put on the amount - it is not true that this will not be specified - once the House has voted."
"My purpose in speaking frankly and openly here today is to attain a goal which none of us can underestimate."
"When casting our votes, let none of us lose sight of the sense of pride and dignity which must guide us in voicing the ideas and feelings of the European peoples."
"It is vital to cut through the demagogy, adverse propaganda and opportunistic moralising: we must be in a position to perform our difficult and complex work on a salary which is reasonable and equal for us all - for all MEPs, whose circumstances vary and who accept different degrees of inconvenience in performing the same duties."
"I really do mean what I say! I may not agree with Mr Rothley, but I admire him nonetheless, because he has shown himself capable of coping with the most difficult circumstances, tight deadlines and pressures from all and sundry."
"Our President does indeed have to take to the Vienna Council a document on which to negotiate."
"Yet in this case, as I stated this morning in our group, we have let ourselves down."
"We have been slow to deal with such an important issue which affects us directly, and we are in grave danger of mishandling it altogether."
"Of course we support the Statute."
"It has our full support."
"I very much fear, however, that what we are to vote on tomorrow is not in fact the Statute for Members of the European Parliament."
"What we are really voting on is the Members' payslip."
"What seems to be of prime importance is how much a Member will earn and what for."
"It is the only statute in existence to contain such an inordinate number of figures and details."
"That is not what transparency is all about."
"It is a travesty of transparency."
"There is no reason for the Statute to contain an annex which is an integral part of it."
"Rather, that annex, whilst referred to in the Statute in the appropriate way, should be regulated by Parliament itself at a later date, with the benefit of all necessary transparency."
"That is the legally correct procedure, and you, Mr Rothley, know that as well as I do."
"We do, however, have a good opportunity to improve the draft by means of amendments."
"Mr Rothley has been extraordinarily receptive with regard to these."
"Some issues are not really economic, but they are essential to the Statute, such as the transitional periods, taxation, pensions and incompatibilities."
"In addition, Mr President, we must make every effort to avoid an obvious risk: that the Statute may prove to be to the detriment of many of our colleagues."
"Having heralded the Statute, stressing its transparency, impartiality and solidarity, it would be absurd and contradictory to allow unfair and detrimental differences to arise."
"Once again, I stress the importance of taking advantage of the many amendments which do make sense and help to make the text more reasonable."
"We should not forget that we are regulating our future and that of our successors."
"God forbid that due to a misunderstanding of the nature of transparency, we produce legislation to be ashamed of, and which is not only unfavourable but also seriously detrimental to us."
"Mr President, tomorrow we shall be able to show that we are willing to play our part in achieving clarity and precision."
"Despite considerable resistance, the Liberal Group has managed to move the process forward so we can submit our proposal."
"I am delighted to note that this is the general view tonight, which was not the case when we began in July."
"We can therefore ask the Council to resolve the issue so that it can be removed from the agenda, which is no more than Europe deserves."
"I am glad that it looks as if there will be a broad majority tomorrow, and that everyone appears to be democratically minded enough to approve it."
"Our objective is a system with independent representatives, and one where we do not have an auction in which the lowest bidder wins."
"The transitional regime is reasonable in view of the fact that a considerable number of candidates have already decided whether or not they wish to participate."
"As we have mentioned, our group is split over taxation."
"I share the minority view that national tax regimes can continue to apply in the future."
"I think it is important for us to broadly accept this principle."
"Consequently, it is not up to us to decide this matter, but a valid decision is required by the next parliamentary term."
"I hope we will be able to support other reforms which we can decide for ourselves."
"Finally, I should like to say that there have been times when we have come up against the obduracy of the rapporteur, but on the other hand his tenacity has made it possible for us to discuss the proposal and put it to the vote tomorrow, and for this I should like to thank him."
"Mr President, since we are members elected by 15 nations to a supranational structure of states, should we not have a single statute?"
"Undoubtedly we should."
"However, perhaps over-concerned with the media, we are currently showing our inability to give the signal that the Council needs so that it can reach the unanimity that the European Parliament itself seems regrettably so far from achieving."
"The basic question is this: does a single statute necessarily mean a single salary?"
"Obviously not."
"Our position, which we reached after much consideration and with due respect for the opposite point of view, and which we announced quite clearly almost two years ago, is that our emoluments should refer to the country and the people we belong to and where we live."
"If the proposal is approved, the report would be taking the idea of allowing, albeit provisionally, different salaries for members of the same national origins to absurd lengths, particularly as we approach a single currency."
"Finally, on a subject that was a burning issue some time ago, perhaps we should take care not to moralise and stir up trouble about the cost of members' travel expenses, especially in the case of people who come to meetings from a very long way away."
"Smoke might get in people's eyes but there is no smoke without fire."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are many things in the European Union that are still far from European."
"This even applies to the European Parliament."
"The work of its Members is still governed by rules that were devised at a time when this House was merely a parliamentary assembly of MPs from the Member States."
"What we are planning now is nothing more or less than the Europeanisation of the pre-European conditions in which our parliamentary work is conducted."
"Our debates have shown to all and sundry that this proposal touches on some very raw nerves - on issues of social standards and individual circumstances and indeed on the broadest possible diversity of unique personal dilemmas."
"From where can we draw the strength we need for this step on the road to Europe?"
"The Treaty on European Union tells us."
"The European Parliament, it says, shall consist of representatives of the peoples of the States brought together in the Community."
"We are not simply representatives of the people, but representatives of the peoples."
"Anyone who does not know what that means would be well advised to come along to the Committee on Petitions, where he would see that our mandate is not to represent one people but rather all the peoples of the European Union."
"At the same time, however, we do represent a single people in that we represent the people of the Union, which now expects its Members of Parliament to take this step whereby they can establish their credentials as representatives of the peoples."
"Mr President, more than 20 years ago now, the Council undertook to draw up a statute for all Members of this Parliament."
"We never got one."
"That is not in itself so bad, because having a Community statute may nurture the idea that Parliament represents one people."
"But the European Union is made up of a rich diversity of different peoples."
"We are elected by the people of our own nation and must also bear in mind our national interest."
"However, the interim solution of being paid a salary by the Member State and expenses by Europe has resulted in disparity, an uneven picture marked by excessive reimbursement of expenses, the improper use and even abuse of expenses."
"While it is worrying that the media are far less interested in our debates than in our expenses, it is essentially right that they should attack these anomalies."
"If we are to clean up our act, there has to be an end to the situation in which the amount refunded for travel expenses is far greater than the actual costs incurred."
"Competition in air travel has meant that in many cases it is considerably cheaper to fly than to buy a full-fare rail ticket."
"Over shorter distances, certainly those served by fast rail links, Members of the European Parliament should set an example by using the train, not the plane."
"Clearly, the expenses paid must reflect that."
"Expenses for the use of one's own vehicle must be based on the objectively calculated total cost of a good and safe car, such as an official car."
"Mr President, we have been suggesting for years on our side that the expenses paid should on no account be greater than the actual cost incurred."
"The rapporteur's proposals now offer a cohesive framework for achieving all this."
"We shall support his proposals, together with those amendments which seek to reimburse costs in a thrifty and realistic way."
"We shall not support amendments which seek to add new bells and whistles to the system."
"The monthly salary is an altogether different matter."
"The rule is that each Member of the European Parliament gets the same as members of his own national parliament."
"As a Dutchman, I find it rather suspect that my national parliament has broken the link between the salaries paid to Dutch MEPs and those paid to its own members."
"The Netherlands short-changes us to the tune of some ECU 1 000 a month."
"This probably means that it is breaking the terms of the Treaty."
"A standardised salary is not our top priority in view of the national office we hold, even though the salary differentials between Member States which the rapporteur has highlighted are enormous and hard to justify."
"I imagine that in countries paying very low salaries, membership of the national parliament is not seen as a full-time job."
"But a Member of the European Parliament who takes his responsibilities seriously has a more than full-time job."
"I would guess that there is not one country which comes close to 45 weeks of meetings a year."
"So I do not think that combining membership of the European Parliament with another political office is compatible with the scale and scope of our work here."
"To sum up, I would commend to the House the set of amendments tabled by the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations."
"Should these not be approved, we shall vote as a next best solution for amendments which aim for thrift and follow the line taken by the rapporteur, who has made an honourable attempt to get us out of this hornet's nest."
"Mr President, after so many years we have come as far as this evening's debate on the Rothley report, in the sincere hope that we are approaching the beginning of the end."
"A common statute for Members of the European Parliament must finally be established."
"Some of us have not ceased fighting hard for that over the years."
"The reasons are very simple: the common Statute would put an end to the provocative inequalities that discriminate between Members."
"The basic principle of equal pay for equal work has been and is still being violated in the European Parliament's own house, and our efforts to restore a certain balance have created other problems and exposed us to perfidious and sometimes malicious attacks."
"The need for solutions free from serious drawbacks has constantly become more urgent."
"With that rationale, the Bureau of the European Parliament, at the time of Egon Klepsch and with as rapporteurs the then President of the College of Quaestors, the Belgian socialist Ernst Glynn and your present speaker, asked the Council to establish a common statute and proposed to equate MEPs with European judges, as happens in several Member States of the European Union."
"The Council, however, rejected our proposal and since then the problem has remained outstanding."
"Last year it was necessary, on the initiative of the current President Mr Gil-Robles, to add a new provision to the Treaty of Amsterdam currently being ratified, to restate and encourage reconsideration of the problem."
"Following the arguments of the David Martin working group, the report by Mr Willi Rothley attempts to propose solutions."
"Our esteemed German colleague has taken a lot of trouble to come up with some entirely new proposals, and it is also true that he has worked under tremendous time pressure so that we would be able to table a first draft at the Vienna summit."
"But I believe that despite this pressure, he should show still greater flexibility in the search for solutions that will be more widely acceptable."
"Where such serious issues are concerned, I am not alone in thinking that we should not submit proposals based on opportunistic majorities of just a few votes, and I hope that in the voting tomorrow that phenomenon will be rejected."
"With the Council's agreement, the common Statute ought to be established soon, but even at this late stage there are some things which must be made clear once and for all."
"Some of us have fought for years for this common statute, but it was never our aim to sacrifice everything in order to achieve a common statute at any price."
"There is a limit beyond which there can be no obligation on our part, no discount and no compromise."
"It is a matter of protecting our dignity, which is not open to debate or negotiation, and the Council must understand that."
"No malicious attack by the media, which some people are trying to orchestrate, must divert us from that principle."
"We must not claim equality with category B2 Community officials, agreeable though they may be in other respects."
"And I hope Mr Rothley will forgive us for disagreeing with his way of thinking and preferring the rationale of the amendment by the European People's Party."
"The Council too should not be misled about this for any reasons, on any pretexts or by any excuses."
"We have fought for reforms a great deal in the European Parliament and have promoted important ones in recent years, not because we give way to the pressure of often perfidious attacks by the media, but because we believe in the need for radical reforms."
"I believe that as a democratic body, it is our duty to show particular sensitivity towards any criticism offered in good faith."
"Likewise, however, we must disregard attacks motivated by anti-European sentiments which aspire to discredit the European Parliament and the European Union's other institutional bodies."
"No attempt to terrorise us must be allowed to divert us from our course, and we cannot conceal the fact that we particularly regret that a few of our colleagues have contributed to those attacks, courting popularity by denouncing their fellow parliamentarians and putting themselves forward as the only incorruptible ones, to ensure their re-election."
"Mr President, we want the common Statute, but not a demeaning one which will offend our dignity."
"And we are prepared to continue our fight unwaveringly on that basis."
"Mr President, we are elected as Members of Parliament for constituencies in our respective countries whose voters we represent."
"I therefore do not see any need to replace national rules relating to our terms of employment with a common statute."
"The usual argument for this proposal is that we should have the same conditions, for example as regards salary."
"Under the terms of the proposal, our conditions would continue to be different."
"However, many of us would receive a large pay rise, which would be totally unjustified."
"There is no good reason why we should be paid more than members of our national parliaments."
"The proposal that we should have a special, very low EU tax is even more unwarranted."
"Like other high income earners, we should pay tax where we live."
"I trust that anyone who votes for the proposal on an EU tax will not oppose tax dumping on other occasions."
"After all, what is this proposal if not an excuse for us, a highly privileged group, to give ourselves still more perks?"
"Mr President, according to the Treaty, the EU is an association of 15 independent states."
"Members of the European Parliament represent voters in their own Member State, and no other."
"It therefore goes without saying that salaries should be determined by individual Member States in accordance with national rules, and that tax should be paid where one lives, even if one is a Member of Parliament."
"However, the significance of this report lies in the institutional changes that would take place as a result of the Statute, and which would mean that the ties between Members of the European Parliament and their electorates and national parliaments would be weakened and that we would end up rather like satellites."
"Surely the dissatisfaction among Members over salaries is just a simple matter of envy?"
"None of us is on the breadline yet!"
"This dissatisfaction has now become a pretext for introducing a statute that will mean a high salary, taxation and pension, all of them regulated by the EU."
"As for travel allowances and the criticism levelled against them, this problem would have been resolved long ago had Parliament's Bureau so desired."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the rapporteur set about his task with the intention of solving a problem, not with the intention of getting rid of a problem."
"In September, he submitted a working paper to the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights containing a list of the subjects that should be discussed in an external study he was proposing which would evaluate the tasks undertaken by the Members of the European Parliament."
"Moreover, the results of the study were to be on the table in three months, after the conclusion and ratification of the Treaty."
"Three months have not yet passed since the working paper was presented."
"Although there is no study on the table, we are planning to adopt a complete Members' statute already, with no means of knowing whether the Amsterdam Treaty - without which, of course, the Statute would have no legal basis - will have entered into force before the end of the present parliamentary term in May."
"Several times in the course of this debate, I have protested against this type of summary procedure, but to no avail."
"I shall go along with this, but I cannot escape the feeling, or indeed the conviction, that we are shelving the problem instead of solving it."
"Maximum transparency for all arrangements relating to the Statute - that is our foremost principle, as Mr Fabre-Aubrespy has already said."
"The time of day, or rather night, that has been chosen for the discussion of this report in the European Parliament, a time when the public are automatically excluded, as it were, speaks volumes."
"Is this our idea of transparency, or is this birth supposed to take place in secret?"
"In this respect too, I have to conclude that we do not really want to solve the problem but only to rid ourselves of it."
"For all that, I recognise unreservedly that a common European statute will be of immense value in lending weight to the European Parliament."
"It is a very clear step towards closer integration."
"Above all, it strengthens the democratic legitimacy of the European Parliament."
"Nevertheless, it is important that such a statute should be adopted by an emphatic majority."
"We should be seeking an absolute majority, because it would be illogical for us to make do with a smaller majority while requiring an absolute majority for any amendment, however insignificant, to the Rules of Procedure."
"I do not entirely understand why the rapporteur responded so vehemently to the proposal by some Members that our remuneration should be based on a judge's salary."
"In my view there is more cunning in the proposal to use the average salary."
"It is certainly the line of least resistance, but above all it is a cunning ploy."
"To me, however, the most important thing at the end of the day is that we should have an appropriate solution that we can explain to everyone - to ourselves and to the general public."
"Let me offer my sincere thanks to the rapporteur for his endeavour in pursuit of this goal."
"His efforts deserve our gratitude."
"Mr President, as we consider any report or legal act, we must bear in mind that this House represents the citizens of Europe, and also that we are a legislative body."
"As representatives of the citizens of Europe, we have a duty to our constituents."
"As legislators, we are called upon to create an appropriate legal act, one that is legally sound and wellconceived."
"The first of these considerations is particularly pertinent in this case."
"It is abundantly clear that public opinion wishes the European Parliament to adopt a common statute for its Members. Such a statute must be based on the principle of equality of all Members, and must put an end to all arrangements which are the legacy of institutionalised inequalities."
"Mr President, the courage and single-mindedness displayed by the rapporteur as he dealt with this issue deserves special mention. He did not hide behind the legal framework, the huge raft of rights and duties enshrined in a statute."
"I am bound to say that I have engaged in a good deal of debate with the rapporteur, but he has consistently displayed a constructive attitude, even though we have not reached agreement on certain issues."
"I should like my admiration for him and for the courage he has shown to go on record."
"Turning first to the legal aspects, it has been mentioned that the Treaty of Amsterdam has not come into effect."
"True, but that need not prevent us from undertaking the necessary preparatory work to enable the procedure to be concluded according to plan and in cooperation with the Council, once the Treaty of Amsterdam does come into effect. I have every confidence that it will."
"Secondly, it has been claimed that the transitional arrangements create transitional inequality - to quote Mr Rothley. It is envisaged that Members will be able to choose different arrangements during the coming legislature."
"As legislators, however, we should be well aware that any significant legislative change entails transitional arrangements which may be quite different from what will finally be put in place. This is true of any of our legal systems and also, of course, of the Community system."
"There are therefore no grounds for criticising Mr Rothley's approach on this point."
"One might or might not agree with him, but such arrangements are common practice in any major legislative reform like this one."
"As regards the average salary, I supported this idea from the start, for the very good reason that, as I stated at the time and reiterate today, I can think of no better approach."
"On this point I disagree with some colleagues who believe it would be better to establish a comparison with high-ranking civil servants."
"I do not agree."
"As for the legal aspects, I differ considerably from the rapporteur on technical details."
"I wish him luck as he negotiates with the Council on these matters."
"I feel that there is scope for improvement on the legal aspects of certain issues, and I hope this will be achieved through the amendments."
"Mr President, I should like to conclude as I began, by expressing my admiration for the rapporteur and my gratitude for the work he has undertaken."
"Mr President, after all the fuss over the expenses and salaries of Members of the European Parliament, tomorrow looks like being a good day."
"What has been impossible for years - the same salary for all MEPs irrespective of nationality, plus a rigorous system for refunding expenses which is proof against abuse - looks like happening at last after 20 years."
"That is a good thing, because this disparity in earnings and the abuse of expenses has well and truly poisoned the atmosphere in and around Parliament."
"I must pay tribute here to Mr Rothley, who has done a fine job in bringing the complex task of producing a uniform statute to completion."
"I must also echo Mrs Green in her compliments to Mr Gil-Robles and former President Hänsch."
"It is they who got this thing moving, no one else, and though some may think it was other MEPs who did so, they were the ones, and they too deserve our congratulations."
"Nevertheless, I have to highlight a few points on behalf of the Dutch CDA delegation, because we wish to mark out one or two lines of thought in our group in what will be a free vote."
"We are in favour of the proposal for a uniform salary, based on an average of current national salaries."
"We find that principle more important than the old suggestion of a certain percentage of the salary of a judge at the European Court."
"So we support Mr Rothley there."
"We agree with the option of allowing the old system to continue for five years in the case of Members who have been in it for years."
"We think that is a reasonable way of dealing with the old system."
"And we think it is a good thing that the voluntary supplementary pension is being phased out."
"Whether that happens in 1999 or 2004 is a personal choice."
"But it is good that it should not continue for longer than it needs to."
"As regards taxation, we are in favour of levying European taxes on a European system and national taxes on national systems."
"Lastly, on the subject of travel expenses we have always favoured a rigorous system for repayment of travel and subsistence costs."
"We are glad that this is at last being sorted out."
"Tomorrow is an important day, and I sincerely hope that the Rothley report will be approved by a large majority, so that we can at last draw a line under these sordid discussions."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as many colleagues have said, the lack of a Members' statute has been noticeable for at least 20 years, so a proposal for one is most welcome."
"Yet in my opinion, although I acknowledge Mr Rothley's deep commitment, the draft is unsatisfactory because it confuses the question of an MEP's status - a vast and complex topic, involving rights and obligations - with that of his emoluments."
"This is a very narrow approach, which I believe is unprecedented in the statutes of parliamentarians around the world."
"What is more, despite focusing solely on economic problems in the main, the draft sets out to solve these by taking an average of the allowances currently fixed by the individual national governments."
"Personally, I believe that it would be fairer to link MEPs' allowances to those of another Community regime, and at the same time for us in this House, together with the other institutions, to advocate an across-the-board reduction in all Community salaries, which are too high in objective terms."
"But on this issue, raised by myself and other colleagues back in 1995, nothing has been done and nothing is likely to be done."
"Let me finally make one other point: the proposed reform leaves intact the existing - and controversial - voluntary fund for Members' supplementary pensions, financed mainly from the public purse but managed privately in a haphazard way, to put it mildly."
"I criticised this disgraceful state of affairs in 1995 when I realised how the fund operated, and withdrew from it along with other colleagues."
"I now regret that this opportunity has not been grasped to abolish the fund or to stipulate that Members wishing to belong to it must finance it entirely from their own pockets."
"Thank you, Mr Florio."
"Before I close the debate, Mr Fabre-Aubrespy has asked to raise a point of order."
"Mr President, I will speak for just one minute, pursuant to Rules 19 and 22 of the Rules of Procedure, which also define your duties as President of the sitting and the duties of the Bureau."
"During this debate, I have heard officials being called into question and Mr Anastassopoulos, the Vice-President, with whom I have discussed this issue - which is why I am saying it in public - mentioned the possibility of bringing the system for reimbursing Members into line with that for officials, and said that this was detrimental to Parliament's dignity."
"I must say that I was shocked by this statement and I must ask you, in my capacity as a Member of the Bureau which is responsible for the administrative organisation of Parliament's work, to reassure our officials of the esteem in which their Members hold them."
"There are countries where ministers and heads of state have salaries defined in relation to their civil servants' salaries."
"I am not in favour of this system, but I find that to say that bringing Members' salaries into line with officials' salaries would harm Parliament's dignity is an insult to these officials, who help us and who serve everyone's interests."
"Thank you, Mr Fabre-Aubrespy."
"What you have said will be recorded in the Verbatim Report of Proceedings and also in the Minutes."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m."
"External representation of Euro"
"The next item is the report (A4-0439/98) by Mr Herman, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the proposal for a Council Decision on the representation and position taking of the Community at international level in the context of economic and monetary union (COM(98)0637 - C4-0638/98)."
"I give the floor to the rapporteur, Mr Herman."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, who should represent the euro externally?"
"It would seem that this controversial question that Parliament has already raised on several occasions has just been answered with a compromise reached yesterday, without waiting for Parliament's opinion."
"Who should speak for the euro?"
"It should, of course, be the President of the European Central Bank, as there will only be one monetary policy and, this being the case, we may ask what role the governors of national banks can still play in any sort of international body as they no longer have any say in this matter."
"But the union we have is an economic and monetary one."
"Who, therefore, will represent the economic side of monetary union?"
"Who is in the best position to do so?"
"According to the Council, the President of the Council is in the best position as it is the Council that must ensure that economic policies are coordinated."
"Let us challenge this statement."
"If we were entirely dependent on the Council for ensuring economic coordination, there would never be any economic coordination."
"The ministers who sit in the Council of Ministers defend their national policy first and foremost."
"That is their role, they are elected to do so, they are paid to do so and none of them has any reason to defend the common interest."
"It is not their job."
"What is more, the Council is an intermittent institution."
"The President of the Council is appointed every six months, and there are major differences between successive presidencies."
"A President barely has the time to get to know the matters in hand before having to give way to his successor, who must also begin the learning process from scratch."
"When the Union is represented by the Council in difficult negotiations, the result is disastrous, as we can see by looking back at past experiences."
"When the Commission is not leading the talks - as we saw in Geneva and have seen elsewhere - the outcome is deplorable because, in the Council, an agreement is often reached according to the lowest common denominator."
"Also, the President of the Council often finds it difficult to split his duties as President and as a national leader. I will only give one example."
"Mr Oskar Lafontaine will be the next President of the ECOFIN Council."
"Mr Lafontaine is now well-known the world over for the relatively inopportune and untimely statements he has made on a range of issues, which do not reflect the common position in any way."
"I do not wish to accuse Mr Lafontaine of being schizophrenic, but when he goes to Washington to speak for the Community, the language he uses will inevitably be different from that which he uses as Minister of Finance in Germany. This will not increase the credit, or in any case the credibility, of monetary union in the eyes of the world's major financiers and finance ministers."
"This is why I believe that the Council's position is not the best on this occasion, based as it is on restricted formal arguments."
"I believe that it would have been of more use to make the Commission the representative of the common interest, as that is its permanent and institutional role."
"What is more, this would provide continuity in the issues being dealt with."
"Therefore, I am most disappointed that these common sense arguments - which also conform with the spirit of the Treaty - have not been acknowledged and that we are heading towards a compromise where the Commission will play a minor technical assistance role as an observer."
"It will be there to provide information for ministers who speak for the Community and nothing more."
"I regret this decision."
"I hope that reality will win through and that continuity and the severity of international life will show that we will only obtain the best results by increasing the Commission's powers in this field."
"Mr President, since the Maastricht Treaty was so vague, this definition is all the more important since it has enabled the European Union to be properly represented internationally."
"Fernand Herman's report is a worthwhile contribution on this issue."
"Of course, our strategy in relation to the IMF needs to be considered at a later stage."
"Under the terms of its statutes there can clearly only be national representations, but that makes it vital for the EU to have a monitoring role at least."
"However, in the future thought should be given to whether certain changes need to be made to these statutes. When it comes to IMF intervention in budget policy, which would continue to be decided by the Member States, we must not overlook the fact that the scale of our involvement is much larger."
"Apart from institutional doubts, we should nonetheless welcome the fact that we are sure about the policy to be pursued, ensuring the euro's credibility and stability by means of flexible policies and avoiding shocks with the very negative consequences that they would have."
"Let us hope, therefore, that recent changes of government, in particular in Germany - mentioned a little while ago by Mr Herman himself - do not lead to any change on this score. They might be tempted in all innocence and in the hope that it would be popular - but that popularity would be short-lived."
"Mr President, the introduction of the euro will have a major impact not only for EU citizens but also on the international monetary and financial system."
"The introduction of the euro will give the European Community a monetary presence that corresponds to its economic and commercial influence in the world economy."
"I regret that certain members of the new German Government are pursuing political headlines on tax issues and have given Eurosceptics a field day when sure-footedness and consensus are required at this vital time."
"It is essential that the Community speak with one voice internationally where issues relating to EMU are discussed and decided."
"It is too serious an issue for distracting and divisive solo runs on taxation issues which are clearly in the domain of unanimity and national governments."
"There must be one voice and one position."
"The proposal for a Council decision provides that for issues relating to EMU the Community shall be represented at international level by the Council and the European Central Bank with the participation of the Commission."
"Each of these institutions has its own specific competitiveness."
"The changes brought about by the introduction of the euro will affect position-taking and representation at international level."
"We can support the proposal for a Council decision but my group does not believe that it is sensible."
"We support a role for the Commission in line with Mr Herman's proposals."
"The dawn of the euro is almost upon us and it is vital that we speak with one voice and that there should be continuity at international level as recommended by Mr Herman."
"Mr President, I wish to endorse the rapporteur's position most emphatically, because our group also feels strongly about this matter and not least because the report reflects the spirit and the substance of our endeavours to ensure that this European Union is properly represented."
"From that point of view, it is absolutely right that the European Union should be represented on international financial bodies not only by the European Central Bank and not only by the Council in the form of the eleven participating states, but also by the European Commission."
"The task of the European Commission is to serve as the engine of integration and the guardian of the Treaties."
"For that reason, the same arrangement must apply within the global financial system as in the global trading system."
"The Commission must play its special prominent role."
"That is what makes yesterday's decision by the Council of Finance Ministers so extremely regrettable."
"It does not pave the way for future decisions, because there is no guarantee that the European Union - even when it only comprises the participants in monetary union - will speak with one voice."
"That, however, must be our objective."
"We in the European Union have paid dearly for our failure to speak with one voice during the rounds of world trade negotiations."
"When it comes to the international financial system, a united front is absolutely imperative."
"The cause of democracy and integration would certainly be best served if we were to adopt the proposal made by the rapporteur, Mr Herman, and accord the European Commission its due place as a representative, and not as a subsidiary representative, of the European Union as well as of the euro area."
"Mr President, last night I sat in the House of Commons and I listened to the Chief Secretary of the Government of the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland."
"He said very plainly that his government would resist any attempt to take away the veto on taxation."
"We have heard the spokesmen of France and Germany this week make it clear that they want the veto to go and we are now on a collision course."
"This cannot help our economy, especially as it comes under more and more pressure."
"What has happened in the Far East could happen elsewhere tomorrow, even in the United States of America and in Europe."
"Today we are on a collision course."
"Let me make it clear that I have always believed that the future for this Union is in the cooperation of sovereign nation states and not in the incorporation of nation states into a single international superstate."
"Mr President, twelve months ago the euro-11 was set up as an informal grouping which was answerable to no one, it is true, but was not required to take any formal decisions either."
"We now find that the presidency of the euro-11 is to speak for Euroland in bodies like the G7 and IMF, and on visits to individual countries."
"Not only does this give a casual but powerful boost to the two-speed concept which the integration of Schengen into the Amsterdam Treaty is supposed to eliminate, but more importantly we see an intergovernmental model being introduced into what is the most far-reaching Community measure to date under the first pillar."
"In the second pillar, we are desperately seeking to give the Union's foreign policy a single face and a single voice at last with Mr or Mrs CFSP."
"At the same time, we are entrusting the external representation of economic and monetary union not to the Commission, the guardian of the Treaties and the executive arm, but to a Council presidency - changing every six months - of the euro-11, a body which does not officially exist and is accountable to no one."
"Something is fundamentally wrong here, ladies and gentlemen."
"EMU is coming off the rails here before it has even started."
"This is the price we are paying for the fact that too many decisions in Europe today are left to the narrow scrutiny of the finance ministers, under the prompting of the even narrower circles of the Monetary Committee."
"A single Euroland needs a single representation."
"But Henry Kissinger's call for just one European telephone number will not be met with a presidency which changes every six months."
"In practice, the Americans will telephone either the chairman of the Economic and Financial Committee, who does not change every six months, or one of the permanent members of the G7, although they will not know who that member is speaking for."
"If Euroland takes itself seriously in its commitment to acting responsibly, the number to ring should be that of European Commission."
"European coordination should happen as soon as possible, so that Europe really can speak with one voice."
"The Commission should refuse to go along with the current proposals of ECOFIN, whereby the Commission might give a helping hand to the presidency of the euro-11."
"It should withdraw its proposal too."
"No one can represent the European Union in the present-day G7."
"It would be better to disband it and start again from scratch with a G3."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the House for having included this item on the agenda."
"It comes at just the right time, that is to say just after the Council's decision and - this may well come as a surprise - I would personally like to thank the European Parliament for making such a valuable contribution and supporting the Commission's proposal."
"This was an important factor in the success of yesterday's meeting of the Council of Ministers for Economic and Financial Affairs."
"I will come back to that in a moment but the fact still remains that the Commission is grateful to you."
"The agreement reached yesterday is a satisfactory one."
"It is a political agreement, and it incorporates the basic principles of the Commission proposal on the Community's external representation of the euro, which will be tripartite in nature."
"Before going into detail on the content and form of this agreement, let me remind you of the objective."
"The objective and what is at stake is important as the euro must be given a voice so the Community can be present in the international monetary arena to defend its interests, to participate in managing and preventing crises and, on a more general level, to adapt the international monetary system."
"The euro will provide Europe with true monetary existence."
"Europe will also have a presence in the international arena which will better reflect its weight in economic matters."
"Let us discuss the form of the agreement."
"Firstly, it is a good agreement and to those who have expressed reservations I would say that, in this case, it is better to leave well alone."
"This is a transitional agreement, a realistic agreement, and it has been reached before 31 December, in other words before the birth of the euro, something which seemed far from likely even just a few days ago."
"I believe there are two aspects which must be emphasised."
"The first aspect is defining a common position for the Union."
"Before each international meeting, a common position for the Union will be defined by means of coordination between the Member States, under the guidance of the President of the Euro 11, as is the usual practice."
"This coordination can take place very rapidly as the Commission has been asked to install a videoconference system linking the Commission, the Central Bank and the finance ministers."
"I would add that these decisions, the positions adopted by the Council, will be prepared by the Economic and Financial Affairs Committee. In other words, they will be based on input, or possibly a proposal, from the Commission and this will happen before every major international meeting."
"Therefore, we will be guaranteed a common position of the European Union, of the euro zone, for any meeting and any deadline."
"The second issue is that of representation of the Community."
"The form of representation that has been defined will allow Europe to speak with a single voice, whilst respecting the competences of the institutions concerned."
"There is an economic side and a monetary side. It is only natural that this voice, in order to be heard, should use several vocal cords, in accordance with the will of the Heads of State and Government as expressed at the Luxembourg European Council last December."
"Yesterday's agreement lays down a role for the Council, a role for the Central Bank and a role for the Commission."
"This is a tripartite representation, as your rapporteur stressed."
"The three parts cannot be separated and they are vital if economic and monetary union and the euro are to operate smoothly."
"To be a little more specific and to dispel certain misunderstandings - which were probably caused by press comments made yesterday - allow me, as someone who participated in the negotiations from start to finish, tell you exactly what specific decisions were taken in three cases, by way of example."
"Firstly, in formal institutions such as the G7 or G10, it was decided, in accordance with the Commission's proposal, that the Council will be represented by the President of the Euro 11, the President of the European Central Bank and the relevant Member of the Commission."
"These three form the Community delegation."
"As for the Commission, it is not simply playing a minor role."
"Nowhere in the agreement will you find terms outlining the technical assistance role which it is claimed the Commission has been given."
"The Commission is there to provide help, as is perfectly normal, to provide support and to play a useful and efficient role."
"And I should like to reassure the rapporteur that you can count on the Commission to be ready and willing to fulfil this role."
"In order to ensure continuity in the representation of the euro and in view of the rotating presidencies, a minister from a G7 Member State will support the President of the Euro 11."
"As regards formal international institutions, I will take the case of the IMF and look beyond the current provisions, which already give the Commission observer status in the Interim Committee."
"This agreement provides for the ECB to have observer status in the Interim Committee and in the Executive Board."
"It also provides for the relevant member of the Executive Director's Office holding the Presidency of the Euro 11, assisted by a Commission representative, to express common positions in the Executive Board."
"This means, in a very real sense, that the Commission will have access to all the necessary information to allow it to fulfil its role, particularly as regards multilateral supervision."
"Lastly, as regards bilateral missions, the arrangements for missions in third countries will be defined by the Presidency of the Euro 11 or by the ECOFIN Council on a case-by-case basis, which I think is simply common sense."
"On the basis of the Commission proposal, these arrangements will be translated into a decision under Article 109(4), once approved by the Heads of State and Government, and will be discussed with the third countries involved."
"I would like to inform you here that the President of the Commission, Jacques Santer, has already announced that because there is to be a Euro-American summit on 18 December, it will fall to him and the President of the Council, Chancellor Klima, to discuss this with the Americans."
"In conclusion, I believe we must stress the importance of this agreement and its transitional nature."
"To my great regret there are only eleven of us in the euro, not fifteen."
"To my great regret, it is not possible to change the statutes of the International Monetary Fund in a few weeks."
"Yet this agreement is still a positive one, even if it is only transitional, and it is nonetheless an agreement which will allow us to launch EMU in full on 1 January under the best possible conditions."
"And I can assure you that as far as the Commission is concerned, it will keep you closely informed of developments in discussions, as always, and of the development of the international aspects of the euro."
"Thank you, Mr de Silguy."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m."
"Monetary and financial crisis"
"The next item is the report (A4-0441/98) by Mrs Randzio-Plath, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the world monetary and financial crises and their effects on the economy of the European Union."
"I give the floor to the rapporteur, Mrs Randzio-Plath."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the economic and financial crises have highlighted the need, especially for our ancient continent of Europe and for the European Union, to redesign the international economic and financial structures."
"The Bretton Woods institutions are more than 54 years old; they are not designed to meet the challenges of globalisation."
"That is why a new international financial system is needed, and the restructuring must begin with the International Monetary Fund."
"As an advisory and administrative body, the interim committee is an anachronism and must be replaced by a political council."
"This institutional reform is vitally important, because we need a political council which will take decisions, which will assume responsibility for financial decisions and which will not pass the buck to the administrative staff when things go wrong."
"We want to ensure that financial decisions have political backing too."
"Moreover, I believe that the International Monetary Fund, the Bank for International Settlements, the World Bank and even the World Trade Organisation must cooperate more closely and coordinate their operations."
"What we need, in other words, is reform of these institutions, and the G7 will certainly not be untouched by these reforms either."
"After all, not every region of the world is represented at the G7 meetings."
"We have become painfully aware of the pitfalls of solving crises without the proper involvement of the affected regions in the decision-making process."
"For that reason, it is important to consider whether a UN Security Council for Economic Affairs would not solve the problem of worldwide representation and whether such a body could not serve to underline the fact that security today primarily means economic and social security."
"At the same time, of course, there must be no underestimating the reforms required by the existing institutions."
"These should include changes to the way in which the International Monetary Fund operates."
"The existing system of imposing conditions and the stereotyped manner in which they are adapted for individual countries have done more to exacerbate crises than to contain or resolve them."
"Admittedly, reforming operational methods is but one side of the coin; what is especially crucial is that the International Monetary Fund should have adequate financial resources."
"The last set of G7 decisions points in the right direction, but I believe we have still to find the right solution in terms of the working methods and finances of the International Monetary Fund."
"The rules of the International Monetary Fund must also be restructured, amended and applied more effectively to ensure that assistance can be quickly obtained and organised to deal with liquidity shortages such as those that have given rise to crises in recent months and years."
"There must be greater openness, so that moratoria, safeguard clauses and suspension agreements can be put in place as the foundation stones of rescheduling plans, which have invariably been devised too late in crisis situations and have essentially been inappropriate into the bargain."
"Alongside the monitoring of short-term capital influxes, consideration must also be given in this context to organising some sort of temporary system to control the movement of capital out of the country or countries in question."
"Another important element, as far as we in the European Union are concerned, is the creation of new legal instruments so that the finance markets become more transparent and financial information becomes more freely available and more reliable."
"What is needed here is the globalisation of regulatory and supervisory systems in this age of increasingly deregulated and liberalised capital transactions."
"After all, the market economy has shown throughout the world that economic and financial relations have been unable to function smoothly in practice without a regulatory framework."
"That is why particular attention must be paid to short-term international movements of capital, which have plunged many countries into crisis."
"Comprehensive monitoring of these capital flows is essential."
"But it is also high time that governments themselves began to provide incentives which would help to encourage a greater volume of long-term credit commitments."
"Since the Mexican crisis, there has been a 'moral hazard' problem."
"Private and institutional investors are running ever greater risks in the quest for maximised returns."
"In so doing, they rely on the fact that, if a liquidity crisis occurs, the International Monetary Fund will overcome the problem, because the adverse effects of financial crises on national economies, on business, growth, investment and employment, are so great and incalculable that they warrant the use of tax revenue to minimise the risks for private investors."
"It is time a framework was found within which the private sector could be made to foot its share of the crisismanagement bill."
"Another point: an efficient system for the supervision and monitoring of financial activities must also be established and enforced for the flood of new financial products that are contributing to the fragility and volatility of the finance markets."
"We cannot prohibit derivatives, but we must see to it that they are subject to supervision and control."
"Besides the supervision of banks, we also need supervision of non-banking institutions."
"Close cooperation is required here between the International Monetary Fund, national governments and the Bank for International Settlements."
"What we also need are definitive, globally applicable quality standards for financial information as well as for other information systems."
"There will always be financial crises."
"The potential for crises, however, must be reduced, because crises in today's financial markets affect the real economy."
"That is why we must ensure that the effects of these crises on growth, investment and employment are contained, not only in the crisis-torn countries themselves but also in the newly industrialised countries, in the developing countries and in the industrialised countries too."
"For that reason, political cooperation is needed in order to ensure that the European and US trade cycles remain stable and in step with each other, and there is also a need for cooperation between the European Central Bank and the US Federal Reserve."
"We must also ensure that stable exchange rates are maintained between the main currencies of the world."
"In the age of the euro, we must help to make sure that those regions with the power to create stability in the international currency markets actually exercise that power to contribute to the development of a fairer international financial system in response to the challenges of globalisation."
"Another important objective is a fairer global distribution of wealth."
"That will only become achievable when we in the European Union know that we too can contribute to this crisismanagement strategy through our European plans of action, not by intervening to sort out crises, but by helping to prevent the development of critical situations."
"Mr President, I will confine myself here to what we as the European Union can do about the financial crisis."
"Firstly, we must remain open to exports from the countries hit by the crisis."
"And we can do so, because the European Union has so far actually profited from the crisis; the flight into sound capital from non-Union countries to Europe has caused interest rates on our capital markets to plummet."
"Because of a falling-off in demand and low raw materials prices, our inflation has sunk to an all-time low."
"As a result, growth in Europe is even higher than was expected in the spring."
"If exports from the crisis countries with their devalued currencies now increase, we cannot suddenly hit the brakes with anti-dumping levies."
"If these countries cannot dispose of their products in Europe, with its trade balance surplus, where can they do so?"
"Secondly, Europe must help to provide for scrutiny of flight capital flowing into developing countries."
"Enforcement of the internationally agreed prudential rules, which will probably need further tightening, is a crucial first step towards this."
"Thirdly, the IMF must focus less on buying out western private banks at the expense of governments and ultimately the population in debtor countries and more on the preservation of purchasing power, production and self-help in debtor countries."
"If private banking is itself made to share the responsibility for preventing and combating crises, this kind of financial policy is feasible without any need to increase the IMF's resources."
"The shift in the IMF's thinking needed to achieve this is hardly something which the IMF's interim committee can be expected to bring about, made up as it is of conservative bankers and finance ministers."
"Nor do I see how upgrading the interim committee or merging the committees of the IMF and World Bank could be instrumental in bringing about this necessary change."
"Fourthly, the EU must help to ensure that standard clauses are introduced into contracts whereby debt renewal incurs a penalty."
"If clauses like this had been in place, much of the misery we are now seeing in the debtor countries could have been avoided."
"Lastly, of course a great deal has to change in a number of the debtor countries themselves."
"But to say all of a sudden, after the event, that this is where the fault lay is unworthy."
"Many of the countries affected were given excellent marks by all the international bodies and their associated experts."
"Conveniently forgetting that is unhealthy, and stops us from reflecting on our own mistakes, something I have found sadly lacking in our debate on the crisis so far."
"Mr President, the world economy is undoubtedly caught up in a significant crisis."
"Nevertheless, the data for the European Union are extremely encouraging."
"This year's average inflation rate for the countries participating in monetary union is expected to work out at 1.5 %, their national budget deficits at 2 % and their economic growth at 3 %. It is a long time since such favourable economic statistics were last recorded."
"For all our discussion of the global crises, it is worth emphasising that the European Union is the bastion of stability in the world, not least because of the decision to introduce the euro, Commissioner de Silguy."
"These are the facts we have to discuss."
"We must not forget that."
"Mrs Randzio-Plath's report contains many useful ideas, but there are some points to which we certainly cannot subscribe."
"I intend to enumerate these points in the short time at my disposal, since I do not expect to be given so much additional time as the honourable Members on the other side of the House."
"First of all, we do not believe that there is any benefit at all to be derived from short-term capital controls."
"Secondly, the establishment of a Security Council for Economic Affairs under the auspices of the United Nations is nothing but a pipe dream."
"Thirdly, Mrs Randzio-Plath, Amendment No 5, which you foisted on us by way of a compromise, seeks to omit investments from the calculation of the budget deficit under the stability and growth pact."
"There was absolutely no need for you to defer to Mr Lafontaine in that way!"
"Nevertheless, we do need transparency in the realm of finance."
"Let me briefly list the three things we need."
"Firstly, we need transparency at the national and international levels, because the markets could not function otherwise."
"Secondly, we need a multilateral monitoring system, especially in the domain of fiscal policy."
"Thirdly, we need reforms in the context of the national finance markets."
"The fluctuation margins for the yen, euro and dollar proposed by Mr Lafontaine are unhelpful, because we can only earn the right to make such demands by pursuing sound economic, fiscal and monetary policies."
"That is precisely the path which the European Union is following."
"We therefore welcome the approach proposed by the Commission."
"Mr President, the international financial crisis shocked the world, and many people claim to have been taken by surprise."
"We have identified a number of the causes of it, and Mrs Randzio-Plath has highlighted them in her report."
"Mr Metten says that we must not complain after the event, but we were forced to realise at the hearing of financial experts that there are gaps in our information system."
"The IMF has no early knowledge of a number of figures, because the figures are unreliable and because it is clear that different countries apply different standards of measurement."
"Countries in Asia which have seen very fast growth and which were very important to Europe and America succumbed all of a sudden to Asian flu."
"Asia has been sick, but Europe will start sniffling if we are not careful and Europe has done relatively well with the euro."
"Those countries which sadly are not yet joining the euro still have a problem."
"Transparency, good controls and standardised rules will be essential."
"So we Liberals think it is important to apply the same standards, but that it is no use having a sort of security council for the economy or a decision-making power within the IMF."
"That would just mean more talking shops, and I would have thought we had enough talk shows on television already."
"We need action."
"We need unambiguity. We need clarity."
"The market too can have a share in this."
"The market too can take risks here."
"If we follow a sound economic policy, review the situation properly and take account of cultural differences - because there are plenty of those in Asia - then the right thing for Europe to do, and Europe must see that it does this, may be to play a role and help ensure that stability is restored as fast as possible. Stability will open the way for more jobs to be created and for more growth in these countries, and in Europe as well."
"Mr President, may I say to Mr Langen that I do not believe the old way of thinking will take us very far."
"There is now a real need for a new way of thinking."
"It is dangerous when Europe and the Europeans like you, Mr Langen, believe we are on one of the Islands of the Blessed here and take a Pharisaic delight in having been spared the effects of the crises."
"What is really important is that Europe should use its favourable position to play an active part in ensuring that others can once more set their feet on dry land."
"To that end, we need stabilised exchange rates, supervision, transparency, control and ultimately a social and ecological reconstruction of the key international economic institutions."
"Mrs Randzio-Plath is absolutely right: we also need a basic political consensus on this matter."
"It must be developed within the United Nations, difficult though that may be to achieve and hard as it may be to imagine after 20 years of neo-liberal policies."
"But in the world of finance in particular, Mr Langen, the dialectics of power will always apply."
"The mighty, through their arrogance, invariably sow the seeds of their own downfall."
"Mr President, may I point out to you that the honourable Member from the Liberal Group, Mr Goedbloed, has just delivered his maiden speech."
"You, who are normally such a communicative President, forgot to mention that."
"Could you please acknowledge it now?"
"After all, it is already 11.20 p.m."
"Thank you, Mr Langen."
"I am always grateful for helpful comments from the House, and I am glad you drew my attention to this point."
"I had not realised this was Mr Goedbloed's maiden speech, as it was so accomplished."
"I might be excused, perhaps, because he spoke as if he were an old hand in the House."
"Judging by your speech, Mr Goedbloed, I am quite sure that you have much to contribute to this Parliament in the future."
"Mrs Randzio-Plath, do you wish to raise a point of order?"
"Please do not open a further debate at this point."
"Mr President, since my colleague from the Group of the European People's Party made a comment about a German politician, I should like to put on record the fact that my Amendment No 5 is in line with the position of this House on the principles of economic policy, a position which, I might add, was adopted last year by the European Parliament in plenary sitting."
"Thank you, Mrs Randzio-Plath."
"At this hour of the night, one can be generous with points of order."
"However, we are not going to embark on a new debate, and Mr Lukas now has the floor for one minute."
"Mr President, what a pity that the honourable Member had to make his maiden speech at midnight before an empty Chamber."
"But it is an even greater pity that such an important and excellent report could not have been discussed before now."
"I consider it excellent, even though I cannot endorse everything it says."
"It would naturally be ludicrous to try to deal in the space of one minute with all the points on which we differ."
"I should merely like to say how deeply I regret the fact - and this is not a digression from the subject - that the report does not devote a single word to the problems of child labour and child abuse."
"The way in which these two problems have become so serious and so widespread in our time is also a result of the globalisation process."
"The Asian crisis has had an enormous impact on these abuses."
"Child-sex tourism in particular is thriving as a result of the falling exchange rates."
"I believe we can speak of a globalisation of perversion."
"The European Union ought to speak out on that aspect of the crisis too."
"Mr President, I shall dispense with diagnoses, already conducted in great detail, and move straight on to three points concerning the prognosis of what is to be done."
"Firstly, it seems perfectly clear to me that there are two somewhat conflicting views: some stress the need for more controls and dirigisme ; others think it more important to make the market function better."
"This latter argument strikes me as the more convincing one, not least because the recent financial events have revealed the need to step up prudential supervision, to improve transparency and the flow of information, and thus to lay down rules which are more in keeping with the new operating environment."
"On the other hand, the idea of managing to control capital flows, both directly and indirectly, could not only turn out to be pure wishful thinking but also lead to a highly inefficient allocation of resources."
"Secondly, on the subject of volatility, I would stress that this problem is bound to persist and creates a need above all for the appropriate instruments to eliminate the risks resulting from it, rather than for inefficient control measures which cannot possibly function, given the volumes and operating methods that are typical of financial markets nowadays."
"We shall soon see this within the next few weeks, in respect of the euro/dollar exchange rate."
"Nor, I am sure, does anyone think the conditions still exist today to return to something resembling the old Bretton Woods system, which we all remember so well."
"I would just say a word on my third point: let us show more concern - as the rapporteur quite rightly does in her text - for the weakest links in the chain, namely for economies such as those of Latin America, and Brazil in particular, which - only partly through their own fault - are experiencing hard times, although not totally desperate ones."
"Mr President, at the end of 1996 the Wall Street Dow Jones index hit the 6400 barrier."
"It then went from record to record and last June peaked at 9337 points."
"Then everything collapsed: there was a domino effect around all of the world's exchanges without exception and widespread panic in the financial markets, with a number of different countries on the verge of economic collapse."
"Apparently, the world financial crisis took everyone by surprise."
"Doctors of economics, financial analysts, business journalists, political decision-makers who were all, until four months ago, singing the praises of the global financial market were all caught up in a monumental fiasco because of their lack of foresight."
"But Japan had been sliding for some time."
"The Russian economy had long been as sick as its president and European banks had poured 48 billion dollars into a country no longer in control of its own currency."
"For a long time the so-called emerging economies had been burying themselves up to their necks in debt."
"Years of certainty suddenly all seemed to be called into question."
"Already yesterday's apostles of ultra-liberalism are casting doubt on the ability of markets to self-regulate or claiming that there can be no growth without full freedom of capital movement."
"This backto-business or return to greater state interventionism as well as intervention by international financial organisations is quite evident in this report and in this resolution."
"Suddenly the dictionary used in financial circles has been taken over by terms such as control, transparency, reform, public investment, guarantees, risk, coordination, codes, conduct, ethics, safeguard, supervision, balance, plans and action."
"In other words, the ruling classes have finally realised that the globalisation of markets without political and legal frameworks and concern for the social dimension of its consequences poses a threat to international stability."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate Mrs RandzioPlath on her report, which asks us to give serious consideration to a grave problem, that of the effect of financial crises."
"This is a problem worthy of our attention."
"Therefore, we congratulate your on your initiative, and we are taking due note of your recommendations."
"I must point out that the Commission is not inactive in this area and is well aware that the Union has a specific role to play, particularly as regards the arrival of the euro and its development."
"I should like to consider three important questions raised by your rapporteur."
"Firstly, what are the solutions to the current crisis?"
"We must not go back on the free movement of capital, as Mr Langen underlined."
"I believe this is a wise judgement."
"Experience has shown that all attempts to control the movement of capital do not work and are counterproductive."
"In fact, capital flows out but does not flow back in."
"Developing countries need capital in order to develop."
"But freedom comes with its own demands including, as you highlighted, for the private sector."
"There are three demands: transparency, monitoring and vigilance."
"On the subject of transparency, we are a long way from achieving full transparency."
"Some investment funds are currently in a position to invest several hundred billion euros, without being under any obligation to declare their operations to the supervisory authorities, nor even to their shareholders."
"I believe that such a lack of transparency is dangerous, and recent events have demonstrated this."
"It is also shocking, as monetary authorities are under constant pressure to determine public authorities' levels of exchange reserves much more accurately and rapidly."
"We therefore need to examine ways of putting an end to such imbalances in transparency."
"As for monitoring, we must also develop our supervision instruments."
"The famous Cook ratio was a considerable step forward in financial history and probably averted many crises, but I believe that it has now reached its limits, particularly as it only applies to banks."
"We must therefore develop a way to monitor off balance-sheet business more efficiently, and we must develop stricter accounting practices."
"I am thinking of the scale of bad debt brought to light by the fact- finding operation currently underway in Asia."
"Lastly, the third element is vigilance."
"We need to increase our capacity for collective prevention."
"We know that today, for example, we need to develop the multilateral supervision of macroeconomic policies, particularly as regards exchange rates and short term capital flows."
"On this point let me say that - unusually perhaps - I do not agree with the rapporteur's idea of creating an Economic Security Council under the aegis of the United Nations."
"Why?"
"Because we actually already have a body within the United Nations called the IMF, and the issue now seems to me to be how to develop the structure of the International Monetary Fund to make it better prepared to prevent and even to contain crises."
"In view of this and in view of what you call 'political accountability' - if I have understood correctly - I think that the possible transformation of the IMF Interim Committee into a true decision-making global body, with its role extended to include supervision, as President Chirac recently suggested, is an idea worth further consideration."
"The second question is what Europe's role should be."
"It is twofold."
"Europe must firstly set an example and contribute to discussions."
"But if the real challenges are on a worldwide rather than a continental scale, Europe can play an important part in adapting the international monetary and financial system."
"Europe has already made a number of contributions here, and I will quickly give you a few examples."
"There is the recent communication on financial services presented by Mario Monti, 'Building a Framework for Action', which, as of June 1999, should lead to measures and timetables for limiting financial instability in several fields."
"There is also the creation of the Forum of European Securities Commissions (FESCO), under the auspices of the Commission, and the banking supervision committee within the European System of Central Banks."
"All these measures constitute a real step forward."
"There is a particular need to establish a rapid and safe exchange of information between supervisory authorities and the competent monetary authorities."
"As regards accounting practices, the Commission supports the work of the International Accounting Standard and will review with the Member States the rules which apply to the capital of financial establishments, taking account of the work of the Basle Committee."
"On a commercial level, I would remind you that the Commission was the first to call for the launch of a new series of multilateral negotiations - the 'Millennium Round' - and to ensure that these negotiations would be applied to financial services."
"That will do for a brief list of examples."
"As for contributing to discussions, the Commission played an active part in the debates and, in particular, in the recent initiatives of the G7."
"It is the source of the communication which was adopted yesterday by the ECOFIN Council for the European Council on strengthening the international financial system."
"This communication stresses the central role which the Union should now play in the new architecture of the international financial system, and the strengthening of economic and financial cooperation with emerging and developing countries."
"This brings me on to prevention."
"The private sector should be involved in resolving crises and should take its share of responsibility."
"However, Europe's real contribution to the international debate is directly linked to the quality of its external representation, but as we discussed this earlier I will not go back over it now."
"In view of the time, I will not go into the third and last matter now."
"I thought it would be raised in the debate, but I do hope we will have a chance to address it at a later date, since you have included it in your report."
"It concerns whether we need to draw up a European plan for stimulating investment."
"I will simply say that, this morning, acting on my proposal, the Commission adopted an interesting communication on this matter which, whilst of course pointing out the budget policy line, raises a number of possibilities that Europe could implement."
"I hope that we will have an opportunity to discuss this in more detail in the coming weeks."
"As you can see, the Commission generally shares your views and I can assure you that it will closely follow developments in these areas in its recommendations on the convergence and stability programmes."
"But I would like to end by reassuring the House that the Commission is carrying out its full responsibilities in the current debate on the new architecture of the international monetary system."
"The introduction of the euro also gives us an incentive to play a more active role in this field."
"I believe that the decisions which were taken yesterday on external representation will give us the instrument we need to put our ideas into practice."
"Thank you, Mr de Silguy."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m."
"Before wishing you a well-deserved and refreshing rest, let me say that tomorrow's sitting on Thursday, 3 December 1998 will begin at 9 a.m."
"(The sitting was closed at 11.45 p.m.)"
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, I wish to raise a matter which is not covered by yesterday's minutes."
"However, it is a serious matter."
"Many of us today will be travelling home by plane."
"Many of us will be using the services of the company LSG Lufthansa Skychef."
"I wish to report to this House that last week four hundred workers who took part in a legally called strike were summarily dismissed by that company."
"I hope that all Members of the European Parliament will complain about this outrageous breach of human rights."
"Mrs McNally, that is a matter for individual Members."
"Mr President, I should like to return to page 17 of the Minutes."
"Yesterday evening, at the start of the discussion on the Rothley report on the Members' Statute, I tabled a preliminary question pursuant to Rule 128."
"Under this Rule, the President should have asked if there was a speaker in favour and a speaker against the motion, before putting it to the vote."
"No doubt mistakenly advised, the President of the sitting decided of his own accord - as is stated in the Minutes - that the report I contested was perfectly admissible."
"I should like you to use this incident, which I consider to be very serious simply because it calls into question the rights of Members and the application of the Rules of Procedure, as an opportunity to give instructions, both to those who substitute for you as President of the sitting and to all the advisers, that the Rules of Procedure are to be applied and that the rights of the majority should not take precedence over the legal position of minorities."
"The interpretation given was clearly mistaken and I should like you to formally confirm this today."
"Mr President, yesterday, pursuant to the Rules of Procedure, as Mr Fabre-Aubrespy has just explained, he questioned the admissibility of Mr Rothley's report."
"So far, Mr Fabre-Aubrespy, who is very familiar with the Rules of Procedure, has acted entirely within his rights."
"I myself, aware of the responsibility vested in me when I occupy the position which is yours today, Mr President, decided that in this case, admissibility could not be questioned. I announced my decision accordingly and assume full responsibility for it."
"So far, so good."
"However, I feel there is something inadmissible in what Mr Fabre-Aubrespy has said."
"I cannot accept that he should attribute my political prerogative, my full political responsibility, to the President's advisers."
"Those who advise the Chair may express an opinion, but the President must take full political responsibility for his decisions."
"Consequently, Mr Fabre-Aubrespy, if you have any objections, you should address them to the President, not to officials."
"I therefore invite you to withdraw your remarks."
"I appreciate the views of Mr Gutiérrez Díaz, and I agree with him as regards the decision that he took."
"As I understood it, Mr Fabre-Aubrespy was not seeking to attack the officials who advise the President."
"In any event, I shall refer Mr Fabre-Aubrespy's comments to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, since he has raised an important procedural question."
"The committee will either confirm the interpretation given by Mr Gutiérrez Díaz or correct it, and that will clarify the situation."
"Mr President, I am pleased that the thief from the security service has been identified, which I hope will mean that our offices are safe again."
"Thank you for telling us that, Mr Rübig."
"I think it will encourage the security service to continue its activities for the benefit of us all."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"VOTES"
"Mr President, I am sorry to speak now before the vote has begun but my comment relates to the first amendment on which we will be voting."
"I would like to suggest that Amendment No 106 tabled by the Europe of Nations Group is inadmissible under Rule 125(1)(b) because it seeks to replace the whole of the text."
"Equally, Rule 125(1)(d) is relevant because it talks about amending more than one of the individual articles or paragraphs of a text."
"It seems to me that Amendment No 106 should not be voted on."
"It should be ruled inadmissible."
"Mr Donnelly, we will decide when we come to Amendment No 106, and then I will give the floor to Mr Fabre-Aubrespy."
"On Amendment No 106"
"Mr President, I should like to speak not only on the subject of this amendment, but also on other points of procedure, as Mr Donnelly has done."
"On the subject of Amendment No 106, I ask you not to put it to the vote. We will withdraw it."
"The intention was not for it to be put to the vote."
"As regards the admissibility of amendments, on the same basis that you have just declared Amendment No 106 inadmissible, I ask you to also declare inadmissible Amendments Nos 83, 81 and 80."
"These amendments are not admissible."
"They seek to delete parts of amendments and the same result could be achieved by a split vote pursuant to Rule 125(3)."
"They are therefore inadmissible."
"I also ask you to declare inadmissible Amendment No 109, presented as a compromise amendment."
"There can be no compromise amendment on a text such as the one we have before us. Furthermore, this amendment is designed to replace more than one article in the text and therefore, like Amendment No 106, cannot be admissible."
"In any event, if you apply Rule 115 you must first ask for the Chamber's approval and I do not believe you can obtain this on this amendment, which was submitted after the deadline and as a compromise amendment between two political groups, and which furthermore seeks to replace all the amendments relating to the same article."
"Finally, Mr President, I would point out that the voting order which you give in the voting list does not correspond at all to Rule 115, that we are dealing with an own-initiative report to which Rule 50 applies, that this own-initiative report includes a resolution and that, in a resolution, it is customary to vote first on the recitals, then on the articles, and then on the annexes."
"In practical terms, Mr Fabre-Aubrespy, when we come to the vote on these amendments, we shall decide whether they are admissible case by case."
"I would ask you to draw my attention to them then."
"I can tell you now that, as regards the compromise amendment, the House will be asked to decide whether it is possible to vote or not, pursuant to Rule 50."
"But we shall look at admissibility as and when we come to the articles in question, and I would ask you to bring them to my attention then."
"As for the voting order, this has been studied at some length between the groups themselves and the sessional services."
"The precedents are that when we have dealt with similar texts, based on a treaty which is in the process of being ratified but aimed at opening negotiations with a view to the position subsequently being formalised in the treaty, Parliament has previously used the legislative procedure."
"This is not the first case, so I am standing by the precedents which have been established in other cases and we shall follow this voting order, the main purpose of which is to enable the House to take a clear decision and everyone to understand the proceedings."
"For that reason, I shall take this vote very slowly, explaining point by point what is involved, so that everyone can decide with a full knowledge of the facts."
"On Amendment No 27"
"Mr President, one of the phrases used in this text we are voting on is not clear to me."
"I believe the confusion stems from an error in translation."
"Once we have adopted this, MEPs will be described as 'Abgeordnete im Europäischen Parlament ', that is to say Members in the European Parliament."
"The normal German designation is 'Abgeordnete des Europäischen Parlaments ', which means Members of the European Parliament."
"I believe it is a mistake in the translation."
"I should like to think that we can continue to call ourselves Members of the European Parliament."
"We have taken note of your comment, Mr Friedrich, and the language services will check the original text against the German version to ensure that there are no mistakes."
"Mr Rothley, you have an opportunity here to tell us your position on Amendment No 41 which is about to be put to the vote."
"There are also other amendments which correspond to No 41, but it is essentially No 41 that is at issue."
"What is your position?"
"Before the vote on the third part of Article 4"
"Mr President, I should like to draw something to the attention of the House. We have proposed the deletion of the sentence you have just mentioned for purely technical reasons."
"It is not a decision on the transitional regime itself, but simply a piece of editing."
"Mr Rothley, if this phrase is adopted, there are transitional provisions."
"If it is not adopted, there are no transitional provisions."
"That would mean that it would then not be possible to vote on the provisions concerning the transitional arrangement."
"That is the significance of this phrase, and everyone must know exactly what they are voting on."
"That is why I have read it out, and I am grateful that you have given me the chance to make clear the significance of this vote."
"After the vote on Article 4"
"Mr President, according to our voting list, there should be a separate vote on the principle of a transitional regime."
"I propose that we keep to the voting list that has been distributed. I also propose that we listen to the rapporteur, who stated that the vote on the transitional regime which we have just carried out was a purely technical one regarding the second subparagraph of Article 4(2)."
"I would also like to emphasise that in the request for a split vote it only states that we should vote in three sections."
"We have taken the vote, Mrs Thors."
"We do not vote on principles, but on texts."
"I put to the vote the text which provided for the transitional arrangement."
"I explained the significance of the vote quite clearly, and the rapporteur stated his position."
"The vote was taken, the result was announced, and that is what is valid."
"We do not put principles to the vote, especially if we have decided on a text."
"This point is therefore closed."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have come to an absolutely decisive point."
"May I prevail for a moment upon your patience, Mr President."
"At the request of other groups, my group requested a separate vote on the sentence 'Transitional provisions shall be adopted for the duration of the fifth parliamentary term'."
"There is a 'no' against this on our voting list, but for the sole reason that the sentence is inappropriate at that point in the text."
"That is the one and only reason!"
"I pointed that out before the vote."
"It is a purely technical point."
"When we vote, it must surely be possible for us to indicate that the wording we favour does not belong at this particular point but should be elsewhere in the text."
"That has to be possible!"
"This is a motion."
"The point is that my group supports a transitional system, as do the other groups."
"Just because we have now said that this sentence does not belong at this place in the text but at a different point, you cannot simply rule that the matter has been decided."
"(Applause) Since you ought to respect the will of Parliament, I strongly urge you to proceed in strict accordance with the voting list and take a vote now on the principle of a transitional arrangement."
"In no circumstances can I go against the will of the House, Mr Rothley."
"The Rules of Procedure say that we normally vote on texts, and the significance of the vote was very clear."
"I stated and restated it very clearly."
"When the House votes, I cannot go back on its decision, whatever voting list there may have been."
"The voting list provides an indication for the groups. That indication, under the Rules of Procedure, has no bearing on the will of Parliament."
"The House votes on texts and, according to the Rules, I have no alternative but to proceed in this way."
"I explained things quite clearly."
"I took great care to explain them immediately after you had spoken."
"I cannot now go back on the vote."
"The House has decided that there are to be no transitional provisions, because it has rejected the text in which those transitional provisions were established."
"(Mixed reactions)"
"Mr President, at the beginning you said this was a very complex, difficult and sensitive vote."
"You said that the groups had worked very closely with your services to determine the voting order and the way in which we would approach this vote."
"The interpretation you have just made runs counter to the way in which this vote has been ordered by your services."
"It is inappropriate and insensitive to change the interpretation during the vote."
"We were all led to believe, according to the voting list drawn up by your services with ours, that there would be a vote on the principle of the transitional regime."
"To change that immediately before is not appropriate."
"It led to confusion on that first vote and had we been absolutely clear what was going on then, there would have been a different outcome to that vote."
"I am very unhappy with this."
"We are putting the whole issue at risk."
"I know how determined you are to get this draft statute through today so I would ask you please to reconsider your interpretation."
"Mr President, may I try to help out here?"
"In Article 4, which contains three numbered paragraphs, you will find in paragraph 2 the sentence 'Transitional provisions shall be adopted for the duration of the fifth parliamentary term'. We voted on that, and the sentence was deleted from Article 4."
"However, in the annex to the draft Statute, under heading A - 'Parliamentary allowance for exercise of office' - the text begins with the words 'For the duration of the fifth parliamentary term, the following Articles 1-5 shall apply by way of a transitional arrangement'."
"We have not voted on that yet."
"This is the proper point at which the principle of the transitional arrangement must be incorporated, as the rapporteur, Mr Rothley, quite rightly indicated."
"So all we have done so far is some technical editing of Article 4, and we are only now about to vote on the principle set forth under heading A of the annex, a principle that is therefore still part of the draft Statute."
"Mr President, clearly, as far as the Rules of Procedure are concerned, the Chair is, strictly speaking, quite right. A vote already taken cannot be repeated."
"I believe this serious incident could be resolved if Amendment No 26, put forward by the European People's Party, were put to the vote."
"According to the voting list, Amendment No 26 still stands, and it does refer to these transitional arrangements. We would not be repeating a vote already taken."
"The House would, officially, continue to comply with its Rules of Procedure."
"However, a vote in favour of Amendment No 26 would enable us to raise the issue of the possibility of putting transitional arrangements in place once again, without referring to the fifth legislative period. Rather, there would be a reference to the legislative period following approval of the Statute."
"In my view, this would be a way of overcoming the difficulty whilst complying with the Rules of Procedure."
"Mr President, just now, before the vote on Article 4(2), Mr Rothley spoke and you yourself gave a very clear interpretation of the vote which was going to be held."
"You confirmed this interpretation on three occasions and you were right because the House did indeed pronounce on the transitional system for the fifth parliamentary term."
"What is proposed now is contrary to the Rules of Procedure because it involves returning to a text by means of an annex."
"You said yourself just now, when I contested the voting order, that you were adopting the principle of the legislative procedure."
"How is it possible, on an annex, to go against a vote on the main text?"
"If there is a contradiction with regard to the first subparagraph of paragraph 2, this simply relates to the terms 'transitional allowance', which will not apply."
"But you cannot now put to a roll-call vote the principle of a transitional system for the duration of the fifth parliamentary term, following a very clear vote which you yourself ordered, which took place and in which a majority in this House voted in favour."
"Mr President, I should like to say that I greatly appreciate the way you are conducting these debates as, for the first time in this Parliament, we know what we are voting on."
"You are taking the trouble to read, paragraph by paragraph, the questions on which we must vote."
"You were extremely clear just now and our colleagues must know that, in the House, reference must be made not to a paper prepared by the groups, but to what the President says, who conducts the vote."
"I entirely support Mrs Palacio's and Mr FabreAubrespy's legal argument, and you should not repeat the vote which has just been held."
"Thank you, Mr Pasty."
"I would ask everyone to listen carefully to what I am about to say, and not to start making a noise before I have finished."
"The vote has taken place, and we are not going back on it."
"When we come to the vote on Article 11a, as proposed by the PPE Group, this question will arise again."
"If, at that point, the majority wish there to be a transitional regime, they must vote in favour of the text which I am about to put to the vote."
"If that principle is adopted, we shall then see whether or not the first paragraph of the annex is to be adopted."
"That will depend on the implications of that vote."
"I am therefore now going to put to the vote Article 11a, which reads: 'The European Parliament shall establish, during the parliamentary term following the adoption of the Statute, a special transitional regime concerning the parliamentary allowance and social insurance, pension and taxation arrangements of Members'."
"I shall put to the vote that text, which I shall read out once again."
"This text does not say that the annex will be put to the vote."
"It says that Parliament will establish a transitional regime, and that regime will then be secured."
"This means that I shall then put to the vote the first paragraph of the annex."
"We shall then see whether the House simply wishes that Parliament should establish this transitional regime in the future, or if it wishes to do so now by means of the annex."
"In this way, everyone can see how to vote."
"I shall therefore be taking two votes."
"I would say very clearly that I am not going back on what has happened."
"In the article in which it appeared, the phrase that was put to the vote has been deleted."
"I am putting to the vote Amendment No 26, which has not fallen."
"If you wish to have a transitional regime, then in the third vote you will decide whether to keep only Article 11a or to move on to Mr Rothley's annex."
"(Parliament adopted Article 11a)"
"After the vote on Amendment No 26"
"Mr President, what you have just done is very serious."
"You have changed the voting order, but before doing so you should have asked whether or not there are 29 Members or a political group which oppose this."
"You have called into question a roll-call vote by means of a vote which was not itself a roll-call vote."
"You have put to the vote an amendment which concerned another part of the text when we were busy with the vote on the main text."
"You have thus violated the Rules of Procedure three times and what is more on a text which contradicted a desire clearly expressed by the House."
"I explained the significance of the vote quite clearly, Mr Fabre-Aubrespy."
"What is involved is a question of principle, namely whether or not a transitional regime is to be established."
"One phrase in the text which made provision for this arrangement was deleted."
"However, Amendment No 26 has been adopted by the House, which thus establishes the transitional regime."
"We now have to take the following decision: whether or not this transitional regime is to be the arrangement in Annex 1, in other words what Mr Nassauer was asking for."
"I can put that to the vote."
"Before, I could not go against the text of the Statute, but now the text of the Statute says that there is to be a transitional regime."
"We now have to decide whether this transitional regime will be adopted later by Parliament, or if it will be the one contained in point A of Annex 1 to Mr Rothley's text."
"I hope that everyone has now understood the significance of the vote I am about to take on this point A, which will now read: 'For the duration of the parliamentary term following the adoption of the Statute, the following Articles 1-5 shall apply by way of a transitional arrangement'."
"That is the text which I am going to put to the vote."
"Mr President, after the last vote, I would now ask that you put immediately to the vote the other amendments tabled by the other groups to the effect that we should not have a transitional period."
"We have overruled and mixed up what we have voted for in the draft Statute by the previous vote."
"You have allowed us now to move something from the annex into the draft Statute."
"This is totally contrary to what we are supposed to be doing."
"I spoke yesterday about the need for respect and dignity and about all of us agreeing on the principles of what is contained in this draft Statute."
"We are shooting ourselves in the foot by what we are doing now."
"I would ask you to cancel that last vote because it was illegal."
"Mr Crowley, can you indicate which amendments you are talking about."
"Mr President, this House has voted on the matter of the transitional period."
"It voted that it did not want transitional provisions."
"That was as part of the draft Statute."
"You have taken amendments to the annex which is to be attached to the draft Statute and voted those before anything else."
"I want to know whether a proposal in the annex overrules the earlier vote on the draft Statute, namely not to have a transitional period."
"There is a clear conflict between the two texts."
"They cannot both be right."
"May I draw your attention to one point."
"When we vote against part of an article we have not approved any other phrase saying we will not have a transitional period."
"We vote against part of the text."
"Then I put to the vote another amendment to the text of the Statute, not the annex."
"That is what we have voted: that we will have the transitional period."
"What we still have to decide is whether this is the one established in Annex 1(a) 1-5, as a transitional regime or not."
"This is the only way to know exactly what the House wants."
"My task is to allow the House to vote for what it wants and not use words to make Members say what they do not want to say."
"That is my duty and I will keep to it."
"This discussion is finished."
"Before the vote on point A of the annex"
"'For the duration of the fifth parliamentary term, the following Articles 1-5 shall apply by way of a transitional arrangement'."
"Those who vote against this paragraph simply want to have Article 11a."
"That means that the transitional regime will be established afterwards by Parliament."
"Those who vote in favour of this text want the transitional regime to be the one in the annex, as adopted by the Legal Affairs Committee."
"Afterwards, we shall vote point by point."
"This is what you are calling the question of principle."
"I am very sorry, but the Legal Affairs Committee has produced an extremely complicated text, and it is my responsibility to ensure that the House is able to vote on what it wants."
"The document consists of a principal text, a resolution and an annex, and I am obliged to follow that order."
"You have read out what you want us to vote on but can you tell us which page it is on or which article it is, and whether it is in the annex or the original text?"
"I am confused about what we are going to vote on."
"I will try to explain it again."
"We have adopted Amendment No 26 which says that this House will establish a transitional regime."
"Now I need to know the decision of the House on one point, namely if this transitional regime is the one established in the introductory paragraph of Annex 1 which I have read out."
"It says:"
"'The following Articles 1-5 shall apply by way of a transitional arrangement'."
"The first part - 'for the duration of the fifth parliamentary term' - has to fall, because the text states: 'during the parliamentary term following the adoption of the Statute'."
"This is what was proposed in the text drawn up by the secretaries-general and what you have in the voting list."
"I have divided the principle into two parts: first the transitional regime itself, then what that regime will be."
"I cannot do any more to make things clear and establish what the House's decision is to be."
"Mr President, could we just make it clear, when you ask whether there is to be some other provision or whether we will go ahead with Annex 1, Articles 1 to 4, that if the latter is approved, this does not mean that no vote will be taken on the amendments relating to Articles 1, 2, 3 and 4."
"Please do not take the line that because we have already said we are in favour of Annex 1, it is accepted as it stands and we will not be able to vote on the amendments."
"No, Mr Tsatsos, we are voting on the text which, in the voting list, is referred to as the principle."
"Since we cannot vote on principles - as you well know, since you are an expert on the Rules of Procedure - we have to vote on a text."
"And what is this text?"
"Firstly, we have decided that there is to be a transitional regime."
"The second thing we have to decide is whether this transitional regime is to be the one in the annex."
"Afterwards, we shall vote on the contents of the annex."
"For the moment, we are only voting to establish whether the transitional regime will be the one in the annex. Then we can vote on the amendments to the annex."
"That is quite simply where we are."
"On Amendment No 25"
"Mr President, concerning Amendment No 25, I think the text needs to be looked at because in the original it is the other way round to how it appears in the English text."
"The English text seems to have been transposed and now indicates that the Members have to pay more than the Parliament would contribute."
"I think that is the wrong way round."
"Mr Provan, we are now voting on the original text, paragraph 1."
"When we arrive at your point it will be noted but in any case it is the original text of the amendment which is voted on."
"We will check the specific linguistic point."
"Before the vote on Amendment No 35"
"Mr President, I believe that this amendment should be withdrawn."
"To vote on this would be contrary to a decision which has just been taken."
"I quite agree with you."
"After the vote on recital E"
"Mr President, it is a pity that you did not let me speak earlier."
"This recital clearly contradicts the decision taken just now as it introduces a transitional system for the monthly allowance for the first parliamentary term."
"Mr President, there is no contradiction here, because the entire system is a transitional regime."
"The words 'transitional arrangement' are therefore appropriate in this context."
"It is not contradictory, Mr Fabre-Aubrespy."
"Quite simply, we have decided that there will be a transitional regime for the parliamentary term following the adoption of the Statute."
"If there is any contradiction between this text and other points as regards the time of entry into force, it will have to be corrected, since it is the text of the Statute which prevails."
"The time of entry into force is determined by Amendment No 26, which has been adopted."
"If there is a contradiction with this recital, it will be corrected to that effect, but there is certainly a transitional regime."
"Before the vote on the draft Statute as a whole"
"I could speak in a moment, but as you said earlier that we are dealing with a legislative resolution, it is indeed Rule 50 which must be applied."
"Under this rule we should have had a financial statement, which we have not had."
"But paragraph 1 of this rule states that a majority of Members of Parliament must vote in favour, and this paragraph is applicable."
"Rule 6 says so."
"The draft Statute as a whole must therefore be put to the majority of Members of Parliament."
"The Statute must therefore be adopted by an absolute majority of the Members of Parliament."
"We shall take a roll-call vote for this, at the request of the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations."
"Mr President, in this context I think we should bear in mind that Article 190(5) of the Treaty of Amsterdam does not specify a majority for this kind of question."
"Therefore, only a simple majority is needed for this document to be adopted."
"I refer of course to its final adoption. I do nevertheless feel that as the Treaty of Amsterdam takes precedence over our Rules of Procedure, it would be illogical for us to require an absolute majority for the draft and then adopt the final version by a simple majority."
"I have no objection to requiring an absolute majority, so long as the Rules of Procedure are complied with."
"This is, however, a very unusual own-initiative report, closely linked to the Treaty of Amsterdam, but I must stress that I certainly do not have any objection, and I am sure the House will vote in favour by an absolute majority."
"Mr President, this question was discussed in detail by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights together with Parliament's Legal Service."
"There is not the slightest doubt that in this case no absolute majority is required."
"The Treaty explicitly lays down that Parliament need only act by a majority of its component members in cases where a specific provision to that effect is contained in the Treaty."
"This is not the case, however, in the article to which we are referring."
"That sort of majority is not required."
"A simple majority, in other words, is sufficient."
"That is utterly incontestable, and we did not doubt that for a single moment."
"Mr Rothley, as you rightly say, this would apply if the Treaty of Amsterdam were in force."
"That is not yet the case, however."
"As the Treaty is not in force, we are dealing with a legal initiative by Parliament with a view to engaging in a debate with the Council."
"Further, according to Rule 50(6) of our Rules of Procedure:"
"'The provisions of this Rule shall apply mutatis mutandis in cases where the Treaties attribute the right of initiative to Parliament'."
"That means all cases of legislative initiative. We cannot claim that we are voting on a legislative initiative, according to the proposal from your committee, and then say that the Rules concerning legislative initiatives do not apply, because the Treaty is not in force."
"So an absolute majority is required, otherwise the draft Statute will not be adopted."
"On Article 5 of the draft Statute"
"Mr President, it has been pointed out to me that we voted on an amendment to Article 5 of the Statute, namely Amendment No 8, but that we did not vote on Article 5 itself."
"I should be grateful if you could check that."
"If necessary, we should have to vote again on Article 5."
"Have no fears, Mr Rothley, we have adopted an amendment to this article which incorporated the full text."
"Moreover, it was an amendment tabled by your own political group, and you were in favour."
"Once the whole text had been adopted, we could not vote again on a text which had been adopted in its entirety."
"That point is therefore settled."
"Before the vote on Article 3 of the annex"
"Mr President, excuse me for causing another interruption, but I should like to raise a point of order."
"Are parliamentary staff allowed to sit in Members' seats at voting time?"
"I wanted to ask this question because some staff are sitting in Members' seats among the ranks of the non-attached over here."
"Yes, Mrs Schierhuber, you are right, neither assistants nor group officials are allowed to sit in Members' seats."
"I would therefore ask them once again not to sit there."
"Before the vote on Article 4 of the annex"
"I shall ask the rapporteur for his opinion on this article, since I am in doubt here."
"We have adopted Amendment No 26, which states that the transitional regime is to be established during the parliamentary term following the adoption of the Statute, and we have modified the opening phrase of the annex to this effect by removing 'for the duration of the fifth parliamentary term'."
"Article 4 refers twice to the fifth parliamentary term, and I have the impression that this contradicts Amendment No 26 which we have adopted."
"I should therefore like to hear the views of the rapporteur."
"Mr President, I suggest that we adopt the text as it stands and adjust it in line with the amendments that have already been adopted."
"That will therefore be changed."
"It will not be 'the fifth parliamentary term', but 'the parliamentary term following the adoption of the Statute'."
"I wanted that to be made clear so as to avoid any doubt."
"After the vote on paragraph 2"
"Mr President, on several occasions you mentioned the oral amendment to the text, saying - and I fully agree with you on this - that what we had voted for meant that we could not keep the concept of a fifth parliamentary term."
"However, I think that the implications of the amendment you announced are not very clear."
"The wording you used just now left me uncertain."
"Do you mean that you are replacing the words 'fifth parliamentary term' with 'the end of the parliamentary term during which the Statute is adopted' or, as you said, the parliamentary term 'following the parliamentary term during which the Statute is adopted'?"
"That is the wording you used and it does not at all have the same meaning, since in the latter case, the transitional regime lasts for five years."
"Mr Bourlanges, the text which has been adopted - Amendment No 26 by the PPE Group - specifically says: 'during the parliamentary term following the adoption of the Statute'."
"Those are precisely the words to which all the other wordings must be adapted, since those are the words in the text."
"If I used a different expression, that was due to my poor French or a mistake, and not to any other intention."
"It is this amendment which governs all the rest."
"Before the vote on Compromise Amendment No 109"
"Mr President, I talked about this amendment a short while ago."
"I repeat: it is a compromise amendment which was clearly submitted after the deadline, it is presented by two political groups and it seeks to render null and void all the other amendments."
"I do not understand on what basis you consider it admissible, since the Rules of Procedure, and Rule 115 in particular, do not allow a compromise amendment of this kind."
"Mr President, I want to ask you if you consider paragraph 7 to be compatible with our Rules of Procedure and if it is not inadmissible in view of how responsibilities are distributed among the various parliamentary bodies?"
"Mr President, in reply to Mr Cot, the competence of the Bureau is not being disputed in any way."
"To answer Mr Fabre-Aubrespy, the compromise amendment is admissible under Rule 105(4) of the Rules of Procedure."
"Mr Fabre-Aubrespy is right to some extent, in other words this amendment is acceptable if a majority agrees that it can be put to the vote."
"We need to take two votes."
"I shall read out the interpretation given under Rule 115(4), which states: 'In the case of compromise amendments tabled after the conclusion of a debate... the President shall decide on their admissibility case by case'."
"The general criteria to be applied are: 'as a general rule, compromise amendments may not relate to parts of the text which have not been the subject of amendments prior to the conclusion of the debate'."
"'As a general rule, compromise amendments shall be tabled by political groups, the chairmen, rapporteurs or draftsmen of the committees concerned or the authors of other amendments... as a general rule, compromise amendments shall entail the withdrawal of other amendments to the same passage', which is the case here."
"I can therefore propose that this amendment should be considered, but I must obtain the agreement of Parliament by asking whether there are any objections to the compromise amendment being put to the vote."
"Since that is the case, Parliament must decide by a simple majority of the Members present."
"We shall therefore first vote on whether to put this compromise amendment to the vote."
"(Parliament agreed to vote on the compromise amendment) I would inform the House that the groups which tabled the compromise amendment - the PSE Group and the Liberal Group - have withdrawn the phrase 'the Council position vis-à-vis'. The text therefore reads as follows: 'The Bureau shall take this decision in the light of the Statute'."
"That is the text which will appear in the second subparagraph."
"Mr President, I have a problem, even if it does not concern me personally."
"This amendment also refers to Members who travel to Parliament in their own car."
"I know that there is a motorcycle intergroup at the European Parliament. Are these motorcycles included?"
"Only if the motorcycles are Members' own vehicles, Mr Dell'Alba."
"If they were not - although I think they are - they would not be included."
"The Quaestors will be able to determine, when the time comes, whether or not the motorcycles are Members' own vehicles."
"Mr President, you have not answered my question on admissibility in relation to the distribution of responsibilities."
"If I understood the rapporteur correctly, this amendment is a simple request, nothing more, since otherwise it would clearly infringe the distribution of responsibilities."
"That is how I understood the rapporteur and therefore your position."
"Mr Cot, the opening words of paragraph 7 are: 'Calls on the Bureau to take a decision'."
"This is therefore a call addressed to the Bureau."
"The Bureau will assume its responsibilities when the time comes, obviously after the Statute has been adopted."
"On the vote on Amendment No 18"
"Take a look at Amendment No 18, Mr President, which must be seen as an addition to the compromise amendment."
"Look at what it says: it is an addition to the compromise amendment which wants a specific arrangement for Members living close to Parliament."
"So it simply must not fall."
"Please check on what it says."
"No, we cannot go back on a compromise amendment by means of an addition, or in any other way."
"I am sorry, but this amendment cannot be put to the vote."
"Before the vote on the motion for a resolution as a whole"
"Mr President, I agree with the position you expressed at the time of the vote on the draft Statute as a whole, namely that an absolute majority of Members of Parliament is required. It is what I asked you to make clear."
"But this request concerns the resolution as a whole."
"When you read Rule 50, you find the words 'the resolution shall be adopted by a majority of the component Members of Parliament', thus not just the annexes and not just the draft which is annexed."
"I believe that just now we had articles of the draft Statute which were adopted without an absolute majority - I would ask you to check this - and, in addition, what you have just said about paragraph 2 does not seem to me as if it should apply."
"This requirement for an absolute majority of Members of Parliament applies to the resolution and to all its parts."
"I am sorry, Mr Fabre-Aubrespy."
"When we approve a change to the Rules of Procedure which requires an absolute majority, we vote on the text as a whole by absolute majority, but not on the motion for a resolution, which is always adopted by a simple majority."
"And you know that with the budget, for which an absolute majority is required, it is the text of the budget to which the absolute majority applies, but not the comments in the motion for a resolution, which only need a simple majority."
"What we are applying here is precisely that theory."
"So when I take a roll-call vote on the motion for a resolution, as your group has requested, a simple majority will be sufficient."
"On the vote on Amendment No 18"
"Mr President, first of all, before we take the final vote, I should like to pay tribute to your services and indeed those of the Parliamentary Groups who have made sure that this vote has gone through as easily as it has."
"It is a difficult and sensitive one and I think tribute ought to be paid to those who have actually facilitated it because it has not been easy."
"I would like to ask you to look once again at Amendment No 18."
"You have ruled that, the compromise amendment on Paragraph No 7 having passed, Amendment No 18 cannot be looked at."
"Can I say, as the leader of one of the groups that proposed comprise Amendment No 109, that we do not believe that Amendment No 18 is in any way contradictory but could be taken as an addition."
"If Mr Cox, on behalf of the Liberals, were willing to accept that, I would have thought that we could put it to the House."
"It is not in contradiction with anything that was in the compromise amendment."
"Mr President, I agree with Mr De Coene and Mrs Green that Amendment No 18 is actually an addition, and I would like the House to have a chance to vote on it."
"Let us be quite clear."
"This is a compromise which covers all Members' entitlements with regard to travel."
"There is even a paragraph referring to Annex 2, which has been adopted, stating all this and calling on the Bureau to take a decision on this basis."
"We cannot add something to it which did not form part of the compromise."
"I am not going to put the text to the vote, because I believe it conflicts with the compromise."
"When a compromise is put forward, it has to be respected, and the amendment would add a new element to the calculation of journeys."
"I do not know whether or not it conflicts with Article 1 of Annex 2, which governs the reimbursement of duly substantiated expenses, but in any event it deals with the same subject."
"I am very sorry, but that is my interpretation of the Rules of Procedure, Mrs Green, and I cannot allow this amendment."
"Mr President, when my group presented that compromise text to you, on behalf of ourselves and the Liberals, we sent your services a letter which I am sure is there on your table."
"It listed all the amendments that the compromise was intended to replace."
"There is a sentence at the end which says it does not replace Amendment No 18 from the PSE, which should be voted separately."
"It has always been clear that was to be a separate vote, and I would ask you, please, to put it to the vote."
"Mrs Green, the compromise amendment covers all the aspects raised."
"I stand by my interpretation."
"If you table a compromise amendment we cannot take an amendment which overlaps with this compromise."
"I am sorry, but that is my opinion."
"If you want, I can submit that to the Rules Committee but I am not going to put it to the vote"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to comment briefly on the fact that Mrs Green has just praised the President."
"I do not believe we have any cause to praise either the President or ourselves after three hours of voting."
"I think we have delivered a miserable example of the way in which the European Parliament goes about its legislative work: three hours of bartering with amendments across the floor of the House."
"That is the quality we are providing."
"I find it sad to see what is happening here this morning."
"That is not a point of order."
"Mr President, I think the credibility of the vote on the Statute has been fatally threatened by that last incident."
"I would therefore strongly urge the Bureau to check the content of Amendment No 18."
"The question has been dealt with, Mr Willockx, please read the Rules of Procedure."
"It is my responsibility."
"The Rules Committee will decide whether I have acted properly or not."
"It will have the final say."
"But this has been adopted."
"Parliament's credibility does not depend on that, I am glad to say."
"Madam President, I tabled Amendment No 12, and it has come to my notice that the English translation says exactly the opposite of what I sought to convey in the Dutch text."
"So I think it would be a good thing for me to read out the Dutch text as I intend it, and then the translation in English."
"My Dutch text reads as follows: 'Verzoekt de lidstaten ernstig in overweging te nemen om in dat geval de structuur van hun economieën waar mogelijk te flexibiliseren en diversificeren, alsmede aan te dringen op een gematigde loonontwikkeling teneinde de werkgelegenheid te stimuleren '."
"This translates into English as follows:"
"With this eventuality in mind calls on the Member States to consider seriously making the structure of their economies more flexible and diversified where this is possible and also pressing for wage rises to be moderate in order to stimulate employment."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Madam President, our group voted against because we want a clear and fair text."
"The text on which we voted is neither of these things."
"It is a jumble of improbable details and I am surprised that the authors of the amendment to the annex did not add a paragraph stating that Members were entitled to send Christmas cards published by Parliament at their own expense!"
"On the subject of fairness, once the Statute has been adopted we want all Members of Parliament, whatever Member State they represent, to have the same allowances and the same statute."
"This is not the case if we approve a transitional regime."
"But I believe there is something even more worrying than this."
"The amendment which we adopted states that this transitional regime will only be applicable to the term after that during which the Statute is adopted."
"If the Council does not adopt the Statute before July 1999 - which is highly likely, or in any case not unlikely - the transitional Statute which we have adopted will apply from 2004 and the final regime from 2009."
"I have the feeling that when this text comes before the Council it will meet with hoots of laughter, and I regret that Parliament has approved a text under such conditions."
"I have a question I should like to ask."
"Once when I handed in an explanation of vote it was declared invalid because one is supposed to be present during this procedure."
"A number of colleagues whose names are now being read out are no longer here."
"Therefore, are their explanations of vote valid or not?"
"Yes indeed, Mrs Carlsson, you are quite right, I should have announced immediately after the votes the names of all those Members who are giving their explanations of vote in writing."
"But there was so much noise that I would have lost my voice."
"We have had a rather trying morning."
"I think that all the Members who have asked to give their explanations of vote in writing will be able to do so, even if they are no longer here at the moment."
"First of all, I should like to say that I naturally very much appreciate your excellent chairing of the sitting, as well as your accommodating stance."
"However, my remarks are intended to draw attention to the fact that a number of my colleagues left the Chamber a good deal earlier than during the general hubbub that took place a few minutes ago."
"Yes, they left when we finished the votes, Mrs Carlsson, and you are right, I should have done it."
"I shall do it next time, but I can assure you that shouting out Members' names in all the noise of everyone leaving is no easy matter."
"So we shall do as I suggest for today."
"Madam President, the vote which has just taken place on the Statute of Members of Parliament does no credit to the European Parliament. This is due to reasons of procedure and of content."
"On the subject of procedure, we have seen irregularity after irregularity."
"First at the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, where the rapporteur proposed the so-called compromise amendment when he should of course have proposed a new draft statute and opened a new deadline for amendments."
"At the start of the debate, the preliminary question we tabled was not put to the vote."
"In plenary session we voted in an order which was not the usual order for legislative resolutions."
"We even changed this order during the vote, to contradict a very clear vote which had just been given."
"Several amendments were inadmissible, but were nevertheless put to the vote; an absolute majority was required for the resolution as a whole, pursuant to Rule 50, which was not what was adopted."
"It is time - as our German colleague Mr Konrad said just now - that the European Parliament realised that it can only exercise its powers in the legislative field if it respects the Rules of Procedure, leaving aside the fact that the majority can blithely disregard those rules in order to impose its legal point of view on the minority."
"When a parliament considers that those in the political minority are legally wrong, we are no longer in a democracy but close to dictatorship."
"In terms of content, the text has one fundamental flaw, which is why the majority of members of our group are opposed to it."
"Members of the European Parliament must clearly continue to have a national statute, because it is their respective nations that they represent."
"Instead of that, the text adopted does no credit to this House because it seeks to solve a problem by throwing the ball into the Council's court, as I said yesterday."
"The majority rejected the rules of conduct concerning Members' financial interests and refused to ban gifts and fees paid to Members."
"The majority also rejected the general social security and pension regime applicable to Community employees. It adopted a so-called Community system, while at the same time increasing the references to national systems."
"It has approved a text which is not really a legislative text at all and which includes a great many details, as my colleague Mr Pasty said, and it has thus failed to respect the powers which it is to be given."
"I hope the Council takes this into account."
"Madam President, the European Parliament cannot be particularly proud of the Members' Statute we have launched today."
"It suffers from a lack of that transparency which we always like to invoke as one of the noblest aims of European legislation."
"That is why I voted for it reluctantly."
"Mr Rothley's original crystal-clear draft became increasingly muddied on the way into the plenary."
"Let me illustrate that with just one example."
"The proposed additional allowances for the President and other senior parliamentary officials, which the rapporteur had set out clearly in black and white for all to see, are now invisible beneath the silt."
"They are probably hidden somewhere in their trappings of office, which will be difficult, if not impossible, to penetrate."
"A similar situation obtains in other areas of the Statute."
"If we conduct our politics so secretively, we shall be doing Europe and its people a disservice."
"This is a black day for the European Parliament, and I find it regrettable that no vote was taken on Amendment No 18 and that the Group of the European People's Party managed to get its way with Amendment No 27, which sadly perpetuates a 'fortress Europe' mentality, stifling much of the potential inherent in the Treaty."
"Madam President, I voted in favour of this report but extremely reluctantly."
"I was torn between whether to vote for or against."
"I have a number of problems with the report."
"There is the fact that as MEPs we are voting, in the case of my country, to more than double our salaries."
"That is not going to go down very well with the Irish citizens."
"The fact that we are looking at an EU tax system for MEPs will also go against the grain with my constituents."
"When I had to decide whether to vote in favour or against one problem was the fact that the whole thing was tied into one package.There have been major problems with the travel allowance system and I do not know why we cannot tackle things individually."
"Instead, we say that we are only going to change the travel allowance system if we can increase MEPs' salaries."
"This is not acceptable and I do not think it will be acceptable to the Irish voter."
"A positive thing which has come out of this concerns the dual mandate."
"It was unacceptable that Members could sit in this Parliament and in their own national parliaments."
"With regard to salaries, it is not right that MEPs are paid different salaries for doing the same job but we have gone about it the wrong way."
"We are ruling out the involvement of national parliaments, national governments and the citizens who vote us in."
"Madam President, it seems we have adopted a confused and untimely text but, given the point we have reached, a bad text is better than no text at all, which is why I voted for it."
"There is, however, one idea which I definitely reject, and that is the right of outgoing Members to maintain their level of allowances, which means they have the choice, for the first parliamentary term, of opting for either the national or European regime, whichever may be the most favourable."
"This introduces a real privilege for Members of Parliament which is politically, morally and socially repugnant at a time of economic crisis and contrary to the very principle of parliamentary allowance which has never been a pecuniary right, let alone a privilege."
"I would remind you, Madam President, that this allowance is, as you well know, a working instrument won in the last century in order to combat privileges."
"I regret that Parliament has perverted one of the bases of our democratic constitutional regimes by voting itself an unacceptable privilege."
"Madam President, I had to vote against Mr Rothley's report as the whole issue of pay and the switch to a European Union system of taxation, or what in practice is exemption from paying taxes, and the travel expenses scheme, cannot be satisfactory from the point of view of the ordinary citizen."
"The travel expenses scheme still leaves us with the problem that MEPs can claim expenses for a business class ticket, even though they might have travelled economy class."
"This is one of the more blatant problems our citizens simply will not condone."
"I sincerely hope that in future talks, if the issue makes any further progress with the Council and the Commission, on the basis of a proposal approved by Parliament, this flaw in the system is eliminated and that travel expenses will be paid for the genuine costs incurred only."
"It is therefore up to the MEPs as to which class they choose to travel."
"But there should be no kind of chicanery or flat-rate payments made when the travel expenses are claimed later."
"We should like to thank the rapporteur for so bravely trying to elicit a reasonable level of agreement from the European Parliament on issues that involve risk as well as opportunity."
"Our standpoint on the report is based on the following."
"Article 190(5) of the Amsterdam Treaty states that: 'The European Parliament shall, after seeking an opinion from the Commission and with the approval of the Council acting unanimously, lay down the regulations and general conditions governing the performance of the duties of its Members'."
"We would like to see a system of allowances and expenses that is equitable, open to inspection and transparent as regards taxation and what the allowances cover. In particular, travel allowances should be related to the actual costs incurred in carrying out our mission."
"Consequently, we think that significant changes should be made to the present system."
"As a matter of principle, we think that all Members should receive the same salary, since we all carry out the same functions as Members of the European Parliament."
"Nevertheless, we do not think that the right way of devising such an allowance is by taking the average of current emoluments."
"It would be more appropriate to fix an allowance on the basis of a proposal put forward by an independent committee, which is how the matter is handled in the Swedish Parliament."
"We do not agree that there should be a generous transitional arrangement which would allow Members to opt either for the new allowance or to retain the current one."
"Such transitional arrangements run counter to the philosophy behind a common salary."
"We are flatly opposed to a common EU tax."
"Taxation should also be a matter for individual countries."
"Members of the European Parliament, unlike diplomats and Commissioners, live and work in their own countries and avail themselves of the public services which are financed by national taxes."
"We see this as a good reason for overhauling the pension scheme for Members."
"We think that Members should not belong both to national pension schemes for MPs and to the common pension scheme for MEPs."
"An important issue from our point of view relates to a common system for dealing with our present ridiculous system of travel allowances, which allows Members to make a large tax-free profit on travel."
"Under the present system, Swedish Members can make up to SKR 40 000 per month tax free on travel, whereas under the present proposal, reimbursement would be on the basis of actual travel costs incurred."
"Say the present proposal were to mean a salary of approximately SKR 56 000 - an increase for Swedish Members of some SKR 26 000 - the new system for reimbursement of travel expenses would lead to some Swedish Members losing out if a common system of allowances and expenses were introduced, since their tax-free profit on travel would disappear."
"A common statute is the only way to approach the present ridiculous system of travel expenses."
"We believe that it is inappropriate for us to claim travel expenses which do not correspond to actual expenditure, and we are also opposed to the proposal to fix the common salary on the basis of the weighted average of the existing Members' salaries."
"We would state most emphatically that we do not want our own allowances and expenses to be increased."
"We are aware that the present proposal has run up against a whole raft of national interests that not infrequently cut across party lines."
"In our explanation of vote, we would like to clarify our position, which is based on clear principles: respect for the European Parliament as one of the European institutions and the fact that the issue is covered by the Amsterdam Treaty."
"My votes - individually and overall - for each of the documents making up this report - leaving aside the detail - are votes for transparency, against hypocrisy, against anti-parliamentary demagoguery and against populism, in order to bury once and for all a process that has lingered throughout almost the entire lifetime of this parliament and placed the European Parliament and its Members on the pillory of tabloid-style reports which are both ignorant and likely to trigger off the public's most primitive instincts."
"The damage done to the European Parliament's image is incalculable."
"I would hold responsible for that damage the two Presidents of the European Parliament during this legislature and those Members who have given in to populism and did not have the political courage to defend the institution as a whole, punishing at the same time a (small) minority of prevaricators."
"Again, I would condemn the lack of solidarity demonstrated towards those Members of this Parliament who are less well paid by some very well paid Members, who took it upon themselves in their countries to moralise at the expense of other people."
"In the statute on remuneration and expenses that we have voted on I particularly approve the principle of non-discrimination on the basis of nationality; the idea of an objective assessment by independent persons of the activity of Members of Parliament for the purpose of determining salaries; the principle that, in the future, the European Parliament will not define its own remuneration rules, so that each Parliament will function with pre-defined rules when it takes up its functions; and the provisional solution of an average remuneration."
"However, I consider that the transitional option of voting for national salaries is a way of favouring the current statutes."
"I hope that my Portuguese colleagues who oppose the principle of equal remuneration will opt, under the transitional regime, for the national rate."
"This morning, the European Parliament sought to kill two birds with one stone by settling the continuing problem of Members' travel expenses and at the same time advancing the cause of federalism."
"When it would have been very easy to have simply stated that in future - as the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations has consistently demanded - MEPs will be reimbursed on the basis of actual expenses incurred, it has drawn up a vast draft Statute which seeks to harmonise virtually all aspects of the financial situation of Members of different nationalities."
"At present, MEPs receive their main salary from their respective countries and the reimbursement of expenses from the European Parliament."
"The European Parliament has sought to centralise and unify everything in Brussels, taking as its basis a principle of equality between Members which exists only in its imagination."
"The Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations wants all salaries and reimbursements to be paid solely by the Member States, in accordance with the general principle of Articles 137 and 138 of the Treaty, under the terms of which Members of the European Parliament represent their respective states."
"We regard this concept of a single statute as a genuine heresy which is likely to isolate MEPs still further from their respective countries."
"It is the negation of the Europe of Nations."
"In this respect, our group much regrets the position of President Jacques Chirac who, in his interview of 25 February 1998 with the President of the European Parliament, gave his agreement in principle to a single statute for Members of the European Parliament."
"This idea is now included under Article 190(5) of the Amsterdam Treaty, which has not yet been ratified, and which cannot provide a legal basis for the vote just taken by the European Parliament."
"We therefore contest this vote from every point of view. In our opinion, it is contrary to France's national interests."
"At the European Council meeting in Amsterdam, the Heads of Government agreed that Members of the European Parliament would have common, uniform conditions and that Parliament would put forward a proposal on a common statute."
"Thereafter, the form of the proposal was discussed in the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, by Parliament's authorities and by the various parliamentary groups."
"Mr Rothley, a German Social Democrat, drew up a proposal which, together with most of the amendments, has been adopted by a broad majority."
"We support the principle that Members should receive the same allowance irrespective of which country they come from, and that travel expenses should be reimbursed against the actual costs incurred."
"However, we differ as a matter of principle on the issue of how Members' allowances are taxed."
"We think that Members should pay the same tax and other charges as the people who voted for them."
"We have therefore decided to abstain in the vote."
"With this statement I wish to explain why I previously refrained from saying anything about this subject."
"I believe that the climate created, and the way in which this report is being promoted, do little to enhance the image of the European Parliament, especially as the forthcoming elections for the European Parliament draw closer."
"I also think there are much more serious issues that should be occupying our attention. For those reasons, I consider it my duty to abstain from voting."
"With Poujadism in the air in many circles which cannot find words strong enough to condemn what they call 'the political class, its advantages and its emoluments', I believe the time has come to point out once again that the remuneration of parliamentary office is an eminently democratic guarantee and that its introduction in the last century was welcomed as a great victory in the most progressive circles."
"It guarantees that every person who stands for election will be able to effectively exercise the office to which he or she aspires if elected - irrespective of that individual's financial position."
"A parliamentary salary also guarantees independence."
"Furthermore, there is no reason why the motto 'equal pay for equal work', which is so often and correctly applied, should not also apply to Members of the European Parliament."
"The present considerable salary differences depending on the nationality of Members of the European Parliament are therefore totally unjustified."
"It is consequently only fair that Members exercising the same political office should receive the same salary, be fiscally assessed on the basis of a uniform Community tax system (which cancels out the differing effects of national tax regimes) and receive additional allowances covering travel and secretarial expenses."
"More generally, the report on the Statute of the Members of the European Parliament has come at just the right time."
"I share the rapporteur's belief that this Statute must be as clear and transparent as possible in order to avoid any questioning of motives or accusations of possible hidden benefits."
"In this respect, I would have personally preferred no transitional regime to have been included and for all Members to receive the same salary from July 1999."
"That is why I abstained in the final vote on the annex."
"I believe that the introduction of a statute for Members of the European Parliament is a big step in the right direction, and I therefore nevertheless support the text before us today."
"On Thursday, 3 December we voted in the part-session against Article 1(2) of Annex 1 as we cannot accept that a Member of the European Parliament should pay tax only to the European Community."
"The work of MEPs is to some extent bound up with work carried out also in their home countries, where they have their regular place of abode, so that there is no justification for any differences in levels of taxation between them and the rest of the citizens they represent."
"MEPs should pay tax on the same basis as their fellow countrymen."
"Nevertheless, we voted in favour of the report as a whole because rejecting it would have led to a great deal of confusion, since we would have been leaving in place a system in which Members' travel expenses are not being claimed on the basis of the genuine costs incurred, which in our opinion they should be."
"We believe that allowing these rules, which we have been calling for and drafting for such a long time now, to come to nothing would harm the European Parliament's standing and reputation."
"We are elected as Members of Parliament for constituencies in our respective countries whose voters we represent."
"We therefore do not see any need to replace national rules relating to our terms of employment with a common statute."
"On the contrary, it is important for our conditions and electoral system to be determined in the countries we represent, so as to avoid the danger of MEPs representing EU interests instead."
"The usual argument in favour of this proposal is that we should have the same conditions, as regards salary, for example."
"But this is not what will happen. On the contrary, we shall go on having different conditions in the future."
"However, many of us would receive a large pay rise, which would be totally unjustified."
"Why should we receive higher salaries than Members of our 'regular' national Parliaments?"
"The proposal that we should have a special, very low EU tax is even more unwarranted."
"Why should we, as high income earners, not have to pay the same taxes as everyone else in the countries where we live?"
"Similarly, there is no reason why we should have advantageous pensions and other perks which exceed those provided for our national MPs."
"The Rothley report will do very little in terms of improving the functioning of Parliament."
"The effect of the proposal would be that we, as a small privileged group, would award ourselves even more benefits."
"My approach to Rothley is that we need a Common Statute to end discrimination between members from Member State and those from another."
"This requires a common salary."
"I believe in pegging this as a proportion of a judge's salary."
"Having a uniform salary means the need for a uniform tax."
"There is a clear precedent in that EU officials have a uniform tax system."
"The transition period is illogical."
"When a citizens stands as an MEP he should accept the salary on offer."
"The general proposition only, without the details, should be put to the Council."
"For the following reasons, we are opposed to the motion for a resolution on the common Statute for Members which Parliament has adopted today:"
"it is impossible to understand how the European Parliament can claim as a legal basis an article - Article 190(5) - of a treaty which has not entered into force, namely the Amsterdam Treaty; -Article 190(5) governs how Members of Parliament are to perform their duties."
"There is no basis for a common statute, EU salaries, EU tax and so on.The intention, as also specified in the report, is to weaken Members' ties with their home countries."
"We see this as unacceptable, since we regard it as an important democratic principle that Members should represent the electorate in their respective Member States."
"People should also, as a matter of course, pay tax where they live - even Members of the European Parliament."
"Unless the Council takes action to prevent this happening, as we hope it will, the outcome will be that MEPs construct a new EU salary and tax haven, which will do nothing to increase the respect and confidence of EU citizens."
"With regard to travel expenses, we have constantly asked for the system to be changed so that only actual travel costs are reimbursed."
"Parliament's Bureau could have approved this decision long ago, since it had the authority to do so."
"It has now been combined with the proposal for a Members' statute in order to provide an alibi for the latter."
"We voted against the report for these and other reasons."
"We are voting in favour, even though we support national taxation:"
"because adopting the proposal is the only way of securing the necessary dialogue with the Council on a common statute, and-because the proposal means that the rules on travel will be changed so that only the travelling expenses actually incurred will be refunded."
"Today Parliament will adopt a position on the Members' Statute."
"I should like to give the following brief explanation of my reasons for not supporting the proposal."
"In the report, it is proposed that all Members, irrespective of nationality, should receive the same salary."
"But if, as recommended in the report, the salary is calculated on the basis of the average of national MPs' salaries, Members from countries like my own would see their salaries raised by a substantial amount."
"I am unable to support such an increase in MEPs' pay."
"Nor can I support the proposal relating to a common EU tax, since I believe that all MEPs should pay tax in the country where they live."
"It is important that a system of salaries and expenses for MEPs should be as transparent as possible."
"How the money is paid and how it is used should be open to inspection."
"In this respect, I am delighted to see that the report tackles the issue of Members' travel expenses and that it is proposed to reimburse only the actual travel costs incurred."
"For the rest, I do not think the proposals meet the need for clarity and openness, in particular the proposal in the report that there should be a mixed system whereby some Members would be able to choose between the common salary and their present one, and the similar arrangement relating to Members' pensions."
"Furthermore, there are a number of other economic issues that are not satisfactorily dealt with in the report."
"For example, Members who hold posts outside the European Parliament would have different types of earnings and entitlements."
"I think that in such cases their European Parliament salary should be reduced proportionally."
"The Danish Social Democrats believe that Members of the European Parliament should be paid and taxed in the country where they are elected."
"Members are not based abroad, and should belong to the social security schemes which apply in their home countries."
"There can certainly be a common framework for salaries, negotiated by Parliament's authorities and the Council, but payment should take place on a national basis."
"We have voted in favour of a proposal that travel expenses should be settled on the basis of supporting documents, without any ambiguity, so that it is no longer possible for the price of a business class ticket to be reimbursed, even though someone has travelled in a different fare category."
"The aim is transparency, so that salaries and the reimbursement of expenses are both treated as such."
"It is quite extraordinary that the opponents of the EU in the I-EDN Group have used the opportunity to put forward a proposal that would in fact make it impossible to bring legal proceedings against Mr Le Pen."
"Of course those who are elected by the people should be held responsible for what they say and how they vote."
"The opponents of the EU evidently do not share this view, however."
"The European Parliament waived Mr Le Pen's immunity in October because of his statements that the gas chambers at the concentration camps were a detail in the history of the Second World War."
"Through today's vote on the report on a statute for Members, the Danish Conservative Members of the European Parliament wish to express their support for a clear and transparent statute, whereby in financial terms MEPs continue to be treated on a par with members of the national parliaments in their respective Member States."
"Likewise, the situation of Members in a number of other fields must be regulated individually by the Member States, including the question of the extent to which the work of a Member of the European Parliament is compatible with membership of a national parliament and/or other posts."
"The EU is an association of 15 independent states."
"Members of the European Parliament represent voters in their own Member State."
"Members' allowances and taxes should therefore be fixed in the countries where they live, thereby removing the need for a statute to establish a common EU salary and tax."
"The whole idea of an EU tax for Members of the European Parliament is mistaken."
"There is no reason why MEPs should reward themselves in a way that is not available to ordinary citizens."
"The setting-up of an EU haven only increases distrust towards the whole Community and has an adverse effect on cooperation within the EU."
"With regard to both this report and the previous one on the budget, I voted in favour of reimbursement of travel expenses against the actual costs incurred."
"The European Parliament should have taken a decision on this long ago."
"The issue ought to have been dealt with separately and not included in the proposal relating to a common statute."
"I therefore voted in favour of reimbursing travel expenses against the actual costs incurred - no easy matter, since the proposal was included in the amendment on the Statute."
"In the final vote, I therefore voted against the proposal on a common statute in its entirety."
"The common Statute is based on the Amsterdam Treaty which has still not entered into force, so this proposal anticipates the ratification of the Treaty by the Member States."
"Since this only serves to increase the democratic deficit within the EU, the proposal should have been rejected in the first place on these democratic grounds."
"I voted for the incompatibility of certain posts and against the accumulation of parliamentary offices."
"I agree that the reimbursement of expenses should be brought more into line with actual costs, while favouring a lump-sum limit in order not to have to increase control procedures."
"I also believe that parliamentary salaries must continue to be commensurate with the standard of living in the country of origin and with the salaries paid to those who sit in the national parliaments."
"Might not the communitisation of the parliamentary salary foreshadow the imposition of voting methods by the European Union and European parties?"
"These are all questions which merit a clear debate, both here and in all the Member States."
"We should not give in to the populist temptations which I reject, even if they do come from the left!"
"This is hypocrisy and populism made worse by the anti-parliamentarian attitudes often displayed by the media, which are actually often largely unaware of the work we do."
"Finally, I regret that the question of the end of a term of office and the return to professional activity is not dealt with in this draft Statute."
"Such a measure would promote greater democracy in the recruitment of Members!"
"These then are the reservations which led me to abstain in the final vote, although I approve of the adoption of a statute for Members of the European Parliament for reasons of democracy and transparency."
"My work and commitment as a politician are underpinned by values that encompass equality and the achievement of an equal society."
"Some of the worst injustices that our European citizens are enduring today are economic, and include a widening wages gap."
"The report contains a proposal to fix a common salary which, for Swedish MEPs, would mean a hefty pay rise."
"I therefore oppose a salary increase for Members of the European Parliament, partly because a narrowing of the wages gap is an important factor in achieving equality, and partly because Members already receive adequate salaries."
"I see no good reason why tax should be deducted at EU level."
"There should be a link between where one pays tax and what that tax is used for."
"As a Swede, and living as I do in Sweden, I benefit from the Swedish welfare system and should therefore contribute towards it."
"Consequently, I am a charge on public finances even though I am a Member of the European Parliament."
"I am therefore voting against the proposed 'EU tax'."
"The report contains a proposal for improving the system of Members' travel allowances."
"I am delighted that it is a more straightforward and honest system, so that Members will no longer be able to profit from the unfair travel expenses system currently in operation."
"The pension scheme for Members as set out in the report is not self-financing, but requires an injection of extra tax revenues so as to be able to provide adequate cover."
"All other pension schemes are required to be self-financing, and the same should apply in this case."
"I am therefore voting against the pension scheme."
"There is good reason for all Members of the European Parliament to receive the same salary when they perform the same duties."
"It is important that we have the same political responsibility and field of operations, as well as the opportunity to implement policies."
"There is much in the report that I am unable to support and which I am going to vote against. But in principle, I am in favour of a common Members' statute with regard to salary."
"I therefore feel that more time should be allowed for carrying this through, and under no circumstances should it lead to an increase in salary."
"In the vote on the Rothley report I felt obliged to keep abstaining in the unbelievably (and 'apolitically') numerous roll-call votes, only because of the decision by the Bureau, which I find unacceptable, to 'define' the presence and parliamentary function of Members, in its familiar insulting way."
"My real wish is to take no part in this process, because I think the whole way in which the issue of allowances has been addressed shows contempt for the European Parliament!"
"I have kept out of the whole voting procedure on the Rothley report concerning the Members' Statute."
"I did not wish to participate in the debate or in the adoption of a resolution, for the following reasons:"
"1.It is not the place of the outgoing Parliament to take far-reaching decisions affecting the Members who will be elected in June 1999."
"Such political activities ought not to have been initiated until after the European elections.2.At the start of a European election campaign, it is imprudent of the European Parliament to convey to the public the 'false' impression that its Members are chiefly concerned with their own interests.3.At a time when momentous decisions are due to be taken in Europe - the introduction of the single currency, the reform of the common agricultural policy and the Structural Funds, enlargement of the Union, reform of the EU's finances - I believe it is politically wrong to divert attention from these key questions by discussing Members' pay, a topic which invariably arouses enormous public interest."
"An initiative to change the current unacceptable system of allowances is most welcome."
"Travel expenses should be reimbursed on the basis of the actual costs incurred."
"We are voting against the Rothley report for a number of reasons, including the following."
"We do not think we can justify paying ourselves and our parliamentary colleagues what virtually amounts to a 70 % salary increase which, in our case, would be accompanied by a substantial tax reduction if salaries were to be taxed at EU level."
"We think we should receive the same salary as Members of the Swedish Parliament."
"Consequently, it is unacceptable for tax to be collected at EU level."
"Salaries should be in line with those of national MPs and tax should be paid in the countries in which MEPs live."
"This report does not just deal with a bureaucratic issue, as its title might suggest."
"It is to decide vital questions for the future such as what internal democracy in this Parliament really means and the balance of power between 'hard core' and 'peripheral' countries."
"If we had agreed - as almost happened - to separate two inseparable decisions, namely the approval of a single statute for Members of the European Parliament - in other words equal conditions for all, regardless of country of origin - and the approval of a new scheme for the payment of travel expenses on the basis of real cost, then we would have established a twospeed European Parliament."
"Members from peripheral countries on low salaries - such as the Spanish, Finns and Portuguese - would no longer be able to maintain an active presence in the Parliament nor would they be able to go on contact missions."
"However, the other Members - those living near the 'centre' and on higher salaries, in addition to various official positions in their own countries - would occupy that space and end up taking decisions by themselves."
"The fact that this was even a possibility is a serious matter."
"And approving a transitional period enshrining inequality between different Members is a worrying signal."
"Fortunately, common sense, strengthened by the combativeness of the 'weak' Members, defeated the arrogance and blindness of 'the strong'."
"But we escaped a black day for democracy by the skin of our teeth."
"I voted for the report in view of the difficulty experienced in achieving even this half-victory."
"But I am neither satisfied nor relieved."
"In our view, there should be more cooperation over the setting-up of supplementary pension schemes in the respective Member States."
"What is required is a coordinated approach in terms of similar procedures and precautions against discrimination, in order to facilitate the free movement of workers."
"The situation is unsatisfactory if different national regimes play a part in preventing workers from taking up employment in other countries, or expose them to the possibility of either forfeiting their occupational pensions or seeing their value decrease when they move to another country."
"We would therefore like to stress that the result of a coordinated approach should not be a pension scheme that is so far-reaching and detailed that it restricts the negotiating rights of those with contractual or occupational pensions."
"We would also stress that, in our view, pensions could be more widely used to provide investment capital, provided that due care and attention is given to effectively protecting the value of the pensions."
"A state pension scheme that guarantees economic security to all citizens in their old age in the form of a relatively high and income-related remuneration has been shown to be the best form of scheme."
"Nowadays, weak points are beginning to appear in pension schemes, due amongst other things to the inverted age pyramid in most Member States, which the report deals with."
"The result is that state systems have inadequate funds to guarantee financial security."
"In order to guarantee financial security in old age for those of us who are still young, Member States will have to deal with the weaknesses in their state pension schemes."
"We should be moving towards a general and universal social insurance scheme for the elderly."
"Supplementary pensions are just that: supplementary."
"Undoubtedly there are weak points in state pensions schemes, but if they functioned to everyone's satisfaction, which is the goal that I am working towards, then there would be no need for supplementary pensions."
"The preamble to the report is to be commended."
"Recital A states that, 'The State social security system... must remain the cornerstone of the Union's welfare system'."
"I am totally in agreement with this, but the report subsequently becomes contradictory and makes numerous points which I am unable to support."
"In paragraph 6 it is indicated that some private pensions have problems finding markets."
"Apparently, the situation would be improved by certain policy decisions, some of which are listed."
"I think that one of the biggest problems is the existence of weaknesses in state schemes but, above all, I cannot agree with the measures described in the report for facilitating investment, such as the privatisation of some industrial and financial sectors."
"This might be appropriate in some cases, but there are also sectors which should be collectivised in order to provide social security for our citizens."
"I am unable to support a text which so categorically advocates the privatisation of sectors which are of public interest."
"Consequently, the conditions of ownership in certain sectors should be a matter for individual Member States to decide."
"Nor am I able to support so-called 'equal competition between all operators' which, in my view, would lead to inequality between citizens."
"As I said at the beginning, a state pension scheme has been shown to be the best system as regards redistribution and equity."
"I therefore believe that it is the task of politicians to set limits on the development of supplementary insurance schemes. I also believe that their first concern should be to improve the state system."
"The effect of placing private and public operators on an equal footing in the pensions market could be to undermine state schemes."
"Paragraph 20 and subsequent paragraphs deal with harmonisation of tax systems, in particular the tax arrangements that would be required to accommodate supplementary pensions."
"The EU has no authority over taxation, and it is important that Member States should be able to devise their own tax systems in accordance with their social security policies."
"I therefore cannot support paragraphs 20 to 23, nor paragraph 26."
"The Commission is trying to extend the 'single passport' system applied in connection with insurance companies, banks and pension funds, and to liberalise investments by the latter in the context of the more general effort to develop the capital markets still further, and indeed it has given notice of a proposed directive to achieve those aims."
"We wish to stress that the issue of supplementary pensions is of capital importance for the millions of working people in the EU, regardless of the diversity of the respective national systems."
"The basic dividing line between the pensions provided by those systems and private pension schemes is that the national ones are provided by legal persons in public or private law, which are non-profit-making, while the others are clearly private and profit-making, and are provided in the context of life assurance agreements."
"We categorically oppose any attempt to equalise the legal status of those two forms of pensions."
"That would further undermine the public-sector insurance system to the benefit of insurance companies."
"The system of public social security as developed in the postwar years, of which the supplementary pension funds form part, is essentially distinct from the private insurance system, since participation in it is governed by statutory provisions and collective agreements, making it in essence compulsory."
"Besides, it is not by chance that these arguments for private insurance are being put forward at a time when, on the one hand, the suffocating financial restrictions imposed by EMU, the single currency and the stability pact, and on the other hand, the new employment policy and much-vaunted competitiveness are squeezing the life out of the public insurance system and are being used to bring about its gradual disintegration."
"Within that framework, it is characteristic that the attempt is being made to transfer responsibility for the organisation of insurance from the state to working people, either individually or at corporate level by means of group private insurance schemes, and of course at the cost of any notion of collectiveness and social solidarity and to the benefit of the profits made by insurance companies."
"Investment by pension funds is a critical issue which demands prudence, responsibility and effective control."
"The reserves in those funds belong to their worker-members and must not be gambled away in games on the stock markets."
"The continuing market crisis demonstrates the consequences that can come from the pursuit of 'high returns'."
"Those worries are intensified by the proposals to amend the provisions on preventive supervision and reduce the related requirements, and by the proposals to liberalise the regulatory framework which governs investment portfolios with the aim of increasing share investment."
"Indeed, what has changed since the time when the EU itself established such rules for life assurance companies, arguing that the diversification of assets among many categories of property elements and the imposition of quantitative restrictions reduce risk?"
"For us, this is an issue beyond debate."
"The amendments we have tabled emphasise our opposition and the basis of principle which leads us to reject any attempt to create a situation in which the management of pension fund reserves is liberalised and uncontrolled, leaving their assets to be gambled away on the stock markets."
"Though the report has some good points, it accepts the Commission's orientation and in some cases goes still further by calling for the application of competition rules to pension funds, on the basis of equal treatment with insurance companies."
"For those reasons, we will vote against the report."
"We welcome the strenuous efforts made by Latvia, not least in terms of adapting its legislation to meet the EU's criteria in order to facilitate membership of the European Union in the future."
"The process of enlargement towards Central and Eastern Europe gives us an historic opportunity to establish lasting peace based on the principles of freedom and democracy."
"It is vital that the EU should not betray the strong desire of the people of Latvia to see their country become a fully-fledged member of the European Union."
"The Commission should take this opportunity to send a clear signal to the people of Latvia that there will be no delay in opening negotiations."
"It is gratifying that the European Parliament is in favour of opening membership negotiations with Latvia without further delay."
"Nevertheless, I do not strictly agree with the rapporteur's reasons, when he 'notes the successes achieved by Latvia as regards the transition to a market economy, privatisation, containing inflation and balancing the budget'."
"It is a pity that the economic criteria imposed on the applicant countries are so strongly geared towards privatisation and the market economy."
"Capitalism and a market economy are not the most effective or rational ways to produce and distribute resources."
"In a world where 40 000 children die every day from starvation and related diseases, where 80 % of its people consume 20 % of the resources while others are rolling in luxury, where 90 % of the financial capital is used up in unproductive speculation instead of investment, one only has to look around to see that what is required is democratic control of the economy."
"Together we need to create a society where people have control over their daily lives."
"The objective should be to achieve a method of production which includes compensation for the pursuit of profit, solidarity to compensate for competition, and democracy to compensate for 'economism'."
"The enlargement of the European Union towards Central and Eastern Europe offers an historic opportunity to establish lasting peace, democracy and well-being."
"With regard to Lithuania, we are gratified by the extraordinary effort that has been made to adapt its legal system to comply with the EU's criteria."
"The EU should therefore give the people of Lithuania a clear signal regarding future membership of the European Union."
"In the reports which the Commission has just presented, it has failed to indicate any substantial differences that exist between the three Baltic states as regards the extent to which they have complied with the Copenhagen criteria."
"The Commission's reports do not furnish us with the information we need to decide why Latvia should have 'made particular progress', whereas Lithuania has only 'improved significantly'."
"Although we naturally welcome the fact that Latvia may be eligible to take part in concrete membership negotiations next year, we find it very hard to understand why the Commission should differentiate between the two countries as regards their fulfilment of the Copenhagen criteria."
"We do not think that Latvia and Lithuania should be treated differently in terms of opening negotiations, and both countries should be included in an accelerated process of enlargement."
"The report provides an insight into the long way that Turkey still has to go to meet the political, democratic and economic requirements for membership of the European Union."
"The report calls on the Turkish Government to fulfil its promises with regard to human rights, carry out judicial reform, recognise minorities like the Kurds, put an end to torture, abolish the death penalty and introduce freedom of opinion and freedom of the press."
"The report invites Turkey to put forward concrete proposals for complying with these requirements, resolving the Kurdish problem and setting free all political prisoners, including Leyla Zana."
"I support this proposal and have voted in favour of the report."
"However, I would say that now, as a result of Abdullah Ocalan's flight to Italy, the EU, OSCE and UN have a real opportunity to begin a peace process and bring to an end the 14-year war between the Turkish army and the Kurds and PKK."
"The global community has to put pressure on the Turkish Government to persuade Turkey to sit down at the negotiating table."
"Since Sweden is now a member of the UN Security Council, its government should take the initiative, as the Norwegian Government did some years ago to try to resolve the Palestinian conflict, and convene a conference in Stockholm for the interested parties, including the UN, OSCE, USA and EU, the Turkish Government, the PKK and other Kurdish representatives, in order to initiate a similar peace process."
"By and large, I am happy with the recommendations made in this report."
"Their intention is after all to improve relations with Turkey."
"In our amendments, however, we have sought to place the emphasis on the importance of finding a political solution to the Kurdish question in Turkey."
"I still think it is a pity that we concluded a customs union with Turkey before a number of essential guarantees on human rights and a peaceful resolution of the Kurdish question had been secured."
"Nor am I convinced that full membership of the European Union is the best format for future relations between Turkey and the European Union."
"Thousands of people are today languishing in Turkish prisons for having taken part in peaceful political activities."
"In the Turkish part of Kurdistan, 3 185 villages have been cleared out during the past 14 years."
"In 1997, 20 people died in circumstances which indicated that they had been illegally put to death by the Turkish State, and at least six people were tortured to death during the same year; approximately 20 million people have been prohibited from speaking their native language; one half of Cyprus is under Turkish occupation; and, according to Amnesty International, at least 6 000 people have died as a result of the war against opposition forces in the Turkish part of Kurdistan."
"The list of Turkish violations of such things as the UN Declaration of Human Rights is lengthening as Turkey goes on deliberately and systematically abusing its own citizens."
"The European Union, its individual Member States, other democratic countries and the international organisations have for a long time allowed Turkey to participate in a number of cooperation initiatives."
"The reason has very often been marketdriven, but it has also been to promote human rights and democracy in Turkey."
"As a result, some cooperation initiatives have been conditional on Turkey's guaranteeing to respect human rights - a promise it has failed to keep."
"In my view, such behaviour on Turkey's part shows how the land lies."
"It is time for democratic organisations and countries to try out new means for bringing democracy and human rights to the oppressed people of Turkey."
"For the above reasons, I am opposed to any further cooperation with Turkey on the part of the European Union."
"We abstained on the Swoboda report."
"The rapporteur regrets the fact that relations between the European Union and Turkey have reached a total impasse, due to Ankara's decision to freeze political relations."
"Mr Swoboda is all the more surprised and disappointed as he believes considerable progress has been made in considering Turkey's application since the Customs Union entered into force on 1 January 1996."
"The rapporteur lists the various positions adopted by the Council and the Commission since that time, confirming Turkey's 'European vocation' and its 'eligibility' for membership of the European Union."
"But Mr Swoboda fails to mention that relations with Turkey are at an impasse precisely because of this language of ambiguity and confusion."
"You cannot have it both ways."
"Either the Union believes what it says and Turkey is a European country, in which case it must start a pre-accession procedure and if it fails to do so Turkey is perfectly entitled to accuse it of being inconsistent."
"Alternatively, the European Union does not in fact believe that Turkey is part of Europe, in which case it should say so outright and stop pretending otherwise."
"Our group believes that identities need to be clearly defined and recognised before normal and constructive relations can be established with Turkey."
"Continuing ambiguity can only jeopardise these relations, which are essential for balance in the Mediterranean and western Asia, given the important role which Turkey plays and will continue to play in the Middle East and central Asia."
"It is because we support a concept of Europe clearly based on respect for the nation states of which it consists and which constitute its basis, substance and strength, that we want to see respect for Turkey's true identity and a calm acknowledgement that this great country does not belong to the European geographical and cultural whole."
"If we continue to deceive ourselves on this point we threaten to cause a deep and lasting crisis in our relations with Ankara."
"The Union's present inability to engage in clear speaking with Turkey says much about its own inability to define itself geographically and makes it look as if it is destined to become a vague, ill-defined mass, which will be doing it a great disservice."
"By contrast, a variable-geometry Europe will provide a solid basis for extensive cooperation with Turkey in areas of mutual interest."
"We were unable to support Mr Swoboda's report as it offers no way out of these dangerous ambiguities."
"Madam President, it is going to prove very difficult in the future to impose a single monetary policy on a structurally diverse zone."
"We have a small foretaste of this today with this motion for a Council resolution on the Economic and Monetary Union's external representation."
"Before having made any start at all on harmonising the substance of their external positions - despite the fact that we are just one month away from the euro - European and Member States' institutions have been tearing themselves apart over the question of how the Union is going to speak with a single voice."
"The final agreement satisfies everyone as it accepts that the Community's external representation will be jointly formed by three institutions: the Council, the Commission and the European Central Bank."
"The Commission, which drew up the original text, has seized upon the least important article in the Treaty to grab the limelight in joint representation when its initial claims to such a role were very weak."
"Now, as in the past, the European Parliament, its accomplice, has helped it in this escapade by serving as a stepping stone, on condition that the favour is returned."
"This situation leads us to make two points regarding the anti-democratic and incoherent nature of the method."
"Firstly, the Maastricht Treaty - in order not to frighten the voters on the political consequences of the single currency and to present the reform as a purely technical matter - did not clearly state that EMU's external representation must be supranational."
"Yet this is the solution which we can now see as ultimately emerging."
"The Commission will clearly seek every available means to increase its own importance by claiming to represent the general interest against the Council, which it will try to sideline."
"The outcome will not be one clearly chosen by the public."
"But manoeuvrings like this - and there are many of them in EMU - could also cause the euro to fail, as in order to conceal the final objective we are preparing to implement, during the intermediate period, a totally incoherent institutional system in which three European institutions will be competing on the international stage, plus the representations of the individual Member States which will remain, certainly for countries not joining the euro and perhaps also for certain others."
"This incoherence, when coupled with the others, could make the system unworkable. The federalists will then finally be punished for their sins and their lack of respect for democracy."
"In political terms, the European Union is a close cooperative association of independent nation states."
"As such, it cannot be classed as a state or an international organisation."
"Because of this hybrid nature, the external representation of the economic and monetary union in international forums like the International Monetary Fund or the G7 presents us with a problem."
"In statutory terms, it is simple."
"Only states can be members of most international groupings."
"And where individual EU Member States are members of such bodies, full membership of the EU or EMU means being represented twice over."
"In practice, however, it is desirable for the Member States taking part in EMU to express a common opinion or position."
"This can be done through the person of the observer."
"My initial feeling is that the presidency of the ECOFIN Council or perhaps the chair of the ECB Council would be the best spokesman for EMU - certainly not the President or a Member of the European Commission, because they do not provide the 'day-to-day administration' of the Union or EMU."
"It would be a violation of the allocation of responsibilities laid down in the Treaties to allow the European Commission to act as a pseudogovernment for the EU."
"For the above reasons, I was unable to support the Herman report."
"We are four weeks away from the launch of the euro and, according to the latest news, it was not easy to find a solution for representing the euro area at international financial institutions."
"Above all, certain Member States persist in having the Commission excluded from that representation."
"This reductionist vision of Europe, contrary to Article 109(4) of the Treaty and the conclusions of the Luxembourg European Council in December 1997, is also contrary to the spirit of 'more Europe' as characterised by economic and monetary union."
"Speaking with a single voice is not exactly the same as speaking with one voice only, which is what the Council apparently seems to want."
"On the other hand, it would be unacceptable if there was any new discrimination between small and large countries in the euro area over taking part in G-7 meetings."
"If small countries such as Portugal, Austria or Luxembourg have already shown their ability to preside over the fate of the Union, there is no reason why they should be considered as being of less political importance when it comes to taking part in G-7 meetings."
"The economic and commercial weight of the European Union strengthened by the constitution of the euro as a reserve currency and international reference currency, gives it special responsibilities in the reform of the world financial system and its institutions, in particular the IMF."
"The European Union is now a pivot in the field of the prevention and management of financial crises."
"Pointless discussions about the number of votes would only weaken its credibility."
"There are not going to be three voices."
"There will be two vocal cords in the same voice."
"That of the Presidents-in-Office of the 'Euro-11' will have an economic timbre and will rotate."
"The other, with a monetary trill, will be permanent and will be emitted by the President of the ECB."
"It is not the ideal solution because it humiliates the Commission, which is given only a secondary role, lending technical support within the Union's delegation."
"But, given the lack of time, it is preferable to take a slightly less than ideal decision than no decision at all."
"And it seems that that is what will happen."
"British Labour Members of the European Parliament abstained in the final vote on the Herman Report on the 'Representation and Position Taking of the Community at International Level in the context of Economic and Monetary Union'."
"This does not indicate opposition to the principle of the need for a mechanism to deal with the external representation of the current Euro 11."
"Rather, it reflects dissatisfaction with an over Communitization of this sensitive issue on the part of the European Commission."
"It is also an acknowledgement of the pre-in status of the United Kingdom."
"Bearing in mind, in my view at any rate, that the European Union should be based on international cooperation, I cannot support the assertion that 'exchange rate policy can be effective when it is supported by a coordinated economic and monetary policy' (Amendment No 1, recital 8)."
"Nor can I accept that, 'after coordination on the broad guidelines of economic policies has taken place, the Community should really speak with one voice' (Amendment No 2, recital 8b)."
"I think the ECB is deeply undemocratic in its structure, because of the way in which it appoints its governors, to name one reason."
"I am opposed to having a supranational European Central Bank which is free from all democratic control, and I am therefore not going to vote in favour of a text which says that governors will no longer represent their countries but the Monetary Union (Amendment No 4, recital 11a)."
"It is to the credit of Mrs Randzio-Plath's report on the global monetary and financial crisis that, for the first time, we find the beginnings of doubts expressed about the benefits of the euro."
"In particular, it calls on the European Union and the United States 'to maintain a balanced relationship between the rates of the dollar and of the euro', thus reflecting real and justified concern at the risk of increased volatility with a bipolar system in a context of general crisis."
"The report also stresses that 'the effects of crises on the European economy may not be evenly distributed, as individual Member States have different trade exposures to different parts of the world economy', which again expresses the fear that Europe will be the victim of an asymmetrical shock which a single monetary zone such as the euro zone will not be able to absorb without demanding important sacrifices of its population."
"However, it was for another reason that we did not vote in favour of the Randzio-Plath report, namely because it ends with a very dubious call for an increase in European investment expenditure in order to halt the slowdown in growth."
"Unfortunately, such a programme would simply increase the European Union's powers while at the same time inflating an already unbearable public debt, with future generations of taxpayers having to pay for our mistakes."
"Above all, proposals of this kind simply temporarily conceal the real problems and postpone effective solutions."
"France and Germany in particular are caught in the stranglehold of the burden of obligatory taxes on the one hand and the systematic opening up of trade on the other."
"To loosen this stranglehold we must introduce a genuine system to defend European trade while at the same time lightening the burden of the public sector, especially social systems."
"On this latter point, we must find a way of reconciling our principles of solidarity with more flexible social protection management."
"This is possible, as the Netherlands has already done it!"
"Under these conditions, the proposal for European investment expenditure, supported by all the Members of the left, simply serves to protect privileges and to artificially sustain already doomed systems."
"Mrs Randzio-Plath's report is based on the a priori assumption that 'cohabitation' can work."
"A few decades ago, this belief was fiercely upheld by 'progressive' political groups who sought to give it shape at national level."
"In this report, we see similar ideas being projected at international level."
"Just as government cannot totally control the financial sector at national level, and should not be able to do so, such control cannot and should not be entrusted to international organisations either."
"Of course there has to be better supervision."
"A greater degree of transparency is also desirable."
"This can be achieved through codes of conduct and harmonised accounting rules for financial institutions and companies, drawn up under the aegis of the International Monetary Fund or the Bank for International Settlements."
"In my Amendments Nos 12 and 13, I made the point that instruments of monetary policy cannot simply be used to stimulate investment in jobs."
"The call for the euro to be pegged to the US dollar is already an unnatural development and may prove a source of tension."
"Since these amendments were not adopted, this was ample reason to vote against the report as a whole."
"The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted in favour of the Randzio-Plath report on the international financial crises and their effects on the economy of the European Union, but against all the amendments."
"We voted in favour because the report contains many sound proposals on how to prevent crises on the lines of that in South-East Asia."
"The countries hit first and hardest by the crisis are characterised by not having carried out structural economic reforms."
"International accountancy standards are not being applied in the affected countries, nor is there any independent financial supervision."
"The international institutions should also be reviewed, including the Bretton Woods institutions such as the IMF, which has now been in existence for 54 years."
"The financing of the IMF must be increased and the transparency of the institutions improved, the Fund should have a greater degree of political accountability, and surveillance of the exchange markets should be tightened."
"To avoid the crisis spreading to the EU, it is proposed that a boost should be given to demand, for example by stepping up public investment and not regarding such expenditure as contributing to the public deficit."
"Demand should be increased, but it is difficult to bypass the requirements of the third stage of EMU, and the subsequent demands of the growth and stability pact may not be in the interests of the present and future Euroland."
"This means that we are voting in favour of the report as it stands, but against all the amendments."
"I will be voting in favour of this report, which highlights the serious consequences of the prevailing economic and financial system."
"The increased power of a transnational financial capitalism in which capital movements and speculations are more important than real trade in goods is causing serious imbalances, chaos and crisis, while inequalities between and within countries are increasing."
"The time has come to regulate economies and financial movements properly in order to encourage harmonious development for the benefit of the public."
"This is why the European Parliament must energetically support Mr Tobin's idea to introduce global taxes on capital movements."
"Simply referring to a code of good conduct and to the need for transparency is not a sufficient guarantee for the future."
"A system of taxation of capital movements will have a threefold effect, limiting speculation, providing better knowledge of capital movements, and recognising the principle of taxing capital."
"The argument for capital mobility is a pretext for reducing taxes and the growing imbalance between taxes and charges on labour and consumption and those levied on assets and capital."
"Finally, Mrs Randzio-Plath's report rightly alludes to the serious risks of reduced growth in Europe as a result of the world financial crisis and calls for a recovery of internal demand."
"Although the report stresses the need for major European investment, it does not mention the vital need for lower interest rates to help the recovery."
"Central banks, such as the ECB, seem to be deaf to the requests of many European finance ministers."
"The European Parliament is also missing an important opportunity to play its role in the 'democratic dialogue' with the ECB which it regularly calls for, because by being too slow to cut interest rates Europe risks being caught up in a spiral of reduced growth and then having to take urgent action."
"We all know, more's the pity, that the price of this impotence and reduced growth will be higher unemployment."
"This is why every effort must be made to correct it."
"The continuing financial crisis which began in Thailand has spread to the whole of south-east Asia and then to Russia and Latin America, and is characterised by sudden and lasting falls in the value of stock market assets and currency exchange rates, and the bankruptcy of giant financial institutions and other investment groups and major industrial enterprises."
"The governments of the large countries and the multinational capital directly involved in companies in those countries fear that the situation may get out of control."
"The framework of efforts to deal with the problem include the recent decisions by the G-7 Group, which the rapporteur approves but which do not address the essence of the crisis."
"On the one hand they are compelled to admit that the celebrated globalisation, under the conditions in which it is taking place led by major multinational interests, may prove catastrophic for the system they have created, and on the other hand they insist on their basic choice which, as the report characteristically puts it, consists in the existence of a 'world-wide financial credit market supported by technology and investors to pursue the greatest profitability'."
"There is no mention at all of control over profiteering capital movements, which are a fundamentally destabilising factor especially for less developed countries, and which are an integral element of the rationale of easy, quick and maximum profit."
"No concern at all is shown for the promotion of productive investments which would contribute to economic recovery and job creation."
"Before the crisis gets any worse and becomes more widespread, the Member States must adopt initiatives to increase public investment, support the public sector and divert the vast reserves of private capital away from stock market speculation and towards productive investment."
"In parallel, the EU must adopt the necessary initiatives to abolish tax havens for capital."
"It surprises us that the EU's official bodies have so far declined to perceive the risk that the crisis may spread further and begin to have an impact within the EU, pleading the supposed stability of the euro zone."
"They disregard the reality that extensive exposure of the European financial credit giants to countries such as Russia and south-east Asian countries is a potential timebomb for Europe's already vulnerable economy."
"They ignore the forecasts of the IMF and the OECD concerning slower development, clearly so as not to dampen the ill-justified euphoria about the imminent introduction of the euro."
"We categorically oppose any attempt to strengthen the intervention powers of the IMF and the other international economic organisations."
"This of course does not mean that we accept the system created by the Bretton Woods agreement."
"But the plans to create an Economic Security Council, to invest the IMF's Interim Committee with decision-making powers, or even to call upon private capital for emergency loans - together with the IMF - for countries affected by crises, will not only fail to solve the problem but also result in further restriction of the sovereign rights of the borrowing countries, the imposition of stricter austerity programmes on their peoples, and the creation of overcentralised structures with no accountability over the heads of national and regional authorities."
"We have no doubt that the crises will continue unless the policies and conditions which nourish them undergo substantive changes."
"The first victims of those crises are the millions of working people who are then called upon to bear the cost of the new austerity and restructuring programmes."
"Only they, with their coordinated struggle at national, Community and international level, can impose a redistribution of power at international level and promote measures which will mitigate and in the long run eliminate the causes of these phenomena."
"I abstained in the final vote on this report because Parliament did not comply with the rules governing a quorum laid down in Rule 112."
"I believe that the decision taken was in breach of Parliament's own Rules of Procedure."
"Parliament has now come to the end of its agenda."
"Adjournment of the session"
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"(The sitting was closed at 1.15 p.m.)"
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on 3 December 1998."
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of the last sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, I want to speak on pages 6 and 7 of the Minutes."
"As you have acknowledged yourself, a qualified majority was needed to adopt the Statute, an absolute majority of Members of Parliament."
"So I imagine it was a mistake that Recital g), which received 270 votes, was declared adopted, and likewise Amendment No 84 to the Annex, with 264 votes, Article 1(1) of the Annex, with 251 votes for the first part and 212 for the second, Article 2 of the Annex, with 279 votes for the first part and 288 for the second, Article 8(1) of the Annex, with 311 votes, and, finally, Article 5 of the Annex, with 297 votes."
"These provisions appear in the Draft Statute which was adopted."
"I believe they should not have been declared adopted and I do not think we can approve Minutes containing such a manifest error, especially as important provisions are contained in the text in question."
"Mr Fabre-Aubrespy, you will remember that you raised this question when the text came to be approved in the form in which its various parts had been adopted."
"It is when the vote is taken that the majority has to be established, and the majority was established at that point and easily obtained."
"I also told you that I would refer the matter to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure."
"You wrote me a letter which I shall forward to the Rules Committee in order to have a definitive interpretation."
"For the moment, these parts of the text are deemed to have been adopted in accordance with my interpretation of the vote at the time, right or wrong."
"They therefore stand adopted."
"The text has been forwarded to the Council, which moreover has just taken note of it at the European Council meeting in Vienna."
"However, your written protest will be forwarded to the Rules Committee without delay, so that it can consider this interpretation."
"Mr President, I asked you last time to consider improving the bicycle facilities in this building, such as by allocating one car-parking space in the covered car park for bicycles."
"I have not had any reply from you, although the President at the time assured me she would look into the matter."
"I would therefore ask you again, as I did last time, to ensure that improvements are made so that cyclists do not always have to take second place to car-drivers."
"Set one car-parking space aside so that cyclists have more room to store their bicycles out of the rain."
"Thank you, Mr Eisma."
"I shall investigate what exactly happened and why no reply has been forthcoming."
"Rest assured that you will receive a reply in due course."
"Mr President, I have just found out that Mr Zaldivar, the President of the Chilean Senate, who supported General Pinochet's coup d'état, is coming to the European Parliament tomorrow in support of Pinochet."
"May I ask in what context and on what grounds this visit is taking place?"
"You are misinformed, Mr Duhamel."
"The President of the Senate, Mr Zaldívar, was exiled for many years precisely because he did not support the coup d'état by General Pinochet."
"He is coming here to visit me, like any other Speaker of a parliament."
"I do not know the reason for his visit."
"That is not something that I ask other Speakers."
"I have Parliament's resolution."
"It was easy to reply to him, because Parliament has already adopted resolutions on the subject."
"Mr President, I have a point of order based on Rules 2, 5 and 119 of the Rules of Procedure."
"Messrs Falconer, Balfe and other like-minded Members will be pleased to hear that I have taken legal advice and that I intend to apply to the Court of First Instance to have the Bureau's decision of 15 and 16 December 1997 annulled, in accordance with the Beate Weber procedure."
"Once the Quaestors have taken a formal decision, a two-month period begins in which this application must be made."
"I shall spare you the arguments - one legal and one fiscal - but if I give this document to your Secretary-General, Mr President, I should be grateful if, as the experienced and authoritative lawyer that I know you are, you would consider whether the decision taken at the time to impose penalties for a refusal to participate in roll-call votes should not be reviewed in the light of the new Members' Statute."
"I would be most grateful if you could forward me a copy of the legal advice, Mr Janssen van Raay. I shall then, of course, pass it to the Bureau."
"This is not a matter of my personal preference, even though it might seem so at times."
"It is a Bureau decision, and in due course, the Bureau will decide whether the issue should or should not be reviewed."
"Mr President, I am very concerned about Members' safety and there is something I would like to warn you about."
"One Friday in Brussels, I had a group of visitors on the fifth floor of the LEO building, and at a certain point several people said that they could smell burning."
"It took 20 minutes of telephoning around the various services before any alarm was sounded."
"If there really was a fire in the building, this would be far too long."
"Would you ask the security services in Brussels to carry out tests to see whether Members would be in danger in that sort of situation?"
"There was not a fire on that particular occasion, but we were not to know that."
"Thank you very much, Mrs van Putten."
"Your comments have been noted and will be pursued with the security services."
"To date, what seems to happen is that nobody can do anything for 20 minutes because the lifts stop working during an alarm."
"However, the occasion you have referred to is different and we shall investigate exactly what happened."
"You will be informed of the result of the investigation."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Agenda"
"The next item is the order of business."
"The final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents pursuant to Rule 95 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed, to which the following amendments have been proposed:"
"Monday: no change"
"Tuesday:"
"Mr President, I would like to ask for a small change to Tuesday's agenda."
"The reports from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy are on the agenda, including my own report."
"However, a report on fisheries is slotted in between one of the Economic Committee reports and my own, which is then followed by another report on fisheries."
"In terms of time management for both Members and Commissioners, this does not make much sense."
"As this concerns the second reading, I would like my report to be taken before the Souchet report."
"It will take five minutes."
"That is a better solution, because our fisheries colleagues will not have to wait."
"So I would ask you to make this small change, which would also be appreciated by Commissioner de Silguy."
"I would gladly do that, Mrs Lulling, but you know that amendments to the agenda must be proposed by a political group or 29 Members one hour before the opening of the sitting."
"Unless I am mistaken, I have not received such a request."
"But I see that Mrs Oomen-Ruijten is asking for the floor."
"Mr President, this is something we overlooked, for which I sincerely apologise."
"I think Mrs Lulling's request is entirely reasonable."
"Her report would take perhaps ten minutes to discuss, and I think it is important to bring it forward."
"I gather from the expressions of colleagues on the other side of the Chamber, particularly Mrs Green, that they would not object to this."
"Things as they stand are organised very illogically."
"If there are no objections, I shall put the request by Mrs Lulling to the vote."
"(Parliament approved the request)"
"Is there a speaker in favour of the request?"
"Mr President, I must admit that events in the last few days have been totally unpredictable so far as the 1996 discharge report is concerned."
"I would have thought that the 1996 budget would have been rather more important than the 1996 discharge but history has told us otherwise."
"What we have heard this afternoon from Mr Fabre-Aubrespy is correct."
"We now have a report which is extremely tough on the whole question of management of the 1996 discharge and yet a very narrow majority, achieved by our Socialist Labour colleagues when one of us happened to leave, means that we are now facing acceptance rather than rejection or refusal to grant."
"In the light of the fact that we also have an unprecedented ruling that we now have to apply the Rules of Procedure in our vote rather than the Treaty, I suggest that we refer this report back to committee and bring it to our next part-session."
"Does anyone wish to speak against?"
"Mr President, I should like to oppose Mr Fabre-Aubrespy's motion."
"Once again he has demonstrated that he is a bad loser."
"I have never known a 14/13 vote to be an unacceptable majority."
"When he says we had new information, we have had no new information at all from the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities."
"All we have had is a reaffirmation of the existing Rules."
"In committee we had a very thorough debate."
"As Mr Elles rightly says, we make some very tough criticisms."
"But we have often made tough criticisms of the Commission without refusing them discharge."
"At one stage we asked for a deferment of discharge but since then we have had an improvement in the Commission's position."
"I have to say that it still has some way to go, but there are sufficient grounds for progress, in the view of the majority of the committee, for us still to go ahead and grant discharge."
"I hope that now we will reject Mr Fabre-Aubrespy's motion, having had this fully debated in the committee."
"I see that the chairman has asked for the floor but the chairman is a very partial person in this question, having herself tabled an amendment to reject."
"The chairman is entitled to express an opinion under Rule 126."
"Mr President, a while ago, I requested that you have the degree of incompatibility between the Treaty, particularly Article 206, and Annex V to the Rules of Procedure looked into, as well as those areas that are vague."
"I have just been in the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities, which you had asked to decide on the discrepancy that I have raised."
"No clear opinion, if I may express it thus, was stated on the matter."
"You will receive a letter from the Committee on the Rules of Procedure explaining its viewpoint."
"However, I should also like to say that as I have understood it, the Treaty ought nevertheless to take precedence."
"The matter has not been settled yet."
"It will be explained to you how far these matters are or are not compatible."
"I do not want to talk about discharge or refusal of discharge at the present time, even though Lord Tomlinson dwelled on this matter."
"I only want to say that as a Member of the European Parliament, I am of course free to decide how I do or do not vote."
"Mr President, I should like to tell Mr Colom i Naval that I do indeed know how to lose."
"But that is not by any means my problem at the moment, because we will certainly know one way or the other on Thursday."
"My question to the President is about when the members of the Committee on Budgetary Control will have the opportunity to reflect upon the findings of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities."
"A certain insecurity did of course prevail when we pronounced our opinion."
"That is why I would ask you to make some suggestion as to procedure, because in my view we simply cannot accept the opinion of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure on the subject without an exchange of views."
"That is why I would ask you when there is going to be a discussion on procedure."
"Mrs Müller, the Committee on the Rules of Procedure will put forward an interpretation, which is what the Committee on Budgetary Control requested."
"This interpretation will be put to the vote in the House without a debate."
"I hope that it will be possible to vote tomorrow, at the end of the morning sitting."
"The interpretation will naturally be read out to the House."
"This is the system laid down in the Rules of Procedure: the interpretation is to be read out and it will then either be adopted or rejected."
"Mr President, I do not think it is right that we should have to vote on the basis of information provided by certain Members about a decision apparently taken by the Committee on the Rules of Procedure."
"None of us has any documentation and we are being asked to take a decision."
"I would ask that in future we should be provided with the documents or reports we need before we are asked to decide on anything."
"Mr Martens, we did not vote on the decision by the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, but on a request for referral back to committee, which is something quite different."
"The Rules Committee will give its interpretation, which will be announced to the House."
"Rule 162(4) reads as follows: 'Should a political group or at least twenty-nine Members contest the committee's interpretation, the matter shall be put to the vote in Parliament."
"In the event of rejection, the matter shall be referred back to the committee.'"
"This means that as soon as we have the interpretation by the Committee on the Rules of Procedure - which I do not yet know myself - it will be read out to the House."
"Everyone will have the text sufficiently far in advance to be able to exercise the right provided for in Rule 162(4)."
"By contesting the interpretation, therefore, a group can ask for it to be rejected."
"Parliament will vote and take its decision after everyone has had time to read the interpretation and decided whether or not to contest it."
"Mr President, last Thursday afternoon the Conference of Presidents was told that it would be informed of the results of the discussion in the Committee on the Rules of Procedure on Wednesday afternoon, to prevent us from having to have an endless procedural debate here."
"I would like to ask you how these two things can now be reconciled."
"First of all, I would not like us to arrive here at 9 a.m. tomorrow morning to find a document that the groups have not had a chance to read, study and compare with statements by other groups, because the problem at issue here is an extremely serious one."
"Secondly, I think we must be logical in the order in which agreements are reached here in the House."
"If the matter is to be examined in the Conference of Presidents, then we cannot have a vote on it here in the plenary before that."
"Mrs Aelvoet, the Conference of Presidents is not competent to interpret the Rules of Procedure."
"There is a system, laid down by the Rules themselves, which I have just read out."
"As soon as I have the interpretation, it will be announced to the House and I will ensure that the text is sent immediately to all the groups."
"Whether the announcement is made this evening or at 9 a.m. tomorrow, you will have at least three hours before the vote in which to decide whether to contest this interpretation."
"Those are the terms of Rule 162(4)"
"Your group, or 29 Members, can contest the interpretation and Parliament will take its decision at the end of the morning."
"The Conference of Presidents is not competent in this area."
"I am sorry, but no agreement can override the Rules of Procedure."
"The Rules must be respected, and that is how we shall proceed."
"Mr President, before you close the item I initiated by asking for referral back to committee, I would like you to clarify something you said."
"I think the conclusion you have drawn from the rejection of my request for referral went too far."
"Rule 129(2) does indeed state that a request for referral back to committee may be made only once, but that is during each of the three procedural stages. These are: agenda-setting, which we are now doing; the opening of the debate, which will be tomorrow morning; and the final vote, which I think will be on Wednesday morning."
"So the rejection of my motion by no means rules out other requests for referral back to committee."
"We simply cannot do so again now, while we are setting the agenda, and we will only be able to do so once during each of the other two stages."
"That is correct."
"You are quite right."
"Mr President, I would simply like to ask you to move to the next item on the agenda."
"I think we have spent enough time on this point and everything has been decided."
"Thank you."
"I think that everything is settled, but it is no bad thing for Members to be able to express their views on such an important issue."
"Mr President, I just wanted to draw attention to the improper nature of this procedure. An issue that should have been settled before the meeting of the Committee on Budgetary Control is in fact being dealt with two or three days before the vote, putting us in this kind of situation."
"That type of thing should not happen in this House."
"If neither the Treaty nor the Rules of Procedure are clear about how we are to proceed, then it is your duty to resolve the matter in good time, before the Committee on Budgetary Control meets and not after."
"Then we would not have a situation like this."
"I agree entirely with you, Mrs Pack."
"For that to be the case, however, the relevant committee should consider the matter earlier."
"The Committee on the Rules of Procedure met as soon as it could."
"I apologise for this."
"Wednesday: no change"
"Thursday:"
"The Group of the Party of European Socialists is proposing that Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi's report on the quality of the drafting of legislative texts and Mr Cot's report on 'Better lawmaking 1997' should be taken as a joint debate."
"Mr Cot has the floor to explain the purpose of this request."
"Mr President, I will be brief because this is a very simple matter."
"The two reports are very closely linked because one deals with the procedure and the other with the substance, so it would be absurd to have two separate debates on two reports given that the connection between them is so obvious."
"Mr President, I support what Mr Cot has said."
"It makes sense for both reports to be debated jointly, as they deal with the quality of text and the quality of ideas."
"Form and content are always closely connected."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"(Parliament approved the request)"
"Friday: no change"
"(The order of business was adopted thus amended)"
"Supplementary and Amending Budget 1/98"
"The next item is the report (A4-0497/98) by Mr Tillich and Lord Tomlinson, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the draft supplementary and amending budget of the European Communities 1/98 for the 1998 financial year - Sections I and III (C4-0677/98)."
"I give the floor to Mr Tillich as rapporteur."
"Mr President, at the end of April 1998, the Commission submitted the draft supplementary and amending budget for 1998. The Council and the European Parliament agreed during the 1998 budgetary procedure that if the Commission discovered that the payment appropriations were not sufficient for the 1998 financial year, then we - both Council and Parliament - would give favourable consideration to a supplementary budget for 1998."
"The Commission fulfilled its duty and submitted the supplementary budget."
"This draft plans to increase payment appropriations in the third and fourth categories by ECU 200 million, including ECU 100 m for PHARE. There is a further ECU 100 m for the European Social Fund, ECU 150 m for Section I, the European Parliament, and the ECU 400 m that you mentioned a moment ago for emergency food aid to Russia."
"In various trilogues and in both conciliations with the Council, Parliament and Council agreed that this report on the supplementary and amending budget would be taken as a package together with the Notenboom Procedure and the budget for 1999."
"I would like to assure colleagues that in its proposals the Council was most accommodating towards the European Parliament."
"Parliament is supporting the allocation of ECU 400 m for emergency food aid to Russia as the Council wanted, but on condition that distribution is guaranteed, action is taken to prevent fraud and the food reaches the needy."
"On 8 December, during the conciliation, there was a common vote on this between the three institutions in order to reach agreement on the remarks for the budget line, and today the Commission delivered the latest proposal as an annex to the supplementary and amending budget."
"I should like to point out to the House that it is important for us to vote today because the deadline is tomorrow."
"If today at first reading we do not agree this supplementary and amending budget that the Council has already adopted, it will be dropped."
"Then we would not have a supplementary and amending budget for 1998 and consequently it would not be possible for us to ensure the financing of our buildings in time."
"As regards the amendments that have been introduced by colleagues, I would like to add firstly that these are covered by the remarks on the budget line, and secondly that we shall have a debate on the regulation tomorrow which should, I am sure, cover what colleagues have asked for."
"Mr President, part of the supplementary and amending budget is ECU 150m for Section I of the budget. That relates to Parliament and this money is allocated for Parliament's buildings."
"If we debate that in two and a half minutes, it means that Parliament is gaining ECU 60m a minute during this debate for capital purchases towards our buildings."
"The resolution adopted by the Committee on Budgets is explicit that the Council has included this sum of ECU 150m for the buildings of Parliament so that we will be able to continue the policy of purchasing its buildings where the conditions are appropriate."
"The purchase of buildings for Parliament will lead to significant savings for European taxpayers."
"All Members of Parliament will realise that in Brussels in particular, but subsequently for the IPE IV building in Strasbourg, we have been using the annual ramassage to make capital injections for our buildings."
"This policy has been so successful that perhaps Members of Parliament do not know that we already own what was known as the D1 and the D2 parts of our Brussels building and a substantial part of D3."
"With this supplementary and amending budget, we will be closer towards becoming the owners of the D3 building and therefore the whole of the Leopold complex."
"If we continue with the process of ramassage , we will be able to do the same not only here in Strasbourg with the IPE IV building but also for some of Parliament's buildings in Luxembourg."
"That is all part of the ambition, as well as making sure that the Belliard I and II buildings are purchased and made available for the Committee of the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee."
"This supplementary and amending budget takes us another large step along the road to being able to own our buildings, to save money for the future."
"I commend it to the House."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution and the President declared supplementary and amending budget 1/98 adopted)"
"Interpretation of the Rules of Procedure"
"Fifth RTD framework programme (1998-2002)"
"The next item is the report (A4-0493/98) by Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl, on behalf of Parliament's delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council Decision concerning the fifth framework programme of the European Community for research, technological development and demonstration activities (1998-2002) (C4-0646/98-97/0119(COD))."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it took four conciliation meetings for us to obtain this conclusion and this conciliation result, which I think is a record."
"Now the question that naturally arises is whether the result actually justifies all the effort."
"As rapporteur, I believe I can say that yes, this is a good result from the point of view of Parliament."
"From the beginning, we could see that the Council had adopted the main points of the structure and content of the framework programme, some of which had been adopted by us with an overwhelming majority, leaving only details to be modified."
"That was not the difficult part of the procedure as a whole."
"In its great wisdom, or for fear of the potential developments, the Council introduced some changes and some articles which were not at all acceptable to us."
"We are in the run-up to Agenda 2000, in the run-up to perhaps a new financing of the European Union, which may also have effects on research policy and mean that changes may have to be made."
"However, as a legislative authority it was not acceptable to Parliament that the Council alone was to vote and decide on possible changes."
"We have succeeded in again making full codecision necessary for all future changes to the framework research programme, as stipulated in the Treaties."
"A further point which was very important for us, although it may not have met with much of a response in the public discussion, is that we are living in a time of rapid change and great flexibility."
"In the period 1997/98 we cannot know what problems may arise in the period 2000/2001 and what issues may need to be resolved with the help of research, innovation and innovative products."
"We have therefore insisted on a review of the content of the programme halfway through its term."
"We are not keen on starting a cumbersome procedure in two or three years time."
"But if new trends are being introduced at that time, possibly by a new Commission, then we would like to have a say in them, and this is also something that we have succeeded in making sure of."
"A third point that we were very concerned about was that small and medium-sized enterprises are taken into consideration in the framework research programme."
"We have seen that recently a great amount of progress has been made in this area, not least due to the efforts of the Commission."
"However, if small and medium-sized enterprises are regarded as the backbone of our economy as far as job creation is concerned, then we must remove all potential difficulties from their path so that they can have as large a share as possible of the research funding that should eventually lead to jobs."
"We have increased the share of small and medium-sized enterprises accordingly."
"We have also introduced rules to facilitate access."
"The Council has approved these demands, albeit after lengthy discussions."
"That brings me to what I have to say is one of the bitter aspects of the result of the conciliation, which is the overall budget."
"I cannot deny that we would have preferred to see a different figure precede the billion."
"In view of the small difference in the amount, I would say to the Council that it was really quite small-minded of the Ministers not to have given way."
"It was only a difference of 0.26 % after all."
"I am fully confident that the Commission and the Commissioner can save this amount through good, streamlined and efficient management in their area, and will not insist upon taking it away from research."
"As Article 1 states, at a later stage Parliament will also follow the management of the programme."
"I have to say that a conciliation is actually fought with very unequal weapons."
"In Council unanimity is needed."
"Ministers say that they have fully agreed on something and then hide behind the person who just happens to be opposed."
"In Parliament majorities are needed."
"For approval of the result of a conciliation, we need a different type of majority than that required for rejecting the common position of the Council."
"This is simply no longer progressive or in keeping with the times."
"I am firmly of the opinion that the Amsterdam Treaty, which has extended our rights and facilitated many procedures, will serve well here."
"I now come to a very pleasant part of my statement, which is to thank the Commission for its constant cooperation and our very fruitful discussions."
"We were not always of the same opinion, Commissioner!"
"I would also like to thank Members on the other side of the House. Dear colleagues, I am aware that some of you went to the limits of the possible."
"You did not necessarily allow yourselves to be budged, and neither did we."
"But I know that it was as difficult for you as it was for us to reach this result of the conciliation sometimes, particularly where institutional matters were concerned."
"I would like to emphasise that the rights of this House are at stake in the run-up to the election, and this result of the conciliation came about in the end because all of you showed solidarity."
"I can only say that this solidarity should form a precedent in this House where all of us - the elected representatives of the citizens - are involved."
"For that I thank you very much indeed!"
"I now have a final comment on the specific programmes which are going to be discussed in a moment."
"Once again, we were aware of the fact that the Council had already reached broad agreement on these specific programmes."
"It gave out a few, very unfortunate, press releases in this regard."
"I would say to the Council that we are going to take a very close look at whether the amendments which will be discussed today and voted on tomorrow shall find their way into the final version of the text, and here we shall also insist upon our rights."
"In conclusion, I can say quite honestly that everything has been resolved, but it took one and a half years of work to do so."
"I should very much like once again to thank all those who have helped."
"As rapporteur I am happy, and I shall be looking forward to a unanimous vote tomorrow in favour of the result of the conciliation."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by heartily congratulating the rapporteur on the result achieved in the conciliation procedure."
"The fifth framework programme for research is the first small step in the right direction."
"Sustainable agriculture, fisheries and forestry, and the integrated development of the rural area and mountainous areas should also be funded and find expression within the context of research and science."
"Nevertheless, I think it is highly regrettable that no serious approach to this forward-looking policy can be discerned in the proposal for Agenda 2000."
"I personally am very angry about that."
"The Austrian Presidency of the Council made this subject a high priority, and held a conference of international experts on the subject."
"I hope that ultimately those findings will also be taken into account in future European policy."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we had already introduced a multitude of amendments for the Committee on Transport and Tourism at first reading."
"We were after a separate emphasis on transport policy, which was unfortunately not possible. However, we were very glad that it was possible to preserve the results and content of the first reading until the third reading now in the conciliation procedure."
"I recall in particular intermodal transport, a subject which we were very concerned about."
"One of the great successes of this conciliation procedure is that we have also managed to preserve the significance of aeronautics and space travel."
"I would like very much to thank all of those involved, particularly the rapporteur."
"We regret that it was not possible to make available enough money for transport, which is an important field and a motor for European integration. The Council was unable to take up the big challenges that this field offers and would rather go on backing its national policies."
"I think that transport is an area in which more Europe would be better than less."
"Mr President, although I am speaking on behalf of the Socialist Group, I am in fact doing so more as chairman of the delegation which conducted the conciliation negotiations. These, as Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl has said, proved extremely difficult: in fact it took four meetings, two exploratory ones and two at which we really tackled the substance of the matter."
"I should like to draw some general conclusions."
"First of all, the incompatibility of unanimous decision-making in the Council with the conciliation procedure emerged clearly."
"There can be no equality of legislative competence if the Council is bound by the unanimity rule, which automatically leads to vetoes; the Parliament is unable, under such circumstances, to exercise its powers of codecision to the full."
"Secondly, I have the impression from this and other experiences that the concept of codecision has not been fully taken on board within the Council."
"We noted once again during this latest conciliation on the fifth framework programme that the various delegations, speaking on behalf of their respective countries, stressed how arduous it had been to arrive at the common position, regarding that in itself as an extremely difficult compromise to achieve, almost as if Parliament should then simply decide whether to take it or leave it, rather than embarking on fresh negotiations to reach a further compromise."
"Thirdly, I should like to take this opportunity to highlight the shrewdness of our delegation's attitude and conduct, as well as the ability and experience of the various colleagues who are so familiar with the subject in question. They enabled our delegation to present a united front at every important juncture, demonstrating a unanimity which is often very difficult to achieve in this House."
"I must say that we were assisted partly by an Austrian Presidency which was keen to move in the direction advocated by Parliament, and partly by the Commissioner, Mrs Cresson, who was of course on our side, given that Parliament's proposal dovetailed with that of the Commission."
"Nevertheless, the obstacles were truly enormous."
"I wish to draw attention here, as did the rapporteur, Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl, to the two main issues."
"First of all, there is the Council and the way in which it has taken up the concept of codecision: a Council which inserts into its common position what it itself describes as a 'guillotine clause' demonstrates a lack of skill, not least from the tactical point of view."
"Presenting Parliament with such a position means failing to understand the substance and even form of the reaction likely to be triggered by such a clause."
"The clause in fact stated that not a single euro would be available for research after 31 December 1999 and that, in the absence of any decisions on the new financial perspective, it would be the Council which decides. In other words, codecision had come in through the door and was being thrown out of the window."
"The real point was this: paradoxically, on every other occasion when we have gone to conciliation we have argued over figures, but this time we had to talk more about institutional procedure, even before we could complete our discussion of the figures."
"In our opinion, as we have said several times, this represented an infringement of the Treaty, or at least of the interinstitutional agreement on the financial perspective."
"And here, after the Council's statement of its common position, it might have been useful if the Commission as such - and not so much Mrs Cresson - had pointed out that a principle of the Treaty was being undermined, given that the Commission is guardian of the Treaties."
"Nevertheless, I am reasonably satisfied in this regard, since we did achieve a fairly positive outcome."
"With respect to the funds available, as Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl said, there could have been more, but we might equally have obtained less."
"On balance, I believe that the outcome is a good one, as long as we abide by the terms of the negotiations."
"However, I would raise one 'but', one contradiction: the governments say that the priority is employment and that we must invest in research and innovation in order to boost job creation, and then in the final analysis the Council - that is, all the governments together - will not even countenance the idea of increasing by ECU 2 billion the funds available for the fifth framework programme."
"Therefore, what was said at this conciliation conflicts with what was discussed and decided at Vienna: grand statements and the new proposed pact for jobs, but no specific initiative just at the very moment when conciliation was coming to a close."
"I would merely thank the rapporteur, the chairman of the committee, Mr Scapagnini, and all the colleagues who participated with such commitment. I invite the House to demonstrate its wholehearted support for the outcome of this conciliation."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Francis Bacon said that whoever fails to find new solutions should expect new evils as time is the best inventor of all."
"Those are the words of a great European 400 years ago. But it seems that Europe is still learning that lesson."
"Innovation is a condition for survival: it is the antidote to inertia, it creates new, hitherto unthought-of markets and it promotes a more effective and more human society."
"In order to have social innovation you must have research, research in high-tech areas such as biotechnology, research applied to industry and also research in the social and economic areas."
"The fifth RTD framework programme has acquired coherence throughout the debate with its three readings and long conciliation process and is now presented to us as a balanced programme deserving of broad support."
"It could even be seen as a model of interinstitutional co-operation."
"The prospects offered by this fifth framework programme for researchers, enterprises and the well-being of citizens should not be jeopardised by a lack of agreement over the European Union's financial perspectives."
"The conflict between the defenders of so-called 'stabilisation' and the defenders of 'cohesion' should give way in the Council to an overall perspective that takes into account all of the interests at stake."
"In the text that we are going to vote on, the winners are transparency, information, small and medium-sized enterprises, and the fragile sectors of society, such as the disabled and the elderly, and a fillip has been given to the outlook for peace, with the specific references to biological and chemical disarmament and the exclusion of nuclear armament."
"Nonetheless, I hope that the Council, on 22 December next, will strengthen the socio-economic research component, as Portugal has been asking, which in itself will make it possible to predict trends and factors of change in a rapidly changing society such as ours."
"Fundamental questions such as citizenship, participation, exclusion, violence, governability and the role of the media call for a close and continuous study that should meet with appropriate responses from society."
"We must also strengthen the interdisciplinary perspective, the international perspective of European research."
"That is why I hope that the Marie Curie bursaries are going to be opened up to nationals of countries that are not members, as symbolic recognition that science, like music, is a universal language."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Liberal Group I should like to congratulate Mrs Quisthoudt on her success in concluding the decision-making on the framework programme."
"I should also like to express my appreciation for the solidarity shown by all the groups during the conciliation procedure."
"Parliament spoke to the Council with one voice and was solid, yes, solid in defence of its own powers."
"We refused point blank to accept the guillotine clause, and through close cooperation which was entirely consistent with the aims of the programme we achieved excellent results on both the budget and the contents."
"I would like to thank all my colleagues for their cooperation, and my group wholeheartedly supports the results we have achieved."
"There are a few comments I should like to make."
"Starting with the substance of the programme, my group is delighted that the Council even at first reading agreed with Parliament's proposal that we should choose four research areas for the next four years."
"The Council and Parliament also agreed to give priority to the first two areas, namely biotechnology and information and communications technology, in acknowledgement of the fact that employment in Europe in the future will largely depend on the successful development of those sectors."
"Technology, as I cannot emphasise too often, is the key to economic growth, competitiveness and employment - in short, Europe's prosperity."
"If we in Europe can apply new technological developments and develop new services, it will not just mean more jobs, it will also give a powerful boost to the economy and put us in a much stronger competitive position."
"This is what Europe needs to maintain its position on the world market."
"All of us - Council, Parliament and Commission - share this view, but despite all the fine words from the Member States and the Council, the European Union's research expenditure lags far behind that of its main competitors, the United States and Japan."
"As I said, unfortunately, the Member States are happy to support research with fine words, but not with money."
"The ECU 14 billion that the Council originally proposed was not even as much as the budget for the fourth framework programme."
"The policy pursued by a number of Member States is designed to reduce their contribution to the European Union."
"If we look at the position of, say, the Netherlands, which is a net contributor, then this is quite right."
"Yes, quite right."
"We are not idiots."
"But sitting up until all hours of the morning on three occasions haggling over ECU 40 million spread over four years is really going a little too far."
"Research and technological development is exactly the sort of area where European cooperation is needed."
"The framework programme plays an essential role, and this is where, in my view, European investment in research really comes into its own and brings major added value."
"The decision-making process for this framework programme has not exactly been a thing of beauty, but there is hope."
"It is a sign that after the ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty the Council might decide on framework programmes by a qualified majority."
"The Council is still not used to the codecision procedure, as Mr Imbeni just pointed out."
"Codecision means joint decision-making, and this means that the Council and Parliament have to reach a viable compromise."
"For the Council arrogantly to insist on its own hard-won compromise is not good for decisions on European legislation."
"Good decision-making, I would point out to the Council, demands greater flexibility from the Member States."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thanks to the rapporteur's determination and the efforts of the chairman of the Conciliation Committee, Mr Imbeni, the European Parliament and the Council have reached agreement on an amount which is certainly not enough but does make it possible to continue the European Union's research effort."
"The principle of a mid-term review ensures that developments in the financial perspective are taken into account, along with progress made in science and technology."
"Parliament also won the day on five important points: maintaining a 10 % rate for financing research by small and medium-sized enterprises, research concerning biological and chemical disarmament, no funding of cloning for purposes of human reproduction, taking account of research into ageing and disability and, finally, the establishment of a René Descartes Prize for talented and promising researchers."
"I want to highlight two areas in the fifth framework programme which will have direct consequences on daily life in Europe."
"One is information and communication technologies, accessible to all, respecting the rules of info-ethics, which aim to allow everyone to express their own personality and to facilitate the exchange of information."
"The other is technologies of living resources, supporting not just the cell factory but also the fight against infectious diseases and ageing."
"The bio-ethics arrangements are now in place to prevent deviance, and specific socio-cultural characteristics of the Member States must be taken into account, particularly as regards embryo research."
"The Joint Research Centre must become a reference centre serving the concerns of the European Parliament and hence of the citizen."
"Finally, in the field of research into nuclear energy, we certainly must not abandon permanently research into controlled thermonuclear fusion. We need to maintain scientific and technical vigilance in this domain, which retains its potential for the future."
"Similarly, I think it is essential to pursue and extend research into the safety of nuclear fission, with a view to perfecting ever safer reactors, such as the EPR, in collaboration with several European countries, but also with a view to better management of the end of the nuclear fuel cycle."
"We must continue research into high-temperature reactors in industrial enterprises and research must be done on experimental modules for hybrid reactors; the necessary technologies need to be validated."
"They can then be assembled with a view to making an experimental prototype."
"Through research that is conducted transparently, nuclear energy is actually the most reliable way of responding to the growth in demand for energy, without increasing CO2 emissions."
"In conclusion, under these conditions the fifth framework programme for research and development will make it possible to identify the skills of European researchers and laboratories as well as to look for complementarity between them right across the European Union."
"It will demonstrate the effectiveness of European added value."
"It will take us from a Europe of researchers to a Europe of research."
"That is one of the major challenges of the fifth framework programme, serving knowledge, but also serving the citizens, in an ethical context."
"With the fifth framework programme Europe will be able to take its place in the western world, earning world recognition through the skills of European researchers."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on her diligence and her persistence during the many meetings of the conciliation committee, and likewise all the members of that delegation and in particular the chairman."
"As he has pointed out, we wanted real co-decision and this was being blocked."
"We finally obtained an acceptable result and for that Parliament has to be grateful."
"I have to say that the devil is in the detail and I want to make some comments on the secrecy and lack of transparency of the Euratom research programme in particular."
"It is now apparent that nuclear fusion has no future. It is therefore madness to continue the budget for the framework programme."
"I believe that the Commission has accepted the logic of this and we will see what transpires."
"In particular, I want to refer to the radiation protection programme run under the Euratom Treaty."
"Within the programme there is a self-perpetuating oligarchy."
"The programme is decided at closed meetings to which only existing research coordinators are invited and by government advisory committees."
"These people represent mainly the radiological protection boards of the member governments and, as such, represent those in the member countries who get Euratom grants."
"A case in point is Ireland where three of the four members of the national advisory committee, namely Jim Malone, physicist, Nuclear Medicine Department, St James's Hospital and RPII board member, Peter Mitchell, Department of Physics, UCD and RPII consultant, John Cunningham, radiation chemist, RPII Assistant Chief Executive, are employed by or otherwise affiliated to Ireland's Radiological Protection Institute and are funded by Euratom."
"The remaining member is a civil servant in the Department of Energy."
"Every other Irish national advisory committee involved in the EC programme has a broad representation from all interested parties and has 12 to 16 members."
"So the way the Euratom programme is managed is unacceptable."
"There is a similar lack of openness in the so-called independent review of submitted projects to this programme in Euratom."
"Somehow the reviewers seem to get funded."
"Application to see the complete list of reviewers is refused."
"Why is the list of reviewers not published?"
"It is for all the other programmes."
"It is absolutely essential that radiation protection research should be conducted by those without vested interests and should therefore come under the environment and health section of DG XII."
"I want to press that point most firmly."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should also like to express my thanks to the rapporteur for the clever and committed way in which she has dealt with the situation."
"We have worked well together."
"Yes, we have also argued, but we have achieved success."
"The increase of EUR 1.7 billion in the fifth framework research programme compared to its predecessor, which was obtained by Parliament, seems at first sight to be a considerable amount."
"However, what must be understood is that it is only about 4 % more than the increase to allow for inflation in relation to the previous programme."
"This is not exactly the clear and self-assured signal of a resolute departure into the information society that we had intended."
"I should remind you that the USA launched an offensive this very year to bring its annual aid for research up to 3 % of its GDP in the very near future."
"European aid, however, will remain at roughly 2 %, because unfortunately, aside from a few exceptions, national research is also diminishing."
"Unfortunately, as a result of obstruction by some Member States, the Council could not be persuaded to cross the apparently magical boundary of EUR 15 bn."
"We will thus be far from reaching the strategic ceilings on research in the overall EU budget that were wisely instituted by previous Councils."
"That is regrettable and in this regard the fifth framework research programme will be a compromise, many sections of which can only be accepted by Parliament because otherwise the continuity which we have now achieved in European research funding would be jeopardised, and this would be painful for all involved."
"Ultimately there was nothing else for it, because this programme in principle suffers from a congenital defect, as has been said repeatedly, namely that Parliament decides in accordance with democratic rules by a majority vote while Council decides unanimously."
"That will only change when the Treaty of Amsterdam enters into force."
"Then it will be possible to approach the budget strategically, and rival minority interests will cease to be a significant obstacle."
"Restructured management of the fifth framework research programme will allow the Commission at least partly to deal with the dilemma of a range of subjects that is still too broad by establishing links."
"It also wants to bring together its different strategic advisory bodies into a European research forum."
"We welcome this and shall support the Commission in the process."
"Tomorrow's decision will not mean that Parliament will relinquish its demand to be involved. Rather, it will accompany the implementation of the programme."
"A realisation of the concentration and flexibility that everyone wants will be part of the critical accompaniment."
"Adjustments to the programme which may become necessary will be made only according to the codecision procedure."
"In view of the EU's considerable negative trade balance with the USA and Japan in the field of high technology, the general under-funding of European research is worrying."
"A certain balance could only come about by consistently making maximum use of results."
"In this respect, we have improved considerably the opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises, some of which are highly innovative and labour-intensive, to participate in this programme, and this is one of Parliament's big successes. It has been achieved, as has already been said, by Members being united."
"Optimising the possibilities and, as said so often, achieving a European added value will also lead to the general integration of socio-economic research into projects and increased funding for it in the fourth action line."
"Innovation in fact not only has a technological aspect but also a social one."
"Converting research into profitable application on a massive scale will also depend to a considerable degree on how far it is possible to organise the new global information society in a way that is socially fair, and therefore involves comprehensive participation."
"I think that is where our greatest potential lies."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my group I should also like to thank the rapporteur."
"I was searching for an image before, and then it struck me that this is like being faced with a bunch of individualists with their own pet ideas, and reconciling them is akin to the task of organising a large number of wild horses to make a good impression in a Spanish riding school."
"That is what you have achieved."
"Once again, thank you very much."
"It was not easy, but you have succeeded!"
"On the framework research programme as a whole, I would like to say in all objectivity that it was the European Parliament once again that pushed through an increase, something we have seen in each decade."
"My advice to the Commission would therefore be to work closely with Parliament, as this will be worthwhile in future too!"
"However, as the Council is being so tight-fisted with its money it has to be told that the only thing more expensive than research in the long run is no research."
"If we want to secure our future, as many people have said, then broadening the knowledge base is the only way, and at the beginning that is simply going to cost money."
"Secondly, I would like to say that once again I have had the bad impression that research does not really have a lobby."
"Where are the large research organisations in Europe that supported us?"
"Everyone wants a small piece of the large cake, but they do not want to see the cake as a whole made larger."
"If that does not change, and if science in Brussels does not acquire a stronger lobby equivalent to that of other sectors, then it will continue to find things difficult in future as well."
"Let us now turn to the tasks for the future."
"My first point is one that the rapporteur rightly raised a short while ago, namely that the lifespan of products is becoming shorter and shorter, and knowledge evolving faster and faster. Because European research policy concerns itself with applied technology and its goal is therefore to bring products onto the market, it is important that as the lifespan of a product becomes shorter, the application procedure does the same."
"I know there are limits to this, and of course there are also the budgetary and financial checks, but we must find ways to make sure that the end result is not that the system of financial supervision is in order while research is in ruins."
"That should not be the outcome."
"We should not have financial controls which last for three or four years, during which time nothing is achieved in the field of research."
"We must make the procedures shorter."
"This becomes even more important as more countries participate in the fifth framework research programme."
"Central and Eastern European countries will be part of the research programme as well via the PHARE programme, and Switzerland will join them in a few years once it has signed the agreement."
"That means that if management is not streamlined - of course after taking on board the rules arising from the financial and budgetary checks - then we will be dealing with a more complicated system than in the past."
"The second comment that occurs to me here is that we also need some form of monitoring, not merely budgetary monitoring but better monitoring of research. There has to be a strategic and operational goal."
"Ultimately there has to be some result."
"The issue is not just that money should be used sensibly but that there also has to be something to show for it."
"We do not just want to search, we also want to find."
"That is forgotten again and again."
"In order to do this, instruments must be developed which go beyond what we presently have."
"Over the next few months we will surely have time to think about this."
"I am sorry that an application for research on disarmament did not get through."
"The Council proved to be quite stubborn."
"However, I would like to mention a report that I read a short while ago in Le Monde , in which the Americans referred to the existence of new problems in the field of atomic, biological and chemical weapons, or weapons of mass destruction."
"We cannot deny this, and will have to deal with it because it is also a part of security."
"Research has to be used not only to develop new weapons but also to protect ourselves from their misuse. Above all it must be used to dismantle the weapons upon whose reduction we have actually agreed."
"Once again, I thank the Commission very much indeed."
"I think we have done a good job."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, later this week we will be dealing with the results and conclusions of the Vienna Summit."
"However, one thing has been clear from the outset, namely that the most important matters discussed by the Heads of State or Government were employment issues."
"I think that the conclusion of the conciliation procedure for the fifth framework research programme lays a very important foundation stone for tackling employment issues in Europe in a different and more forward-looking manner than has perhaps been the case for a long time."
"In Europe, many people live together in a very small area."
"Our territory is appreciably smaller than that of other continents, it is populated by many people, and we do not have the natural resources of other continents."
"The resources that we in Europe have are knowledge, ability, our aptitude and skills. This explains the importance of research programmes, which aim to create European added value and to achieve more than can be achieved by teams of researchers in individual countries."
"They are also concerned with what can be accomplished when researchers work together and combine their ideas and results and when, as the previous speaker said so clearly, these results can also actually be implemented."
"Research is not an end in itself, rather it is the basis for the social and economic development of our continent. For that reason, when organising the research programmes we should not merely be thinking about covering many important subjects in the projects and programmes."
"I am extremely happy with many of the subjects, because we are venturing into areas of research that are important and necessary for the future of Europe. We have also taken on areas of research that people thought had been dealt with long ago and which in my opinion will be of greater significance in future, such as foodstuffs."
"However if we do not actually transpose the research results in terms of employment, the development of new products, the inevitable social restructuring and transition to a new type of society that moves away from the industrial society in which we still live, or whose upheaval we are experiencing, then even the best research will be of no value."
"In our discussion on the fifth framework research programme in particular, we should be considering the mid-term evaluation and orientation of the programme to be at least as important as a final point which I should like to turn to now."
"We in Parliament have worked together very well and in the right way, and in this regard I would like to express my great thanks to the rapporteur, the chairman of the delegation to the Conciliation Committee and other colleagues."
"The Council should have understood that a larger sum than this - 14.9 something, a figure reminiscent of a special offer in a cheap shop - was required."
"It is not acceptable to preach repeatedly about the importance of research and then, when it actually comes to making money available for research, to become so stingy with small amounts all of a sudden."
"I hope that the different procedure in the Treaty of Amsterdam will improve things."
"Finally I would like to say that, as an Austrian, I am happy that the Austrian Presidency has concluded - and indeed was able to conclude - such a difficult procedure. I very much hope that with this programme we will be able to achieve the objective of European added value in research."
"Mr President, if we look at the developments of the past few weeks and compare them to a piece of theatre, we can see that there are three acts."
"In the first act the European Parliament pushed through considerable improvements. In the second the Council accepted them, but incorporated some catches."
"In the third there was the lengthy conciliation procedure."
"Thus it is a piece of theatre in three acts."
"I do not know for certain if it is a play, a drama or a tragedy, but I am aware that it is not a comedy, essentially due to the conduct of the Council."
"There are three areas in which it behaved like a bulldozer."
"Firstly it attempted to take research hostage for interests that were altogether different and had absolutely no connection with it. That kind of behaviour is by no means acceptable."
"Secondly, as Mrs Graenitz has just pointed out, we have heard about the importance of research for innovation, employment and so on, in sermons from various sources, but when it came to committing money, the tap was turned off purely due to a rigid adherence to principles, and nothing was invested in research. It did not even have to do with making savings, as the money withheld from research now flows into other areas of internal policy."
"My third point concerns the specific programmes, and here, as the rapporteur pointed out, press releases are being published as though everything had already been decided without Parliament."
"I very much hope that this bulldozing behaviour will not be typical of the Council in future."
"All of this would lead us to believe that we are dealing with a drama here, not a comedy."
"But on the other hand, we have accomplished something."
"There has been a strategic change of direction in European research, away from the sectoral thinking and rare technologies, and towards a strategic approach to the European development model and qualitative competitiveness in Europe."
"In this respect, what Mr Linkohr referred to is implicitly and explicitly contained in the research programme."
"We are concerned with the integration of research into European policy to create more employment and thus of course with the matter of how research fits into the social context."
"In this regard I am very glad that Parliament has managed to have socio-economic aspects of the information society taken into account, that the ageing of our society is to be a focal point of research, and that the city of tomorrow is to be a subject for research as a central problem of urban areas."
"The direction that we are aiming in is thus clear."
"So, be it drama, tragedy or play, I will be voting in favour!"
"Mr President, Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl, ladies and gentlemen, with this third reading in the European Parliament, we have reached the second-last leg of a long and sometimes difficult journey."
"As this journey comes to an end, I want to express my sincere thanks to everyone in Parliament whose dynamism, intelligence and negotiating ability have made success possible."
"First Mr Imbeni, who was authoritative and effective in his difficult role as joint chair of the Conciliation Committee, and next Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl, rapporteur for the fifth framework programme, who produced work of the highest quality at each procedural stage and demonstrated realism and a great sense of the public interest when it came to conciliation."
"My thanks also go to all the members of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy and its chairman, Mr Scapagnini, who has devoted himself to this new framework programme for many months."
"Thanks too to all the Members of Parliament who contributed to its progress through the other committees and the House."
"In her report on the joint text that emerged from conciliation, Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl gives a very clear and detailed account of the development of the procedure and of these last two stages in particular."
"The final agreement which is to be ratified by you tomorrow, ladies and gentlemen, and by the Council on 22 December, is a compromise like all agreements, and I would like to make four points concerning it."
"First, a solution was found to the difficult question of the amount of financing."
"Of course, the amount is not as high as Parliament and the Commission had proposed."
"So to have real impact we will have to apply the principle of concentration of resources more strictly, which means mobilising a critical mass of funding for specific targets."
"However, I would stress that the budget for the fifth framework programme will be 4.6 % higher in real terms than that for the fourth framework programme."
"In a difficult budgetary context, this increase is a positive sign and an encouragement both to the scientific and industrial community and to Member States, where the research effort is tending to contract at a time when public and private research expenditure is continuing or picking up in the United States and Japan, as some of you have quite rightly pointed out."
"Secondly, throughout the procedure there has been a strong convergence of views between Parliament and the Commission, and their mutual support and highly effective collaboration certainly played an important role in securing the agreement."
"Thirdly, thanks to the Austrian Presidency's spirit of openness, Parliament has broadly succeeded in having its views on the fifth framework programme taken into account in the final decision."
"For the last time, we had to overcome the obstacle to codecision represented by unanimous voting by the members of the Council."
"In spite of that constraint, the scientific and technological choices will express significantly the vision of your institution, ladies and gentlemen, you who represent the people."
"Finally, the fifth framework programme will be broadly consistent with what our two institutions wanted."
"The research programmes will be clearly geared to economic and social needs, with priority given to business competitiveness and employment."
"The key actions will introduce a new approach to research."
"This will focus on actual problems rather than being broken down into fields and disciplines."
"Through the external advisory group just established by the Commission, the programmes will be implemented in close association with the scientific community, industry and users of the research."
"They will be managed in a more flexible and effective way."
"There will be real emphasis on transparency, especially as regards the European Parliament."
"So the combined efforts of the three institutions have succeeded in endowing the Union with a powerful instrument to exploit its scientific potential and industrial resources in the service of Europeans."
"It would have been extremely regrettable to interrupt the European research effort, and the adoption of the new framework programme within the required time-frame means continuity can be assured."
"Now comes the real challenge."
"We must implement the fifth framework programme as soon as possible."
"The Commission has already taken all the necessary steps and will ensure that the first calls for proposals are launched, as planned, at the beginning of 1999."
"It will make sure this is done even more effectively, as Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl rightly insists."
"This new framework programme can be implemented in the spirit which presided over its conception."
"I am sure that the debate that is about to begin on the specific programmes will demonstrate that here the Commission can count on the support and collaboration of the European Parliament, its suggestions and its constructive vigilance."
"So I will conclude by thanking Parliament in advance for its contribution to this great enterprise."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Specific RTD programmes (1998-2002)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the life sciences have hitherto been divided among three different programmes but they are now combined in a single, problem-oriented programme."
"The Commission has found a poetic title for it, 'Quality of life and management of living resources', but if I have understood the contents correctly, then it actually has to do with life sciences."
"There is going to be an increase in funding compared to the fourth framework programme, in fact a considerable increase of 42 %."
"In relative terms, this is the biggest increase for a sector in the fifth framework programme and reflects the importance that has to be attached to the development of life sciences in the European Community."
"European life sciences and technologies have already had successes over the last few years."
"Most significantly, the number of employees and firms in the EU has risen considerably in 1996 and 1997, by over 40 %."
"But here, too, there is a negative side because this figure is less than half as high as the American equivalent."
"This path can still lead to success, but only if progress is made in the scientific foundations and infrastructure in this field and in the social consensus on it, particularly of course with regard to the hotly and widely disputed gene technology."
"Enlightened social discourse is therefore a prerequisite, not only for legitimising the aims of funding research, but also for making the best use of the results, and Parliament is reinforcing its demands to make it a part of the programme."
"In addition, some colleagues are demanding that new bans on research funding and moratoriums are written into the programme."
"Let me tell you, I do not think much of that!"
"For example, it will not provide us with a way to solve problems resulting from the possible eugenic misuse of gene technology."
"The most effective solution here is still the ostracism of those who behave in this way, thereby contravening the ethical consensus."
"The funding programme should consist of projects and not bans."
"Projects that are ethically controversial simply do not belong in the body of the Community programme."
"Of course, the consumer's decision is extremely effective."
"Products which contain undesirable substances, or which have been manufactured in an undesirable manner, and which are accurately and clearly labelled, are not going to stand a chance on the market."
"That is and always will be the bottom line."
"I would therefore explicitly support the extension of accompanying socio-economic research which looks at the relevant issues, and the obligation of the Commission and those running the project to be part of the public discussion."
"Parliament has insisted on writing this into the programme."
"The programme describes very many interesting individual projects, illustrating the importance that is being attached to the life sciences, as I mentioned at the beginning."
"But it also seems to me that it highlights the dilemma of Community funding of research, which is that 125 priority themes are still supposed to be funded, more than in this case. If there are 125 priorities, that means that there must be other, non-priority, projects."
"The sum total is colossal. It will then be allocated by the Commission down to the thousandth part among the key actions, as the budget allows."
"That therefore leaves no room for manoeuvre at all in response to the quality and number of project proposals submitted under the various key actions."
"It will not facilitate compliance with the principles of concentration and flexibility."
"In this regard, Parliament calls for practical steps, such as the establishment of financial margins."
"The days of breaking down the claims for funds in such a precise manner ought to be a thing of the past."
"In spite of the multitude of amendments, the way in which the programme has been worked out is basically such that Parliament would not call into question the Commission's fundamental idea."
"So I would recommend then that having regard to the amendments proposed by the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, the programme should be approved."
"Mr President, I wish to speak on the second thematic programme, the one concerning a user-friendly information society or IST, information society technologies."
"This programme is in fact a priority which is directly linked to the potential for boosting economic growth, wealth and employment, as was underscored by the ministers meeting at the recent Vienna European Council, and as emerges from a Commission document on the prospects for the information society."
"Following the conciliation procedure, this programme has been allocated a budget of ECU 3 600 million, which is lower than the allocation accorded to the ACTS, Esprit, RACE and Telecommunications programmes combined."
"This is a cause for some concern, even though the reduced investment in research could be offset by the growing presence of information technology in the other thematic programmes."
"One case in point is the networking of all the European research establishments, which accounts for 3 % of the thematic programme; here I have put forward amendments stressing the need for involvement in the coordination of every thematic programme, so that this ambitious networking scheme can be taken forward in a coherent way."
"As far as the Commission's proposal is concerned, we would ask Parliament to endorse certain important rectifications suggested by myself and largely endorsed by the Research Committee. I should now like to run through these rapidly."
"I have suggested curtailing slightly the funding for the action on electronic commerce, transferring this to services for the citizen."
"Indeed, if we expect administrations to act as trail-blazers in the implementation of new services for citizens, we must somehow encourage this approach."
"I have also highlighted the importance of basic technologies, emphasising the move towards platforms, technical and industrial standards, patents and ultimately whatever can promote the creation of products and services which are widely used on the international market - not only on the European one - and can thereby generate economic and commercial success."
"I have included a reference to information technology in the machine tools and production sector, a sector which is absolutely crucial to the competitiveness of our industrial system and to complement the thematic programme on sustainable development."
"I responded to concerns regarding the participation of small and medium-sized enterprises in this programme by accepting the cross-party amendment in favour of a minimum guaranteed SME participation of 10 %."
"I would however point out with satisfaction here that, according to the Commission's data, the participation of SMEs in IT programmes has traditionally been around 26 %;"
"I therefore believe that this amendment should be understood more as an encouragement to boost the qualitative and quantitative participation of SMEs. I recommend for their sakes that the exploratory awards scheme, modelled on the CRAFT programme, should be maintained to provide assistance during the phase of drawing up proposals."
"Since information society applications have a satellite dimension, we are constantly in a situation of competitive disadvantage vis-à-vis the Americans; I am therefore pleased to note that the programme takes this aspect into consideration."
"Whereas I can certainly agree with the ideas behind the amendments from the Committee on Women's Rights, some of these, in particular Amendment No 8, strike me as impracticable."
"In conclusion, I believe that it is vital to make clear to the Commission that not only a high degree of flexibility and focus, but also care and attention are required to avoid duplication between the various programmes."
"I believe above all that Parliament must keep an eye on the Commission in this respect."
"I nevertheless thank the Commission for its cooperation, and am relying on the Council to adopt the proposed amendments."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since we have reached agreement on the fifth framework research programme in the Conciliation Committee, we can also discuss the specific programmes today."
"This evening I am presenting a report on behalf of Mr Argyros."
"The specific programme 'Competitive and sustainable growth', provided unfortunately with only EUR 2.7 billion, is made up of the most significant priorities for the European Union. It is therefore of fundamental importance for a successful implementation of the fifth framework research programme as a whole."
"Allow me to make four general comments on this programme which should be taken into account when it comes to selecting the research partners."
"Firstly, and I think quite self-evidently, the activities undertaken should be in tune with the proposed requirements as they are presently stated in the programme."
"Secondly, and this is an important point which we have discussed again and again in this House, I think that the Commission's publications should also be made available in accessible forms, for example electronically."
"Thirdly, in committee we laid down some conditions for selecting the companies to be funded, and I would ask the Commission to accept these."
"The contribution made by a company should improve the overall competitiveness of the sector, and therefore due attention ought to be paid to applying the sectoral approach to individual research projects."
"There should ultimately be an improvement in the position of the European economy as a whole on the world market."
"The knowledge that has been acquired through the research programmes should be analysed and made available, and should also lead to new processes and products."
"Fourthly, we must also of course remember that our competitors in the USA and Japan are carrying out similar programmes, and we have to be able to react to these accordingly."
"A wide range of themes for research is available in the four key actions and the two horizontal measures in this specific programme, which I would also like to comment on."
"In the first key action, our concern is that alongside what has been proposed, additional new methods of management and human resources are also developed and entrepreneurial activity further encouraged. That is very important."
"However, it is also necessary for us to think about methods for the recovery and restoration of the damaged environment to its original state."
"In addition, the committee suggests that this should also cover production and the textile and construction sectors."
"In the second key action, we are faced with the huge task of continuing the development of different transport systems and intermodality in order to be able to react in a suitable manner to the great challenges in this particular field. I mentioned this when I presented my report on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism a few minutes ago."
"I think it is extremely positive that we in the European Union are for the first time making a separate priority of the field of aeronautics and space flight, because the business news of the past few weeks has shown in quite a dramatic way that this is the way to do justice to the European dimension of the sector."
"Finally, when it comes to funding the research infrastructure, some thought ought to be given to using existing structures, particularly so that the small and medium-sized enterprises can be appropriately integrated."
"On behalf of Mr Argyros, and also on my own behalf, I would like to thank all of you for your friendly cooperation with the rapporteur."
"Madam Commissioner, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it has fallen to me to give you the details of the fourth specific programme, which is part of the first action and concerns energy and the protection of the environment."
"This was therefore what Parliament did, in a programme entitled 'Preserving the ecosystem'. A special feature of this programme, and one which is not very helpful, in my opinion, Madam Commissioner, is that it includes demonstration projects."
"We are all calling for more resources to be devoted to research."
"I agree with previous speakers that ours are not old or antiquated industries. Rather, they are obsolete, and what they must do is modernise their facilities."
"Subsidies and other aid are not what is called for."
"It is true that, for example, Parliament's Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy is strongly in favour of subsidies for renewable energy."
"Of course we all support renewable energy, Madam Commissioner."
"Nevertheless, for it to succeed, become more efficient and play the part it should on the market, what is required is more research, more innovation and fewer subsidies."
"I shall now refer to the six key actions that make up this specific programme: four relate to the environment, and two to energy."
"Firstly, I should like to congratulate the Commission and thank it for including, as a key action, everything concerned with research into technology relating to the management of water resources."
"We know that what mankind will lack in the twenty-first century is water."
"No particular difficulties are anticipated in connection with energy; if there are any, they will be speedily resolved."
"There will, however, be serious problems regarding water supply. The European Union must develop technology, equipment and much more efficient management techniques so as to be in a position to export significant amounts of equipment and services."
"I therefore feel that both aspects of the programme on water resources are very important: the management of water resources and water quality."
"The second key action covers climate change and biodiversity. These are truly crucial issues."
"What more is there to say about climate change? It is of great concern to us all and so closely connected to the dreadful disasters that are affecting people with such meagre resources to draw upon."
"Being so poor means that for them the consequences are far worse."
"Furthermore, it is on climate change that the future of mankind surely hinges. Everything else depends on it."
"The third key action concerns the integrated management of marine ecosystems."
"We have used the sea and its resources in so many ways, yet the sea, which covers the majority of the surface of our planet, tends to be forgotten. It hardly figures in research and investigation."
"I very much hope, therefore, that the integrated management of marine ecosystems will receive a significant boost. The citizens of the future will also be heavily dependent on them."
"Finally, the fourth action under 'environment' relates to the city of tomorrow and cultural heritage."
"Madam Commissioner, as has often been stated in this House, cathedrals, tapestries and great palaces are all part of Europe. They represent a great cultural heritage that we must not lose."
"Substantial investment in resources and technology is needed if we are to conserve it well, not just patch it up. If we take inadequate measures to restore our cultural and historical heritage, we shall gain nothing."
"This programme is also of great consequence, therefore."
"The objectives have been well chosen, but unfortunately there are too many of them."
"As Mr Tannert said referring to his programme, the Commission has used the word priority in a sense I simply cannot grasp."
"There are no less than 130 priorities in this specific programme."
"I do therefore feel justified in saying that the objectives are all very well, but there are just too many priorities, assuming we all take priority to mean the same thing: something worth highlighting, something that deserves to come first."
"I am confident that the Commission in its wisdom will be selective concerning the programmes and will make more efficient use of resources."
"There are two subsections or two key actions relating to energy. One concerns the development of cleaner energy and includes renewable energy."
"The other aims to achieve a more effective and efficient use of energy. It must be recognised that in the European Union we use too much energy in the home, in transport, in particular, in our factories and in production."
"It is with regard to this area that I have serious doubts as to whether the programme as it stands will prove useful."
"Mr Linkohr said that the results would have to be quantified, and that Parliament would have to exercise an important supervisory role. I agree with him."
"Such parliamentary control will be of great help to the Commission, and I am not referring merely to budgetary control, though that should also be undertaken."
"I have in mind the monitoring of results, of innovation, of the efficiency of the groups of researchers working in the various countries, and of the efficient use to be made of the scarce resources available. It should be stressed that the resources available for these two programmes are somewhat limited."
"I am opposed to Amendment No 9, because it means that 42 % of the budget would be devoted to demonstration projects, in particular to those involving renewable energy."
"Madam Commissioner, that amounts to subsidising them."
"Renewable energy will never make headway if you allocate 42 % of this budget to subsidising small projects concerned with solar panels, biomass, renewable energy and so on."
"They certainly deserve to be supported, but not in this way."
"The trouble is that renewable energy is not competitive, and only new technology can reverse this situation."
"I should also like to mention Amendments Nos 25 and 27, and I hope the Commission will include them, because they refer to gas."
"Europe is to promote a major gas programme, and we have rather fragile and rigid gas systems."
"Something will also have to be done therefore regarding the storage of non-liquefied gas."
"More needs to be done too concerning further prospecting for hydrocarbons in offshore areas. Once again, the need to support SMEs must be stressed."
"We all genuinely want to improve employment prospects."
"Research can achieve this."
"I doubt if it can be achieved through subsidies, but it may be possible through the Commission's skilful handling. All the Commission's flexibility will be called for in order to succeed in this."
"Mr President, there are two different programmes involved here, and I should like to begin by talking about my own report on SMEs and innovation."
"Small and medium-sized businesses deserve to be given a prominent place in European Union policy because, even apart from the employment considerations, they have enormous economic importance at European level."
"Of the 17 million firms in Europe, a good 99 % are small and medium-sized businesses accounting for more than 70 % of Europe's jobs, 50 % of its investment and 60 % of its wealth."
"SMEs are thus the most important economic factor in Europe."
"Most businesses are extremely small."
"Almost 15 million firms have nine workers or less and just over one million firms employ between 10 and 99 people."
"SMEs are also not a homogeneous group, which means that a different approach is needed for each target group."
"I am therefore pleased that in the framework programme too, the definition of SMEs is now restricted to firms employing up to 250 workers."
"The competitiveness of these firms largely depends on their ability to innovate, which is why it is vital to promote innovative activities, facilitate the dissemination and exploitation of research results and support technology transfer."
"Action at European level is needed to supplement the initiatives taken by the Member States in order to help SMEs to globalise their activities and gain access to new technologies."
"This specific programme must help to optimise the effort devoted to promoting innovation and encouraging SMEs to take part in the framework programme."
"It is merely a coordinating instrument designed to support the thematic programmes, and therefore has a small budget of ECU 363 million."
"I take the view that all the projects should be carried out in their natural environment, in other words within the thematic programmes, and I am therefore delighted that Parliament and the Council have supported my proposal to earmark at least 10 % of the research budget in each thematic programme for projects involving SMEs."
"Secondly, ideas and new technologies need to be disseminated as effectively as possible, and a great deal of attention must therefore be given to innovation in the thematic programmes."
"What can be done to encourage the dissemination of R&D results and their transformation into new and better products, processes and services?"
"When projects are started up, appropriate output indicators must be decided upon and developed, such as publication of results and patents, since these are the only way to quantify and legitimise the effect of European research investment."
"At the same time, I would stress the importance here of disseminating knowledge."
"We need to have a sound infrastructure so that knowledge can be used throughout Europe and the wheel does not have to be constantly reinvented in all 15 Member States."
"There are still far too many untapped opportunities."
"This was true four years ago and it is still sadly the case today."
"For example, small firms lack information about new ideas developed by universities and research institutes, the possibilities for technology transfer and, as I said earlier, access to assistance programmes."
"When I entered the European Parliament four years ago, in the first report I wrote I stressed the importance of disseminating information for SMEs."
"If Europe is to be able to face up to competition from the major powers - the United States, Japan and China - the 15 Member States must work together, particularly in the field of research and technological development, and the framework programme provides an excellent instrument for this."
"My third point is that people still tend to think that if there is enough research, the commercial applications will develop themselves."
"The opposite is true."
"A new product may be produced, but there is no money to develop it further."
"Banks and venture capitalists often dare not finance high-tech projects if they fall outside their area of expertise."
"The have too little in-house knowledge to be able to calculate the technological and financial risks involved in developing these new products."
"This was why the technology rating institute was set up in the Netherlands in 1995 to try to make it easier to fund promising technological innovations in SMEs."
"It is Europe's job to disseminate knowledge about such successful initiatives, and this is what is going to happen over the next few years through the ENTAS system - the European new technologies appraisal system - that is to be set up by the ING and other European banks and the Frauenhofer institute in Germany."
"National networks of knowledge centres must learn from each other, set a good example to each other and contribute to cluster formation in Europe."
"This should generate a great deal of innovation and costs relatively little to do."
"My final point is that a shortage of manpower is a typical feature of SMEs."
"To make the procedures and conditions for taking part in the framework programme clear for SMEs, all the thematic programmes must define and apply specific measures for SMEs such as exploratory awards, feasibility studies and CRAFT in the same way."
"They must also be accessible via a single central contact point in the Commission."
"However, the first signs are already there that the Commission is going about this in the wrong way."
"For example, the proposed work programme for the ICT programme makes no reference to CRAFT."
"I would therefore like to ask Commissioner Cresson how she intends to coordinate the various DGs involved in the implementation of the framework programme, particularly with regard to the measures for SMEs?"
"I would like to have an answer on this fairly soon."
"I should like now to move on to my second task, which is to deliver the opinion of the Committee on External Economic Relations on a number of specific programmes under the fifth framework programme."
"On behalf of the REX Committee, therefore, I should like to congratulate the four rapporteurs, Messrs Tannert, Malerba and Argyros and Mrs Estevan Bola."
"Europe has a very solid tradition when it comes to research and the application of science and technology."
"The strategic aim of the programme before us is to establish a link between research capacity and production capacity primarily in order to promote technology exports, thereby bringing more jobs and greater prosperity to Europe."
"The added value and the fundamental role of the European Union in the field of research is consequently to promote cooperation between Europe's research partners."
"By going beyond frontiers and making use of each other's knowledge, European companies both large and small will be better equipped to face the international competition."
"But partnership does not come to a halt at the boundaries of the European Union."
"Europe is currently witnessing a globalisation of the world economy and its hitherto disparate markets."
"Less than two weeks ago, I spent five days in the Bay area of San Francisco and saw for myself how new small businesses, or 'start-ups' as they are known, are sprouting like mushrooms in the biotechnology sector."
"New activity means new jobs, which Europe so desperately needs."
"Cooperation with the United States in this field could also encourage the European biotechnology industry, and the same applies for the information and communications technology sector."
"Up to now, the European Union and the framework programme have concentrated on cooperation within Europe, but in the future, global cooperation, which already characterises the high-tech sector, will become increasingly important."
"The Committee on External Economic Relations was therefore delighted with the agreement signed a year ago between the European Union and the United States on scientific and technological cooperation."
"There have always been close links between the United States and the European Union."
"Our bilateral economic relations generate the largest trade flows in the world."
"The European Union and the USA are each other's main investors, and the quality of this relationship has a major effect on world trade."
"More intensive scientific cooperation is therefore justified and could lead to a better understanding of each other's views and the settlement of trade disputes with the United States such as in the field of biotechnology, Internet security, encryption, privacy and data protection."
"These disputes arise from our differing views on the human and environmental consequences of these new technologies, and differences in consumer behaviour within the Union and in the USA."
"If we are to prevent a constant stream of trade conflicts in these areas and develop universally acceptable legislation, cooperation with third countries and in particular with the United States within the framework programme is an absolute necessity."
"Mr President, the question of what holds together the innermost part of the world is not a very original one as it is very old. It is however more relevant than ever, because of course our social development is moulded by many different factors, together making up what we call the European development model."
"To that extent, it is crucially important with respect to our future development for us to ask at this point what really holds our society together in the innermost part, and then to tie that in to research activities in all sectors."
"That is why I very much welcome the fact that we have here a specific programme that supports the mobility of researchers and focuses on socio-economic research, particularly with regard to the innermost part of our society."
"This delicate plant was produced by Parliament and began to bloom in the fourth framework research programme."
"There were many problems and excesses, the strategic direction could have been better, but in the last few years it has improved considerably and the last call, the third one, was excellent."
"At this point I would also like to praise Director Mitsos from the Commission, who really handled it well. Praising the Commission is something we ought to do once in a while these days!"
"Nonetheless, I have taken the liberty of proposing improvements on seven points."
"Firstly, in the provisional allocation of funds, it is foreseen that only 10 % is to be made available for socio-economic research."
"I think that in our provisional allocation we could easily fix the figure a little higher, as the areas of responsibility have increased somewhat within the framework of the conciliation procedure under the fifth framework research programme."
"I would therefore suggest a provisional figure of 15 %."
"Secondly, I think it is important for us to know about the mobility and research content of the programme."
"Transparency must be ensured, in particular by using the Internet, with regard to the participating institutions and the themes."
"Thirdly, I think it important that socio-economic research is not just carried out as a sideline, but is connected horizontally to the other research areas."
"That is why there are some proposals - Amendment No 37 in particular - for greater coordination of this research with other research areas."
"Fourthly, I would like to mention some small improvements with relation to content. These involve structural changes, particularly as regards the ageing of our society, the effects of structural changes on employment and people's mentalities in our society, and the forms of participation."
"In many areas it turns out that participation is no longer taking place in traditional policy areas, but more in non-governmental organisations, citizens' initiatives and so on. These aspects should also be reflected in the content."
"Fifthly, of course, the networking of researchers is also important."
"I do not want to take up the cudgels for social science research, but I sometimes have the feeling that European cooperation has not yet developed very far in the area and a little help could still be given to establishing a European research network. This is also important of course when it comes to making applications."
"My sixth point concerns support for equality of opportunity, also where participation in this research programme is concerned."
"It cannot be acceptable for instance that time spent bringing up children is not taken into account when the Marie Curie fellowships are awarded."
"That point has to be clarified, as indeed does overall support for equality of opportunity."
"Last week I attended a symposium where there were 150 participants, and only two of them were women."
"There is obviously room for improvement here."
"My seventh and final point is that we also have to promote the results."
"It is of no help at all to have good studies if they are lying in a drawer."
"In the area of the social sciences especially, this often happens."
"The results should be promoted on the Internet, for example, but should also be transferred directly to the users, the politicians, in this Parliament, in the national Parliaments, and presented on the ground, in order to make them useful in the social process."
"Mr President, I am presenting two reports, both under my name and both about the JRC."
"The first is the fifth framework report and the other is the Euratom nuclear report on the work of the JRC."
"The JRC is the living embodiment of what European added value means."
"It is something that should be very much better known by the Members of this House and by the general public."
"That is true of all the research programmes but in particular of the Joint Research Centre where scientists from all over the European Union come together to work on problems which are relevant to its citizens."
"Like the European Union itself, the JRC's role has changed and its emphasis has changed."
"It started off with a very largely nuclear emphasis and did valuable research in the nuclear field."
"That emphasis is now lessening and the new mission of the JRC as it takes us into the 21st century is being highlighted more and more."
"Mr Allgeier, the Director of the JRC, and Mrs Cresson, the Commissioner, have between them shown very great clarity of thinking in defining the role of the JRC so that everyone is clear about its task."
"Its task principally is to be a tool for policy makers in the European Union and for those carrying out implementing programmes in a variety of areas."
"For example we need the 'technology foresite' work which is done in Seville where they look at forthcoming technologies."
"We need the testing and standards work that is done in Ispra and elsewhere."
"Recently, for example, they tested the methods used in every Member State to monitor air pollution and they found great discrepancies in these tests."
"That was a very valuable piece of work."
"Alongside the clarity of purpose we need some reform and some restructuring and that is being done very efficiently."
"The JRC possesses facilities which no one Member State could possibly afford to build and there ought to be better use of some of those facilities."
"As the European Parliament has a duty to monitor what is going on in the research establishments, we would like observer status."
"We would like two observers on the board of the JRC."
"If for technical or legal reasons that is not possible we would like an exploration of other ways in which we could carry out that task."
"Given the size of the Ispra site and the complications of maintaining such a site, some renegotiation has to go on with the Italian authorities and I hope that is in progress."
"In this, as in every other programme, we need to emphasize that the equal opportunities policy of the European Union is not just a pretty phrase."
"It means that this must be implemented."
"Here I would pay tribute to Mrs Cresson, a woman Commissioner for science who has grasped that if we are to have an equal opportunities programme, there must be research, in her words, 'by women, for women and about women."
"She has set up a special unit at DG XII, and should be congratulated and supported."
"I move on to the Euratom part of the JRC."
"In view of the reduced budget, a sensible decision has been made to cut the fusion research in the JRC and a higher emphasis will be put on nuclear materials and safeguards control."
"The FARO facility is very important: this is a way of studying real accidents."
"My Amendment No 20 highlights the fact that it is not the job of a research programme to pay for the decommissioning of nuclear facilities."
"There must be urgent discussions with the budget authorities and the Committee on Budgets about how the ECU 100m needed for the full decommissioning at Ispra and elsewhere can be paid for without impinging upon the research programme; this would be wholly inappropriate."
"I would like us to look at the suggestions of Professor Rubbia, amongst others, on on-site separation and transmutation of nuclear waste."
"If we do not find a solution to the problem of nuclear waste, the public will lose heart at any suggestion of the use of nuclear power."
"This may be a promising way forward."
"I should like to say now - pre-empting a little but my time is in one block - why I have tabled an amendment to Mrs Matikainen-Kallström's report, on which I congratulate her, and I certainly agree with her suggestion that the title be changed to one which is more straightforward."
"My Amendment No 19 suggests that, in view of the amount which has to be cut in the fusion programme, the Commission should come up with a new plan and should bear the following points in mind when it looks at the international thermonuclear experimental reactor:"
"There is a sharp decrease in interest and ability to participate by the planned partners and, as far as I can see, a site is not available."
"The timescale is inappropriate for the fifth framework programme."
"We are not going to be doing that work within this timescale."
"There is certainly scope for a cost reduction."
"The JET facility in Culham in the United Kingdom has very many achievements and is an important part of the fusion programme."
"My suggestion for a cut in the budget does not include the JET facility."
"Indeed, so long as Parliament is consulted, there is probably a case for its continuation after 1999."
"It has fixed costs."
"However, I cannot believe - even though we want to study the socioeconomic aspects of nuclear fusion, and I am all in favour of them - that they cost ECU 920m, or anywhere near that amount."
"We need to continue our on-going research into the fusion programme and I do not suggest in any way that we should not."
"But I ask the Commission, if this amendment is adopted, to look again at the programme as it is drawn up and get something that is slightly more appropriate for the available budget."
"Mr President, the need for energy will approximately double over the next fifty years."
"Most of the increase in demand will occur in the present developing countries, which will obtain their increased quantities of energy mainly through the use of fossil fuels that accelerate the greenhouse effect."
"To some extent we can influence the consumption of primary energy sources by means of energy saving measures, but these are only possible in industrialised countries, and even there their effect on total energy consumption is minor."
"The increased use of renewables will be considerable, but will have insufficient effect as far as contamination of the environment is concerned."
"Knowing that the earth's resources of uranium and natural gas are finite, we could say there is no environmentally acceptable energy solution that exists at the present time, especially with regard to carbon dioxide emissions, which would meet the growing demand for energy and prevent the worsening of the greenhouse effect."
"For several decades now we have been researching the theory of nuclear fusion, and fusion has actually been achieved in trial reactors."
"In trialing the commercial exploitation of fusion we have reached the point where it is necessary to create the next demonstration project."
"We now have the ITER research project which should get under way soon and which is jointly organised by the EU, Japan, the USA and Russia; its purpose is to produce the technology for the future commercial exploitation of a nuclear fusion power station."
"The barriers to the exploitation of nuclear fusion are at present technical, so mere theoretical research is no longer enough to ensure development."
"For the time being the developing world will not be able to develop an energy source that commercially exploits fusion, so the programme will have to be undertaken by the industrialised countries."
"When we consider the timescale for exploiting fusion, which is estimated at approximately fifty years, it is clear that investment in the continuation of this work will be needed if the research currently being carried out is not to be discontinued, the Commission's proposed funding cut and the ITER project postponed."
"Current research being undertaken into nuclear fusion costs ECU 500 million per year, which is just 1 % of the total cost of the oil imported by the EU."
"The production of energy from fusion does not produce fuel-derived radioactive waste."
"Research into fusion and its possible commercial exploitation will not involve elements that would encourage or facilitate the manufacture of nuclear weapons."
"We also have to remember that research into nuclear fusion has led to an abundance of innovations, such as in the field of materials technology, and we have thus been able to exploit the results of the research well before any production of commercial energy has commenced."
"To stop the greenhouse effect from ultimately causing irreparable damage before the introduction of fusion energy, we must invest in the production of energy from sources other than fossil fuels."
"Making present nuclear power stations safe and more efficient will be vital if we wish to work to produce energy without harming the environment."
"The Commission's original proposal was to fund research for the modernisation of current nuclear power plants and the treatment of nuclear waste."
"I believe these will be areas of nuclear fission research which will be well suited to this programme."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we are taking decisions on energy alternatives that will affect future generations."
"Now, by taking the right decisions, we can solve the problems of the production of energy for Europeans in the future."
"By voting in favour of research into fusion energy we can guarantee those future generations a life that does not rely on respirators."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall now comment on the three horizontal programmes from the perspective of the Committee on External Economic Relations, in other words as regards the international role of research, innovation, SMEs and human potential."
"On the first topic - the international role of Community research - it is essential, in my opinion, that technological research in the European Union should be a match for research worldwide and should remain competitive; I would even say that the benchmark should be the international relevance of our research and discoveries."
"The fifth framework programme would be impoverished if this openness were not ensured."
"Nevertheless, we might ask ourselves under what conditions non-EU partner companies should be allowed to participate, and to what extent the money of Europe's citizens should be spent on partners not belonging to the Union."
"Special conventions will need to be drawn up, but our committee would see fit to lay down two vital criteria: firstly, research conducted in conjunction with external partners should be of benefit to the European Union, thereby improving its competence and its qualities; secondly, there should be a reciprocity criterion, meaning that if, for example, the partners - the American researchers - have access to a European research programme, the opposite must also be possible."
"This, in my view, is a key point which the Commission as a whole, not just Mrs Cresson, must press in its international relations."
"I am thinking here of technologically advanced countries such as the United States, Japan and Canada. Whereas we have by now found ways of solving conflicts and competitive difficulties, for example in the commercial sector through the World Trade Organisation, the world of research is still a fairly closed, impermeable one in most countries."
"As regards the emerging and developing countries, on the other hand, and above all nearby countries such as those applying for accession and the third countries of the Mediterranean, I should very much like to see research becoming a tool of cooperation."
"In these cases, however, additional financial instruments are needed to complement the RTD framework programme: I am of course thinking of the Agenda 2000 programmes and the MEDA programmes."
"In this context, technology transfer and the involvement of third countries will add to the merits of the framework programme."
"Mr President, Commissioner, it has been a long road to the final decision on the European Community's fifth framework programme for research, technological development and demonstration."
"Today I can tell you that although there was an initial protest about this programme, the Committee on Fisheries can accept the result of the conciliation procedure despite a general disagreement on funding and possible deficiencies with regard to content."
"But I would like to explain to you why we shall be following its implementation very carefully."
"In its opinion on the proposed fifth framework research programme, the Committee on Fisheries described the research needs of the fisheries and aquaculture sector."
"It noted that, in contrast to the fourth framework research programme, the proposal does not contain a programme solely devoted to fisheries."
"The design of the new framework programme means that fisheries interests will have to compete with other research interests in several programmes and key actions."
"That does not make things any easier for fisheries."
"Moreover, a solution also needs to be found for the future funding of activities relating to fisheries, which have so far been defined as studies and kept outside the research programmes."
"These activities include the collection of basic data for stock assessments, which have so far been funded through the Structural Funds."
"The Committee on Fisheries stresses the need to avoid any risk of interruption in the funding of the very important activities concerned, and the need to extend support for such activities to the aquaculture sector."
"We have heard that in accordance with Article 130i, the framework programme will be implemented through individual specific programmes, in turn consisting of key actions as they are known, or work programmes."
"The first specific programme, called 'Quality of life and management of living resources' thus covers many key actions of relevance for the fisheries and aquaculture sector."
"The most important of these is 'Sustainable agriculture, fisheries and forestry, including the integrated development of rural areas'."
"The priorities for research, technological development and demonstration in fisheries and aquaculture have been defined in such a way that most of the relevant research needs should be covered."
"The key action 'Health, food and environmental factors' is absolutely relevant here, and the key action 'Control of infectious diseases' provides a natural framework for research on prevention and control of fish diseases within aquaculture, since it has now emerged that this key action will not be limited to human diseases."
"The key action 'The cell factory' could possibly also be of some interest to the aquaculture sector because of the genetical problems that may arise there."
"That is all I have to say on the first specific programme."
"The second and third programmes are not very relevant for fisheries and aquaculture, so let me move directly on to the fourth thematic programme, 'Preserving the ecosystem'."
"This programme is of the greatest importance to fisheries and aquaculture, especially in the attempts at what is known as the conceptualizing an ecosystem approach to fisheries management, because understanding how environmental changes may affect the marine ecosystems upon which fisheries and aquaculture depend is extremely important."
"Up to now we have always complained that the current state of knowledge rarely permits forecasting of concrete effects on fish stocks or predictions of the consequences of a troubled ecosystem for the fishing industry."
"The other specific programmes predominantly concern amongst other things the need for international cooperation with third countries in the Mediterranean region, as well as Russia, the USA and Canada."
"It is a subject that we will be increasingly preoccupied with in the fisheries sector as we search for new resources."
"The Committee on Fisheries has clearly defined the contents and affirmed their importance."
"We look forward to their realisation."
"We have heard about the growing demands that are being placed on the framework programme, and in view of these each penny of the amount had to be fought for."
"Of course this was tiring at times, but it was worth it."
"My thanks to all those who were involved. We are also very relieved that with the framework programme, an important part of employment policy that we have all been waiting for is to be implemented."
"In a modern Europe we ought never to neglect the field of research."
"It is often the true beginning of all things. Of course this also has to be reflected in our budget."
"Mr President, I wish to focus on the section in the framework programme covered by Mr Argyros, which deals with competitive and sustainable growth. It is very gratifying to see that so many suggestions in the opinion from the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs have been incorporated into the report."
"Greater emphasis is now being placed on sustainable growth as a means of creating jobs and improving quality of life: in other words, a horizontal approach is being advocated."
"What is more, politicians and decision-takers will be requiring advice on socio-economic and environmental issues. Research can contribute towards smoothing the way for social change and safeguarding ecological balance."
"I am disappointed that we failed to obtain budgetary resources for such work and I therefore call upon colleagues to support the Green Group's Amendment No 30."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will start with the report by Mr Tannert."
"In the fifth framework research programme, European research is supposed to be more in tune with the needs of society than ever, and more concerned with searching for solutions to its pressing problems."
"The biotechnology field potentially contains many answers, which we are seeing already in the medical, pharmaceutical and agricultural sectors, where work is being done worldwide. The European Union must intensify its efforts here considerably if it wishes to remain competitive."
"But just as biotechnology answers questions, it also throws them up, especially in the field of gene technology. There is for example the safety of manufactured products that are genetically engineered, and there are also the highly sensitive ethical aspects."
"I would fully agree with the rapporteur that research on gene technology depends mainly on whether we can arrive at a social consensus on the issues associated with it."
"That is why objective information and a widely-conducted discussion in the field of ethics also have to be among the aims of this programme."
"The Green Group in the European Parliament is calling once again for a moratorium on research involving foetal tissue and research on embryos in vitro before implantation until a full ethical evaluation has been undertaken."
"But for my group the moratorium on research is not a feasible option."
"It is an unrealistic demand because we can never have a conclusive ethical evaluation."
"It is always going to have to take place in parallel with the research."
"It is crucial in embryo research that the provisions in national legislation are complied with, and that the common, basic ethical principles are taken into account."
"European research projects should be evaluated carefully from an ethical point of view before they are begun."
"But a complete moratorium would lead to a standstill, which is something we especially want to avoid with this programme."
"Now let me turn briefly to the report by Mr Lange."
"By and large, the amendments can be supported and also have the approval of my group."
"I very much welcome the fact that this specific programme continues the efforts to promote the training of European researchers."
"It is hugely important for Europe's competitiveness that the quality of our researchers and scientists is continually reinforced."
"It is important to achieve a lively and effective cooperation between European researchers."
"As for socio-economic research, the Commission's aim that socio-economic aspects be identified as a key action in this horizontal programme is an idea that is very much to be welcomed."
"But in any case it has to be said that not everything that is scientifically interesting and feasible requires comprehensive European research funding."
"I think therefore that the chosen figure of 10 % of the funds from the specific programme for socio-economic research is sufficient."
"Thank you very much indeed to both of the rapporteurs."
"Mr President, I should just like to make one point on the Estevan Bolea report and that is about renewable energies, specifically geothermal energy, better known in my part of the world as 'hot rocks technology'."
"Many of our Member States have a very good record in this area."
"Europe has a good track record in that it has been successful with its research in the past. And yet this is not specifically mentioned in the Commission proposal."
"Perhaps it is included under the title 'Any Other Energies'."
"In my own mind that is not at all sufficient."
"Hence Amendment No 19 which specifically mentions geothermal energy."
"I would remind the Commission that the United States is currently putting something like USD 100m into research into this particular area."
"They are looking for export markets."
"They are areas where we, as the European Union, will miss out if we do not make sure that we keep abreast of this technology."
"Will the Commission support geothermal technology? Will it please support Amendment No 19."
"Mr President, I congratulate all the rapporteurs on the excellent reports they have produced."
"I can agree with almost all of them."
"I am pleased to see that the Tannert report clearly spells out that research into human cloning will not be permitted in the present framework programme."
"My personal belief is that human cloning in any form should not be tolerated under any circumstances."
"The user-friendly information society programme presented by our colleague, Mr Malerba, is of great importance."
"Every single element of the four key action areas will have a major role for future progress and development, not least for the creation of jobs."
"In recent weeks the Taoiseach of Ireland, Mr Bertie Ahern, announced the decision to create a major digital park."
"In so doing he said: 'Linking cities and villages into this busy network will not only give new jobs to Ireland but will provide the one-stop media shop for local services in health, education, tourism, business development and all public services'."
"Speaking on behalf of the Irish delegation in my group, it will come as no surprise to many that I have some difficulties with those reports dealing with research of one kind or another in the nuclear sector."
"The Sellafield lies, leaks and cover-ups saga has been consistently denounced by my Fianna Fáil delegation in this Parliament, right back to the early days of Windscale."
"We are totally opposed to the proposed new expansion of Sellafield."
"There is no justification - economic or otherwise - for the reprocessing of nuclear waste."
"We will not support any programmes which would in effect contribute to a continuation of the lethal contamination from Sellafield."
"That money would be far better used for research into projects in non-nuclear renewable energies as set out in the programme, preserving the ecosystem, the subject of the Estevan Bolea report."
"In conclusion, I have one comment on the overall fifth framework programme."
"I am convinced that the time has come for Europe to stop being perceived as a follower of American and Japanese research fashion and become, in a coherent and united approach, a world leader in the field."
"We can do it if we wish."
"Mr President, I would like to emphasise three points in connection with the fifth framework programme for research and the special programmes attached to it."
"The first concerns the users of research."
"According to the Commission's proposal, the intention behind the fifth framework programme is greater interaction with users."
"It is very important that by the word 'users' the Commission does not just mean those engaged in business, but the real end-users of research, the people."
"Organisations that represent the people and democratically elected decision-makers must also be able to participate in the planning and monitoring of research."
"Secondly, I would like to focus on the special attention paid to women in the research programmes."
"Mr Lange's report, now under discussion, pays commendable attention to the issue."
"We have to make sure that both sufficient resources are available for research into the status of women and the promotion of equality, and that women are represented in groups involved in the selection and appraisal of projects."
"The third important issue concerns the opportunities for applicant countries to be included in the fifth framework programme."
"Negotiations with those countries, which are desirable for their participation in the programme, must be swiftly concluded, so that they may be included right from the start."
"In this connection I would also like to stress the importance of research into health and safety at work, which is also well worth investing in."
"Finally I would like to state that I am in full agreement with what Mr Fitzsimmons said just now about nuclear research, which is that we should invest in renewable energy resources."
"Mr President, the programme 'Preserving the ecosystem' would more correctly have been called 'Repairing the ecosystem', because with many of these programmes - and I need remind you only of the Structural Funds - we are continuing to destroy and rob the planet before we are even aware of all that it has to offer."
"This can be said about the forests and seas, and everything else too."
"Of course what makes me particularly angry is the funding which has been provided - ECU 2.125 billion for 130 priorities - which will not do justice to any of the priorities."
"This path will not lead us to renewable energy."
"We need anything but fusion, on which we have spent billions without seeing any results so far."
"What about energy efficiency?"
"Obviously, with so little money we cannot make progress on that either."
"For the future of course it is important for us to find out what resources and valuable medical substances can be obtained from the sea before they are plundered."
"None of these things can be achieved with what we have here, and I deeply regret that. I also think it inappropriate for so much money to be going into computer science."
"As for the nuclear industry as a whole, I do not think it is at all right to continue to invest money in it, because it must itself take responsibility for the consequences in accordance with the principle that 'the polluter must pay', instead of always making the general public pay in its place."
"Mr President, I cannot start my first speech in this Chamber without referring to my predecessor, Dr Alan Macartney, who I know was held in very high regard here both for his work in committees and in Parliament."
"There could be no more fitting tribute to Alan Macartney from the people back home than the very decisive result of the by-election which brought me, also a member of Scotland's party of independence, to this Parliament."
"If one of our major purposes is to create the conditions that will encourage economic growth and improve employment opportunities, then small and medium-sized enterprises must and do play a substantial part."
"I was pleased to note that SMEs figure in these programmes and, in particular, that a proportion of the budget will indeed be available to be directed particularly towards projects from smaller enterprises."
"As a former proprietor of a very small business myself, I am only too well aware of how difficult it can be to find the extra time, energy and finance required to pursue innovative projects."
"And as until recently I was also the leader of a local authority in Scotland - a very successful one too - I know from the experience of our economic development and European units that many of our smaller businesses have a wealth of talent and ideas which require more encouragement."
"I hope that there can be considerable flexibility in the decision-making processes and in the running of these programmes so that they can indeed be fully accessible to our small and medium-sized enterprises."
"The Scots have a well deserved reputation for innovation and inventiveness."
"In my particular part of Scotland, the North-East, we have many businesses, enterprises and academic and research institutions working on projects and ideas that are very worthy of dissemination both throughout Europe and in the wider world."
"Dundee, for example, one of the two cities in my area, is well and truly becoming a centre of excellence in life sciences."
"Aberdeen is acknowledged as the energy capital of Europe."
"I know of much work being done to develop projects in a whole range of fields including telematics and renewable energy resources."
"Incidentally, I come here from a party which is non-nuclear in its outlook and I support the comments of our colleague a few minutes ago."
"We have projects to maintain the high quality of our water supply systems, also referred to earlier in this debate."
"We in Scotland have much to offer by way of research and development."
"I hope that through participation in these programmes not only will Scottish projects, Scottish businesses and Scottish institutions benefit, but the ideas generated therein will benefit Europe and the world."
"I look forward very much to my participation here in this Chamber in promoting Scotland and indeed promoting European projects back home in Scotland."
"Mr Hudghton, I did not interrupt you because I wanted to thank you and congratulate you on your first appearance in Parliament."
"I wish you all the best as an MEP, but would point out that here in Parliament we all keep to our allotted speaking time."
"Mr President, in the context of this joint debate on research and technological development, I will be speaking on the report on the programme for innovation and participation of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"The decisive role of SMEs in employment and in our countries' territorial balance can never be over-emphasised."
"It is very much better to promote the maintenance and development of a coherent and close-knit fabric of businesses in the countryside rather than to invest vast sums in urban policy with very uncertain results."
"That fabric has now been seriously damaged by recession and it is essential to rebuild it, in particular by encouraging the development of the industries of the future, which are currently creating most wealth, growth and employment."
"It is essential to be in a position to protect the intellectual property involved here, both at Community level and at third country level, because this is absolutely necessary if the costs inherent in research and development are to be amortised."
"And instead of salving our consciences by incorporating into this fifth framework programme for research an SME section which is poorly-funded and will therefore have little impact, it would surely have been better to start by carrying out an audit of the legal obstacles currently facing people starting up in business and of the brakes on the development of SMEs created by certain Community regulations themselves."
"Our legal systems simply must be geared towards facilitating the development of SMEs, instead of hindering it, as is seen in particular in the case of some regulations which tend to strangle businesses at birth, the very time when they most need capital."
"It would have been useful to give some thought to the essential improvements that need to be made to company law with a view to adapting it to the rules of technological industry and risk capital, a vital instrument in facilitating access for SMEs to private finance for innovation."
"A policy geared to making extensive free trade agreements without prior impact assessment and adopting artificially high standards for our small and medium-sized enterprises has undeniable negative effects."
"Mr President, I call for a pragmatic policy, not an ideological one, a policy that will really facilitate the development of these small and medium-sized firms. They are now the principal source of job creation in the European Union."
"Mr President, research is the future, it is the breath of the human spirit."
"However, responsibility is called for!"
"I am very glad that thermonuclear fusion is not under discussion in Mrs McNally's report. However nuclear fission safety, control of nuclear materials, the decommissioning of nuclear power stations and waste management are."
"We are going to have to decommission a great many nuclear power stations in the future, something that we should perhaps have done much earlier."
"Waste management is going to keep us busy for a very long time."
"Although we do not have a solution for nuclear waste yet and it will continue to be radioactive for centuries, indeed for millennia, we go on producing more every day!"
"It is a grotesque, tragic and dramatic form of human irresponsibility."
"It is I think perhaps too late for us to carry out research in this area."
"I am grateful to Mrs Matikainen-Kallström for pointing out in her report that the routine generation of substantial quantities of radioactive materials may also constitute the biggest obstacle in the development of fusion."
"She refers to extremely important areas such as nuclear fission, operational safety, nuclear facilities, radiation protection and once again, waste management, which has been mentioned several times today."
"I know that Mrs Matikainen-Kallström has taken a great deal of trouble over her report, but like many of the others who spoke before me, I regret the fact that there is no talk of any key action for renewable energies here."
"The waste must certainly be brought under control."
"You are responsible on behalf of the people in this respect."
"When one tries, as I do, to conduct politics in a Christian-Democrat spirit of responsibility then it is simply impossible - for me at least - to support a programme which admittedly offers us a great many advantages, but also leaves behind for those who will come after us problems that are presently regarded as insoluble."
"I would ask my colleagues to have some understanding for the way I am going to vote."
"Mr President, referring to the report by Mr Argyros on the special programme for competitive and viable economic development, I would first of all like to note with satisfaction the rapporteur's effort to address issues concerned with ensuring transparency in the management of appropriations connected with the programme's activities, promoting the social dimension in the objectives served by the funds made available each year, extending the special actions to branches such as the textile industry, which is a very important industry in Europe and indeed a labour-intensive one, reserving a larger proportion of the budget for improvements in land and sea transport technologies and making research results available to small and medium-sized enterprises so that they can derive benefit from them."
"However, I should like to point out that the worldwide economic crisis has highlighted the need for economic development which benefits society while fully respecting the environment. That, indeed, is what is meant by viable and sustainable development."
"But now, the word 'competitive' is being added."
"Is that coincidence?"
"Surely not."
"That word establishes a framework wherein the main effort will be directed in an extremely one-sided manner towards intellectual, scientific and technological development in order to promote the interests and aspirations of large-scale multinational capital."
"Competitiveness is ranked above all else, and the rights and acquisitions of working people, the environment and a balanced ecology are all placed in thrall to it."
"Development of any kind and environmental protection are conditional upon company profits."
"Experience, particularly recently, shows that any reference to competitive development is very worrying for working people and the general public."
"It is essential to grasp the point that technology is the product of scientific development and the human intellect, and that it must not be used in ways that pose a threat to nature, mankind and its needs."
"Mr President, I shall begin with the Malerba report, on which I have tabled some amendments."
"Whilst I am very much in favour of a user-friendly information society, I still have some misgivings."
"There is a danger that the resources of the information society and the Internet will be exploited for purposes of electronic surveillance."
"It is incumbent upon us in this Parliament to distance ourselves from any attempt to use this programme to facilitate the development of such communication or surveillance technologies."
"I also have a point on the Argyros report on competitive and sustainable growth."
"I have tabled an amendment on reducing the environmental impact of air traffic."
"Parliament is very vocal about developing better fuels for motor cars and cutting petrol use, yet we seem to overlook the fact that aeroplanes are also major guzzlers."
"Competitive ways must be found of producing fuels which will spare the environment and reduce consumption."
"This should be seen by industry as a positive challenge, rather than a negative threat."
"Mr President, the fifth framework programme is primarily designed to promote the interests of a common research policy."
"Over time, the structure has become clearer and the subject areas more specific."
"Fragmentation into lots of small projects and the overlapping of different projects is to be avoided, and from this point of view the question has to be asked whether earmarking 10 % of the budget for SMEs will really promote scientific development."
"The rapid assessment of applications is extremely important for research institutions and especially for businesses, and establishing clear criteria is also important in order to provide a degree of certainty."
"It also prevents lengthy discussions on contracts and bureaucratic procedures, both of which are seen as obstacles."
"Because of the rapid developments in science, it has to be possible to alter specific programmes half-way through."
"The extremely rapid progress made in genetic technology, which could generate new resistances and harmful trends in nutrition, means that further biomedical research and ethical consideration is required."
"Scientific research is not seen as something free from value judgements, as is clear from the fact that human cloning has been excluded from the framework programme."
"We are delighted about this; a pause for thought about other genetic technologies is also needed, and full, unbiased information would be extremely welcome."
"Sustainable development is an important basis for research, and energy and environmental protection must form an integral part of this."
"Cooperation between government, the private sector, industry and the services sector can set a good, encouraging example here, particularly for applied research."
"However, there must also be scope for fundamental research, which should be as independent and objective as possible."
"As for the future of the nuclear fusion programme, we would point out that the knowledge we have acquired here must be kept for future generations, but in view of the fact that other sources of energy are now in full development, we no longer need to attach high priority to it."
"We support the idea of setting a maximum for nuclear research, which will certainly be advisable once we have a clearer and fuller picture of everything that is going on in the nuclear sector."
"It is extremely important to think about waste management and safety here."
"Mr President, I wish to refer to Mr Malerba's report on the user-friendly information society, part of the broad fifth framework programme."
"I should like to put forward four observations on this report."
"First, the total European Union investment - not just that allocated within the fifth framework programme, but overall investment in the field - together with the investment made by each of the 15 Member States individually falls far short of the investment in this sector by our main competitors, the United States and Japan."
"We have to realise that information science is at the cutting edge of technology and should therefore welcome this initiative and carry it through."
"Furthermore, as the resources available are limited, they must be distributed wisely."
"In this respect, I welcome the rapporteur's suggestion to concentrate resources on objectives 1 and 3, namely, systems and services for the citizen and new technologies, rather than on objective 2, which relates to electronic commerce. This requires improved regulations, and thus calls for legislative action rather than investment."
"I should also like to point out that the final chapter is ill-defined and therefore somewhat vague."
"Our resources must be concentrated at the cutting edge, in those key sectors where investment will bear most fruit."
"Finally, I should like to refer to two types of amendments, following on from what our colleague from the Green Group said."
"At this stage, it would be extremely dangerous to start a witch hunt concerning the promotion of investment in this important sector."
"Many problems are indeed emerging, relating to safeguarding the rights of the individual, the right to privacy, for instance. However, we should bear in mind that the Internet arose as a result of research undertaken by the military, and later developed into what it is today."
"Caution is therefore advisable."
"In addition, I should like to endorse the rapporteur's opinion on some of the amendments put forward by the Committee on Women's Rights, relating, for example, to the introduction of gender quotas. These do seem to go rather too far."
"Mr President, I am already very disappointed with the manner in which the European Parliament's report deals with gene technology."
"On top of that, I find the talk of social ostracism that I hear, as opposed to the imposition of bans, very naïve."
"We were promised years ago that there were at last going to be standards, and after years of research programmes in this field it could be expected that the Commission would finally establish ethical standards instead of routinely insisting that this is what the research projects are supposed to be contributing to. It is becoming increasingly clear that they are merely waxing lyrical, and their real concern is with making unrestricted progress in this risky and ethically questionable research."
"Returning to the subject of research involving foetal tissue for instance, even the federal chamber of doctors in Germany has spoken out in favour of a moratorium."
"But the Commission is obviously unable to admit that this type of research is dubious, both scientifically and from an ethical point of view, and that some limits must finally be laid down in the field."
"This applies to the softening agent in babies' toys."
"The Commission says that bans cannot be imposed because research is needed, and yet its research programme contains absolutely no attempts at research that could finally put this issue on the agenda, namely environmental medicine and all these other questions concerning for example chemical substances."
"Mr President, the adoption of the fifth framework programme was a key moment for research in Europe, as we have all seen."
"Parliament managed to make its own voice and that of Europe's citizens heard, by introducing various themes which are crucial to the development and improvement of life and research in this Europe of ours."
"As I have stated on several occasions in all the institutional forums, only through research and technological innovation can we get the better of the unemployment which is afflicting Europe."
"Conducting research means creating jobs for the future and improving the lifestyle of our children; efforts must therefore be made in Europe to improve the attainment and dissemination of research findings, and to facilitate access to them."
"Today's adoption of the specific programmes must be seized as a further opportunity for companies, researchers and all the citizens of Europe."
"We naturally welcome a whole range of themes within the various programmes. Among these I would single out an extremely important one: the quality of life and management of biological resources."
"Europe has ample experience of research and applications in this field, and I would stress that - over and above all the ethical considerations - biotechnology and genetic engineering are having and will continue to have a crucial impact on the future of medicine and on our future well-being."
"I would also stress, on behalf of the committee which I chair, that a good deal of important work has been done in recent years, both on the framework programme, on which agreement has been reached - albeit painstakingly - with the Council, and on the specific programmes where, as you know, several amendments have been put forward."
"In conclusion, I hope that the Council will take due note of Parliament's suggestions, not least when adopting these programmes to which codecision does not apply: it would be a serious mistake not to take account of the opinions of those, like ourselves, who represent the citizens of Europe."
"Mr President, I should firstly like to congratulate my colleague Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl, the rapporteur, for all her very hard work in bringing the fifth framework programme to this point, including, I am pleased to say, paying a visit to Devon, my constituency, to hear about many research projects engaged in at Exeter University and Plymouth University."
"I welcome her interest."
"I welcome the outcome of the conciliation procedure."
"There were many researchers out there who were anxious about future funding and the prospect of funding being cut off."
"We should emphasise very strongly the importance of the fifth framework programme for networking across national borders."
"The importance of this work cannot be overstated even though it represents a very small proportion of overall spending in Europe on research."
"I urge the Commission to pay more attention in future to providing consistent assessments of bids, to telling unsuccessful applicants why they did not succeed, and to make payments on time because delays cause great difficulties, particularly for small businesses."
"I welcome the emphasis on SMEs participation."
"We should remember that they face particular difficulties in participating in these transnational large projects."
"I welcome Mrs McNally's support for the work of JET at Culham."
"That should reassure the staff who work there and who were anxious about their future employment prospects."
"Above all, I wish to emphasise the benefit of the fifth framework programme as a catalyst for progress, innovation, competitiveness, quality of life and employment in Europe."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"(The sitting was closed at 8.50 p.m.)"
"Interpretation of the Rules of Procedure"
"I have been informed by the Green Group, pursuant to Rule 162(4), that it contests the interpretation of the provisions governing the discharge procedure that was announced to Parliament yesterday."
"I would therefore remind the House that, as announced yesterday, the vote on this interpretation will take place at voting time today, in other words at 12 noon."
"There is of course no question of us holding a debate on this matter now."
"Rule 162 is perfectly clear."
"We shall vote at 12 noon."
"However, I will give the floor to Mrs Theato, who has asked to speak as chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"Madam President, I should like to request that the opinion drawn up by the Legal Service - which contains statements on this point -should also be made available to groups and Members."
"I do not know whether all Members have now received this opinion."
"Yesterday, it was also submitted to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities."
"That is difficult, Mrs Theato, since the interpretation has been given by the Committee on the Rules of Procedure."
"It is that interpretation which has been contested, and the House knows its mind well enough to decide freely for itself."
"It will do that at 12 noon today."
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Madam President, on 12 January 1999, Mr Wijsenbeek and I are required to attend the Court of Justice in Luxembourg at 9.30 a.m. in proceedings on a question referred for a preliminary ruling on the basis of Article 177 by the District Court in Rotterdam."
"We are therefore faced with a choice."
"We would have to leave Strasbourg very early in the morning to travel to Luxembourg and would therefore probably miss the voting, so we must choose whether to go to Luxembourg or stay here to vote."
"Who should decide?"
"This is a question that I raised yesterday as a point of order."
"My lawyers tell me that, according to Rule 2 of the Rules of Procedure, it is Mr Wijsenbeek and myself who should decide."
"If it is of overriding importance that we should be here, then we will inform the Court that we regret that we are unable to attend."
"If we say that it makes no difference and that we would be fulfilling our parliamentary duties better in the interests of the citizens of Europe and the free movement of persons by going to Luxembourg, then we will unfortunately probably not be here for the voting."
"It is up to us to decide, according to our lawyers."
"But the Bureau says that on the basis of Rule 5 it must decide for us, and that its decision is that, unfortunately for the Court of Justice, we must be here throughout the voting, otherwise we will be fined half a day's allowance for failure to attend."
"It has thus implicitly ruled that the half-day's allowance is income - think back to ground 21 in the Lord Bruce judgment - and is therefore subject to national taxation laws."
"I promised Mr Gil-Robles yesterday in the corridor here in Parliament that I would let the Secretary-General have a short statement in French and English sometime this week, and I shall be happy to hand it over to you this week, Madam President."
"Madam President, I would just like to say that the Court of Justice has indeed summoned me to attend on Tuesday, 12 January 1999 in the Wijsenbeek case."
"I would also point out that we have already discussed this issue in the Committee on Legal Affairs of which you yourself are a member, Madam President, and that the case concerns the free movement of persons and the interpretation of Articles 7 and 8, on which Parliament itself brought proceedings, though its case was rejected as inadmissible."
"I and my lawyer, Mr J.L. Janssen van Raay, who also happens to be my colleague here in the House, have ourselves brought proceedings on this issue, because as Members of the European Parliament and as ordinary citizens we are victims of the failure to implement Articles 7 and 8."
"I would therefore ask you, Madam President, both as President and as the party which brought the earlier proceedings - even if they were declared inadmissible - to lend us all possible support and cooperation and not to insist that all Members must be here all the time, because that is a misinterpretation of the Rules as construed by myself and Mr Janssen van Raay."
"Madam President, I have a comment on the Minutes, because the presidency yesterday committed an omission which could have serious consequences for relations between Parliament and the Council."
"It was on the Council's common position on the European capital of culture for the years 2005 to 2019."
"The deadline for any reactions expires today, but the presidency requested and was granted a postponement by the Council."
"It is not clear why and when this postponement is to begin, because no announcement was made yesterday that the common position had been received."
"You can put this right by announcing it now, which would mean that the deadline for reactions is postponed until 15 January."
"The Committee on Culture decided unanimously yesterday evening to put before the plenary a declaration of intent to reject the common position."
"If we do not react we shall achieve the exact opposite, which is that the common position will go through on the nod."
"I would therefore urgently request that you make this announcement today, and I would also point out that this is the consequence of the procedure followed with documents received, which is that the President says that documents have been received and refers to the Annex that is later attached to the Minutes."
"We all say yes, and have no way of checking whether what was agreed has actually been done."
"It is only now, a day later, that I can officially see what has happened."
"Because of this we had the unusual situation yesterday that, after the plenary and before the committee meeting, the services informed me that the announcement had been made, then after the committee meeting they said that it had not been after all."
"These sorts of misunderstandings are, of course, extremely slipshod."
"Yes indeed, Mr Pex."
"We are well aware of the situation, and I can assure you that the announcement will be made today."
"Madam President, I refer to last night's Minutes and the speech made by the newly elected colleague in this House from Scotland. In his speech he referred solely and continually to Scotland."
"Madam President, could you point out to the new colleague that this is a European Parliament and if he wants to continue with his narrow nationalist views maybe he should have been elected to the Scottish Parliament?"
"Madam President, I would like to make a further point concerning page 22 of the Minutes."
"You will recall that after the rejection of my request that the report be referred back to committee, in accordance with Rule 129, I felt I had to point out the consequences of a vote of rejection by Parliament, and the President agreed with me that there could be other requests for referral back to committee."
"This is not mentioned."
"I wish to have it recorded not because I was right but because the question might be repeated, and for future reference I think it would be good to record that this was stated."
"If it was not mentioned, Mr Fabre-Aubrespy, it is because that is what the Rules say and so it was not considered necessary."
"Madam President, I would like to make a point relating to Question Time."
"When we know which Commissioners are going to attend Question Time, we ask questions intended for those specific Commissioners."
"But in this instance, the European Commission has decided that questions that were intended for Mr Van Miert, since they concerned competition policy, are to be answered by Mr Papoutsis, who is not going to attend Question Time during this part-session."
"Madam President, I would like to protest to Parliament's Bureau because when we Members ask questions intended for specific Commissioners, it is because we know that they are the ones responsible for certain issues."
"I know - or at least, I imagine - that we cannot now change the questions, but the Bureau should use its authority to monitor such matters."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Madam President, you know that we all have to come here to Strasbourg for one week a month and that we are often deprived of news from our home countries."
"The situation has been somewhat improved by the fact that we now have a television in our room broadcasting in all sorts of languages."
"There is even a Dutch-language channel, but every time I come here I find that it has been switched off, and I have to make a number of telephone calls to have it restored."
"Could the services perhaps ensure that when we arrive on a Monday the Dutch channel is also available?"
"I am told that in the new building this will not be a problem, and it is certainly unfortunate for you not to be able to receive Dutch television."
"Decision on urgent procedure"
"Madam President, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture, I would like to call on the House to approve the request for urgent procedure for the programme to supply agricultural produce to the Russian Federation, in accordance with the resolution adopted by the House on 19 November."
"It appears that there is an urgent need to supply certain regions of the Russian Federation and certain groups - particularly the unemployed, sick and elderly - with agricultural produce."
"Therefore, the Committee on Agriculture is asking Parliament to approve this request for urgent procedure."
"Does anyone wish to speak against this request?"
"If not, I shall put it to the vote."
"(Parliament agreed to urgent procedure)"
"Discharge for 1996"
"The next item is the report (A4-0502/98) by Mr Elles, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the discharge to the Commission in respect of implementation of the general budget of the European Communities for the 1996 financial year."
"Madam President, I should like to request that Mr Elles's report be referred back to committee pursuant to Rule 129 of the Rules of Procedure."
"I would therefore ask you to call Members back so that they can take part in the vote."
"I think the reasons are sufficiently well known."
"I do not wish to prolong the procedure."
"Thank you."
"Yes indeed, we shall vote without delay, but after hearing one speaker for and one against, as provided for by the Rules."
"Madam President, I can only agree with Mrs Müller's request."
"Her explanation of the reasons for this request was brief. I too will be extremely brief as I explained yesterday why I considered a referral to be necessary."
"I am therefore in favour of it."
"Madam President, in March we set out the conditions for the Commission to be given discharge."
"The Commission has largely met those conditions, which means that there is now nothing to prevent us from doing what we said in March, namely giving discharge."
"(Parliament rejected the request for referral back to committee)"
"We shall now proceed with the debate on the report by Mr Elles."
"Madam President, I rise to present my final report on the 1996 discharge."
"Last week in the Committee on Budgetary Control, a narrow margin came down in favour of giving discharge while voting across party lines."
"Even so, this report itself is highly critical of the Commission's management."
"We must now decide whether these criticisms merit refusal to grant discharge of this budget by the whole House."
"There are three specific concerns that remain despite the valiant efforts of the budget Commissioner, Erkki Liikanen, to fill the gap left by the invisible Commissioner for financial control, Mrs Gradin."
"First, the perceived lack of democratic control in the fight against fraud."
"In all good faith, last October this House adopted the Bösch report, setting out a clear structure for an anti-fraud office - OLAF."
"Despite the fanfare of the President of the Commission earlier this month in Brussels, announcing an independent institution to combat fraud, this proposal does not meet the request of Parliament."
"Many fear it will make combating fraud more rather than less difficult, negating as it does the independent right of investigation in the case of internal checks."
"Second, the perceived lack of coherence and sound financial management in external policies."
"Information recently made available to Parliament by a courageous Commission official has confirmed many of our worst fears in several programmes."
"The handling of these issues by the Commission has compounded the problem."
"Not only have examples found during the discharge procedure revealed a real concern that irregularities are committed without individual Commissioners perceiving the need to take personal responsibility for their actions; but furthermore, the Commission has refused to make certain documents available to Parliament, the most flagrant disrespect of Parliament being shown in the ECHO case, where the text handed over was so heavily censored as to make it totally illegible."
"Last and by no means least is the perceived lack of effective measures for improved administrative and budgetary management."
"Not only have recent high-profile cases involving certain members of the Commission with regard to staff appointments caused severe damage to the credibility of the Commission, but also evidence given a few days ago to our committee revealed the scope for abuse in the appointment of high officials in the Commission where, I am afraid to say, it still seems that who you know is more important than what you know."
"As testified, the inordinate power over appointments and resource allocations exposes the administrative structure to potential political interference in all matters of management unparalleled in Member States' public administrations."
"These factors can be summarised by the notion that flaws in management organisation have inevitably led to operational distortions in implementing policies."
"It is small wonder that staff morale in the Commission is at a low ebb."
"In essence, not enough thought has been given since 1995 to how the Commission should be run."
"Well qualified and hard-working officials have in many cases been asked to do too much with too little."
"The secretive way in which high-level appointments are made has not helped."
"These issues must be resolved as soon as possible."
"The conclusions of the committee are drawn up with the purpose of establishing a work programme for the Commission over the next 12 months to ensure significant change to modernise the Commission by 1 January 2000."
"Proposals include a revision of the Statute; a screening report of the Commission services so that Parliament can judge what staff the Commission needs to carry out its responsibilities effectively; and, not least, a code of conduct for the nomination of high-level officials."
"Is it acceptable that certain posts are kept empty, sometimes for years, waiting for the appropriate cabinet member?"
"Is it appropriate that certain cabinets set aside a number of flags for themselves at the beginning of the Commission?"
"I would say it is not and this needs to be acted on as soon as possible."
"This work programme was adopted in the committee by a vast majority."
"It is deeply disquieting to have the feeling outside the Commission that any behaviour is accepted without fear of reprimand."
"Where we have disagreed is on two essential aspects."
"First, some maintain that this discharge report contains many criticisms which go beyond the 1996 year and therefore wish to just treat the discharge as a technical matter with no political overtones."
"But specific evidence found relating to the 1996 budget year in many policy areas continues to be revealed by colleagues in their reports to the committee, as well as by journalistic investigation in several newspapers."
"Yet still some turn a blind eye, seemingly not wanting to take account of the evidence presented."
"The second point is the fallacious allegation presented that the discharge amounts to sacking the Commission - a vote of censure."
"But this is illustrative of the manipulation to which many in this Parliament have been subjected, perhaps taking too much advice from those outside rather than looking at the specific provisions of the Treaty."
"This discharge procedure is an entirely separate matter from that of censure, being a regular annual process which must be judged on its own merits."
"A vote to censure the Commission has been suggested by a few parliamentarians - who are not with us at this time - but it is not a course I would support."
"Why, then, did I vote in committee not to grant discharge to the Commission?"
"Not only are the substantive issues serious enough to justify not doing so, but the real truth is that the Commission is incapable of undertaking these reforms by itself."
"Many of these issues have been on the table for years."
"The reformers in the Commission have been unable to make headway against a wide range of vested interests."
"They cannot succeed without the active support of our Parliament."
"I therefore conclude by making an appeal on behalf of all those, whether inside or outside the Commission, who wish to see modernised institutions based on integrity, ready to implement the euro and welcome new members from the East."
"To give discharge for 1996 at this juncture could only be interpreted as a whitewash, a message to continue as before, ignoring Parliament's requests."
"We must now act not only for the long-term viability of our institutions but also for the credibility of our Parliament."
"We must have the courage to shoulder our responsibilities, based on facts available to us. Remember that when you all vote tomorrow you should be thinking of those who elected you and who would be in favour of a people's Europe."
"I urge the House not to grant discharge on the 1996 budget."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, one of the main criticisms of the implementation of the 1996 budget is that in that year - and with the substantial budgetary appropriations at its disposal - the Commission failed to implement the European Union's external policies effectively."
"Neither the appropriations for PHARE and TACIS - the programmes for Central and Eastern Europe - nor those for the Mediterranean countries showed satisfactory levels of execution."
"Only 15 % of the aid for reconstruction for Bosnia - and I am taking this as my example - was actually used."
"The main reasons were the Commission's incapacity to take the required managerial measures in good time, and its inability either to deploy its staff effectively or request the additional resources necessary."
"Compared with the United States, the reconstruction aid programme for Bosnia, for example, was grossly understaffed."
"The European Union's inefficiency became legendary in Sarajevo."
"Whether we still wish to grant discharge in the light of these facts - which belong in 1996 and can no longer be altered for that financial year - is something which the following criteria must decide: firstly, there must be a real improvement in the way in which the European Union operates in the region; secondly, comprehensive information about the measures taken should also be provided, so that Parliament has a clear understanding of where improvements have been made and where the weaknesses remain."
"It is true that, following my report of April 1998, the number of staff working on the reconstruction of Bosnia was increased considerably."
"The Commission is endeavouring to improve matters locally."
"But it is still not clear whether the decentralisation of the management of the programme to the area, which we requested, is allowing targeted monitoring of the project."
"As the Court of Auditors recently noted, the results are hard to see."
"A large number of European non-governmental organisations - such as Caritas and Evangelisches Hilfswerk - do not qualify for the Commission's reconstruction aid."
"The Commission passes on a large proportion of the money released by Parliament to the United Nations relief organisation, which makes it impossible for us to fulfil our monitoring obligations."
"The cooperation of the directorate-general brought in to work on the reconstruction of Bosnia could be improved."
"Despite repeated requests, Commissioner Liikanen is refusing to give information about the increase in staff appropriations which has been demanded."
"He is either withholding the necessary information from Parliament or giving evasive answers."
"Madam President, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has discussed the budget in detail and has tried to come up with some improvements for payments under the Social Fund and in the other social items."
"We note that there has been a gradual improvement in the situation over the last financial year, particularly as regards the Social Fund."
"However, a number of problems arose at the end of the year because there was not enough money to pay for the projects that had been completed, and this is something we are likely to encounter again with this budget."
"That was the first point I wished to make."
"I also wanted to thank the rapporteur for the way in which he has examined this whole issue in such depth."
"In the past the discharge was perhaps just a formality, and I sometimes have the impression that this is still more or less how it is viewed by the other side of the House, but nevertheless the fact is that we are now having a very detailed and important debate on one of the most fundamental elements of the European Union."
"There is one point in the social section on which I am not yet in a position to comment, but which I would still like to say something about."
"A letter was written to Mrs Aelvoet and sent via the Internet and was thus accessible to anyone in the House who wanted to read it."
"A small section of the letter referred to Leonardo da Vinci, a vocational training programme that comes under the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"We have of course not been able to investigate this matter, and even when it was discussed in the committee this aspect of Leonardo was not on the agenda."
"I would therefore request that it should certainly be looked at more closely, which is what we intend to do in the committee."
"First of all, we need to examine whether 1996 was the only year concerned, or whether there were others."
"We are going to have to go into this very carefully."
"I cannot comment on the substance of the claims, but I believe they are serious enough for us to look into them very thoroughly."
"This is another good reason for agreeing with the rapporteur's cautious approach to the discharge."
"Madam President, I was rather surprised that a rapporteur who talked in such detail about the integrity of the Commission should place so little emphasis on the fact that he was speaking on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, because as far as I know the committee voted in favour of giving discharge, albeit by an extremely narrow majority."
"I find the reactions in the House to be quite remarkable, because we now seem to be accepting that rapporteurs should no longer speak as rapporteurs but should suddenly be freed from their responsibilities, which is very strange."
"To give discharge or not to give discharge, that is the question, and it is a very interesting one at that."
"In March of this year, we postponed the discharge and we laid down five demands for the Commission."
"The only question now is whether the Commission has done enough to meet those five demands."
"The Committee on Budgetary Control itself has dropped three of the five because they have already been met over the last few months, and Commissioner Liikanen in particular has made exceptional efforts here."
"There are two areas left where progress still needs to be made;"
"Mr Elles has described one of them in detail, but the other goes way beyond the scope of the five demands we laid down last time, and we really cannot expect the Commission to solve its entire staffing policy problem in just a few months."
"That would be quite ridiculous, and no one can expect it of the present Commission or its successor."
"There is so much to do, and it has already largely resolved one of the most serious scandals, that of taking on staff outside the Commission without proper provision in the budget."
"Agreement on this at least has been reached with the Committee on Budgetary Control, but there is still plenty to be done."
"There is still the problem of the provision of information."
"The flow of information from the Commission to the Committee on Budgets during the discharge procedure must be considerably improved if the discharge is to be meaningful, and I think we need to work towards an interinstitutional agreement to be able to deal with the discharge properly."
"But again, these are two problems that could not have been solved in the short time since the discharge was postponed and on which further work will have to be done over the next few months or, when it comes to the staffing problem, even years."
"A lot of issues have blown up since the discharge was postponed in March."
"Newspapers such as Libération , Focus and Stern have revealed the various scandals and stories of mismanagement, the Court of Auditors' report on PHARE and TACIS and nuclear safety."
"So there was some justification for including all sorts of other issues in the discharge debate, but I think that these are generally things that need to be examined in more detail and should be included in the 1997 discharge procedure which is just beginning."
"So we must not be influenced by the tabloid press into changing our conditions for giving discharge."
"If we think that the Commission has not done enough to meet our demands, then we can draw the necessary political conclusions from this and dismiss the Commission, rather than postponing the discharge again or refusing to give it or tabling a motion of no confidence."
"Simply refusing to grant discharge is far too easy."
"Article 206 is very clear on this point and says that discharge must in the end be given."
"It may be postponed, but it cannot be refused."
"This is why the no-confidence motion is the only instrument left."
"This does not alter the fact that the resolution before us is extremely critical of the Commission."
"The Socialist Group has tabled a large number of amendments to try to establish a better balance between the decision to give discharge and the text of the resolution."
"We hope that these amendments will be approved and that the necessary balance will be created."
"Madam President, this Parliament has the task of monitoring how the Commission handles European taxpayers' money."
"The responsibility is ours alone."
"The Council merely gives us a recommendation, but we have to decide whether we can give the Commission discharge in respect of its implementation of the budget or not."
"However, to make this decision, we need to have the necessary information."
"Since this was not the case, we had to postpone the discharge in March; nor were we in a position to decide in September, as announced."
"It is now December, and we still do not have all the information we have requested, despite the Commission's recently sending us a document - which it considered to be exhaustive - with a view to obtaining the discharge."
"On the other hand, Parliament can only have felt cheated, for example, when it received the UCLAF documents on ECHO which had been tampered with."
"I ask you: can it be right for the institution under audit to determine on what and to what extent it wishes to be audited?"
"It is also about informing the competent judicial authorities."
"In two resolutions in February and March, we called on the Commission to inform the competent judicial authorities swiftly whenever there was the suspicion - and I emphasise, suspicion - of fraud."
"Until it was ensured that this was the case, discharge could not be given, according to the resolutions."
"The Elles report unambiguously states, in paragraph 7, that this very condition has not been fully complied with."
"The ECHO case illustrates this, but so does the MED affair."
"We still do not know whether the Commission has handed over all the documents to the judicial authorities."
"This puts its credibility at risk and damages the confidence that steps are being taken against cases of suspected fraud in its own ranks."
"It is the same story with the Commission's response to the Bösch report on establishing an Anti-Fraud Office."
"The Commission's proposal of 2 December will have exactly the opposite effect of what it alleges it will achieve."
"The resources and powers are poor enough as it is, and they are being eroded instead of consolidated."
"When we vote on giving discharge to the Commission on Thursday, you will know the facts, as they are listed point by point in the Elles report."
"Each of us then has to be answerable for being able to give discharge under these circumstances."
"Based on what I know and after repeatedly scrutinising my assessment, I cannot accept the responsibility for doing so."
"Madam President, I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Elles."
"I think that Parliament has seldom been so focused on the importance of the discharge as it has been in his report, and I welcome this."
"My first question is this: what happens if the discharge is not given?"
"Would the Commission regard this as a motion of no confidence, or would it simply disregard it?"
"It is important for Parliament to know this."
"I and my group also think that what the Commission has done since April this year, when conditions were first laid down for granting discharge, is important."
"I feel that the Commission has shown good will in trying to solve the problems, but is this enough?"
"No, clearly not."
"The resolution before us makes a number of very critical points which I think the Commission will take very seriously, because it is Parliament's right ultimately to decide on whether or not to give discharge, and the deadlines it mentions are going to have to be taken very seriously indeed."
"I think that the interpretation given to Article 206 of the Treaty is also of crucial importance."
"How far can the Commission go in providing Parliament with information without harming the personal interests of officials?"
"I think that we need to have a sort of covenant or, as Mr Dankert said, an interinstitutional agreement so that everyone knows what the position is in future."
"Of the points made in the report, I think that the most important are the ones relating to the personal interests of officials and, secondly, the organisation of the Commission itself. How do officials gain promotion?"
"What can prevent them from doing so?"
"There is a great deal of unease about this issue, and I think it needs to be sorted out as soon as possible."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, if today's debate on giving discharge to the Commission in respect of the implementation of the general budget of the European Communities for the 1996 financial year is one of dramatic intensity and not without passion, it is because, unquestionably, we have gone beyond the bounds what is acceptable."
"This debate has gone beyond technical issues to become political in the true sense of the word."
"Successive audits by the Court of Auditors, which since 1994 has declined to provide positive overall assurance as to the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying the payments for the financial year, have condemned the way in which the Commission manages the operating appropriations allocated to it, whether for humanitarian interventions or the PHARE, TACIS and MEDA programmes or indeed the reconstruction programmes in the former Yugoslavia."
"Not only are these appropriations used inefficiently or diverted from their target, but the lack of transparency in management has allowed real misappropriations of funds to the detriment of both the beneficiaries of the programmes and European taxpayers."
"The compromises shown on a daily basis in the selection of operators call into question the highest authorities of the Commission, and there are serious flaws in the appointment of officials which cast doubt on the credibility of the institution."
"The almost total absence of communication and coordination between the different Directorates-General and services of the Commission increases the lack of transparency in management and prevents monitoring procedures from functioning normally, encouraging the widespread lack of accountability among administrators."
"All these shortcomings were thrust into the spotlight by the committees of inquiry set up by the European Parliament, for example on the tragic BSE affair and on fraud in Community transit."
"Yet the Commission, instead of dealing with the problem head-on by undertaking a drastic reform of its structures and procedures and opting for transparency, still maintains its haughty or even contemptuous attitude towards the monitoring bodies and towards Parliament."
"All the current operational problems were exposed by the European Parliament."
"Need we point out that the serious fraud in the management of appropriations for tourism was exposed because one of our colleagues brought an action before the Belgian criminal courts, thus forcing the Commission to provide documents which it had hitherto refused to make available to the European Court of Auditors or to Parliament?"
"Officials who contributed to the inquiry are today being punished unjustly."
"In the light of the gravity of the facts exposed and the obvious reluctance of the Commission to cooperate with the European Parliament, we must refuse to grant a discharge."
"In March we gave the Commission respite by postponing the discharge to allow it to mend its ways."
"It only half-listened."
"Some of our colleagues today wish to grant the Commission a conditional discharge."
"This is pointless and shows great hypocrisy."
"Why would the Commission, whose mandate comes to an end in less than a year, achieve in the space of the next three months what it has so delayed doing hitherto?"
"And what means would we have to sanction the Commission if it appeared that, once again, it had not followed our recommendations?"
"Would we have the political courage to vote for a motion of censure during our last part-session in May?"
"Those who propose such prevarication actually want to allow the Commission to escape all political sanction."
"The Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities, to which the matter was referred at the request of the chairman of the Socialist Group, has given the opinion that any amendment in plenary that goes against the recommendation of the Committee on Budgetary Control, which proposes that the discharge should be granted, should be declared inadmissible. This vote was obtained under dubious circumstances,"
"whereas a previous vote had not approved this discharge, the votes being shared equally."
"As for Mr Dankert, a former president of Parliament, he has the impertinence to tell us that we do not have the right to vote against granting discharge, although there is a precedent: in 1984 we refused discharge, and we refused it again following a report by Mr Wynn concerning the discharge by the EDF."
"When procedural devices are used to prevent a parliament from expressing itself, democracy is in danger."
"I am sure that you will not fall into this crude trap, that you will assume your full political responsibilities towards your electorate and that as a result you will refuse to grant a discharge to the Commission in respect of the implementation of the budget for the 1996 financial year."
"Imagine, in a private sector company, an executive being granted discharge for its administration when the auditors refuse to testify, as did the Court of Auditors, to the regularity of the accounts."
"By granting a discharge under these conditions we would be failing to fulfil our obligations under the Treaties to protect the interests of the taxpayers."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, we see the discharge process as an eminently political rather than an administrative process."
"Nor can this process be analysed in the light of immediate interests, whether or not there are elections in the offing, or the stage which the Commission's term of office has reached - or, even, whether there might be a motion of censure."
"We think that the European Parliament should regard the present discharge process purely in terms of the powers conferred upon it by the Treaty and it should exercise those rigorously and responsibly."
"In these terms, the question before us is only what position to take in the light of the irregularities and instances of fraud that have been brought to light - and since we know that the Commission is undeniably responsible and that the Commission has failed to act, in particular to inform the European Parliament and the judicial authorities of the Member States."
"We should also ask ourselves whether the answers given by the Commission are enough and whether they are in keeping with the seriousness of what has taken place and whether our minds can be at rest for the future."
"For us, the response is a definite 'no' to all of these questions - for if we did grant the discharge in this present situation not only would the European Parliament be failing outright to assume its responsibilities but, inevitably, it would be seen as jointly responsible for the acts that it has itself been denouncing."
"Furthermore, that would be in complete contradiction with the assessments which - despite everything - the Committee on Budgetary Control adopted last week."
"Therefore, we believe that the European Parliament, at this moment and given that it does not have the slightest guarantees, should not grant the Commission its discharge."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, my group is determined not to grant discharge to the Commission."
"It is no longer a question of whether we have enough evidence to do this, but how we judge these facts politically, and what the view of the majority will be."
"I say to my fellow Members - and I am also thinking of those sitting in their rooms in front of their television screens - that this is Parliament's finest hour."
"We all need to weigh up the facts, but what standards should we apply?"
"Each and every one of us has different loyalties to take into account: loyalties to individual Commissioners, to our party or to our government."
"But as Members of the European Parliament, should we put personal, party political or national interests before the interests of Europe?"
"Should we disappoint the citizens of Europe who are now expecting Parliament to send out a clear signal?"
"Do we not also have a responsibility to the many excellent staff at the Commission?"
"Doubt has been cast on their ability to do the job for which they are qualified, just because a few are not called to account."
"All too often these days - and in particular from our esteemed colleague, Mrs Green - I hear that Europe would be plunged into chaos if discharge were not given to the Commission."
"Quite honestly, I take a very dim view of dramatising the situation."
"It only obscures one's view of the essential point."
"What is the essential point in this case?"
"Obviously, it is the supervisory role which Parliament is assigned in the Treaty."
"The citizens of Europe trust that this role will be fulfilled."
"The atmosphere between the institutions is not exactly sweetness and light the whole time, but for all that, to talk immediately in such apocalyptic terms does not help one bit."
"So, not so fast, not granting discharge is not a death sentence, but a yellow card for bad behaviour."
"But we must send out this signal, so that the public knows that it can rely on Parliament."
"Nor does it make any sense to say that we cannot be too hard on the Commission in view of our own problems."
"Certainly, we should not get on our high horse, but this is about the Commission's failings alone."
"We will not put an end to them by shamefaced introspection."
"Let us judge the Commission for ourselves, and then in the future we will also apply the same standards even more so to ourselves."
"In any case, my group will have no part in an organised display of irresponsible behaviour."
"That is why we will be voting against giving discharge."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament - demonstrating a sense of responsibility and awareness of its powers - voted by a large majority last March for a postponement of discharge. It did so pursuant to Annex V of the Rules of Procedure, which was perfectly acceptable then;"
"The rapporteur, Mr Elles, had drawn attention to a number of grave problems, and Parliament performed its supervisory role to the full."
"It seems to me that since then the Commissioner, Mr Liikanen, and the officials and Commissioners responsible have spared no efforts in attempting to respond to the serious and thoughtful stance adopted by Parliament in accordance with the Treaty."
"Over the past few weeks, however, some have been seeking to transform this important and serious exercise into a purely political affair."
"We have seen senior officials - people who may well be gone from the Commission a month from now - passing through the Committee on Budgetary Control, denouncing this and that, and the dossiers are mounting up."
"Now, if this matter is to be played up into a political issue, where both institutions have everything to lose, well, the time is ripe and that is clearly the preferred option, not of a majority but of a rather odd cross-party minority extending from the far right to the far left of this House, taking in a number of groups on the way."
"I doubt that Europe will emerge strengthened."
"Madam President, I take an extremely dim view of the fact that the handling of discharge has been transformed into a political issue. Had the other side won 14 to 13 in committee, discharge would undoubtedly have been granted, but since that side was defeated it now becomes an irregular vote."
"I believe that it was irresponsible to place us in this situation: either this exercise is not conducted at all, or it is conducted on the basis of a broad consensus in this House, so that the message reaches not only the Commission but also, if I may say so, the governments and public opinion."
"We are a fortnight away from the introduction of the single currency and, as it happens, six months away from elections, and I am entirely convinced that Mr Pasty is initiating his election campaign."
"His group has always opposed the building of Europe; fair enough - whether or not this is an anti-Commission election campaign does not change the background."
"I do not believe that this is an effective way of conducting our debates."
"Our resolution, which will be put to the vote on Thursday, remains critical - as we have always been - and demanding of the Commission; it calls on the Commission to improve its internal operations, and I am convinced - or rather, I hope - that in his reply Mr Liikanen will tell us his thoughts on some important parts of the document being put to the vote."
"But please let us not transform this vote into an exclusively political one, as some have attempted to do."
"I would say to certain members of one of the most active groups in this House what the Gospel says: 'Let he who is without sin cast the first stone', if I remember rightly."
"I think we must be just a little more consistent with what has gone before, and not seek to transform this exercise into a settling of scores, which has no raison d'être."
"Political and national elections are one thing, ladies and gentlemen; our debate is another!"
"As permitted by the Rules, Mr Pasty has asked for the floor to make a personal statement."
"Madam President, I cannot simply ignore the remarks just made by Mr Dell'Alba to the effect that my group has always been against European construction."
"This is completely incorrect."
"To denounce, as I have done, the failures of a European institution in fulfilling its duties towards European citizens and taxpayers, is not, in my opinion, acting against European construction but, on the contrary, in favour of it. After all, the construction of Europe will not be able to progress without sufficient confidence in the European institutions, the Commission of course and also Parliament, and Parliament must exercise its responsibilities."
"It has responsibilities under the Treaty and it must exercise them."
"Madam President, the majority of the Committee on Budgetary Control propose that we grant a discharge to the Commission for the 1996 financial year."
"It does so, as it did in 1994 and 1995, even though the Court of Auditors has declined to provide positive assurance as to the regularity of the accounts."
"Therefore, we are effectively in a situation in which, although the accounts are claimed to be incorrect, we would grant a discharge and we would do so by using procedural devices, by saying that amendments are not allowed, by saying that the Rules of Procedure take precedence over the Treaty, by using devices."
"I am in favour of refusing to grant a discharge, for the reasons given in particular by Mr Elles and Mr Pasty."
"Refusing to grant a discharge is not to target one Commissioner or another."
"It is not to target the Commissioners personally, it is to give a verdict on a system, a system guided by the philosophy that we need to spend more and that not spending more means curbing European construction, a system in which questioning the operation of an institution such as the Commission would be considered as holding Europe back, whereas of course it in fact allows it to advance."
"Never before have there been so many irregularities, so many scandals within the Commission."
"Never before have we seen so many officials denounce anonymously to Members of Parliament what they see, what they hear."
"This is why Parliament must exercise its responsibilities."
"It is because some people want to grant it powers that it is not capable of exercising when it has them that I will vote against granting a discharge, and I am grateful in advance to all those who are going to hand a convincing argument to people like me who believe that it is the Member States who can best monitor things, that is, all those who are preparing to vote in favour of the discharge."
"Madam President, the Elles report, which provides us with a list - very probably incomplete - of the numerous tricks the Commission was guilty of in 1996, is of exceptional importance because of the gravity of the facts it contains."
"We are aghast at the Commission's inability to manage huge sums of money, paid, we must remember, by the taxpayers, and at the great skill it has displayed in concealing this."
"We are appalled by the contempt in which the Commission holds Parliament."
"We are outraged to learn, from the media, that European officials who might have been tempted to reveal to Parliament the criminal acts they have witnessed, are being threatened by their superiors."
"Numerous questions addressed by the European Parliament to the Commission, such as those concerning Mrs Cresson directly, or the Périlux affair relating to humanitarian aid, or indeed the dubious management of funds intended for statistical studies, have still not been answered."
"But of course the Commission does not have a monopoly on embezzlement."
"What can we say about the skulduggery surrounding the construction of the International Congress Centre in Brussels and, even more so - in fact much more so - the construction of the large 'object' just a short distance away from here, which may one day end up being our headquarters?"
"If the Eurosceptics were short of arguments we have certainly given them some."
"Mr President, the issues which led to us deferring the approval of the accounts in the spring have for the most part been resolved to our satisfaction."
"The questions which the Commission has still not dealt with are all ones which only affect the accounts indirectly, or not at all."
"It has therefore now come as a bolt from the blue that an unholy alliance of Conservatives, Liberals and extremists is threatening to reject the accounts for 1996."
"Everyone in the Committee on Budgetary Control agrees that the Commission has acted in a way that is very much open to criticism, but the point now is to join together in finding constructive solutions to the problems that have been revealed."
"At worst, rejecting the accounts now may mean that good Commissioners like Mr Liikanen, who is the first Commissioner ever to have shown some interest in clearing things up, will be forced to resign."
"In such a case, however, I would like to see one or two others go as well."
"At best, it may result in the EU having a lame-duck Commission for six months, a period in which there are more important things on the agenda."
"I would just mention the introduction of the euro, the work on enlarging the EU to include the new applicant countries and the forthcoming elections to our own institution, and perhaps that is why this joker is being played here - there are some people who want to make a name for themselves in an election campaign at home, and this issue is being used for that purpose."
"The voting yesterday and today shows that there is a clear majority in Parliament in favour of closing the accounts for 1996."
"However, this does not mean that the Commission is now being given a permanent carte blanche for all the years to come."
"It means that the European Social Democrats will monitor the Commission night and day in order to uncover the truth for the benefit of the ordinary citizens of Europe."
"I would advise the Commission to be on its mettle in the future."
"We shall be constantly snapping at its heels, and while we were a watchdog before, now we shall be one with teeth, so that we can clear up all these matters."
"The Commission has shown the will to do this, for which I think it should be rewarded, and so everyone else should stop using this for their own personal election campaigns."
"Mr President, the European Parliament must remain a place of negotiation and compromise."
"Within the interinstitutional balance, this is the place for negotiation and compromise."
"We are not a House of confrontation, as a national parliament would be, because we do not have a government here to support or oppose."
"The Commission has not been elected by us, but it is our duty to help it work better."
"The greatest achievements of this Parliament have come about as a result of cooperation with the Commission."
"Parliament and the Commission are the only two truly European bodies and, where possible, we must work in the same direction."
"This is not the ideal time to go our separate ways."
"We cannot close the door to negotiations with the Commission by refusing to grant discharge."
"The Elles report includes a proposal for a work programme in paragraph 26."
"This work programme is the key to the future relations between Parliament and the Commission, but it cannot be implemented in a context of interinstitutional confrontation in which the Commission is condemned or censured - as certain political groups have already said they want to see happen - or, simply, in which the Commission is in a weaker position for what remains of its mandate than it is in today."
"Ladies and gentlemen, if we want the Commission successfully to complete its reorganisation - which is obviously essential - if we want it to respond to the many accusations of poor management, and if we want the European Parliament to have greater democratic control over the Community institutions, then we must not close the only door we have left to negotiation."
"Therefore, to keep this door open, I would urge you to grant discharge under the same terms as the Elles report was approved in the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"Mr President, the question of whether or not to grant discharge is one that turns on Parliament's role as an authority which exercises budgetary control."
"It is in fact our credibility which is at stake, because if we give a discharge to the Commission, we shall be assuming joint responsibility for all the outstanding problems."
"Our work has not been particularly encouraging in the last nine months, when I think of how we have had to drag information out of the Commission and how we have had to fight for the slightest changes."
"The worst thing, to my mind, has been the attempts to disclaim responsibility for various mistakes and scandals."
"It has also been disappointing that, although we have repeatedly given new deadlines, there are a great many things which have not been followed up by the Commission."
"In my view, this is not a question of wanting to send the Commission packing."
"My aim is to ensure that the problems are resolved, that the EU is adapted to new tasks, to the major challenges that are facing us, and that the EU is prepared for and copes with its enlargement to include the countries of Central and Eastern Europe."
"It is above all the European Parliament which, as the institution that represents our electors, will be held responsible by our taxpayers for how we use money in the EU."
"The point is therefore for us to live up to our responsibility and do what we can to bring about a sound and effective administration."
"There are some things which have been resolved after a long campaign of pressure."
"However, there are still some serious outstanding problems and an ineffective administration."
"It is completely unacceptable that two, three or four years should go by before political decisions are put into practice."
"There are the problems with staff policy, and there is a lack of internal procedures where irregularities and corruption are suspected."
"The proposal which the Commission has put forward regarding changes in UCLAF is an insult to all those who wish to have a clear approach, because what we have here is the Commission wanting to keep full control over what is to be investigated and how it is followed up."
"Some people have talked about the consequences of refusing to grant discharge."
"I believe that granting a discharge would have the most consequences, because that will not solve the outstanding problems and we would be playing our hand poorly on behalf of Parliament."
"If we can now accept what it takes for us to refuse discharge for a second time, and ultimately we will find it hard to explain to our voters how it fits in with our responsibility to..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, I do not consider that we are talking about a political issue or about an institutional dispute between the bodies."
"Anyone who claims that the subject we are debating is a difference of opinion between socialists and populists, or claims that it just concerns a shift of balance between the bodies, is in a way trying to force the hand of the Members."
"Indeed, the Commission is the supranational body best suited to our purposes and is Parliament's best ally."
"Indeed, I could add that the Commission is one of the best bureaucracies I know."
"However, it suffers the weakness and, if you will, the isolation of unaccountability. This is brought out very clearly in the Court of Auditors report, which refuses to confirm that all is going well."
"And this is where Parliament can play a very simple part, by striving to secure the trust of Europe's citizens in our institutions and in the building of Europe."
"Anything else, I repeat, is rhetoric and blackmail."
"Consequently, we cannot approve discharge."
"Mr President, of course it is not Parliament's business to investigate fraud; that is not what we are doing."
"According to the Treaties, however, the European Parliament does have a horizontal remit to check that taxpayers' money is being correctly spent within the EU."
"Political conclusions must then be drawn."
"The question we have to ask ourselves is this: has the Commission managed to administer the European taxpayer's money in the best possible way?"
"I think not."
"As the days go by, more and more reports of alleged fraud and suspected irregularities are coming in."
"Yet the Commission is not coming forward with all the documents - and that is precisely the problem."
"Lack of transparency within the Commission, its failure to produce all the information, simply encourage corrupt practices and nepotism. It is the institution itself and ordinary taxpayers who are the losers."
"What is needed is access to documents and an open system of administration."
"Those who vote to grant discharge are effectively acquitting the Commission of the many allegations made against it. They are flatly dismissing criticism of the way the Commission spends our money."
"I am very disillusioned at the way in which the PSE Group seems to be shielding the Commission, tolerating both its cavalier attitude towards taxpayers' money and its secretive style of operation."
"The Green Group and I will naturally be voting against discharge."
"Mr President, as democratic nationalists and regionalists, we are unable to give discharge today."
"In granting discharge, the European Parliament would be guaranteeing its citizens that their money was being spent as economically and efficiently as possible and that the institutions were doing everything in their power to provide the best possible protection against fraud, corruption and organised crime, and we feel that we cannot, in all conscience, say that today."
"The people of Europe have little confidence in the European institutions, accusing them of being overly interfering and wasteful, and of delaying and failing to act effectively when action is required."
"Giving the Commission discharge now when everyone knows that there are major abuses and inefficiencies in handling European funding would rightly be seen by the public as a failure to take things seriously."
"Our responsibility as representatives of the European Parliament is at stake here."
"Giving discharge would be circumventing a number of reasons which Parliament gave earlier for not granting discharge."
"The Commission has clearly argued that improvements have been made, which we acknowledge, but there is still a lack of democratic responsibility in the areas of combating fraud, tourism, MED, ECHO and so on."
"Need we go on?"
"We also feel that the new proposals are not adequate and do not provide appropriate measures for improving administrative and budgetary policy."
"Commissioners, you must realise that cronyism and nepotism are clearly endemic, and the public are no longer prepared to tolerate the combining of interests that this involves."
"As far as Parliament is concerned, there is still not sufficient access to the information we need if we are to carry out parliamentary controls properly."
"The Commission has threatened that if discharge is not given the Commission will resign."
"What sort of a threat is that?"
"Clearly everyone must take his or her own responsibility here and now."
"We are currently being asked whether we can give discharge with a good conscience."
"If not, and if there are consequences to be drawn from this, everyone will have to decide for themselves."
"There may be a motion of no confidence, or maybe not."
"That is not the issue at present."
"The Commission can draw its own conclusions, either collectively or individually."
"We certainly regret that motions of no confidence cannot be tabled against individual Commissioners."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would say to Mrs Müller that it is always Parliament's finest hour when we hold debates here, not only when we are discussing Article 206."
"Article 206 stipulates that for the purposes of giving the discharge, Parliament shall examine the accounts - the financial statement and the annual report by the Court of Auditors - for 1996, so not for subsequent years."
"Now you have claimed today, Mrs Müller - and this is something I cannot overlook - that granting discharge is an organised display of irresponsible behaviour."
"Those are the very words you used."
"I categorically refute this, because granting discharge is not an irresponsible act; it provides an answer to the following question: is the discharge procedure an act of revenge on the existing Commission, or is it an invitation to establish new systems within the Community to ensure that the mistakes of the past are not repeated?"
"I am surprised to see all these colleagues taking the floor today, when I have never before heard them speak during the political debate of the last nine years on developing new procedures."
"Mrs Müller, I can tell you that it was the Committee on Budgets which was responsible for making sure that the director-general responsible for tourism at that time was driven from his post, because we entered the appropriations for Commission salaries in the reserve."
"Five days later he was gone."
"So do not come to me with the same old story where this issue of the discharge is concerned."
"We listed six points on 31 March."
"Replies were given to four of those six points; questions do actually remain on the other two, and we need to find answers to them."
"The first point is the BATs."
"Nobody in this House needs to tell me anything about what the Commission has done in recent years."
"It has spent around DEM 460 million - ECU 230 million - on staffing outside the structure of the budget."
"Contrary to the opinion being propagated far and wide by the PPE Group, this does not constitute fraud. The fact is that money was illegally taken from the budget for equipment and spent on staffing."
"In the 1999 budget procedure, we have an arrangement stating this: transparency is now restored with regard to the ECU 230 million."
"If there is a further arrangement on BATs - which is not envisaged at the present time - this will automatically entail disciplinary action being taken within the Commission."
"That is the result of politics and not of revenge!"
"That is why I conclude - on the basis of the list of criteria which we drew up in this House on 31 March - that we can actually grant discharge."
"I also believe that from a political point of view - because we are not just bean-counters, we are politicians - it is right to say that we do need a Commission in the Agenda process."
"Mr President, this debate has shown that the procedure on the 1996 discharge has been the most difficult ever."
"I wonder whether it would have been a good idea to relay it to all the Commission officials."
"Last March Parliament was quite correct to defer discharge and gave five reasons for doing so."
"Now we have to decide whether the Commission has performed sufficiently well on these five points to merit discharge."
"This calls for all of us to make some highly subjective decisions."
"We have before us a report which had 106 amendments in committee - a record for the discharge."
"Lord Tomlinson and I, the joint rapporteurs on transit fraud, are happy that the Commission has progressed sufficiently on the matter of computerisation."
"We do not blame the Commission for the fact that their consultants failed."
"Mr Pasty questioned whether there could be a conditional discharge."
"Every discharge decision is conditional in that it is accompanied by a report with paragraphs of resolution which the Commission undertakes to deal with on receipt of discharge."
"So that is a condition; and there are many strong paragraphs in the resolution."
"I am glad the Committee on Budgetary Control approved discharge last week, albeit by a small margin."
"I believe that the House should confirm that vote on Thursday, by granting discharge to the Commission for the year 1996."
"Mr President, if citizens are to have faith in European cooperation, then freedom of information and good governance must prevail."
"We are now debating whether to grant discharge in respect of financial management in 1996. No one would dispute that there are grounds for the tough criticism which Parliament has addressed to the Commission on a number of points."
"And there is broad agreement in the House on the additional measures necessary to reassure us, as the elected representatives of Europe's citizens, that fraud and mismanagement will not occur in future."
"There is equal consensus on the need for transparent administration."
"The issue today, though, is how we can best achieve the changes we are advocating."
"I am convinced that most people, on reflection, would rather see a parliament working positively for change than one which allowed anger and irritation to gain the upper hand."
"Parliament's attitude to date has, I feel, been particularly constructive."
"Unflinching examination of the workings of the Commission has initiated a whole range of action and, in our report, we are now laying down a series of clear conditions for granting discharge."
"And I doubt that this House will rest until its demands have been met."
"We would not however be behaving with any degree of responsibility if we refused discharge or submitted a motion of censure - which would be a logical consequence of such a decision."
"Two elements need to be borne in mind. Firstly, forcing the Commission to resign while Europe has weighty matters on its agenda would be very serious indeed."
"We cannot afford to deprive the EU of leadership at such a juncture."
"Secondly, a vote of no confidence is an indiscriminate instrument."
"The entire Commission would be tarred with the same brush - including, for example, Commissioner Liikanen, who has demonstrated both the will and the capacity to come to grips with the problems."
"There would be no sense in such a move."
"The European Parliament should set aside this meaningless and potentially damaging posturing and rely henceforth on its own ability to engineer true change."
"Mr President, I regret that the 1996 discharge procedure is not focused on the matter in hand, but has become a political football in the debate here in the plenary."
"The only explanation I can find for the Socialist Group's coordinator in the Committee on Budgetary Control stepping down is that she cannot reconcile the way this issue is being dealt with in her own group with her conscience."
"The facts are clear and sufficient."
"This is not about individual cases, but about the organisation of the Commission's work as a whole, which makes the cases we are talking about here - which have occurred in connection with MED, ECHO, Leonardo and so on - a possibility, which creates favourable conditions for them, and which in principle does not prevent them from happening. I emphasise quite specifically that this is not about the Commission per se as a whole, but about the criticisms levelled at several Commissioners."
"We are thus expecting the Commission to state its position on this."
"Mr Samland, it is clear that we are discussing the 1996 discharge."
"You emphasised that."
"We know that some things have changed in the meantime - and for the better."
"But the fact is that there has not been an improvement on every point."
"That is why we are not assessing the situation in 1998; that will come later."
"I ask all Members still in doubt about which way they should vote whether they believe that anyone will take us seriously in the future, when we have debated these serious accusations against the Commission today, if we grant discharge in respect of the 1996 budget?"
"To do so would actually be to give the Commission a clean bill of health, a confirmation that everything was in order in 1996."
"The agitation of recent weeks would then actually have been nothing but play-acting."
"In accordance with the Treaty, we, the European Parliament - as Mr Pasty said - have a responsibility to the taxpayer to confirm that the Commission is using the appropriations in a proper manner."
"I cannot accept responsibility for this and will therefore also be voting against granting discharge to the Commission."
"Mr Dankert, the fact that we are having a legal dispute is something which should, in principle, go down as a black mark against us, because it actually shows the spirit of the European institutions and those who created these treaties."
"We in Europe are always right and we in Europe always act as we should."
"That is the only way I can understand the interpretation, at least the one now preferred by the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities."
"What I mean to say is that we must also be able to contemplate doing the opposite of what we are discussing today, namely refusing discharge."
"I must ask those Members on the other side of the House in the Socialist Group, whether it is in accordance with democratic principles - at least this is what I have heard - for dissenters within your group, such as Mrs Wemheuer and Mr Bösch, not to have been allocated any speaking time by their group."
"In our group anyone can speak, whether they support or oppose granting discharge on the budget."
"(Applause) Mr Samland, if you are accusing us of seeking revenge ..."
"(Heckling) ... then of course you really are wide of the mark."
"You yourself pointed out in your speech that we only settled the BATs issue in the 1999 budget procedure, so that will only apply in the 1999 budget year."
"Today we are discussing the discharge for the 1996 budget!"
"That is why I see it as populism on your part to accuse us of seeking revenge."
"I do not believe that this has anything to do with revenge; you have to face the facts - we are talking about 1996."
"(Applause)"
"Mr Blak has the floor for a point of order, which I hope is indeed a point of order."
"If it is to make a personal statement, you will have to wait until the end of the debate."
"Which Rule are you raising this under?"
"Mr President, I am sorry to ask for the floor on a point of order, but the Socialist Group has now been attacked several times ..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Since this is not a point of order, you will have the floor at the end of the debate."
"Mr President, I think the Socialist Group position is extremely clear and that is why it has been given very forthrightly this morning."
"One of the main roles of the European Parliament is to check the Commission to ensure that taxpayers' money is being spent properly and with accountability."
"This is no easy task when we are presented with obstacles of the kind evident during the 1996 budget procedure."
"Perhaps the most serious charge of all against the Commission is the lack of democratic accountability in that Parliament has been hampered in its attempts to gain access to information which would point to or dispel allegations of fraud."
"The reluctance with which the Commission has forwarded documents gives cause for concern and the attempts to conceal, sometimes admittedly with reason, the names of officials being investigated has descended into farce."
"The problems encountered in the execution of the MED and ECHO programmes need major structural answers to ensure systems are in place to avoid a similar situation arising."
"There can be no question that the implementation of the external policies has had a negative effect on the EU's reputation."
"Nevertheless, since the postponement of the discharge in March, improvements are evident in some fields including the transit system and the SME sector."
"For the European public, fraud is a serious issue."
"We need to tackle it seriously or the whole boat will go down because of a few wreckers who are out to destroy the European voyage."
"The pressure will in future increase, not decrease, to keep the accounts clean and transparent."
"With the firm note of warning in the Amsterdam Treaty, we must heed the Court of Auditors' view on the global assurance of accounts."
"This will be a new formal departure in future."
"Lessons must be learned, in particular, as Mr Elles has highlighted, in the field of staff appointments."
"But I will be voting along with my political group in accordance with the committee's position to grant discharge."
"I believe that not granting discharge should be linked to rejection of the Commission as whole."
"That is what would happen in the business community - the company would be closed."
"The Commission has moved a long way since March."
"Mr Liikanen, in particular, has been tireless in his efforts to clean up the act and, with the introduction of the single currency on the horizon and the need for an agreement on Agenda 2000, this is not the time to create turmoil and havoc in the European Union."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the 1996 budget year was certainly not a glorious chapter in the history of the European Union."
"The BSE crisis was at its height."
"It was also a year of scandals."
"What can, what must the European Parliament do to force the necessary changes?"
"In spring of this year, Parliament postponed the discharge and drew up a list of demands."
"Some - though not yet all - of these demands have been met."
"This may not be enough."
"So should we refuse discharge?"
"Yes, possibly."
"But - as today's debate and the debates of recent days have so clearly shown - for many this is obviously not only about a technical process."
"Today's rhetoric has shown that Parliament wishes to make its mark by saying that we have to send the Commission packing."
"At the time of the BSE crisis, we chose the constructive method of work programmes."
"After two years, this has - thank goodness - proved to be the right decision."
"Today we have come so far that we are now already in a position to discuss reopening beef markets in the Union."
"That is why constructive cooperation is also the option we should choose in the discharge procedure."
"In my opinion, paragraph 26 in the Elles motion is actually the decisive one."
"It contains the Commission work programme."
"As several others have already requested, I would also very much like the Commission to tell us its views on paragraph 26, and when and how it believes it will be able to perform these tasks."
"Mr President, I must first say that this year's discharge procedure has been unlike any other."
"For the first time, we have been inundated by special reports from the Court of Auditors denouncing malpractices and irregularities in the Commission's administration, and giving the figures."
"It must be said that we on the Committee on Budgetary Control are neither policemen nor detectives, but faced with the pile of special reports produced by the Court of Auditors, we have a duty to take action."
"And I say all this despite the fact that, like other speakers, I too wish to stress the very positive part played by Commissioner Liikanen, who has really tried and is trying, for the first time in history, at least from what I have seen over the past nine years, to give us facts and figures and to see something done about it."
"But the problem is that Mr Liikanen cannot achieve much because there is a system in the Commission which ensures that even the best efforts are frustrated."
"Commissioner, I doubt whether you will be able to achieve what you will promise us here, in good faith, to do."
"That also explains the reactions from within the Commission."
"For the first time on the Committee on Budgetary Control, we have accusation made by specific individuals which cannot be disregarded and which must be taken very seriously."
"Even the press in Europe is saying that a vote for discharge would be 'suicide du Parlement européen ' - suicide for the European Parliament - and it explains why it regards it as 'suicide': some will vote because there is a majority of socialist Commissioners, while others will vote according to supposedly national interests."
"I think such a development is quite unacceptable, and that is why at present I believe that refusal to grant discharge would strengthen the hand of those who desire it - the majority of the Commission - so that they can set about internal restructuring."
"It would help people like Mr Liikanen and others to achieve what must be done internally, so that we who are Europeans can see ..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking James Elles for the efforts he has made to reflect in his document all the reports that have been presented on this issue, which were guided throughout by the invaluable work of the Court of Auditors, the specific assistance provided by UCLAF, the help given by Financial Control - which was not always fully made use of - and the participation of all the members of the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"I firmly believe that, irrespective of the result of the final vote, Parliament's view is and will be unanimous."
"The European Commission's management can and must improve."
"Parliament's reaction to the lesson learned must be unanimous: we cannot continue to approve budgets that meet the Commission's material demands, yet deny it the human resources needed to ensure that they are properly managed."
"Together, we need to be able to find the correct relationship between cost and efficiency."
"A reorganisation such as that required of the European Commission can only be tackled with the conviction, the will and the strength of the Council, the Commission and, of course, Parliament."
"And that will not be possible while the Treaty and our Rules of Procedure are not aligned, while the responsibility is shared and everyone must be treated in the same way, and while the Commission's weakness is such that it prevents it from taking any decisions."
"I therefore think that, for the credibility of the institutions and the Union itself, it would be better for those in charge, who are 'out on bail', to solve the problems created. If it turns out that they do not fulfill the commitments they have made to Parliament, the guarded trust we have put in them in this part-session should be withdrawn."
"Mr President, it does not seem to me that the question is being asked in the most usual terms."
"Despite the 1984 precedent, despite the wording of our Rules of Procedure, both of which take quite serious liberties with the Treaty, it seems to me that the problem does not lie in giving our opinion on whether to refuse to grant discharge."
"Rather, we are in a situation where in fact we either grant the discharge or we do not grant it, and I believe Mr Dankert is right to say this, even if the conclusions I draw from this are politically the opposite of his."
"Granting the discharge means closing the dossier."
"Not granting the discharge means leaving the dossier open."
"Where this issue is concerned there can be no definitive refusal, no refusal that applies for the entire administrative future."
"After all, if this were the case, we would have to accept that the discharge procedure, which in fact consists of approving the results of the financial year and accepting the balances that must be carried over to the following financial year, could mean that the accounts presented to us were found to be definitively irregular, which is obviously out of the question."
"The question we are faced with for the moment is: should we grant a discharge today?"
"The answer is obviously that we should not."
"Parliament is not sufficiently well informed of what happened in the course of the 1996 financial year."
"We have control over the clocks and the calendar."
"We have no reason to stop the clock, to stop taking evidence, when each day brings us more information, true or false, on the financial year under consideration."
"I will vote not to grant discharge but that does not mean that I refuse it definitively."
"Mr President, the Elles report includes numerous points concerning which the Commission has already stated its position in meetings of the Committee on Budgetary Control and also in written form."
"I hope that all Members have had a chance to read our written replies to all the questions about the draft report which we received earlier."
"I do not wish to reiterate here what was said in that context, except to correct one point."
"Mr Fabre-Aubrespy, and also Mr Pasty to some extent, gave a wrong interpretation of the Court of Auditors' report on DAS."
"Mr Fabre-Aubrespy said that the Court of Auditors did not give a positive declaration on the accounts of the Communities."
"That is wrong."
"When we talk about the Court of Auditors' report we must be extremely exact."
"Otherwise we abuse the powers of an important external control institution."
"What did the Court of Auditors say?"
"As far as the accounts are concerned, it gave a positive declaration."
"As far as commitments are concerned, it gave a positive declaration."
"As far as own resources are concerned it gave a positive declaration."
"But where it has not been able to give a positive declaration, is in underlying transactions."
"There I would ask you to read the Court of Auditors' report for this year, which states that in the field of agriculture, these normally take place at the level of final beneficiary in Member States."
"They have no impact on the budget because the recovery of the clearance of accounts is on the same level as the level of the errors found."
"Secondly, on the structural funds, it says that there the level of error is higher."
"They do not always have an impact on the budget but it is still too high."
"We must draw the right conclusion."
"Together with you, we have tried to change the system for management of structural funds."
"For the year 1998 the Commission has accepted the eligibility sheets and will apply the system of corrections to put things right."
"But, even more important, now that the whole reform of the structural funds is in the hands of the Council, your opinion is also needed."
"We need a clear system where if Member States detect an irregularity, they can transfer the money to a good project."
"If they do not, the Court of Auditors or the Commission will recover the money for ever."
"We need systems which control well and we must find these systems."
"I also want to say that I am ready to receive criticism of the Commission, but that the Court of Auditors has criticised the Member States little more than today's debate in this area, and also as regards 1996."
"I come now to paragraphs 26 and 27 and also the amendments which were mentioned."
"Firstly, a point on the fraud investigation office. I have very little to add to what President Santer said when he presented the proposal on 2 December."
"The Vienna European Council last weekend welcomed the Commission proposal and advised the institutions to examine the proposal with a view to taking a decision without delay - I stress, without delay."
"I would like to make it clear that, according to the proposal, the office will enjoy full freedom to conduct internal investigations on its own initiative inside the Commission and other institutions."
"This legislative procedure which has started offers Parliament and the Council a good opportunity to express their views, which of course will be fully taken into account."
"We shall see what will be the final outcome of the legislative procedure."
"Point B on the Staff Regulations: the Commission has had some internal social conflicts in that very sensitive and difficult area."
"In order to resolve a conflict we set up a reflection group on personnel policy chaired by Sir David Williamson, former Secretary-General of the Commission, and the group submitted its final report on 9 November."
"The group was composed of representatives of the trade unions and staff associations and of the administration."
"The report is the starting point for modifications of the Staff Regulations."
"Before proceeding to legislative proposals to the Council and Parliament, the report must go through an extensive consultation process with the other institutions and with representatives of the staff."
"The European Parliament has reiterated its will to be thoroughly consulted in this area."
"Consultations with the staff are already under way and interinstitutional consultation has started in parallel."
"The College of the Heads of Administration has already discussed the report and the first meeting at the level of the Directors of Personnel for all institutions will be held the day after tomorrow, Thursday 17 December."
"Conceptually, the Williamson report can be split into two parts."
"The first part is about modernising the European public service."
"It covers the re-examination of the structure of the Commission's human resources, recruitment, training, review of career development and the policies of equal opportunities and non-discrimination."
"In addition, a review of the balance of incentives and sanctions will be carried out."
"These include both disciplinary procedures and professional incompetence."
"The second part concerns the allowances of the officials of the European institutions."
"As far as the salaries of officials are concerned, they are guided by the rules which were adopted by the Council in 1991 for ten years and annexed to the Staff Regulations."
"On the basis of the interinstitutional consultation and the social dialogue, the Commission intends, by the end of January 1999, to present an indicative timetable for presenting communications on the reforms to Parliament and to the Council."
"The idea is first to present communications on the contents and then, on the basis of the discussion, to make the final proposals for modifications."
"Point (c) on the evaluation of the Commission's services - at the end of 1997 the Commission launched a vast evaluation or, as is often said, screening of its services."
"As a result we will have a clear picture of present missions, resources and working methods of each directorate and unit of the Commission."
"The report from each DG will be ready at the beginning of next year, which is obviously the timetable you wish, and the conclusions from this exercise will be drawn during the first half of 1999."
"The President of the Commission has given a commitment to present to the next designated President, on the basis of the evaluation, a global concept of how to organise the portfolios of the Commissioners and how to structure the directorates-general in accordance with political priorities."
"That is a major task."
"Much depends on the will of the President designated."
"But what is important is that the President of the Commission is committed to doing this."
"I agree with you that the borderlines of the tasks of the European public administration need to be clearly defined."
"In any case the Commission must retain the power of decision and control of its activities."
"Regarding point (d) of paragraphs 26 and 27 on nominations, two principles should guide the nomination of officials within the Commission, the European Parliament, the Council and the other institutions, namely, autonomy of the institutions and transparency."
"The principle of institutional autonomy is established by the Treaty and the case law of the Court of Justice."
"The Commission considers that this principle is of fundamental importance in ensuring its independence in the spirit of the Treaty."
"The rules for nominations are laid down in the Staff Regulations which are common to all the institutions."
"In the spirit of transparency a report on nominations of members of the Commissioners' cabinets has already been forwarded to Parliament as a follow-up to Parliament's resolution on the first reading of the budget."
"The Commission is willing to act in all transparency in the field of nominations while respecting the provisions of the Staff Regulations."
"On the difficult issue of relations between Commissioners and the services, the Commission is currently preparing a code of conduct which will further clarify relations between the Commissioners, their cabinets and directorates-general."
"The proposal for the code of conduct will also be transmitted to the next designated President of the Commission."
"A more general code of conduct on the ethical principles of officials is also under preparation."
"The Ombudsman has given us important guidance in that area."
"The qualifications for each post within the Commission are laid down in advertisements for vacant posts."
"I agree that experience in management should be made a central criterion for any appointments of senior officials."
"This should include experience in both financial and human resources management."
"Here I agree with the criticism that we must do better."
"Too often in the past expertise has been learned in the rather narrow field of important dossiers, however, management of a large service requires knowledge of the dossiers and the capacity to manage resources and budgets."
"In this context I should like to mention that if the budget is adopted on Thursday, as the Committee on Budgets proposes, we will introduce a major management training programme next year which will be obligatory for every official working in a management position."
"Regarding the Financial Regulation, last July the Commission adopted a working document on global revision of the Financial Regulation."
"On the basis of interinstitutional consultation, where we are still waiting for comments, the Commission will formulate a legislative proposal for global reform in 1999."
"As to the Financial Regulation and the personal responsibility of the Commissioners, the Legal Service of the Commission has taken the view that Members of the Commission have personal financial liability when they act as authorising officers deciding on entering into commitment of expenditure."
"In point (f), Parliament calls for Commissioners' declarations of their financial interests to be transparent and publicly available."
"The Commission accepts Parliament's request."
"Another point which has been taken up by two or three speakers is the agreement on the exchange of information between institutions."
"The Commission views this proposal positively."
"During this debate we have heard a lot of references to letters, press articles, rumours and even parliamentary questions."
"Some of them may be true but many of them could also be totally false."
"In the spirit of transparency, it is very important that Commission officials are invited to appear before the Committee on Budgetary Control whenever a reply is needed."
"If you are not happy, say so."
"It is very difficult to fight against false information if you do not have the opportunity to respond."
"You know what I mean."
"For us, not all the work has been done."
"This report is on the year 1996."
"Many issues come from the past."
"Much remains to be done."
"We must improve financial management; we must get good value for money for European taxpayers."
"We have a huge task in front of us."
"We need a strong Commission for these tasks in negotiations for Agenda 2000."
"Thank you, Mr President, for also giving me the opportunity to thank Mr Liikanen for his comments."
"I should just like to make one point clear: whether we grant the discharge or not, I still hope that the Commission will make these efforts, irrespective of how we vote."
"I should also like to point out a discrepancy in the translation of Mr Elles's report."
"It is in the English version."
"Paragraph 23 has not been changed to reflect the result of the vote and the words 'give/refuse' still appear there."
"The 'refuse' and the stroke ought to be deleted."
"That is how we voted."
"I would ask you to check this in the other language versions too."
"That will be done, Mrs Theato."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 9.30 a.m."
"Thank you, Mr President, for giving me the chance to correct one or two misunderstandings."
"Mr Tillich made a number of comments about our practice with coordinators."
"I would like to say that the situation in the Socialist Group is that if someone is chosen as a coordinator, they look after the interests of the group and their colleagues, not their own personal interests."
"If a coordinator steps down because he wants to operate in a different way, another coordinator is chosen, and in this case I was selected."
"I would like to say that I am very disappointed that another group is attacking us in such a personal way."
"If a Member does not wish to be a coordinator, they are released and can step down, and the other person takes over."
"That is democracy, and anything else is not!"
"Mr President, with regard to this debate, it was announced that the vote on the interpretation given by the Committee on the Rules of Procedure on voting rules would take place at midday."
"We were also told that the document would be available from 9.00 a.m. or 9.15 a.m. today."
"I went to the Distribution Service barely 5 minutes ago with some of my colleagues, and they have no idea whatsoever where this document is!"
"No one has it."
"It would be desirable, Mr President, for us to have copies of documents before voting on them, otherwise our task will be made extremely difficult."
"Mr Monfils, I can tell you that the interpretation of the Rules of Procedure is included in the Minutes of yesterday's sitting, on page 24, so I would ask you to look at the Minutes."
"Mr President, during this debate, the rapporteur spoke for seven and a half minutes."
"Since rapporteurs normally speak for five minutes, I presume that the last two and a half minutes correspond to the speaking time for his group."
"I think that it would have been much wiser to separate the two speeches by Mr Elles, because his final remark was to call on the House to refuse to grant discharge."
"This is something that Mr Elles can obviously do in a personal capacity but as rapporteur, it contradicts the vote by the Committee on Budgetary Control, and I would like this to be recorded in the Minutes."
"As you know, Mr Colom i Naval, it is up to the groups to distribute speaking time and it is common practice, where appropriate, to extend the speaking time which a rapporteur has in that capacity by part of the speaking time allocated to his group."
"Clearly, a rapporteur is free to organise his speaking time and set out his comments as he sees fit."
"Mr President, I took the precaution of submitting my question in advance and would have liked it to be recorded."
"But first I would like to make a personal statement."
"Commissioner Liikanen said that I gave a wrong interpretation of the Court of Auditors' report."
"The only thing I said was that the Court of Auditors had not given a positive declaration on the regularity of the accounts for the 1996 financial year."
"I am not the only person who said this, Commissioner!"
"Paragraph 1 of the resolution of the Elles report points out that, for the third year in succession, the European Court of Auditors has declined to provide positive global assurance as to the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying the payments for the financial year."
"I am only repeating what was stated in the report."
"I would like to raise a point of order at the end of this item, Mr President."
"I should simply like to clarify something once more for Mr Colom I Naval's sake. It was clearly stated on my list of speakers that Mr Elles would have five minutes as rapporteur plus two minutes for the group."
"This is just for the record."
"I do not think that he in any way intended to be misleading."
"Mr President, I would like to say to Mr Fabre-Aubrespy that the phrase in the Elles report is correct."
"It talks about underlying transactions but you are talking about the accounts."
"There is a difference."
"The Court of Auditors gives four different opinions on the accounts, which are positive, and on payments and underlying transactions, which are not positive."
"I hope that they will be in the near future."
"Mr President, I would like to make a request pursuant to Article 3(2) of Annex V of the Rules of Procedure."
"A number of amendments to the Elles report were declared admissible, exactly 22 according to the information I have been given."
"Others were declared inadmissible."
"It is your responsibility to apply the annex to the Rules of Procedure, which provides that amendments must be forwarded to the Committee on Budgetary Control so that it can deliver its opinion."
"I would ask you to confirm that the amendments will be given to the committee at this afternoon's meeting so that it can give its opinion on the 22 amendments which, moreover, were tabled by all the political groups."
"There are 11 from the Socialist Group, the very people who wanted to prevent us from tabling amendments on the operation, and from practically all the other groups in Parliament."
"The matter will in any event be considered before the vote on Thursday, you may be assured of that."
"1999 General Budget"
"The next item is the report (A4-0500/98) by Mrs Dührkop Dührkop and Mr Viola, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 1999, as modified by the Council (C4-0600/98), and on draft Letter of Amendment No 1/99 to the preliminary draft budget for 1999 - Section III Commission (C4-0666/98)."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I would like to begin by thanking all those who have helped me in this House for their work throughout the 1999 budgetary procedure."
"I would particularly like to thank those in the secretariat of the Committee on Budgets whose untiring work has allowed us to reach this second reading as anticipated."
"I thank you all."
"The 1999 budgetary procedure is coming to an end with the European Parliament's second reading."
"I would like to give a brief assessment of it but, more particularly, I would like to look once again at an essential question."
"We began this procedure calling the 1999 budget a 'bridging budget' to the year 2000 and the new financial perspective."
"The 2000 budget should represent the basis for the new financial perspective, but the 1999 budget also needs to be rigorous while meeting the priorities of the European Parliament."
"These guidelines involved certain essential conditions, one of which was the mandate given to Mr Colom by Parliament to negotiate the new financial perspective and to introduce an instrument of flexibility in it."
"Therefore, at its first reading, Parliament introduced a strategic amendment that increased non-compulsory expenditure and payment appropriations in accordance with paragraph 17 of the current Interinstitutional Agreement to act as a safeguard. This aimed to guarantee, on the one hand, that the Council negotiated an instrument of flexibility and, on the other, if this new agreement was not reached, that the level of non-compulsory expenditure would not be reduced, because this would put at risk Parliament's ability to fund its own priorities."
"The bridge that was thus built by the European Parliament was not accepted by the Council as we had hoped, but I would point out that we have actually achieved something."
"We have succeeded in building a new culture and a new confidence, because it appears that the Council, through its desire to negotiate, is accepting the idea of Parliament as a genuine political interlocutor."
"The Council held its second reading on 24 November, after the traditional conciliation, with a common approach with Parliament to the global aspects of the budget, but without making any progress on the strategic amendments."
"I would like to review the various categories of the Council's reading and contrast them with Parliament's position before its second reading."
"I said in my first speech, before the first reading, that I was somewhat disappointed with what had happened with the ad hoc procedure for agriculture since we had not managed to hold a serious debate in July, as Parliament would have liked."
"Nevertheless, I must point out that the ad hoc procedure before the Council's second reading has shown itself to be a very valid instrument since the Council has agreed with Parliament's views about not increasing agricultural expenditure."
"The Council has also allowed Parliament an agricultural reserve, of which EUR 20 million are destined solely for agri-environmental measures, which are a priority for the European Parliament."
"So - to give my shortest speech in this respect - as far as Category 1, agriculture, is concerned, Parliament's position is more or less in line with the Council at its second reading."
"I believe that we have reached an agreement that both parties can accept."
"Moving on to Category 2 - which in the financial perspective is usually called 'the Edinburgh package' - I must nevertheless say that Parliament is introducing a 'package amendment' comprising a reserve of EUR 1 500 million in commitment appropriations and EUR 250 million in payment appropriations, as well as a reduction in payment appropriations of EUR 500 million."
"This is based entirely on the information provided by the Commission in September on the situation regarding the non-implementation of the Structural Funds."
"In all the dialogue and conciliation discussions we have held with the Council, this was never mentioned."
"It was never brought up for discussion as it did not pose any problems."
"Surprisingly, the Council accepts the reduction but rejects the reserve for the Structural Funds. This means a change to Category 2 that leaves Parliament free at second reading to take a majority vote in the House."
"Yesterday, the Committee on Budgets voted against reintroducing the reserve but in favour of reintroducing the payment appropriations because, as I have said, the amendment was an overall package and a reduction in payments does not make any sense given the delicate situation that exists as far as payments are concerned."
"It loses all justification if there is no reserve."
"As regards Category 3, I told the Council at first reading that this was the 'Cinderella' of all the categories."
"It involves the Union's internal policies, the policies with a European dimension, and I must say that it seems as though the prince, with his glass slipper, has found Cinderella and turned her into a princess. Under the agreement we negotiated with the Council on this category the Council has accepted practically all of Parliament's priorities."
"Some lines have even been increased by 49 %."
"It is worth pointing out that we reached an agreement on the fifth framework programme on research, and included sections of the policies under the third pillar in Category 3, as Parliament had wished, thus anticipating the Treaty of Amsterdam. The Council has also agreed with Parliament about maintaining the funding of the Socrates and Youth for Europe programmes."
"I believe that this is an extremely satisfactory result for Parliament and I would like to thank the Council for its willingness to negotiate. We will thus be happy to vote in favour of this category on Thursday."
"I would now like to look at what is, in my opinion, a serious political issue."
"It is a serious matter that in Category 4, Parliament has been forced to reduce the PHARE programme."
"It is serious because the political message that this sends out is not pleasant either for Parliament or the Council, but it was necessary in the interests of budgetary efficiency and in the light of the overall operation of the programme."
"In this case, we are providing for EUR 150 million less than the level of funding fixed in Cannes, but the Council has agreed to Parliament's proposal to fund its priorities in terms of external actions from this reduction in the PHARE programme."
"In Category 5, Parliament is maintaining its position on the creation of a specific line for pension funds."
"I believe that it is a shame that during the entire budgetary year we have not been able to make even the slightest progress on this issue, which is necessary so that the Union's officials can have guaranteed pensions."
"After the conciliation of 24 November we still had not reached any agreement with the Council on the strategic amendment, and a new conciliation procedure began on 8 December. It was a historic occasion because this was the first time in 10 years that a conciliation meeting took place after the Council had held its second reading."
"I would like to thank the Presidency for its desire to keep the doors open and to agree to have Parliament as a political interlocutor, as I said at the beginning."
"After the outcome of the conciliation procedure I, as rapporteur, am withdrawing the strategic amendments for second reading."
"However, as in all negotiations, we know that both parties are leaving something behind."
"I would have liked - as I believe the whole of Parliament would have liked - to achieve something more concrete."
"I recognise that the planned timetable has not been adhered to."
"We had thought that in Vienna we would have something more specific on the table, which would in turn have made a more specific conciliation procedure possible."
"However, I believe and I hope that Mr Colom will go into more detail in the text of the agreement we have reached, and I think that there will be instruments to provide flexibility."
"We have obtained a historic unilateral declaration from the Council, which is finally going to do what it has promised, and I believe that that may be enough to allow us to reach an agreement in the course of the negotiations."
"Mr President, on Thursday Parliament is going to vote at second reading on a budget that complies perfectly with the current Interinstitutional Agreement."
"It is a budget that will demonstrate that budgetary rigour is entirely compatible with the European Parliament's political priorities, but, in particular, it is a budget that is compatible with the interests of the people of Europe."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by expressing my satisfaction that we have managed once again this year to approve the budget for the other institutions with just one reading, given that all of our amendments have been accepted by the Council."
"This is a sign of harmony and successful cooperation, which I hope will be repeated in future years as well."
"The motion for a resolution, on which we shall vote on Thursday - which shows that there are no particularly significant or outstanding problems - touches on certain matters which have already been addressed before, the aim being to establish some general rules enabling solutions to be found for certain unresolved problems during the course of next year's budgetary procedure."
"Here, taking up what Mrs Dührkop Dührkop said, I do regret that the Council has rejected the possibility of setting up a pension fund for staff of the European institutions."
"Parliament views this as a missed opportunity to solve a problem which should be dealt with as a matter of urgency."
"We are now waiting for the Commission to present, by 31 March, a proposed reform of the pension system, because this remains a priority not only for Parliament but also for all the other bodies of the European Union."
"Another outstanding problem, to which the resolution refers, is the translation work of the Court of Justice."
"The Court needs to provide us with concrete proposals as a basis for thorough discussions leading to the adoption of measures to facilitate its translation work."
"We therefore call on the Court to devise a computer-assisted translation system with a view to overcoming the backlog of bureaucratic and administrative texts, and thereafter to seek other ways of relieving the clearly onerous workload of the lawyer-linguists."
"It must be said from the outset that the budgetary authority is not in a position to solve the Court's wide-ranging problems through an intensive recruitment policy, which would be virtually impossible over a single budget year; it would however be possible if it were staggered according to a multiannual plan."
"The European Parliament - and this is another noteworthy aspect of the resolution - also wishes to make a point to the Committee of the Regions, given that the problem of the forthcoming expiry of the Secretary-General's term of office has arisen; the possibility of falling back on Article 50 has been mooted, with considerable financial implications, as it is estimated that the operation has already cost ECU 320 000."
"Our resolution obviously stresses the need to find alternative solutions which are financially acceptable, technically feasible and will avoid a vacuum in the leadership of this body, whose workload is set to increase as a result of the new Amsterdam Treaty."
"Furthermore, the resolution underlines the need to carry forward the existing policy on buildings, which amounts to taking on rapidly the ownership of the buildings used by the various Community institutions, as well as the relevant payments."
"Yesterday we noted with satisfaction the adoption of the supplementary and amending budget and the availability of the sizeable sum of EUR 150 million, which will serve - for example - to bring forward the purchase of D3. This operation will generate an estimated saving of EUR 40 million over the next ten years."
"This policy has already borne fruit and, if it is pursued further, will bring additional, appreciable savings for the Union's budget."
"We are therefore pleased that our amendment allowing the construction of the new building for the Court of Auditors was accepted."
"Now that the debate on this first EU budget in euros is coming to an end, Mr President, we can say that we are satisfied to have drawn up a rigorous and well-balanced budget for the other institutions, one which does justice to the budgetary efforts made by the Member States."
"I should like to end by thanking my colleagues in the Committee on Budgets for all their help and, above all, the staff of the Commission for their much-needed assistance with our work."
"Mr President, this year's debates on the budget are certainly taking place against a rather tempestuous background."
"Sometimes the sea does become calm, and happily it does so before it is too late."
"That is true to a certain extent, in any case, of the part of the budget for which the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy is responsible, which has been in considerable turmoil, in particular where the implementation of human rights programmes is concerned."
"Fortunately, Parliament and the Council agreed a compromise formula for technical assistance which meant that the legal bases issue could be settled."
"This allayed our main concerns with the 1998 supplementary budget and the 1999 budget."
"Of course we would have liked to have seen more, but what is important is for these issues to be resolved this year."
"For it would have inflicted great damage on the European Union if in this year of all years, the 50th anniversary of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and in this particular week, when we are awarding the Sakharov prize for the tenth time, there had been difficulties here."
"No one will deny that improvements can be made, but any support is welcome where human rights and work on forging links with the other countries of the world are concerned."
"I have just returned from Latin America, where I was once again able to see the value of this work for myself, whether it is election supervision, human rights or the work of our institutes."
"We will be monitoring the implementation of the 1999 budget very carefully with these points in mind."
"I should, however, also like to express my particular thanks to Mrs Dührkop Dührkop for her excellent cooperation in this matter, which has shown once again that Parliament is aware of the significant role it can play on these difficult issues, and is supporting a cause across all national boundaries, which all of us, as good democrats, need to fight for throughout the world."
"Mr President, the agriculture heading has not given rise to any particularly heated debates during the various phases of our examination of the 1999 budget - is this the calm before the storm, or have procedures improved?"
"The latter, I think."
"By continually analysing expenditure in the current year and allowing special scope in the budgetary procedure for drawing the appropriate conclusions at the right moment for the new budget, we manage to prevent too much from being earmarked for agriculture, while also having the certainty that if things develop badly, sensible provisions will be made."
"As the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture, I have helped to make sure that the procedure introduced last year whereby the Commission sends notification of amendments between the first and second readings has been followed to the letter this year too, and we have received specific proposed amendments to a considerable number of budget items."
"A total of EUR 513 million have had to be added to the original total for Category 1."
"The Council and the European Parliament delegation agreed, however, not to include this relatively small adjustment from the draft budget in the total budget amount for Category 1, but to revise the various items in the earlier total on the basis of the most recent estimates."
"The Commission then put forward the required proposals."
"This is in line with Parliament's desire not to solve the problem by making a linear reduction, cutting a small percentage from all agricultural expenditure in the budget, but by making specific reductions to a number of items."
"Furthermore, the fact that a surplus of ECU 1.4 billion has now been identified in Category 1 of the 1998 budget is an important factor for revising the rather poorer outlook for 1999, and on the basis of our close observation of market developments up to now, we can already tell that we are going to have to live with a little uncertainty about agricultural expenditure in the future."
"But this margin can be considerably reduced, compared with the excessive margins of agricultural spending in the past, when very considerable amounts would be held over and repaid to the Member States every year."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have not entered the appropriations for security within and around the buildings of the European institutions in the reserve."
"Nevertheless, I should like to point out that action urgently needs to be taken here."
"As the rapporteur on the budget for the Economic Affairs Committee, I think that we can be very pleased with the benchmark data for the next budget."
"In its proposal, the Commission had already allocated sufficient appropriations to the principal economic lines."
"Parliament has successfully defended these appropriations."
"Title B5-3 on the internal market was increased by EUR 13.8 million, and title B5-5 on the labour market and technological innovation by EUR 12.2 million."
"I am particularly pleased with the agreement reached on stimulating small and medium-sized enterprises."
"The line designated for this purpose, B5-512, was increased by a full 60 %."
"However, we are also looking at the interrelationships and indicators for a healthy overall economy in a wider context."
"Therefore, education and the youth exchange programmes are important for providing human resources, which our internal market so urgently needs to remain competitive."
"Title B3-1 - Education, vocational training and youth - was allotted additional appropriations of EUR 136.4 million, and even though I have great sympathy for the demand expressed by European youth organisations for a further increase, in this budget we have in fact paved the way for these education and vocational training initiatives actually to be continued and extended."
"For the economy, the principle of austere budget management is, after all, of particular importance."
"Let us not forget that in just over two weeks, 11 countries will join together in a currency union."
"I believe that this is a basis for a successful Europe!"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. I should first like to thank our colleagues in the Budgets Committee and the rapporteur for making it possible for this complicated budget procedure and the conciliation procedure on research to at last be brought to such a successful conclusion, with the result that we shall be voting on the research programme today at midday, and then on Thursday we will be able to enter the appropriate figures in the budget, which means that our research policy will continue to run, uninterrupted, next year."
"I should, however, like to draw your attention to a problem: in its explanatory statement on the draft budget for the second reading, the Council pointed out that, in its opinion - and as far as I know the Commission has endorsed this view - the remarks on the budget lines were only intended as an indication, meaning that they are not binding for the purposes of implementation."
"In practice, this would mean that all the specific tasks and objectives which Parliament has included in the remarks, and the appropriations and percentages accordingly placed in the reserve, would, at best, be pipedreams."
"I am thinking in particular of research."
"We have few budget lines, but each has a large amount of money, and our remarks here are to be treated only as an indication."
"I do not think that this is the end result of the budgetary procedure which we in the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy had in mind."
"Mr Liikanen, I have just listened carefully to your speech on the Elles report."
"Here too, you could send out a clear signal for Parliament."
"Our remarks are not pipedreams; they are entirely genuine demands made by Parliament in the budgetary procedure. I make the same claim on behalf of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, that is, that our remarks on managing the appropriations of the fifth framework programme of research should not be taken merely as an indication, but should be binding."
"I have prepared an amendment to the motion to this effect on behalf of my group, and hope that it will also meet with the agreement of the House."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as the rapporteur of the Committee on External Economic Relations, I should like to make just two points today, which we were not able to deal with in October at the first reading."
"We had submitted several amendments concerning the remarks for trade cooperation with Latin America, Asia and South Africa, also including investment."
"Our proposal was to involve economic and social groups, chambers of commerce and industry, employers' organisations, unions, consumer organisations and environmentalists in these programmes."
"We made these proposals, which are in fact modelled on the ACP States, amongst others, - so they are on the same lines as the provisions which apply to the ACP States and Turkey - in order to secure greater participation of economic and social groups in the work of reconstruction."
"Unfortunately, the Budgets Committee did not accept our proposals, although they would not cost a penny and do in fact reflect a broad consensus within the Committee on External Economic Relations, having been drafted by the various groups within the committee."
"My main request to the chairman of the Committee on Budgets, and also to the rapporteur, would be to incorporate this idea, possibly in the motion."
"These are sensible proposals and they correspond largely to what is already common practice in the ACP States."
"I should also like to make a second comment."
"It will only be possible for us to open up the Japanese market if young managers - above all those from small and medium-sized enterprises - are educated about the specific features of the market and also have the opportunity to adapt to them."
"Until now, such initiatives have been promoted to great acclaim by the European Union, making it possible for training and instruction to be given to between 30 and 40 managers every year."
"This proposal was not taken into account because there is no legal base at the present time."
"I hope that the Commission will table the necessary proposals and that we will have a legal base as soon as possible, so that we can reinstate this budget line."
"Mr President, I am delighted that the Council has agreed to our proposal to increase the environment budget, making more money available for the fifth action programme on the environment, LIFE and other programmes."
"This is all very well, but the fact remains that the environment receives only 0.2 % of the overall budget, which is why we are having to think about integrating the environment into other sectors."
"For this reason, I am most surprised that the Council has not approved the very proposals that were designed to 'green' the budget, and the Committee on Budgets is therefore retabling five amendments relating to the environment aspects of the Structural Funds, environmental protection and the allocation of Structural Fund money to environmental protection under the habitats and birds directives."
"We would also like to see at least 10 % of the MEDA funding going to environmental projects."
"A better environment begins with each of us, and this is why I have tabled an amendment to the resolution - also accepted by the Committee on Budgets - on the 'greening' of the institutions themselves."
"The Council, the Commission, the Committee of the Regions and Parliament itself can still do a great deal about saving energy, recycling waste and mobility."
"If we can do this in a credible way, we shall be setting an example for the Member States and we can promote a genuine environment policy."
"Finally, I am pleased that the Council has also agreed to increase the budget for consumer and health policy."
"I regret the fact that it has put both amounts in the reserve, but fortunately, thanks to our intervention, the Committee on Budgets is to take the amount for consumer policy out of the reserve again, and the legal basis for this is expected shortly."
"It is a pity that we were not able to achieve the same thing with the health-care policy."
"I shall finish there, Mr President."
"Thanks to our excellent cooperation with the rapporteurs, Mr Viola and Mrs Dührkop Dührkop, I am satisfied with the overall result."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, I would like to begin by thanking Barbara Dührkop Dührkop, the general rapporteur, for her tremendous help and support."
"I would also like to thank my own group coordinator, Terence Wynn, and my committee secretariat for their help and encouragement."
"As a committee we have not achieved everything that we wanted to achieve but, at the end of the day, we have achieved a budget that we can certainly live with. I do, however, have a number of concerns."
"First of all in relation to the budget heading on tropical forests, I note that the Commission proposals to increase payment appropriations, i.e. by 5 million euros, were not accepted by the Commission."
"Therefore, I would expect that the Commission, by one means or another, to be able to transfer and agree to the topping-up appropriations which might be necessary as far as our external policy is concerned."
"Secondly, on gender, I hope that next year we will see an increase in the budget heading."
"We have seen a decrease this time which was gravely disappointing as far as my committee is concerned."
"Finally, on the issue of land mines, there were numerous arguments about the number of budget headings we should have."
"I am informed that there are currently something like 12 or 13 budget headings that mention land mines."
"I am told by the Commission that they have plans to bring all of these under one heading and that they are proposing a sum of something like 35 million euros to be spent on mine clearance and rehabilitation programmes."
"I very much welcome this, it has been something that the Development Committee have pushed forward for some time."
"The sum of 35 million euros, if we can keep this for a number of years, will go a long way to clearing the world of what has been an horrendous scourge for millions of people in the developing world."
"I would like to express my thanks once again to the general rapporteur."
"It has been an extremely successful budget procedure."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs, I can confirm, on the occasion of the second reading of the budget, that I am as satisfied as I was at first reading."
"In this respect, I would like once again to thank our rapporteur Mrs Dührkop Dührkop and the members of the Committee on Budgets and their chairman Mr Samland, who were much more sensitive to our committee's demands this year than they were last."
"I would like to highlight three particular reasons for my satisfaction, all of which are priorities for the Committee on Civil Liberties."
"Firstly, we asked for measures to be continued and for an increase in resources to combat violence towards women and children, sex tourism and criminal use of the Internet."
"The solution that was arrived at for these items is satisfactory."
"Secondly, we wanted measures to be continued and resources to be maintained for the integration of migrants and the fight against racism and xenophobia."
"As you know, ladies and gentlemen, these budget headings were in a very delicate position because of the absence of a legal basis."
"The solution that has been arrived at here is also satisfactory."
"However, our main reason for satisfaction is that for the first time, at Mr Brinkhorst's insistence, the Committee on Budgets yesterday approved the creation of a European fund for refugees. I must thank Mr Brinkhorst for this."
"Everyone knows the importance of the refugee problem for the European Union, and everyone also knows that the Council has committed itself to taking measures with a view to equal burden sharing, and this European fund for refugees is the best way of achieving this."
"Consequently, I do not understand why the Council persists in rejecting this instrument, which is both necessary and sound."
"Mr President, I should like to pay the rapporteur, Mrs Dührkop Dührkop, a compliment."
"She has worked very hard on her report during this budget year."
"I should like to thank her for her ready cooperation, and I also extend thanks to the Commission and the Austrian Presidency."
"From the point of view of the Committee on Budgetary Control, it is apparent that we still have much to do."
"The very fact that in the 1998 budget we have still overestimated agricultural expenditure by ECU 1.4 billion shows that there is scope for further measures here."
"Despite our actually brokering an agreement with the Council in the 1998 budgetary procedure to reduce the allocation which the Commission had entered in the budget, we still have a surplus."
"That is why I also welcome the fact that the Commission has used a new kind of justification for utilised, non-utilised and partially utilised budget lines in the Notenboom procedure."
"I should like to call on the Commission and request that it continue to do this in the monthly reports during the implementation of the 1999 budget."
"This would mean that the European Parliament would be better able to monitor expenditure on a month-by-month basis."
"The individual committees would be more involved in monitoring appropriations and the process of implementing the budget."
"Communication between Parliament and the Commission would improve."
"Allow me to make just two further comments on the strategic reserve."
"Overall, we are certainly not exactly ecstatic about the result."
"We can, however, credit the European Parliament with success on one count."
"The Council has realised that it has to respect the European Parliament as a partner and as one arm of the budgetary authority."
"In the future, it will no longer be enough simply to take account of the interests of individual Member States within the Council; the will of the European Parliament will also have to be respected."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, I would like to add our appreciation to that already expressed for the rapporteur, Bárbara Dührkop."
"The Committee on Fisheries has collaborated with the general working party for the 1999 budget during the various stages of the budgetary procedure, mainly through the original draftsman for the Committee on Fisheries, Mr Apolinario, who is no longer a Member of this Parliament."
"Although the only amendment tabled by the Committee on Fisheries is an amendment proposing a slight increase in appropriations for monitoring actions, we would like to take this opportunity to repeat a series of priorities that form the core of the committee's actions."
"I will list them in no special order: firstly, actions that monitor actual compliance with Community rules; secondly, specific actions in the areas of non-industrial and inshore fishing; thirdly, research, which is closely linked to the development of the fifth framework programme; fourthly, the Structural Funds, an issue we have already discussed on many occasions; and finally, the question of international agreements, which I would like to consider for a moment."
"As far as international agreements are concerned, the appropriations proposed for the 1999 financial year are lower than those for 1998, both in commitment appropriations and in payment appropriations. Undoubtedly, there is justification for this reduction, but we would like to make an important point here."
"The Committee on Fisheries would draw the attention of the authorities to the difficulty that will arise, when preparing the budget for 2000, in relation to the agreement with Morocco. This runs out on 30 November 1999 and costs EUR 120 million every year, practically half of the total for this heading."
"The budgetary authority will have to show its capacity for sound management in order to ensure that the necessary budgetary appropriations are available to implement a new agreement, while remaining discrete about this amount so as not to endanger the negotiations with Morocco."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Dührkop Dührkop, who was very receptive to the proposals from the Committee on Women's Rights, which sought, above all, to enshrine the concept of mainstreaming in the budgetary procedure, in other words to incorporate equal opportunities for men and women into all European policies."
"We had some degree of success, as can be seen from extensive correspondence with 12 Members of the Commission."
"We have recorded this in two working documents."
"As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights, my second priority - alongside mainstreaming - was to maintain special support measures for women in the fourth action programme and in the Structural Funds."
"I emphasise once again that women are not a marginal group; we represent 50 % of European citizens."
"This is also reflected in the new Daphne programme."
"I might remind you that we - 350 Members of this House - called for a European campaign and a European Year against violence to women in a written declaration."
"The Council ignored it."
"In the second reading, it also deleted the remark on this, despite the Austrian Presidency itself working very hard in support of this cause."
"We in the European Parliament are keeping to our demands; we are expecting EUR 5 million to be allocated for a campaign to combat violence against women, and we are looking forward to the concepts of equal opportunities and mainstreaming being very much more in evidence in the new policy areas of employment and enlargement towards the east than they have been up until now."
"As the Commissioner has already said, the Treaty of Amsterdam gives us a new basis on which to work for equal opportunities and non-discrimination, and if female citizens do not find themselves represented in the policy of the European Parliament - and, by the way, this also applies to the committees - then we shall pay the penalty in the fifth directly elected Parliament."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I can, I think, be brief, because I explained the main arguments of the Petitions Committee in our debate at the first reading."
"I should, however, like to use this opportunity to emphasise, on behalf of the committee, that we feel like the hinge between Parliament and the citizens of Europe."
"We are, as it were, the hinge on the door, allowing it to open to the citizens."
"According to the Treaty on European Union, any citizen of the Union has the right to address petitions and lodge complaints, individually or in association with other citizens or persons, and for us in Parliament to be able to deal with these petitions in an appropriate manner and in as short a time as possible, it is necessary for the committee to be provided with sufficient resources and staff."
"That is why it is also imperative for the Petitions Committee to be able to continue to work as an independent committee in the new parliamentary term."
"I wish to thank the Budgets Committee and Mr Viola for judging the Ombudsman's requests to be objectively justified, and for the fact that the creation of a new body for the Ombudsman will make it possible for sufficient resources to be placed at his disposal."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am sure I do not need to tell you that the 1999 budgetary procedure has been a complicated undertaking; this was, in particular, for two reasons."
"Firstly, the 1999 budget is the last to be covered by the Edinburgh agreements and the last to be adopted before the conclusion of the Agenda 2000 negotiations, which are being held between our institutions to establish a financial framework for budgets after the year 2000."
"Secondly, a decision on the 1998 supplementary and amending budget and a decision on the 1998 global transfer have also become part of the 1999 budget."
"Despite the complexity resulting from combining these different matters, we have finally succeeded in reaching an overall compromise on the 1999 budget, the 1998 supplementary and amending budget and the 1998 global transfer."
"I should like to recall that the success of this overall compromise was to a large extent dependent on the results of intensive discussions on flexibility, which we held with Parliament's delegation at the two Council meetings of 24 November and 8 December."
"In accordance with Parliament's wishes, it is intended that budgets will display flexibility of this kind, and this will be introduced in the new financial perspective."
"The conciliation we held last week with a number of your colleagues paved the way for the overall compromise on the 1999 budget procedure to be confirmed."
"This conciliation in fact resulted in an agreement between our two institutions that there will be no strategic reserve in the 1999 budget, something which we have seen repeatedly threaten the 1999 budgetary procedure from beginning to end."
"The Council thus saw itself in a position to declare itself willing to accept an element of flexibility in the negotiations on a new interinstitutional agreement."
"The nature and extent of this flexibility will depend on the overall result of the negotiations, and on the level of the agreed financial framework."
"During the budgetary procedure, but at the latest before Parliament's first reading, both arms of the budgetary authority can decide - in accordance with the rules on majority voting pursuant to Article 203(9)(5) of the Treaty and by means of a Commission proposal - to activate this flexibility component."
"When applying this statement - and this is something to which I should particularly like to draw your attention - the Council will not make any internal agreements which would nullify these majority rules."
"I should particularly like to emphasise this."
"The positive outcome of our conciliation on the flexibility of future budgets has made it possible for the negotiations on the entire 1999 budget procedure to be brought to a successful conclusion."
"Allow me now to turn to the results of the Council's second reading of the 1999 draft budget and in so doing to highlight a number of points."
"When examining the draft budget, as amended and with the proposed modifications, the Council's general concern was to try to achieve as low a rate of increase as possible for the 1999 budget."
"When assessing the results of Parliament's first reading of the 1999 draft budget, the Council was also guided by the following principles: complying with the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 October 1998 on legal bases and the implementation of the budget; assessing needs with a view to entering realistic appropriations in the budget which it will be possible to implement; and dividing the savings equally between all the headings in the financial perspective, which means that reducing appropriations for one of the headings also has to entail a reduction in the appropriations for other headings."
"Taking all these principles into consideration, the Council approved the content of the overall compromise drafted in conjunction with a Parliament delegation."
"As you have noted, it has accommodated Parliament on many points."
"I would ask you to take that into account when you yourselves vote!"
"As I said at the beginning, the overall compromise on the 1999 budget procedure also includes an agreement on the 1998 supplementary and amending budget and on the global transfer."
"Both the supplementary and amending budget and the global transfer allow non-utilised appropriations to be redeployed, with the result that, in particular, payment appropriations for the European Social Fund and PHARE can be increased by ECU 795 million and ECU 150 million respectively."
"In addition, Parliament will receive ECU 150 million for its building projects."
"I should also like to draw your attention to the ECU 400 million for food aid to Russia, which we decided on as part of the supplementary and amending budget."
"The 1999 budgetary procedure is drawing to a close."
"When you vote on the budget on Thursday at the end of your second reading, some of you will be taking part in this procedure for the last time, and for those Members in particular, I am glad that during this budgetary procedure they have been able to experience some degree of cooperation between the two arms of the budgetary authority, something which has not always been the case in the past, a fact which the chairman of your Budgets Committee, Mr Samland, referred to himself last week at the end of our conciliation."
"I should particularly like to thank Mr Samland for his tireless efforts to improve the quality of our cooperation."
"I also thank the two rapporteurs, Mrs Dührkop Dührkop and Mr Viola, and of course the Commission, for their valuable contribution to bringing the 1999 budgetary procedure to a successful conclusion."
"I was very pleased to see them adopt such a constructive approach, putting us in a position to achieve the result we all wanted, the adoption of a budget for the coming year."
"Thank you, Mr President-in-Office."
"The debate will continue at 3 p.m. with the speech by Commissioner Liikanen."
"It is now voting time."
"Mr President, I wish to raise a point of order under Rules 24(7) and 31, with respect to seating in the Chamber."
"In view of the on-going civil war between Mr Le Pen's faction of the National Front and Mr Mégret's, I should like to ask the Conference of Presidents whether they will consider moving the two factions apart to avoid the possibility of disturbance in the Chamber."
"In the meantime, we should be very grateful if they would wear the appropriate labels so we would know whether they support Mr Le Pen or Mr Mégret."
"Mr President, I would like to make what is, I suppose, a personal statement, as Mr Ford is criticising me as a member of the National Front."
"I would like to assure him immediately that I believe everyone is to be polite in this House, as is traditional, including on the National Front benches."
"Thank you, Mr Blot."
"VOTES"
"We shall now take the vote on the interpretation of the provisions applicable to the discharge procedure - Annex V of the Rules of Procedure."
"Since questions have been raised, I am taking a vote on the interpretation given by the Committee on the Rules of Procedure of the provisions applicable to the discharge procedure."
"The interpretation by the Committee on the Rules of Procedure - which was also included in the Minutes - was that it considered that the provisions of Annex V were not at variance with the general provisions of the Rules concerning the tabling of amendments, which could be accepted under Rule 125."
"On the other hand, amendments proposing the opposite to the proposal of the committee responsible were inadmissible."
"(Parliament adopted the interpretation by the Committee on the Rules of Procedure)"
"Mr President, as the rapporteur for Parliament, I just wish to confirm that the common position is acceptable to us, as is the financial settlement at ECU 112.5m."
"I should like to thank the Austrian presidency and DG XXIV for their work on this."
"(The President declared the common position approved)"
"Before we go on to the explanations of vote, I should like to congratulate the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy and the rapporteurs on the way they organised the votes, which has made it possible for Parliament, thanks to the systematic way in which they were proposed and accepted by the Bureau, to vote on so many reports and 320 amendments in just 40 minutes!"
"This is a record rarely achieved, for which the Committee on Research must be thanked."
"We appreciate the need to consider the status of those countries which are not, for the time being, signing up to the single currency."
"It is a matter that certainly needs a thorough airing as part of the general political debate in the Member States concerned."
"We must not forget, however, that one of the aims of this report - which has a united committee behind it - is to influence public opinion. Yet some of the assertions made here are based on pure speculation as to developments in the non-participating countries."
"We do believe that the advent of the single currency will be of great significance in terms of competitiveness, employment and growth. And we think that Sweden should join EMU at some point in the future."
"But it is not for the European Parliament to tell Swedish citizens - as happens in this report - that their country should adopt the single currency."
"Any such decision will depend on a prior proposal having been put to the Swedish people, either in a referendum or in conjunction with elections to the Riksdag."
"In the Stevens report, the European Parliament shows kind concern for the misfortunes likely to descend upon the Member States which did not wish to join the euro zone (United Kingdom, Sweden, Denmark) and on the country that did not qualify (Greece)."
"Their national currencies will, it seems, become more volatile, and as all their economic actors will favour the euro, it will become a genuine 'parallel currency' in these countries."
"The conclusion of the report is obvious: 'As the only way the risks inherent in parallel use of the Euro can be removed for the United Kingdom, Sweden, Denmark and Greece, is by joining EMU, they should do exactly that, as soon as possible'."
"We are astounded at the arrogance shown in this report and the contempt displayed for the democratic choices made in three of these countries."
"If tribute is to be paid to the United Kingdom, Sweden and Denmark, then it is because their governments were able to organise a genuine debate on the single currency and then to respect the choice of their citizens."
"Not everyone can say the same."
"Moreover, we may wonder whether the aim of the Stevens report is not to allay the feelings of guilt on the part of those in the euro zone who trampled on democracy, by showing them that they were not wrong because, when all was said and done, even those who respected democracy subsequently reached the same conclusions."
"But there is an enormous gap in this report: it is by no means certain that the countries that did not choose to adopt the euro will regret it."
"For example, if we assume that the euro is strong against the dollar, the European countries not participating in the euro zone will perhaps find that they are at an advantage by retaining more reasonable exchange rate parities."
"Similarly, unification of monetary conditions within the euro zone will not be beneficial, or even painless, for all its members."
"Some will doubtless regret not having been able to retain flexible exchange rates to be able to bring their economies smoothly into line with those of their neighbours."
"They will envy the countries that have remained unrestricted outside the euro zone."
"But perhaps the Stevens report has another, hidden, objective: to try to eliminate these recalcitrant countries that could in future become embarrassing witnesses to the error of the single currency by absorbing them into the euro zone."
"The European Parliamentary Labour Party abstained in the final vote on the Stevens report on 'The euro as a parallel currency' for the following reasons."
"The rapporteur is unnecessarily alarmist regarding the consequences of the euro as a parallel currency for the pre-in countries."
"The nature of his call on the pre-ins to join the euro ignores national policies and is not grounded in the real world."
"The framework programmes for research, technological development and demonstration activities always lead to lengthy and stormy debates with the European Commission, particularly where they are linked to budgetary issues."
"This provides the European Parliament with an opportunity each time to fight for the financial share we believe to be fair."
"Until now, we have always been the decisive factor in allowing the European Union to create a real policy of research and technological development."
"The fourth framework programme has now proved itself."
"Scientific cooperation and technology transfer are organised around this unique programme that covers all areas."
"Thanks to its vast range of activities, the opportunities offered to researchers, teachers and companies have been increased, and the result has been the development of a real sense of European identity."
"We have achieved positive results that have been acknowledged unanimously."
"This great popularity within the European scientific community must not be compromised at a time when a new framework programme is being drawn up and eleven new countries are knocking at the door of the European Union and are likely to bring mutual scientific and technical enrichment."
"We therefore need appropriate financing to take account of the most recent technological developments."
"Consequently, I approve the Quisthoudt-Rowohl report and the compromise it presents for 1998-2002."
"I am one of those who would have liked to go a step further. As this is not possible, let us accept a good compromise that includes the majority of the amendments tabled by the European Parliament."
"Scientific research and technological development have become the focal point of the economic future of Europe."
"Promoting these among small and medium-sized enterprises would therefore be promoting the progress of the European Union."
"We would like to thank the rapporteur for this very interesting investigation into the Union's research effort in the field of thermonuclear fusion and fission."
"On the question of fission energy, our position is that we wish to see a phasing-out of nuclear power, although any decisions must be taken at national level."
"We cannot therefore support any fission research which would lead to the development of more nuclear energy."
"We commend the way in which the Commission is now emphasising investment in operating safety and targeting the whole fuel cycle - which includes waste management."
"And we support the proposals on decommissioning reactors, phasing out nuclear power and storing radioactive material."
"Whilst I approve of investing in research and development to improve nuclear safety and devise new waste management techniques, there is no reason for the EU to put research money into new thermonuclear fusion or fission reactors."
"We are told in the report that the aim is 'the possible construction of safe, clean and economically competitive prototype reactors'."
"It is very hard to draw the line between nuclear safety research and new reactor research."
"In order to avoid a fresh proliferation of nuclear power, however, the distinction must be made before any further projects are commenced."
"That concludes voting time."
"(The sitting was suspended at 12.50 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"1999 General Budget (continuation)"
"The next item is the continuation of the debate on the general budget for 1999."
"Madam President, the 1999 general budget for the European Union is the last budget which will be adopted by this Parliament."
"It may be permitted, therefore, to put it into a more historical perspective."
"The 1999 budget concludes a remarkable process of qualitative and quantitative consolidation."
"In the future, the Union will be in better shape to justify its financial requirements."
"Qualitatively, this budget procedure has solved three major problems which have been discussed for many years."
"Firstly, the 1999 budget is established on the basis of the new interinstitutional agreement on legal bases."
"The new budget procedure has shown that the agreement works."
"New and experimental activities can still find their starting-point in the Community budget."
"The Commission and the organisations concerned will benefit from the clarity for the execution of the budget."
"This is a major achievement."
"Secondly, significant progress has also been made with regard to Community subsidies."
"The recent Commission communication imposes mandatory minimum rules for publicity and collective decision-making on all Community subsidies."
"This is something that Parliament has asked for on many occasions."
"The new rules come into effect for the execution of the 1999 budget."
"A vademecum has been distributed."
"We have had a successful seminar exchanging information and holding discussions with the actual and potential beneficiaries; further seminars are in preparation."
"Thirdly, there are the technical assistance offices."
"The intense work of the Committee on Budgets and of experts on both sides has established an unprecedented degree of transparency and control in the 1999 budget."
"In this area, lack of clarity can no longer be an excuse."
"The Committee on Budgets has made that very clear to the Commission."
"Work has to continue to strengthen links between decisions on financial and human resources for each Community action."
"For that reason the Commission is currently developing the first elements of activity-based budgeting."
"Legal bases, subsidies and technical assistance offices are qualitative improvements that may look small to some but they solve problems which have long overshadowed the Community budget."
"They will remain after this budget for the future."
"What will also remain is a string of rigorous Community budgets."
"Since 1996 the Community budget has regularly grown less than public spending in the Member States."
"Thus the Union has contributed to the consolidation effort for the successful launch of Economic and Monetary Union."
"At the same time, within the rigorous framework, clearer priorities have been set."
"On the one hand, financial support for cohesion, as agreed in Edinburgh; on the other hand, employment-creating expenditure, for example trans-European networks research and education."
"External expenditure has grown fast, pushed by the Member States and events."
"It took some time to establish the regulations and the administrative structures to permit satisfactory execution and, as has been said today in the earlier debate, further efforts are still required."
"Qualitatively and quantitatively, the European Parliament has built up a reputation of being, if not always an easy, at least a credible partner in the budget procedure."
"Let us reinforce this partnership with the Council."
"In this respect it has also been fortunate with regard to the most recent presidencies."
"I hope for the best for the future."
"The hope is that this partnership will also permit the successful conclusion of a new interinstitutional agreement next year."
"Important progress has already been made: agreement on a legal basis, the flexibility element, concertation throughout the budget procedure."
"It is no exaggeration to say that more progress has been made in the budgetary field than in any other part of Agenda 2000."
"This makes me fairly optimistic that new interinstitutional agreements can be reached with this Parliament."
"In conclusion, let me congratulate the rapporteurs, Mrs Dührkop Dührkop and Mr Viola."
"As this is the last budget to be adopted under his chairmanship, I should like in particular to thank Detlev Samland."
"I think you will agree that his years at the helm of the Committee on Budgets will not be forgotten."
"However, we still have a lot of work to do during spring so that the agreement on Agenda 2000 will be ready before the end of this Parliament."
"Mr President, this budget has been different in many respects from any other budget I have been involved with."
"The Commissioner has just highlighted the three major topics which have come from the discussions between the three institutions."
"The thing that will always stick in my mind is that we had a conciliation before the Council's second reading, something which has never happened before."
"One of the reasons for this, and part of the process, is that we are trying to get Parliament and the Council to work much more closely together on the budget so that we do not again have the game of ping-pong we have had over the past few years when trying to make sure that the budget we get reflects what the Council wants and what Parliament wants."
"During the conciliation process before the second reading, the big decision was to drop the strategic amendment."
"Those of us who were part of the delegation did that on the assumption that, come the negotiations for the next interinstitutional agreement, flexibility will be part of it."
"The Council made that statement and the President-in-Office stated that clearly this morning."
"Getting that agreement also paved the way for the supplementary and amending budget."
"That position was taken by those of us who were involved for a number of reasons, not least of which was a threat by the Council unilaterally to break the existing interinstitutional agreement and state that the 1999 budget would have been illegal."
"There are those of my colleagues who say that we should have gone along with that line of action, that we should have called the Council's bluff and should have carried on with the strategic amendment."
"Had that happened we would have been confronted with all the consequences of 1999 having no budget, provisional twelfths, etc."
"Quite frankly, many of us did not want that."
"We are trying to be sensible, cooperative and prudent, and that should be kept in mind by those in the Council who think a great victory has been achieved over Parliament."
"From our side it was a spirit of responsibility and good sense that helped us to make that decision."
"The Socialist Group went along with this in what we hope will be a new spirit of cooperation between those two institutions."
"Having said all that, we have a problem which was not mentioned during this conciliation process."
"It concerns Category 2, where Parliament set out its position at first reading."
"Nothing was said in our discussions but at the end of the day when the Council had its first reading, we find that it has made a cut."
"It has agreed with the ECU 500m cut in payments but, at the same time, it has also got rid of the reserve."
"We are left with the problem of what to do."
"Those who were at the Committee on Budgets' meeting last night will say that problem is now exacerbated, because we were going to go back to first reading and the Committee on Budgets did not agree with that."
"The Committee on Budgets has not agreed the reserve but has agreed the ECU 500m extra spending."
"Our group will be discussing that this evening and we will be taking a position on it then."
"Therefore, I cannot give a conclusive statement as to what our position will be until it has been decided and until we vote on Thursday."
"I have to say that the cut in the reserve does not help our position for the maximum rate of increase if things go wrong with the interinstitutional agreement."
"Finally, we need to congratulate Mrs Dührkop Dührkop."
"She has been congratulated throughout the speeches but we must recognise the hard work she and Mr Viola have done."
"Mr Viola's report is a formality at this second reading: but in Mrs Dührkop we have a single working mother from the Basque region, with all that implies."
"Half way through the process she found herself at the top of an assassin's death list!"
"We should appreciate the work she has done this year - it has certainly not been easy for her."
"Madam President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur for all her hard work on this report."
"The debates on the second reading of the budget were extremely hectic, but they are actually relatively calm this time."
"The discussion on the strategic amendments in particular took a great deal of time, and we agreed with the rapporteur's approach."
"We in the PPE Group have always maintained that strategic amendments should not involve any extra costs, and that was how they were formulated."
"They were intended, as we saw it, to get negotiations going, and as such they succeeded."
"There has never been such a broad agreement between Parliament's first reading and the Council's second as there is now, and this is all thanks to the strategic amendments."
"We must thank both the rapporteur and the Austrian Presidency for this."
"I must admit that I, as a Dutchman, still feel rather bitter that this perfectly normal negotiating strategy was so badly misinterpreted by the Dutch Minister of Finance, who made Dutch Members out to be some sort of traitors to their country."
"That was what he said at the time, though he has certainly now been shown to be wrong, as the Dutch Government has also acknowledged."
"The social items too have been settled, though there is one problem remaining, which is the expenditure under the Social Fund and other funds."
"Mr Wynn referred to this a moment ago."
"There are a lot of countries - of which the Netherlands is one - that are having to spend more than 33 % of the commitment appropriations."
"According to the most recent figures, the Netherlands is having to spend 45 % of Objective 2 commitments, 37 % of Objective 3, 42 % of the agricultural section of Objective 5a, 67 % of the fisheries section of Objective 5a, and 57 % of Objective 5b."
"These are very worrying figures, and a number of other northern European countries are in the same position."
"Last year, it was clear that there was not enough money left in the Social Fund at the end of the year, and the same thing is going to happen this year."
"This means that projects will be paid late, particularly, I have to say, in the Netherlands."
"This situation can only be prevented by making sufficient payment appropriations available."
"I am therefore pleased that the Committee on Budgets has approved the amendment to make those payment appropriations available, otherwise a good many projects would find themselves in difficulties, which is the last thing we want to see."
"Madam President, the debate this afternoon on the budget is perhaps less emotional than the one on budget discharge, but I think it is no less fundamental."
"The substantive amendments are not really the issue today."
"Gradually over the last five years the Council has become accustomed to the idea that a dialogue with civil society - where the Council's presence has always been negligible - should be promoted."
"Parliament, far from being a spending Parliament, has proved to be responsible."
"The issue therefore is not so much finance as institutional issues."
"Some people, including our own rapporteur, said that a new culture is developing."
"You, Commissioner, said that there is progress in the budgetary field more than anywhere else."
"I tend to question that."
"Surely all groups, including the Liberal Group, will adopt the departure from the strategic amendment."
"But if one looks at what has really been achieved, one can put some questions."
"There is a very thin compromise."
"At the end of the day the Council has agreed to vote in future by a qualified majority - something that already existed."
"So my main point is that on the question of the interinstitutional agreement - the new interinstitutional agreement in particular - the next Parliament must be much more careful to see what will happen."
"From the perspective of the strategic amendment there was always a compatibility with the interinstitutional agreement."
"Article 17 made it very clear."
"We have stayed within the financial perspectives."
"But then the question of whether we agreed under the Treaty was a different matter."
"I have always understood that during the time of an interinstitutional agreement it would not be possible for either the Council or Parliament to denounce it."
"This particular threat to which Mr Wynn referred quite clearly indicates that was the main argument for the Conciliation Committee to change."
"We should not go back over old history."
"The story for the future is that for the time being the European Parliament margin for future expenditure remains pretty much close to zero."
"Therefore I think we have reached an armistice, rather than that the battle is won."
"The battle for the new structure will come up again in the next three or four months when Agenda 2000 is to be agreed."
"No definitional flexibility is being agreed."
"In short, the question of the future budgetary rights of this Parliament still remains in abeyance although the culture has certainly changed."
"Madam President, the fact that the Council has accepted a good many of the proposals made by the Parliament at first reading and the proposal to include certain others by our committee means that I do not need to make any further comments on this matter."
"I shall, therefore, concentrate on certain questions that I think are of particular importance in this final phase of the procedure."
"I shall begin with something that was spoken about a lot at first reading: the fact that this budget, being the last in the lifetime of this Parliament, may be seen as a bridge leading to the following budget."
"I cannot forget that this statement was made in relation to the so-called 'strategic reserve' and the possible failure to conclude an interinstitutional agreement."
"In any case, now that this process is almost over I must draw attention to the extremely low level at which the budget has been set and how far it is from the financial perspective set out in Edinburgh, and, fundamentally, to the negative impact which this has in terms of sacrificing the Community policies that we all see as fundamental, particularly if it is taken as a reference for the definition of future financial perspectives."
"With or without an institutional agreement. In other words, in our view this is the most negative aspect of the whole process."
"Let us now look at the question of strategic reserves: now that we have reached the end of the process I must say that we have many doubts and a great deal of concern today about the strategy that has been adopted and, above all, the results obtained by it."
"For the sake of a point of departure that was meant to be higher in the future and in order to prevent any need to resort to Article 203 of the Treaty, we have ended up by adopting a rigorous budget."
"That was achieved by the Council once it had rejected the reserve."
"Apart from this, there has just been a vague agreement with the Council on the basis of an imprecise declaration of principle about flexibility, the significance and extent of which also seem to us to be extremely unclear."
"The only conclusion is that there is to be very little flexibility indeed, and only the future will tell just how little."
"I would like to make one final comment to say that there seems to be reasonably good sense in the proposal approved by the Commission to reinstate as payment appropriations the ECU 500 million from the Structural Funds that had been cancelled at the first reading by the Council."
"It is a fact that these are payment appropriations and the question might therefore seem quite technical."
"But it is not technical for the public."
"It is no less true that, even in the technical field, given that the strategic reserve was also rejected here the failure to include this amount inevitably resulted in a huge and incomprehensible discrepancy between authorisations and payment appropriations."
"We hope therefore that common sense will prevail here in the plenary and that this proposal will be confirmed."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I regret the fact that such an important debate as the budget is being held in circumstances where I am almost obliged to speak because so many other people are absent."
"In my opinion, this is partly a result of having tried to place too much political emphasis on another debate held this morning."
"With the 1999 budget we had a lot of challenges and demands to present to the Council."
"Unfortunately, we were unable to do so because we had to accept a certain political realism and abandon the amendment which we had nevertheless voted for at first reading in an attempt to strengthen our influence in the negotiation process and thus achieve a credible interinstitutional agreement, in other words an interinstitutional agreement that also involves the Council."
"We have achieved this."
"Personally, I regret that, obsessed by a dispute that is admittedly relatively important for the proper functioning of the institution but is in my opinion quite fruitless from the political point of view, we have to some extent neglected the real institutional debate with the Council."
"The result is that we are in the process of adopting a budget at second reading that, all in all, gives greater consideration to the Council's current concerns than to those of Parliament, and I mean that quite sincerely."
"We have sacrificed our concerns on the altar of a different debate."
"We shall see whether this tactic, chosen by those of our colleagues who - I repeat - wished to place a different debate at the centre of Parliament's concerns, was the right one."
"Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office, those few ladies and gentlemen who are still with us, for the first time in four years, in the Committee on Budgets, I was in agreement with Mr Samland, the chairman, in rejecting the draft submitted to us."
"To be honest, I am not sure it was for the same reasons: the chairman of the Committee on Budgets rejected the draft because he was not satisfied with the conditions under which the strategic amendment was withdrawn, and I rejected it even though the strategic amendment was withdrawn."
"At first reading I criticised the fact that in artificially raising the budget to 1.17 % of GNP we were holding our countries' taxpayers to ransom, and I mentioned the Committee on Budgets' gamble."
"Well, the gamble failed."
"The Legal Service rightly declared that the strategic amendment did not comply with budgetary rules or with the principle of entering funds for a specific and genuine purpose."
"So the Council is bringing us back to reality, and it is doing so, I must admit, without making any major concessions."
"It has not agreed, for example, that Parliament should discuss compulsory expenditure with the Council."
"It has simply accepted the possibility of a certain flexibility and also the idea of possibly using majority voting, which in fact means that it would be applying the Treaty."
"For our group to vote for it, the budget proposed by the Council at second reading will have to be adopted in accordance with the terms and the amounts already set out."
"Otherwise we will vote against the draft proposed at second reading."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would say to Mr Fabre-Aubrespy that your group has never yet distinguished itself by taking a constructive part in the discussion."
"So your present attitude does not surprise me either."
"Secondly, as regards the general attitude, I would actually be quite happy to devote another minute to that."
"I believe that the Council and Parliament, with the support of the Commission, have in fact succeeded in developing a procedure which is moving towards greater cooperation. This has not just taken place under the Austrian Presidency - that would be to heap too much praise upon it - but has been an ongoing process since the Luxembourg Presidency and the presidency before that."
"The ad hoc procedure for agriculture, for example, originated not this year, but last year, although we have also used it successfully this year."
"Secondly, I say to the President-in-Office and the entire Council that you have not done anything to be proud of!"
"You ran the risk, if we had not agreed at second reading, of unilaterally revoking the Interinstitutional Agreement."
"Because your announcement that, if the strategic amendment were adopted, you would stand here and declare that the maximum rate had been exceeded would have amounted to nothing other than your side revoking the Interinstitutional Agreement."
"This, you see, specifically states that the ceilings on expenditure set in it are the same ceilings which you too accept when the maximum amount is determined."
"You were not ready for that."
"You can give us the credit for being ready - despite the poor results last week - to reach a compromise, because a declaration on your part not to accept the maximum rate would certainly not have been an invitation to Parliament to negotiate an interinstitutional agreement for the period 2000 to 2006 in the next three months, to state that quite clearly here."
"The way in which you extracted yourself from that tight corner leaves much to be desired."
"I must be open about this."
"Because after the discussions and negotiations we held with the Austrians, I can only say that I had expected more."
"Mr Fabre-Aubrespy is right there."
"The results are extremely disappointing."
"Over the next few months, we will have much more ground to make up and catching-up to do on what we have not managed to achieve now."
"For you can take it - I am stating this quite clearly here - that the European Parliament will not agree to another institutional agreement which restricts the room for manoeuvre, characterised by flexibility, which it enjoys on the basis of Article 203."
"You, Mr President-in-Office, must be interested in this new financial perspective, because otherwise this House will be invited to enter the ceiling on expenditure in each respective budget, simply to ensure that expenditure does not fall the following year."
"To that extent, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President-in-Office, this was a step in the right direction, a leap, one might say, but a leap which fell short."
"I should, nonetheless, like to warmly thank all those who, through their work, have supported the discussions on the budget."
"My main reason for doing so is because this will be the last full budget on which I shall work as chairman of the Committee on Budgets and as a Member of the European Parliament."
"I would like in any case, at this early stage, since I will indeed be going some more of the way with you - and have no fear, I still want to leave my mark on Agenda 2000, so that you will think of the work I have had a hand in here for another seven years - to wish every success to those who must then continue working on the budget."
"For you have a huge amount of work ahead of you."
"Always remember that the discussions on the budget are a real political opportunity in the European Parliament."
"While Mrs Müller said this morning on the discharge that Parliament's hour had come, I would say that it comes repeatedly every year with the budget."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are facing this final vote on the 1999 budget with trepidation."
"At first reading, in October, the European Parliament did some positive work by reinstating the necessary appropriations for some of the main programmes for regional and social development, fighting unemployment, preserving the environment and humanitarian aid."
"Thanks to the action of the rapporteur, Mrs Barbara Dührkop Dührkop, we then voted for a strategic reserve which raised the overall value of the 1999 budget to a value closer to that originally planned, to provide a possible starting point for the budget for the year 2000, with amounts which are more realistic given the challenges of the euro, enlargement and the problems of inequality between the rich and poor regions of Europe."
"Unfortunately the Council did not accept the strategic reserve, which meant that our framework for the future was uncertain."
"Regarding Category 2 of the Structural Fund, the Council seems to ignore the fact that there are very large delays in payments, and funds are not being paid to projects already completed, which we feel is completely unacceptable and a discredit to the European Union."
"In January of this year we had to use up PTE 230 billion (ECU 1.17 billion) of the 1998 budget in order to pay what should have been paid in 1997."
"Since the blanket was short we covered our heads and left our feet outside."
"Throughout the year the Commission has been doing all it can to clear these back-payments, but it has not solved the problem."
"How can some people now want to cut or place in reserve appropriations that are already lacking?"
"As for the rest, I would briefly like to express our concern at the mismanagement of the programme of assistance to Russia - namely TACIS - and our doubts as to the objectives and results of the food aid that has now been proposed."
"Finally, I should like to declare the support of our delegation for the creation of stricter machinery for fighting fraud and the misuse of public money."
"Madam President, first I would like to thank the rapporteurs Mrs Dührkop Dührkop and Mr Viola for their excellent work."
"Similarly I wish to express my sincere thanks to the chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Samland, whose leadership of the committee has been almost legendary."
"I also wish to thank Budget Commissioner Erkki Liikanen for the cooperation he has demonstrated in his dealings with Parliament."
"The budget for next year is being created on the whole with consensus, and with little dissension, among Parliament, the Commission and the Council."
"It is a tight one."
"It represents only 1.1 % of gross national product, whereas the ceiling is 1.27 %."
"Personally, I am pleased that the planned EUR 130 million of appropriations for the TACIS programme have not been placed in reserve, as it would have paralysed this important programme and jeopardised, among other things, measures to improve nuclear safety."
"This EU budget is the last in the lifetime of this parliament."
"For the next budget both opinions on funding and an interinstitutional agreement will have to be discussed and negotiated."
"Closely connected with this will be resolving the EU's finances, which includes the issue of net contributions."
"The Agenda 2000 resolutions will be vital for the budgets over the coming years."
"We could say that Agenda 2000 is Europe's most all-embracing international economic agreement ever made in peacetime."
"For that reason, we must focus on its entry into force."
"The worst thing we in Parliament could do now would be to render the Commission powerless, for example by refusing discharge for the 1996 accounts."
"This would mean that our house would virtually be without a master just at a time when the crucial Agenda 2000 talks are going on, and Parliament would not have a negotiating team."
"For this reason I hope that we can debate this issue just as we did the previous one, in a spirit of cooperation, for the sake of the EU and, above all, its Member States and citizens."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, let me remind you that the Council's commitment two years ago, when we were debating the 1997 budget, was that the 1997 budget would be the last austerity budget."
"And I remember the charismatic chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Samland, wagging his finger during his speech and saying to them 'be sure not to let us down'."
"Unfortunately, Mr Samland, it seems that they have let us down."
"Just as they did last year, the same has happened this year and so we are now debating a budget shaped by the demands of the stability pact, a budget tied to the commitment to prop up a phoney Economic and Monetary Union, subject to the dictates of bankers, banks and economic lobbies, and one which has absolutely nothing to do with what we all once dreamed of, namely a Europe of solidarity and employment, the social Europe."
"I know what is going to happen now."
"Everyone who spoke, even the rapporteur Mrs Dührkop, whom I do not see here to congratulate - it seems that she too became bored and has left the House - was disappointed with the budget. At the end of his speech Mr Samland said the same thing, and all of you who have spoken said the same, but you will then vote for the budget, you will vote for it as you did last year and the year before."
"I, however, wish to be consistent with my beliefs and vote accordingly. Therefore I will not vote in favour of this budget."
"And those who elected you should ask you how you can maintain and say one thing and in the end vote for something else, and how you can issue ideological manifestos with a view to the coming elections containing false promises that you know you cannot fulfil so long as the budget remains at 1.10."
"Madam President, we in Parliament are good at eloquent speeches, but the words we utter have no influence on how things turn out."
"In Parliament's Committee on Budgets we roundly condemned the decisions taken by the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions to pay officials their salaries during the strike in May, but as the view of Parliament is not reflected in the budget, it counts for nothing."
"Paying salaries during a strike is a small matter."
"However, the so-called strategic reserve is a big issue, and showed Parliament's desire to increase its powers."
"But it lost the wrestling match with the Council."
"In the end Parliament always humbly does what the EU political elite wants."
"Parliament never opposes anyone."
"Parliament spent a whole morning criticising the Commission for the ineffectual way it monitors finances."
"Today, when in many speeches there have been suggestions of not granting the Commission discharge, Parliament is clearly in favour by a large majority of delivering ECU 400 million worth of agricultural produce into the hands of the Russian mafia."
"The European Parliament will not impose any conditions on the granting of aid that have to do with the proper monitoring of the sale of food aid."
"Thus Parliament itself will be powerless when it comes to looking for those guilty of fraudulent activity regarding EU surplus agricultural produce on the market."
"When food aid is being sold on the Russian market, without any proper market mechanisms, we are squandering taxpayers' money."
"Selling off ECU 400 million worth of EU food is equivalent to just giving the Russians ECU 150 million directly in cash."
"With the European Parliament approach it is easier to squander money all in one go than to squander it in a few small amounts."
"The Committee for Budgets only monitors these small amounts."
"Madam President, at first reading I opposed the ECU 3.75 billion strategic reserve, which I described as a completely wrong signal that will lead to the maximisation of expenditure in 1999 and thereafter, whereas the financial perspectives are precisely designed to control expenditure."
"The Committee on Budgets is now proposing not to have this enormous reserve, which is sensible because Parliament would risk being condemned by the Court if it persisted in this dangerous course."
"The extra buffer would mean that the maximum rate of increase under the Treaty would be considerably exceeded."
"The Council's promise to include 'elements of flexibility' in the new interinstitutional agreement gives Parliament an excuse to change its mind."
"But has Parliament actually achieved anything?"
"The Council has given no promises about the nature and scale of the flexibility."
"Will there be possibilities for transferring between the budget categories?"
"Will there really be more flexibility than we already have with the current financial perspectives?"
"None of this is clear, yet Parliament is content with this vague promise."
"I doubt very much whether we really needed to put our credibility on the line just for this, and we must not repeat these sorts of antics in the future."
"I also think that the Council was right not to make any specific promises."
"The division of the financial framework into maximum expenditure figures for the various categories has helped the budget to achieve controlled and balanced development."
"Budget discipline requires these maximum figures to be strictly adhered to."
"Some flexibility is needed in fleshing out each year's budgetary priorities, but this can be done without transferring funds between the various headings, which so many people have been calling for."
"The headings are broad enough to accommodate varying requirements."
"One final point on the Structural Funds."
"It was stated in Edinburgh that these should be spending targets, and now we are paying for that statement."
"At the end of the programming period, we can expect to see a considerable pool of unallocated appropriations, and we need to find a solution to this problem."
"If we carry appropriations over until 2000 as the rapporteur suggests, they will have to be deducted from the financial package for 2000-2006."
"Madam President, as has already been stated, there is no doubt that this budget is a historic one. However, in my view, it is not historic because Mrs Dührkop is the first female Iberian Member to be appointed general rapporteur - although I congratulate her on her work - nor is it historic because it is the last budget of the current 1993-1999 financial perspective and because it is certainly going to influence the next financial perspective, if there is one, which is not yet certain."
"Nor is it historic, in my view, merely because it is the first budget in euros. We knew all this when the budgetary procedure began."
"In my opinion, it is historic because, in the course of this budgetary procedure, the Council has promised in writing, and this morning it repeated that promise verbally, that it would respect what it has signed."
"We have managed to get the Council to make a momentous declaration here."
"Some people may be surprised to know that it is the first time in 40 years that the Council has made a unilateral declaration stating that it will respect its commitments."
"This might seem evident and redundant to some people, but it has not been the case in the history of the Community."
"This Council declaration relates to the question of flexibility in the future financial perspective, which we would like to sign and to have, but not - and I would stress this point - at any price."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the basis for my current negotiating mandate is the resolution of 4 December 1997 in which Parliament gave its support to a new financial perspective that would be adequate to meet the challenges that the European Union will face in the coming years."
"Parliament accepts as a practical necessity the own resources ceiling of 1.27 % and calls for mechanisms to provide flexibility: on the one hand, review clauses for the financial perspective; and on the other hand, mechanisms that speed up the process of transferring funds between categories and mobilising new resources when necessary."
"In a working document several months ago, I pointed out that the problem stemmed from paragraph 12 of the current Interinstitutional Agreement, which provides for the financial perspective to be reviewed in accordance with the majorities provided for in Article 203(9) of the Treaty. However, the Council had voted unanimously for an internal decision that prevented any degree of flexibility."
"To put an end to this inflexibility, we tabled the so-called strategic amendments."
"In my opinion, these can now be withdrawn following last week's agreement."
"I must point out that Amendment No 708 on the Structural Funds from the first reading followed a certain logic that the Council has now broken."
"It has removed the commitment appropriations from the reserve and added them to the heading, while maintaining the reduction in payment appropriations."
