"Text"
"(DE) Mr President-in-Office, do you know that Mr Papadimoulis is completely isolated here?"
"Are you familiar with the resolution adopted by this House in which a 75% majority of Members said that we were in favour of the Ahtisaari-Rohan plan and that we were clearly in favour of sovereignty under international monitoring?"
"Do you know that we unequivocally ruled out the option of a division of Kosovo?"
"I would also like to ask you what you think of these rumours and the talk of a division of Kosovo, which was actually ruled out by both the Contact Group and this Parliament."
"(PT) The issue of the division or partition of Kosovo is not in any way on the agenda, nor does it form part of the Troika's work."
"Subject: Kazakhstan's candidacy for the OSCE Chairmanship"
"It is reported that Kazakhstan is putting itself forward as a candidate to hold the Chairmanship of the OSCE in 2009."
"The Foreign Affairs Minister of the country holding the Chairmanship represents the organisation and coordinates all the activities of the OSCE."
"Kazakhstan is well known to be a country which has never held an election meeting international standards, and where human rights are in a very poor state."
"The EU Member States very often act together as a block in the OSCE."
"Unanimity is particularly to be expected on an issue as fundamental as this, in which an undemocratic country is pushing itself forward to be Chairman-in-Office of the OSCE."
"This difficult decision is to be taken in November."
"Is there a consensus within the General Affairs Council that the candidacy of Kazakhstan is unacceptable?"
"Will the Member States present a united front?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Thank you, Mr President, honourable Member."
"The European Union has not yet made any decision on the candidacy of Kazakhstan for the OSCE Chair in 2009."
"As the EU sees it, this candidacy will underline the need for Kazakhstan to pursue reforms and respect the OSCE rules and obligations in all their dimensions."
"The Council has repeatedly affirmed that any country holding the OSCE Chair must set an example of respect for the principles of that organisation."
"In meetings with the political authorities of Kazakhstan, the European Union, the Council and the Commission have emphasised that Kazakhstan must show that it is ready and able to commit to full compliance with the OSCE's rules and obligations in all their three dimensions, namely the human dimension, the political and military dimension, and the economic and environmental dimension."
"deputising for the author. - (NL) Thank for your reply, Minister."
"May I assume that you imply that Kazakhstan does not meet those conditions at the present time?"
"(PT) I must comment because the honourable Member has inferred something from what I said that was not exactly what I said."
"What I said was that no decision has been made on Kazakhstan's candidacy and that a decision on Kazakhstan's candidacy will take into account, at the appropriate time, Kazakhstan's compliance with the conditions I mentioned."
"This analysis and debate will take place at the appropriate time and in the appropriate place."
"As the author is not present, Question No 7 lapses."
"Subject: Bluefin tuna fishing in the Mediterranean"
"On 11 June 2007 the Council adopted Regulation (EC) No 643/2007amending Regulation (EC) No 41/2006 as concerns the recovery plan for bluefin tuna recommended by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas."
"However, the text does not respect the principle of equal treatment for bluefin tuna fishermen in the European Union. The rules governing the minimum weight of fish caught and the fishing periods differ according to the geographical areas of the catches."
"What are the reasons for such disparities in the way Mediterranean and East Atlantic fishermen are treated?"
"The restrictions imposed on French bluefin tuna fishermen in the Mediterranean could seriously disrupt the sector's socioeconomic balance."
"Above the 30 kg limit imposed by the new Regulation, tuna are hard to sell."
"A two-week reduction in the fishing season means a significant drop in turnover for fishermen."
"Around one thousand fishermen and their families are directly affected by these measures."
"In what way is bluefin tuna fishing more harmful in the Mediterranean than in the East Atlantic?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Thank you, Mr President, Mr Navarro."
"On behalf of the Council, I should like to thank the honourable Member for his question on the bluefin tuna recovery plan."
"This plan was drawn up following an opinion from scientists at ICCAT (International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas), which recommended immediate and extensive action to prevent the current collapse of bluefin tuna populations in the Mediterranean and East Atlantic."
"ICCAT adopted the recommendation aimed at implementing a 15-year recovery plan at its annual meeting in November 2006 held in Dubrovnik."
"As a result, the European Community, as a member of ICCAT, accepted the international obligation to transpose said recovery plan into Community law."
"In commercial terms, the consequences of total non-compliance with this obligation would be seriously prejudicial to the European Community's position in the Asian markets."
"This obligation was met for 2007 through the adoption of Council Regulation (EC) No 643/2007 amending the Regulation on TACs (total allowable catches) and quotas."
"Based on a Commission proposal, the Council is currently assessing the regulations needed so that the plan can be permanently applied for a further 14 years as from 1 January 2008."
"Different rules apply to the various areas in order to reflect the respective differences in terms of types of fishing, levels of activity and situation of the population units."
"It should be recalled that these fisheries range between high-technology industrial fishing and non-industrial traditional fishing."
"The ICCAT groups decided on the plan based on scientific opinions which made certain distinctions between the Mediterranean and the East Atlantic."
"The Council is therefore of the opinion that ICCAT tried to follow this scientific advice while differentiating the elements of the recovery plan in order to attenuate its socioeconomic consequences."
"The Council is fully aware that this important recovery plan has socioeconomic consequences for the fishing communities in question."
"These consequences would also be felt if the bluefin tuna populations were to collapse again."
"During the negotiations with a view to adopting Council Regulation (EC) No 643/2007, the Council and the Commission agreed to introduce a provision ensuring that the recovery plan would be recognised as such by the European Fisheries Fund."
"This will enable Member States to use part of their resources from the Fund to mitigate the economic effects on the fishing communities affected."
"It is planned that this provision will remain in force until 31 December 2014."
"deputising for the author. - (ES) Mr President, I now wish to speak on behalf of Mr Navarro, and then ask a question of my own, or rather repeat a question."
"My question on behalf of Mr Navarro is as follows: Article 23(4) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002, which provide for the establishment of a bluefin tuna recovery plan, allows any surpluses produced by a Member State with respect to the yearly quota to be deducted from future fishing possibilities."
"What I wish to ask the Council is: what will happen to those who have caught less than their quota this year, since the Commission closed the fishing grounds last week?"
"Mr Ortuondo, I cannot give you the floor as I already have two speakers listed."
"However, I will give you a further 15 seconds if you wish to ask your question immediately because, under the Rules of Procedure, I cannot allow three supplementary questions."
"As an exception, and with the forbearance of all those present, I therefore allow you to continue for a further 15 seconds."
"(ES) Mr President, I also wish to beg your indulgence to ask the Presidency of the Council how Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 can be applied if the Member States have failed to cooperate with the Commission by not sending it the compulsory documentation on catches during this fishing year."
"(PT) The honourable Member has asked me certain questions, one of which is very specific and detailed."
"I will try to answer as best I can but I very sincerely believe that the first question directly relates, and would be better put, to the Commission."
"I feel that the Commission is certainly in a better position than the Council to give you the clarification you want."
"With regard to your second question on the alleged lack of cooperation by Member States with the Commission, of course if this is true then it is up to the Commission itself to analyse the situation and find the best way of, shall we say, forcing the Member States to comply with what they themselves may have laid down."
"This is clearly why I consider that the question would be better put to the Commission than to the Council."
"(DE) I would like to ask the Presidency how it is dealing with the phenomenon of climate change in relation to fishing quotas."
"We all know that climate change is currently buffered by the strong heat absorption of the oceans; 80% of the energy is still being absorbed here."
"However, it must of course be assumed that in future there will be massive warming of the marine environment as well."
"How is the Presidency ensuring that appropriate account is taken of these new scientific findings and that consideration is given to the aquatic environment when setting fishing quotas?"
"(PT) I feel that this is another question that would be better put to the Commission, rather than the Council, as the Commission naturally has a leading and fundamental role in this respect."
"I can tell the honourable Member, as I have already said, that the environmental issues, particularly those relating to climate change, are on the Presidency's agenda and on the Council's agenda as a priority item."
"We will be facing a major challenge after the Bali Conference at the end of this year and, following this whole process, we hope to be able to decide in 2009 on new targets for CO2 emissions."
"(ES) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I also wish to make some remarks on the bluefin tuna issue, and more specifically on the closure of fishing grounds decreed by the Commission recently since the quota allocated to the European Union had been exceeded."
"From the information supplied to us by the Commission, it may be inferred that when the fishing grounds were closed certain Member States, including Spain and Portugal, had not yet caught their quota, although others such as France and Italy had exceeded theirs, and had in fact doubled it, thus placing the European Union in, at the very least, an embarrassing situation of having infringed the international rules."
"My question, which is directed at the Council, is as follows: what measures can the Council take to compensate states that have not exhausted their catches through deductions from those that have used up more than their quota?"
"Can the Council do that?"
"I also have another question: what does the Council intend to do?"
"What measures will it take to ensure that this kind of situation does not happen again?"
"(PT) Mr President, Mrs Miguélez, once again I must say that you will have to put these questions to the Commission."
"It is the Commission which is naturally in a position to properly answer the questions that you have just asked me."
"Subject: Making EU laws in public"
"Is the Council aware of any negative consequences resulting from its decision in June 2006 to transmit on the Council website the proceedings of its meetings at which legislation is debated by ministers?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) In answer to the honourable Member's question, the Presidency would refer you to the report on the implementation of the overall policy on transparency presented by the previous Finnish Presidency to the Council on 11 December 2006."
"This report contained the Council's latest review of the impact of the new transparency measures on the effectiveness of the Council's work."
"According to the preliminary conclusions of this report, which is also preliminary, a more thorough evaluation should be made, before the end of 2007, of the effects of the new transparency measures when more practical experience has been gained of their implementation and impact on the Council's work."
"I can tell you that in the first half of 2006 a total of 98 deliberations and debates were open to the public, in accordance with the European Council Conclusions of 15 and 16 June 2006 and Article 8 of the Council's Rules of Procedure."
"I welcome the President-in-Office's response and I am very pleased that the Council took the decision to arrange for the transmission of these proceedings in advance of any provisions that may be found in the Reform Treaty."
"I note the President-in-Office's response that, before the end of 2007, a review will be undertaken and published, which, I hope; will indicate how the principles of openness and transparency in this area may be extended."
"Can the President-in-Office confirm that, before the end of his presidency, such a review will indeed be published?"
"(PT) What I can confirm and assure you of is that this is a subject dear to the Portuguese Presidency and we will do everything possible to take this process forward."
"I cannot, at this moment in time, guarantee specific dates for this review, but I can guarantee that the Portuguese Presidency is keen to take forward this issue of transparency and is committed to this."
"Subject: Situation in Afghanistan"
"What role does the Council see for the EU in stabilising the situation in Afghanistan, where troops from a number of EU Member States are stationed?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) The European Union's approach is essentially based on strict coordination."
"Internally, particular attention has been paid to ensuring complementarity and mutual reinforcement of the actions of the European Community, Council and Member States."
"Externally, the European Union has been one of the main members of the Joint Coordination and Monitoring Board set up under the 2006 Afghanistan Compact."
"The Council Decision of 12 February 2007 to move forward with the ESDP (European Security and Defence Policy) mission to Afghanistan must be understood in the context of this wider strategy."
"The EU Police mission (EUPOL) is currently in the planning stage."
"Through this mission, the European Union is indicating its intention to play a more active role in the field of policing with linkages to the wider rule of law."
"This mission will of course dovetail with the Commission's commitment to reform the justice sector."
"All these efforts have the common objective of reinforcing the sovereignty of the Afghan institutions."
"Since 2001 Afghanistan has made very significant progress in terms of setting up representative political institutions, freeing the press, creating institutions in the security sector, making improvements in health and education and in human rights and the status of women, appointing a functional supreme court and setting up a consultative panel for the appointment of senior officials."
"The European Union has played a fundamental role in this process and has already contributed EUR 3.7 billion since 2002."
"The European Union is continuing to intensify efforts to ensure that its development aid reaches Afghans in all parts of the country."
"The greater emphasis now being placed on governance and the rule of law is intended to reinforce the action in other areas."
"The Commission has been developing programmes in the areas of rural development, health and governance, and will financially support any civilian activities carried out by Member States through provincial reconstruction teams."
"The European Union firmly believes that, as stated by the European Council of 14 December 2006, the security and development of Afghanistan are interdependent."
"That is why the European Union has always been committed on a long-term basis to Afghanistan through a strong and balanced strategy."
"(PL) Thank you very much, Mr Antunes, for this clarification."
"I simply wished to refer to one key issue that also relates to the statements by representatives of the European Commission active in Afghanistan before Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"I wanted to enquire whether the Council intends to increase humanitarian aid to Afghanistan and intensify efforts to rebuild civil society there."
"In my view, much more than military presence is needed in Afghanistan. My country is, however, committed on the ground in Afghanistan, which is indicative of a certain desire to achieve stability in that region."
"(PT) I agree with the honourable Member: promoting security and stability in military terms in Afghanistan is fundamental, but that is only one part of what we have to do in that country."
"We also have to work on strengthening the democratic institutions in Afghanistan and we must also concentrate on the 'Afghan civil society' component."
"We must invest in health, education and training."
"We must also of course continue to win the hearts of the Afghan people."
"That is why we have a strategy with two aspects to it, one of which is the military aspect involving security and stability on the ground."
"Without security, without stability on the ground, there can be no peace and there can certainly be no economic and social development."
"We therefore need to guarantee this aspect and, at the same time, work on, and invest in, Afghan civil society and the Afghan democratic institutions, which we refer to as rebuilding the administrative capacity of the Afghan State."
"(DE) Economic stability in Afghanistan is the key prerequisite for a functioning democracy and peace in that country."
"In the European Union, we have the Oslo Agenda for Entrepreneurship Education for SMEs to promote business start-ups, foster entrepreneurial mindsets and promote exports and imports."
"Can you envisage this Oslo Agenda being implemented in Afghanistan as well?"
"(PT) Mr Rübig, I believe that we have to invest in all areas of Afghan society, as I have just mentioned."
"Clearly, in a country such as Afghanistan, with its current security difficulties, economic difficulties and its particular social structure, I believe that a very important role can be played by small and medium-sized enterprises."
"It therefore seems to me that this is truly a sector in which, in terms of forming the economic and social fabric of Afghanistan, we can and must invest."
"Of course we can discuss how to specifically use the financial instrument, but clearly no one is currently expecting, at least not at the moment, large enterprises to set up in Afghanistan."
"It is not the time for that."
"In order to revitalise the Afghan economic fabric, I believe that we must, in particular, concentrate our efforts on qualification, on training and, at the same time, on small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Subject: EU response to stop organised crime in Europe"
"Can the European Council make a statement as to the level of organised crime within Europe at this time and what coordinated initiatives are being put in place at EU level to combat the growing threat of organised criminal activity?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) The Council refers the honourable Member to the Organised Crime Threat Assessment (OCTA), which is annually produced by Europol for the Council's attention and a version of which is published and submitted annually to the European Parliament."
"On 13 June this year, in its conclusions on the OCTA 2007, the Council restated its conviction that the fight against organised crime should focus on reducing the threat and the harm caused by it and, in particular, on tackling the following problems: the obstacles to dismantling organised crime groups stemming from their international dimension or influence, the level of infiltration of organised crime into society and the economy, especially the misuse of legitimate business structures and the transport sector in particular, and, finally, the misuse of technology by organised crime groups."
"The Council also stressed that the European Union's priorities for 2007 should be the following criminal markets: drug trafficking, especially in synthetic drugs; smuggling and trafficking in human beings, especially in relation to illegal immigration; fraud, especially in the area of highly taxed goods and Value Added Tax carousels; euro counterfeiting, commodity counterfeiting and intellectual property theft, and money laundering."
"As was the case with the OCTA 2006, these conclusions highlighted the need for a multidisciplinary intelligence-led approach in order not only to disrupt criminal activities but also to dismantle criminal organisations, bring the offenders to justice and deprive them of the proceeds of crime."
"This implies drawing on dedicated (specialised) resources and organising structures with a view to using all information that is available to law enforcement and thus identifying and tackling the most threatening criminal groups."
"The Council also calls in its conclusions for the further development of a new, intelligence-led control strategy covering the entire national - and possibly EU - territory, complementing external border controls with checks, en route or at destination, monitoring financial movements and expanding the analytical capabilities of national and EU law enforcement agencies."
"There are two parts to my question."
"The first you have answered in the sense that you have given me the initiatives that have been put in place, but you have not answered the part about the level of organised crime."
"Many people would feel that is grossly underestimated at the moment and organised criminal gangs are infiltrating huge numbers of countries, if not all countries, in the European Union."
"This is a problem that is not going away and many people feel that it needs to be tackled in a far more coordinated manner than it is at the movement."
"I suppose what I am asking you is about the levels of organised crime within Europe."
"(PT) Mr Ryan, as I have already mentioned, I feel that it would be, or rather that it is useful and in fact essential, to review or consult the Organised Crime Threat Assessment for Europe."
"I am not disputing whether or not there is more or less crime as I do not at the moment have any information to give you on this, but it is often the case that there is a psychological perception of an increase in crime when the facts do not actually support this."
"However, there is one thing that cannot be disputed: we do need a greater concerted effort by, and more cooperation between, the Member States, especially cooperation between the European institutions and the Member States, in order to eliminate the threats posed by organised crime, which are wide-ranging and varied."
"As I indicated, due to the new technologies that are available, organised crime groups have extraordinarily sophisticated means of operation that are extremely difficult to combat."
"I believe that all our Member States are aware of these new technologies and the new opportunities offered to criminals by these technological developments, which are definitely causing specific problems in the fight against organised crime."
"Of course the Portuguese Presidency, as it should, will consider all proposals and suggestions made by the institutions in order to more effectively fight the threats posed by these criminal groups which, due to the type of crime perpetrated, cannot fail to have a major impact on our societies."
"I expect the President-in-Office would be appalled by any link between organised crime and any government within the EU."
"Yet, sadly, that is exactly the situation in Northern Ireland, where Sinn Féin, a lead party in government, is inextricably linked to the IRA, whose illegal Army Council controls a portfolio of hundreds of millions of euros accumulated from the IRA's organised crime activities."
"This is one of the reasons why its Army Council has not been disbanded."
"Will the Council join in condemning this obscenity and call upon IRA/Sinn Féin to disband its illegal Army Council forthwith?"
"(PT) My response to the issue of fighting organised crime and the Council's assessment and response are contained in my initial speech."
"I have nothing further to add on this issue."
"Subject: Road safety"
"Can the European Council outline what measures it is pursuing so that a greater level of road safety takes place within the territories of the European Union?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, Mr Ó Neachtain, as the honourable Member is certainly aware, following the presentation by the Commission of the Mid-Term Review of the European Road Safety Action Programme in March 2006, the Council adopted conclusions at its meeting on 8 and 9 June 2006."
"In these conclusions the Transport Ministers of the European Union and the European Commission agreed on the need to strengthen road safety measures and initiatives at Community or Member State level."
"As a result, in October 2006 the European Commission adopted two legislative proposals on the issue of reinforcing road safety and, thanks to excellent cooperation between the European Parliament and the Council, the two co-legislators quickly reached agreement on a proposal for a directive on the retrofitting of mirrors to heavy goods vehicles."
"This entered into force in August 2007 and will be implemented by 31 March 2009."
"The Commission estimates that this new legislative measure could save up to 1 200 lives on the Community's roads between now and 2020."
"The Council is currently assessing the proposal for a directive on road infrastructure safety management on which, pending the opinion of the European Parliament, it hopes to adopt a general approach at the Council meeting on 1 and 2 October."
"The Commission estimates that around 7 000 injuries and 600 lives could be saved every year if the measures proposed in this draft legislative instrument were applied."
"I must also say to the honourable Member that he can be assured of the Council's intention to positively assess all road safety measures and initiatives proposed by the European Commission in the context of its current efforts to reduce the number of deaths and injuries on the Community's roads."
"I thank you for the reply but I just want to ask you if, in your opinion, a more coordinated approach is needed now in view of the number of Member State nationals who travel from one country to the other, especially as is the case in my own country, Ireland, where many people from Eastern Europe come in and bring their cars."
"I do not think that the Council, or indeed the Commission, has made adequate provision for this type of travel at the present moment."
"(PT) Being Portuguese, I too have noticed very dramatic developments in my country in terms of road safety."
"Portugal has a problem, or has had a problem, in this area and so we have made very significant efforts."
"These have, in recent years, resulted in a very significant reduction in what was a plague of deaths on Portuguese roads, particularly in road accidents."
"This reduction has been due to systematic and persistent action by the government."
"This is a problem of which we are well aware, which affects us very directly and to which we are alert and highly sensitive."
"I said at the end of my speech that the Council, in this case the Portuguese Presidency, will pay close attention to, and will be totally ready to assess and take on board, any proposal that the Commission may make to the Council aimed at further improving the current efforts being made to reduce the number of deaths and injuries on the Community's roads."
"As I have said, the Presidency, in other words the Member State holding the Presidency, is particularly sensitive to this issue because it, too, has to deal with this problem in Portugal."
"As a result, as I have said, it is therefore willing to pay particular attention to any proposals made by the Commission to the Council in this respect."
"Subject: The accession of Croatia into the European Union"
"Can the European Council make a comprehensive statement outlining how Croatia's efforts to join the European Union are proceeding at present?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, Mr Crowley, I have already had the opportunity here today to briefly mention the process of Croatia's accession."
"I will now go into slightly more detail while still being as brief as possible given the time constraints."
"I can tell you, Mr Crowley, that the accession negotiations with Croatia are well on the way and significant progress has made been this year. Overall we have opened and provisionally closed two chapters: Chapter 25 - Science and Research and Chapter 26 - Education and Culture."
"In the meantime, another 10 chapters have been opened. These are: Chapter 3 - Freedom to Provide Services;"
"Chapter 10 - Information Society and Media; Chapter 17 - Economic and Monetary Policy;"
"Chapter 20 - Enterprise and Industrial Policy; Chapter 29 - Customs Union and, finally, Chapter 32 - Financial Control."
"In addition, the Council intends to hold the fifth meeting of the Accession Conference with Croatia at ministerial level on 15 October in order to open Chapter 28 - Consumer and Health Protection."
"Other chapters will follow at the end of the year."
"There is still a lot of work to do, particularly in areas critical to the success of any candidate country, such as reform of the judicial system and public administration, the fight against corruption and economic reforms."
"The Council is also continuing to urge Croatia to improve its administrative capacity and to effectively transpose and implement the acquis so that it can meet its membership obligations in due time."
"In order to maintain this dynamic and ensure a quality process, we must point out that further efforts are needed to meet the requirements of the Negotiating Framework, including Croatia's obligations in respect of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, and also the implementation of the Accession Partnership."
"Could I just say before I ask my question that I think it is wonderful that the President-in-Office has spent so much time in the Chamber today and participated so well in so many debates."
"Thank you on behalf of the House."
"With regard to the time-frame for Croatia, we know the difficulties that there have been in a number of chapters in getting agreement with the Croatian Government, but could the President-in-Office give a time-frame for when he sees these negotiations being concluded?"
"Are we talking about a two-year time-frame or a three-year time-frame?"
"Is there an exact time-frame that can be given, taking into account the difficulties that may arise?"
"Secondly, with regard to the areas that still have to be opened - the whole area of judicial independence and the police services in Croatia - what specific actions have been taken on those areas?"
"(PT) Mr Crowley, many thanks for your kind words."
"I must tell you that it has been my great satisfaction and honour to be here with you today, discussing, debating and not always agreeing on such important issues for the European agenda and the European Union."
"However, the honourable Member is asking me to do the impossible: to give him a date for Croatia's accession."
"I cannot do this because this accession, or this date, will in all likelihood depend more on Croatia than on the European Union itself."
"In fact, Croatia would probably be better placed than the European Union to determine this for the simple reason that, as you of course know, becoming part of the Union, entering the Union, depends on or corresponds to the progress made in complying with the criteria and conditions."
"What I can say absolutely unequivocally is that Croatia has a solid European prospect and a solid prospect of entering the European Union and that the Portuguese Presidency is committed to taking this process forward during its Presidency and is naturally also committed, together with the Commission, to overcoming any obstacles that may arise."
"In November, as I have just said in answer to another question, there will be a review of the state of negotiations with Croatia."
"This review and a proposal will be submitted to us by the Commission."
"These, as I am sure you will realise, will have a fundamental role to play in reporting on, and monitoring, the work being carried out."
"They will be produced under the competence, and with the detail to be expected of, the Commission and what the Commission will say and what it will propose and recommend in its review will be very important in terms of what the Council will decide for the future and for the continued negotiation process with Croatia."
"It is true that very often it is the administrative and judicial issues that are more difficult to resolve, in essence those issues relating to the specific internal organisation of Member States."
"It is those areas in which Member States, in terms of their specific organisation, must make greater investment and possibly also more extensive and, shall we say, more painful and more difficult reforms."
"We are confident that Croatia will be able to overcome any such difficulties and that, in line with its own desires and also those of the European Union, in the not too distant future it will become a member of our Union."
"Subject: Climate change"
"Can the European Council make a comprehensive statement outlining what structures are being put in place at EU level so that a greater level of coordination can take place between Europe and America in our efforts to ensure that the target to reduce CO2 emissions by 20% by the year 2020 can be achieved?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, Mr Aylward, there can be no doubt that climate change is a global challenge requiring global solutions."
"For their part, the European leaders have decided to send the international community a clear signal of their determination to combat climate change by making the following commitments with a view to launching negotiations on a global post-2012 agreement."
"Until such an agreement is reached, the European Union makes the independent and firm commitment to achieve, by 2020, a reduction of at least 20% in greenhouse gas emissions in relation to 1990 levels."
"Secondly, the Union intends to commit to up to a 30% reduction if other developed countries make comparable reductions and if those developing countries that are more economically advanced make an appropriate contribution."
"The European Union considers that it is time to assess the steps to be taken post-2012 and to establish a global approach involving the participation of a large number of countries."
"Pursuing a more permanent dialogue with the United States will be essential in preparing for the post-2012 negotiations which must begin at the Climate Conference to be held in Bali at the end of this year and to which I have already referred in my answer to a previous question."
"Within this framework, two important meetings are planned before the Conference, the results of which will certainly give very positive added value to the Bali negotiations."
"The first is the high-level meeting of the General Assembly of the United Nations on climate change, which actually took place in New York on 24 September."
"The second is the meeting of the main economies on 27 and 28 September in Washington, at which the European Union expects to make an important contribution to moving forward the international process within the United Nations."
"In addition, the European Union and the United States agreed at the Vienna Summit in June 2006 to set up a high-level dialogue on climate change, clean energy and sustainable development."
"The aim is to move forward based on existing bilateral and multilateral initiatives and to pursue the implementation of the Vienna Summit Statement and the Gleneagles Plan of Action on climate change, clean energy and sustainable development adopted by the G8 leaders."
"deputising for the author. - I should like to thank the President-in-Office for his response."
"However, the purpose of the question was that the difference of outlook between the US Administration and the European Union, with regard to finding solutions and building partnerships around the world, seems to have got greater; the distance between the two seems to have got greater in the last number of years."
"Obviously, no matter how good we are in the European Union, we need other people to follow what we are doing and, in particular, we can see now, with China and India and other concerns that they have, that America may lag further behind again."
"So what we are really looking for is specific action on behalf of the European Union to encourage our cousins across the water in America to join with us, so we can stand up to the power of India and China in these negotiations."
"(PT) Mr Crowley, I totally agree with you."
"We must convince our cousins and, as they are our cousins, we expect them to be convinced or at least to be open to being convinced."
"I must tell you that the road to Bali and the road after Bali will be complicated and fraught with difficulty."
"No one can have any doubt about this, but it is clear that, through persistent and concerted action, we can, I hope, be successful."
"In any event, I consider that, thanks to the permanent dialogue that has been established specifically with our cousins on the other side of the Atlantic, despite everything, any differences, any different views of this climate issue can be overcome."
"In this respect, I feel that the conclusions on climate change reached at the G8 meeting in Germany and the possibility created there or the agreement reached there on the fundamental role of the United Nations in the issue of climate change were positive evidence of the possibility of further progress and further agreements on this issue of climate change."
"As I have already said, it is essential that the European Union maintains, shall we say, its role as a leader and as an instigator paving the way for others in order to protect the environment and our planet."
"Ladies and gentlemen, you will have noticed that the next three questions all relate to Pakistan."
"Unfortunately, I cannot use the Rules of Procedure to invite the Council to answer all these questions together as the Council has structured its work otherwise."
"I must draw your attention to the need for the reform of Parliament and, in particular, to what you, ladies and gentlemen, need to do in relation to the essential reform of Question Time, on which I believe we are all unanimous."
"However, unfortunately, we cannot apply more flexible rules as we have Rules of Procedure by which we must abide."
"I therefore have to put these questions one by one, which probably means that not all three will be answered."
"Depending on how our work goes, we will see whether we are more or less productive."
"I will start with Question No 15 on Pakistani military assets."
"This question is by Mr Rutowicz and I urge the Council to answer this question directly."
"Subject: Pakistani military assets"
"It is widely known that Pakistan's army dominates the country's economy and administration."
"Does the Council intend to draw up an analysis to assess the total assets built up through military-related business while Pakistani society has suffered impoverishment?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) The multiple instances of dialogue between the European Union and Pakistan on that country and the role played by the armed forces form part of the comprehensive analysis on which the Council's policy with regard to Pakistan is based."
"The general situation of the Pakistani economy and its level of development are another two parts of this same analysis."
"Of course both are taken into account in the general definition of our policy towards Pakistan and this will continue to be the case in the future."
"(PL) I should like to thank the President and Mr Antunes for this response."
"As I understand it, the purpose of the question was essentially to enquire whether some kind of humanitarian support will be offered to these poor people in Pakistan."
"I would be grateful if Mr Antunes could provide some information in that regard."
"(PT) Mr Rutowicz, as you know, the issues of humanitarian aid, cooperation aid and development aid are priority issues for the European Union."
"Wherever people are suffering or in poverty, the European Union, the Council and also this Parliament do everything in their power to try and help resolve these situations."
"The European Union is one of the biggest, if not the biggest, donor of international aid and this fact cannot be forgotten."
"As the authors are not present, Questions Nos 16 and 17 lapse."
"Subject: European Union Solidarity Fund"
"Could the Council make a statement on the effectiveness of the European Union Solidarity Fund?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, Mrs McGuinness, as the honourable Member knows, the Commission is responsible for applying the Regulation on the Solidarity Fund and the effectiveness of this Regulation must be assessed in terms of the criteria laid down therein."
"As far as the Council knows, in cases of disasters provided for by the Regulation, its application has been effective."
"The European Commission periodically produces reports that set out in detail the use of the Solidarity Fund."
"Thank you for your brief answer."
"I presume the Council has a view, because the Member States would have a view of how it is being impacted upon their own countries."
"Do you think that the budget of one billion is sufficient and that the Fund reacts quickly enough to the various crises that it has to deal with?"
"(PT) Mrs McGuinness, as I said, the Council's assessment is that the application of this Regulation, in other words the use of the Solidarity Fund, has been effective."
"It was certainly an excellent suggestion to set up a fund to help Member States deal with any natural or other disasters as this was something that did not exist before."
"This fund is certainly helpful as such disasters put Member States in a very particular situation of difficulty and need."
"There should always ideally be the possibility of asking and applying for more."
"We must of course look at this issue realistically, but also ambitiously."
"I am sure that the Council, at the appropriate time and if proposed by the Commission, will not fail to assess this possibility."
"However, for the time being we have the legislative framework that we have and, by using this, we can work realistically, welcoming the creation of this fund and the effective role that it has played, which in fact proves that this initiative is justified."
"Subject: Making peace in the Middle East"
"Is the Council making enough use of the eponymous talents of the British Consul General in Jerusalem, Mr Makepeace?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) I will answer the oral question although I am sure it has been asked previously by Mr Newton Dunn."
"Very well, I should like to say that the diplomatic and consular missions of the Member States and the Commission delegations in third countries cooperate to ensure that the common positions and joint actions adopted by the Council in the context of the common foreign and security policy are observed and implemented as specified in the Treaty on European Union."
"This naturally also includes the British Consul General in Jerusalem to whom the honourable Member refers in his question."
"In the interests of my colleague, who wants to ask Question No 20, I will waive my right to a supplementary."
"Subject: Member State seat allocations in the European Parliament"
"Will the Council be proposing changes to the allocation of seats in the European Parliament to each Member State?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, Mr Mitchell, I am delighted to answer your question, all the more so as questions relating to the Reform Treaty are, in my personal opinion, starting with the question of a new Treaty for the Union many years ago, particularly interesting and important."
"I am therefore delighted to try to answer your question."
"I would remind you that, in accordance with the mandate of 22 June given to the 2007 Intergovernmental Conference, the provisions on this issue to be included in the Reform Treaty provide for a decision establishing the composition of the European Parliament to be adopted by the European Council on the initiative and with the agreement of the European Parliament."
"As the honourable Member is certainly aware and so as not to waste time, the European Council in June asked the European Parliament to put forward a draft of this initiative by October 2007."
"We are aware that a report is going to be presented on the future composition of the European Parliament at the part-session in October, i.e. on 10 October of this year, for which the rapporteurs are Mrs Lamassoure and Mrs Severin."
"I would like to thank my colleague for waiving his supplementary and thank the President-in-Office for taking the question."
"The reason I am raising this is that in Ireland we have already gone down from 15 to 13 seats."
"It is an island off the west coast of Europe."
"It is the furthest point before you go to the United States."
"There is a proposal now to reduce us further from 13 to 12, at a time when our population has gone up by 12% and is due to increase again dramatically."
"All I would say to the President-in-Office is this: since there are 16 additional seats to be allocated, would you please bear in mind Ireland's case for retaining the 13 seats?"
"I think if you look at the figures you will see that we do have a very good case, and I would ask that this should be taken into account."
"(PT) Mr President, I should like to point out that the westernmost point of Europe is in Portugal, at Cabo da Roca or Cape Roca."
"Perhaps, as a result of this assertion, I will be challenging the honourable Member's statement as to the geographical location of his country but, in truth, the westernmost point of Europe is in my country."
"With regard to the question raised, specifically the second part, the honourable Member will of course primarily obtain the answer to this from the European Parliament and his fellow members."
"However, I of course take note of his point."
"Questions which have not been answered for lack of time will be answered in writing (see Annex)."
"Question No 31 is inadmissible (Annex II, Part A, paragraph 2 of the Rules of Procedure)."
"That concludes Question Time."
"(The sitting was suspended at 7.35 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)"
"Membership of Parliament: see Minutes"
"Obligations of cross-border service providers (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Lasse Lehtinen, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the obligations of cross-border service providers."
"rapporteur. - (FI) Mr President, first I wish to express my thanks to the shadow rapporteurs for their encouragement and excellent cooperation: to Mrs Wallis, who is here today, and especially to Mr Hatzidakis."
"I am grateful and glad that both Mr Harbour and Mrs Kauppi are also here today."
"The internal market, as we know, is based on the four freedoms, one of which, however, the cross-border movement of services, is not working very well."
"The Services Directive, which was decided on in this House a year ago, will improve the situation, when the Member States have to implement it in two years' time, but that will probably not be enough either."
"Services, of course, cannot be compared to products in all respects, but services will one day be more important than they are now."
"High-quality and cross-border services in particular are this continent's future."
"The problem is that the acquis communautaire does not protect consumers who purchase services as well as consumers who purchase goods."
"European consumer confidence in cross-border consumption is low because the standard of services and level of protection varies from one Member State to the next."
"The Union has Community legislation in given areas, but has no common rules for services."
"Consumers, like service providers, are not always able to say which Member State's legal regime is applicable when there is a dispute."
"It is partly because of this that consumers are afraid to use foreign service providers."
"In my view, the Union should agree common rules and obligations which should be binding on service providers."
"These would benefit not only consumers but also the service providers themselves."
"If the Commission should at any time look into the matter of the service providers' obligations, it should not distinguish between private and public services. Both should equally come under the scope of application of directives on consumer protection."
"In 1990 the Commission made a proposal on the obligations of cross-border service providers."
"It had to withdraw it, however, for lack of political will."
"There is, however, political will once again."
"The Commission should, if this report is adopted, submit, within 12 months, at least a work programme which reassesses the need for a horizontal instrument."
"We need to settle on basic general rules enabling the consumer to obtain, if he or she so desires, relevant information on pricing, contract terms and remedies in the case of defective or delayed services."
"The Commission should also take into account the impact of any initiative on operating conditions for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Not all these matters were raised in the Green paper on consumer protection but they are in this report."
"I hope I will receive the greatest possible support for this report."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I am pleased to be here tonight to represent the Commission in this very important discussion on consumer confidence in the internal market."
"I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Lehtinen, and the shadow rapporteurs of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection for their very ambitious work in drafting this report."
"I should stress at the outset that the Commission agrees with the report regarding the need to increase consumer confidence in the internal market; in particular, the consumer internal market for services demands our attention."
"So, one of the Commission's priorities is to bring the benefits of the internal market closer to our European consumers and I am grateful for the support of the Parliament in this endeavour."
"The Commission has already undertaken a number of initiatives in order to boost consumer confidence in the internal market."
"I would like to mention two: European consumer protection legislation and the Services Directive."
"Now, the consumer acquis already sets out a number of obligations for cross-border service providers."
"For instance, it regulates the information obligations for traders who sell services long distance or on the consumers' doorstep."
"It also provides consumers with protection against unfair terms in services contracts."
"And, with the ongoing review of this acquis, the Commission will elaborate if there is further need to address the obligations of service providers and the rights of consumers in these areas."
"Then, the Services Directive: you know it very well, you discussed it not long ago."
"It improves the position of consumers within the internal market for services."
"And it ensures that consumers will be better informed by businesses, better assisted by public authorities, and it establishes a number of clear and substantive obligations on service providers."
"The Commission of course is very keen to ensure proper implementation of this Directive in all Member States and we believe that those two initiatives are very far-reaching because we can, from both of those initiatives, expect a real change in the consumer internal market for services once the implementation of the Services Directive is complete and the review of the consumer acquis delivers its results."
"Having said that, I have also to underline that the Commission takes a different view to Mr Lehtinen's report on the need for a separate horizontal instrument to cover obligations of cross-border service providers at this stage for the simple reason that we believe that we should first accomplish our ongoing initiatives before coming, if necessary, to a separate horizontal instrument."
"That is why I would like to thank you for your commitment towards helping us implement these two instruments; in also helping European citizens to enjoy the full benefits of the internal market for services."
"And I know that my colleagues, Commissioner Kuneva and Commissioner McCreevy, look forward to discussing with you, working with you, to establish this internal market together with Parliament, which is the real representative of the European citizens."
"So, thank you for your collaboration, thanks for this openness and I am sure that my two colleagues - and, indeed, the whole Commission - will, in a very deep way, continue to work together with Parliament."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"I would just remind you that all remarks should be addressed through the Chair."
"It is late at night and there are few of us but it is a small point of protocol."
"But I am sure Mr Lehtinen took on board your remarks."
"Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs. - Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, who seems to be losing his voice like I am."
"It seems to be the case that most colleagues have sore throats in Strasbourg this week."
"I represent the Committee on Legal Affairs, for which I was draftsman of the opinion."
"I would like to say that, first of all, we fully agree with the assessment of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection on the importance of the services sector for the development of the European Union."
"It would be an absolute kamikaze mission for the European Union and the competitiveness targets if we do not let the services sector flourish and allow the internal market to be completed in this respect."
"I really think, out of these 11.7 million jobs created over the last eight years in the European Union, almost 100% of the net growth of new jobs in Europe has come from the services sector, and everyday statistics prove this."
"But I have to be - in Finnish, a fakkijuristi - a 'dull lawyer', and bring the Legal Affairs Committee's point of view to this debate."
"First of all, we really share the Commission view that at this point it is maybe too early to have a far-reaching new horizontal tool to solve the liability issues."
"We have already pending several legislative initiatives, which are all aimed at ensuring legal certainty, such as Rome I, Rome II and also the Green Paper on the Review of the Consumer Acquis."
"Also, I would like to say that Article 5 of the contractual obligations (Rome I) proposal is essential in order to determine whether the consumer protection legislation of the country of origin or of the country of the client applies."
"This is especially important for smaller Member States, where we might lack a supply of new services if Article 5 is not correctly solved."
"We also regret the present mix of legislative instruments."
"Sometimes it is not very clear which legal regime is applicable to each aspect of the activities of the services sector: whether they have to obey the civil law of the host or home country or the regulatory regime of the host or home country."
"It is necessary that we also get some case-law from the European Court of Justice on these issues."
"Also I would like to stress that cross-border services are provided in many different ways."
"Some of them sell online, some travel to another country for services, and sometimes the service provider visits the customer's home country."
"I think that the internal market for services, the legal framework which is based on the country of origin principle, depends on the relevant measures being clear both from the legal and practical perspective, and maybe it is too early now to really do something."
"As the Commissioner rightly said, now it is time to implement all the good work we have done during recent years."
"If colleagues want to place something on the record, they can always do so in writing during the course of the voting procedure."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, I speak on behalf of my friend and former colleague in this Parliament, Mr Konstantinos Hatzidakis, who, as Mr Lehtinen says, has been elevated swiftly to the position of Minister of Transport in the Greek Government."
"I want to pay tribute to him for the work he has done on the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection."
"I am essentially picking up the work where he left off, right at the conclusion."
"I want to thank Mr Lehtinen because it has not been recorded so far that this is his first report, I think, as a rapporteur."
"Some of you may know that he is a distinguished author in his own right, though I think this is probably not his best work."
"I do not think he will mind me saying that."
"I have a copy of his book Blood, Sweat and Bears, which he gave me to read, and I think he has put a bit of blood and sweat into this."
"It is an important report, but I have to say, from our side, we agree very much with the line that Ms Kauppi and Commissioner Reding have taken."
"There is some useful material in here but I just want to reassure the Commissioner that, if she reads Article 22, which in my view is a masterpiece of compromise drafting, where it calls upon the Commission to continue work and to submit a work programme for an assessment, you will be pleased to hear it does not actually ask you to produce a horizontal instrument but to do a work programme to assess whether we need one."
"You already confirmed, I think, what many of us feel - that with all the work that is currently going on to implement the Services Directive, the Green Paper on the consumer acquis, which we have just considered and which will result in a horizontal instrument in that area plus the other work that is going on - which my colleague from the Committee on Legal Affairs, Ms Kauppi, and I know Ms Wallis will cover later - I think it is much too early to contemplate any further detailed provisions at this stage."
"It is absolutely clear that we do need to monitor this, but of course within the Services Directive itself, with all the work we put in it, there are a very substantial number of provisions."
"One of the amendments that we hope the House will agree to delete tomorrow does actually call upon the Commission to draw up voluntary codes of conduct."
"In my view that is not the Commission's role."
"I think we will have support to delete that."
"But in fact, if you look at the Services Directive, in Article 37 it actually says quite clearly that Member States, in cooperation with the Commission, shall take measures to encourage codes of conduct to be drawn up at Community level."
"It is not as if we did not already have that."
"So I think that we will take that out, so my summary of it is this: I think that this is a very useful contribution to the debate."
"I think it will add to the corpus of information that we are building up to ensure, above all, that the Services Directive is fully implemented and is implemented on time, with all the accompanying provisions - particularly the issues like the single point of contact for service providers, which will give them the sort of requirements and information that they need to provide services plus, we hope, the sort of work on codes of conduct."
"With those, I think we can look forward to a really effective and thriving services market that works to the benefit of consumers."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (SV) Mr President, let me first thank my colleague Mr Lehtinen for a very good piece of work."
"With the adoption of the Services Directive, the internal market for services has clearer rules on the way freedom to provide services can be used."
"On the other hand, there is a lack of clear rules on the obligations of service providers."
"This means that, even after the Services Directive has been implemented in all Member States by 2009, we may be left with an open market in which consumers do not have confidence."
"Only 6% of consumers made cross-border purchases on the internet in 2006."
"The rules for goods purchases are much better established."
"Businesses, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, also need clearer rules since they often choose not to provide a service or make a sale across borders, which leads to reduced competition and higher prices for the consumer."
"Clear rules will encourage both businesses and consumers to venture across a border and provide or purchase services in another country with peace of mind."
"We must ensure that consumers have a well-founded sense of security when shopping on the internal market and that, even when they end up in dispute, they can easily get help and redress."
"For this to be achieved, many different measures must come together."
"Some examples which are mentioned in the report are voluntary codes of conduct for service providers and the possibility of collective action on a cross-border basis against fraudsters or businesses which do not honour their commitments to consumers."
"It is not reasonable for consumers to get less protection when they purchase a service across a border than when they buy goods from another Member State."
"Hence the broad horizontal instrument which the report proposes is another important element in the consumer protection we want to develop in the provision of cross-border services."
"Consumers must know their rights when a service is provided too late or in an incorrect manner."
"If freedoms are complemented by clear obligations on suppliers and strong consumer protection, we can strengthen consumer confidence."
"Once again, our consumers must be given priority."
"Without contented and secure consumers we shall not have a flourishing internal market."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, this is, of course, unfinished business from the Services Directive, and, although I agree with much of the Commissioner's analysis, we do have a problem."
"We have a problem of confidence."
"It is a bit like the Northern Rock bank in the UK over the past few weeks."
"Whatever it said, the customers were still queuing outside, wanting their money back."
"It is a bit like that with us and cross-border services."
"Whatever we say, consumers still are not confident enough to use those services."
"We have to find a way of addressing that."
"Those in this House that sat on the Temporary Committee of Inquiry into the Crisis of the Equitable Life Assurance Society also saw only too clearly that there is this problem of confidence."
"But we will not be able to address that by going back to old proposals that dealt with problems perceived some 20 years ago."
"We have got to deal with the problems and situation that we have now."
"What we are basically dealing with, in looking at service providers' obligations, is looking at basic contract law and basic contractual obligations."
"In this regard, we currently have on the table Rome I, which Ms Kauppi has referred to; if we get that right, it will help."
"We also have the whole review of the consumer acquis; if we get that right, it will help."
"We have the preparation of the Common Frame of Reference on contract law; if we use that, and if the Commission puts a great deal more effort into getting the Member States to take it up, that would also help."
"So there is much that can already be used to help us get right the relationship between private international law and regulation."
"What we do not need - I agree with Mr Harbour - is the Commission writing soft law codes of conduct."
"Let us use what is already being done at the moment and what is in preparation."
"We can keep a weather eye on whether or not we need yet another horizontal instrument, but, at this stage, I really doubt it."
"What we also need to address is the possibility of giving our consumers the right to cross-border access to justice where they can act together as a group."
"This would be a balancing of arms against providers."
"It would make good the current lack of cross-border access to justice, which we saw all too clearly with Equitable Life."
"People do not like to use the words 'class actions', and neither do I, but a European right of collective redress might help give us the confidence for consumers that is currently lacking on this continent."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, the development of the Union's internal market is very significant in terms of forging links between the countries and citizens of the Union."
"Increasing cross-border exchange of services on a competitive basis requires an increase in mutual trust, which should be supported by a consumer-friendly policy."
"This policy aims to improve the legal framework for cross-border services whilst also simplifying procedures, which will increase competition."
"It will also improve access to services and raise their standard whilst reducing costs, thus benefiting European consumers."
"The report contributes to improving this policy by indicating a range of issues impeding the dynamic development of the market."
"These include the lack of a single system regulating the obligations of cross-border service providers and the need to supplement Union documents in this regard."
"The report also highlights the lack of clarity in implementing provisions resulting in mental barriers concerning foreign suppliers, the poorer legal protection for service users than for service providers, the failure to regulate public and private services under the same provisions, the diversity of provisions concerning the obligations of cross-border service providers, and the lack of the necessary transparency for the protection of these services."
"Consideration should be given to the introduction of quality certificates for service providers in order to improve the recipients' confidence."
"The conclusions and proposals emerging from the report coincide with the findings of the Committee on Legal Affairs."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur for a business-like report."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I would also like to thank the rapporteur, although sadly I have not yet had the pleasure of reading one of his books."
"However, I have made a note of it and will make good the omission at the next opportunity."
"Many thanks for the good cooperation, and many thanks, too, for your efforts to address important issues in your report."
"Admittedly, legal frameworks are already in place for services in the internal market, such as the Services Directive or the Directive on the recognition of professional qualifications, but the implementation of these Directives - both of them - sadly still leaves a lot to be desired."
"I therefore think it is regrettable that the Council is not present this evening, as we could have made it clear once again that we expect both Directives to be implemented by the deadline and the work in the Member States to be pursued accordingly."
"However, we also need more initiatives - as the rapporteur has rightly pointed out - to increase consumer confidence in cross-border services in the internal market."
"Here, too, previous reports have addressed important issues."
"In her report, Mrs Roithová has pointed out that there are still very many deficits in relation to Internet sales in particular, and that consumers still lack the requisite confidence in cross-border services here."
"Similarly, Mr Lehtinen, in his report, draws attention to the obligations of service providers and to the issue of legal protection for consumers."
"I would like to come back to a topic which has already been mentioned by two previous speakers today, namely the right of collective redress in cross-border cases."
"We urgently need initiatives in this direction, so that consumers have confidence in cross-border services, and that can only be achieved by strengthening their legal position."
"In my view, both reports - the Roithová report and the Lehtinen report - give important indications of the deficits that still exist."
"The Commission should take both these reports seriously in its work to genuinely overhaul, modernise and update the consumer acquis."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (DA) Mr President, we have adopted a Services Directive through which we have handed over to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg the power to decide what we have decided!"
"We do not yet know if the Member States' agreements are to be respected."
"We do not know the extent to which the establishment of national quality requirements will be permitted."
"We do not know whether it is lawful for the Member States to decide which services they would like to have under private or public control."
"The report is therefore just as unclear as the legal situation."
"We are waiting to hear from the judges in Luxembourg whether we can retain our hospitals and a long list of other core services that together constitute our welfare state."
"In Denmark all citizens have social rights, which we finance through high taxes that only 7% of Danes would like to see reduced."
"It would seem that this 7% will be rewarded by the judges in Luxembourg, but what about the majority?"
"Who will safeguard the decisions and our democracy?"
"We also have a flexicurity system, which is based upon voluntary agreements between parties within the labour market."
"How can they be protected?"
"It is the nerve centre of the Danish social model that is being threatened by the uncertainties and judicial activism of the Services Directive."
"The June Movement would very much like to contribute towards the creation of clear rules for a common market for all services that are suitable for the market, but we do not want to prevent the Member States from also having a democracy to set limits on what should be decided by the electorate and what should be decided by the capitalists."
"on behalf of the ITS group. - (RO) Mr. President, the free movement of services is, as we know, one of the four fundamental freedoms decisively determining the functionality and efficiency of the single market, an important element of the first pillar at the basis of the European Union construction."
"This is one of the reasons why I believe that an analysis of the progress in achieving this single market instrument is both important and necessary."
"It is important because the consistent economic and social development of the European Union equally depends on the area of services, the 70% weight of services in the Union's GDP being significant in this regard."
"It is necessary because the volume of cross-border trade in services is very low as compared to the trade in goods, a situation that also generates the lack of confidence of European Union citizens in the consumption of such products."
"Based upon these arguments, I support and I will vote for the approval of the report."
"Nevertheless, I consider that, in relation to the pertinent and, at the same time, valuable solutions proposed by the Rapporteur, a more substantial analysis would have been required regarding the situation of some newly acceded countries, such as Romania, whose markets are far less developed than those of most of the other Member States of the Union."
"From this perspective, I believe that the report should also have contained a set of objectives for leveling the degrees of national markets development, a condition required for the development of the single market and, consequently, of the segment of border services."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would of course like to thank the rapporteur as well."
"The discussions in advance of this report were always very fruitful and interesting."
"Much of what came out of these discussions has been incorporated into the report, although not everything, which is unfortunate, at least from my point of view, as the report emphasises in some places that the completion of the internal market for services in the European Union is trailing far behind the internal market for goods."
"From my perspective, there is actually no real scientific or indeed objective evidence of that, given that we have not only the Services Directive but also the Directive on the recognition of professional qualifications as well as other Directives in the services sector."
"Secondly, the services sector in the internal market is far more heterogeneous than goods."
"It ranges from subordinate services to medical or legal services and finally large-scale services such as major banking and insurance services."
"Lumping all these services together, which is what repeatedly happens in this House, is risky, in my view."
"I believe - and a number of previous speakers have already pointed this out - that a differentiated approach would certainly be useful."
"The third point which has been raised repeatedly, namely collective redress, is unlikely to become more relevant simply by being the frequent subject of discussion."
"I think what we can say, clearly and unequivocally, is that Parliament expects the Commission to undertake a study to review which of the diverse models that already exist in Europe would genuinely be best for the European Union."
"I think that is all that needs to be said on this subject."
"The liability systems in the individual Member States - and this is my fourth point - are still highly diverse."
"That is why we need a unified system of obligations for service providers."
"Clarifying the legal system governing these obligations will generate more competition and create more choice for the consumer, but I believe - as some of the previous speakers have said - that it would be wrong to ask the Commission to produce a horizontal instrument at this stage."
"In any case, I am very sceptical about the creation of this type of liability law at European level."
"(PL) I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report, which highlights many problems consumers encounter on the internal market."
"This report rightly draws attention to the lack of legal clarity and certainty regarding safety and the quality of services. It also refers to the general lack of confidence in cross-border consumption felt by European consumers."
"This is confirmed by the statistics. In 2006 only 6% of European consumers made cross-border purchases over the Internet."
"This situation has a negative impact on competition and on the activities of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"It also contributes to the expansion of illegal trade."
"Dishonest entities often exploit the differences between the legal systems within the European Union to defraud people."
"Swift action is called for once such situations have been identified, hence our response."
"I would like to remind the House of the many months of work devoted to the Services Directive, that is to say, to a review of consumer legislation. As Members will be aware, the Services Directive must be implemented in all Member States by December 2009."
"A substantial proportion of the problems referred to by the rapporteur will certainly cease to exist after the transposition period."
"It should be borne in mind that the Services Directive will significantly improve consumers' rights. Thanks to this Directive, service providers will have to offer consumers better information regarding the services proposed."
"This will enable consumers to make better and more informed choices. Consumers will also be more effectively protected by the relevant institutions."
"The Services Directive also imposes a series of clear obligations on the service provider, including ones related to conflict resolution."
"I believe there is no need to introduce further legal instruments until the provisions of the Services Directive enter into force."
"In my view, it is premature to call on the Commission to present a horizontal instrument."
"The same applies to the entire review of consumer legislation."
"The Commission has already presented a Green Paper on consumer legislation and will in due course present legislative proposals in that regard."
"Ladies and gentlemen, there are times when more legislation does not mean better legislation."
"We would do well to keep that in mind."
"(SK) The Service Directive, which is to be transposed into national law in all the Member States by 28 December 2009, will have a significant effect on cross-border services."
"This Directive and even the Green Paper on the Review of the Consumer Acquis do not lay down the fundamental obligations of service providers and therefore I welcome the report by Mr Lehtinen on this issue."
"The report seeks to ensure that not only consumers but also small and medium-sized businesses buying and selling cross-border services can benefit from additional legal certainty, simplicity and reduced costs."
"I believe that European standardisation is key to the success of craft, small and medium-sized enterprises and the introduction of European standards at European Union level is thus a means of supporting the safety of services and guaranteeing consumer rights with regard to cross-border services provided by Member States."
"Where consumers feel uncertain about the safety and quality of services, they tend to build up psychological barriers towards foreign suppliers, which dissuade them from using cross-border services."
"If a consumer has a negative experience, that experience will often wrongly have repercussions on all foreign service providers."
"Consumers have an opportunity to resolve problems arising predominantly as a result of the different procedures in force in the individual Member States within the European Consumer Centres Network, ECC-Net, and the cross-border Consumer Complaints Network for Financial Services, FIN-NET."
"Where a consumer has enough information about his internal market rights but attempts to exercise them in vain in another EU Member State, he can seek help from SOLVIT."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the fact that this report focuses primarily on consumers since they, in particular, are a fundamental and important element of the internal market."
"Our common objective must therefore be to create the conditions for consumers that allow them to have the same confidence when making a purchase in another country as they have when doing so at home."
"(CS) Mr President, although the EC Treaty guarantees its citizens free access to services beyond their national borders, only a handful of service providers and consumers make use of this advantage of the common market."
"A low level of competition thus makes services in the border regions more expensive and not always easily accessible, compared with services within a country."
"Surveys show that the problem lies not in language barriers but in legislation."
"It is not always clear when to apply the legislation of the country of origin and when to apply national legislation."
"Unfortunately, thanks to the opponents of the country of origin principle, we lost out on the opportunity to provide a better definition in the Services Directive."
"Here in Strasbourg this report is also accompanied by an irrational fear of mentioning the country of origin principle, notwithstanding the fact that in many professions service providers do not have to know the neighbouring country's legislation in order to provide cross-border services."
"Soon we will see case-law that will end the disputes about when the issue of consumer protection is governed by national legislation or the legislation of the host country."
"I consider Mr Lehtinen's report to be an excellent contribution in this respect because, in my opinion, our definition of providers' general obligations should be based on agreed European standards."
"I agree that when it comes to consumer protection, the same obligations should apply to the providers of private and public services."
"I also support the financing of communication networks between Member States."
"This will lead to effective control and to progress in solving disputes out of court."
"Commissioner, we owe the European citizens a lot when it comes to the conditions governing the free movement of cross-border services."
"This report settles one part of this debt."
"The European Parliament gives the Commission the political support to clearly define providers' obligations regardless of their origin."
"Mr Lehtinen's report is testament to the excellent work of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I have been listening very carefully to the discussion on Parliament's report on the obligations of cross-border service providers."
"I would like to thank the honourable Members for their comments."
"Now allow me to stress a few key points."
"First, the Commission supports the aim of the report on which Parliament will vote tomorrow."
"We are indeed concerned with the lack of consumer confidence in the internal market for services."
"Let me stress that, as Commissioner for the Information Society, this lack of confidence in internet business is very important indeed and we will have to have a look at that."
"Second, as I mentioned earlier, the Commission has already undertaken a number of initiatives which aim to remedy the current situation."
"I have quoted the Services Directive and the review of the consumer acquis."
"The latter, by the way, is one of the key priorities of my colleague Commissioner Kuneva."
"I would like to say that we are very grateful for the support of Parliament and we would like to encourage Parliament to continue to contribute to the review process, and we would like, together with Parliament, to be able to deliver results as soon as possible."
"What are we going to propose in a concrete way for the coming weeks and months?"
"First a summary of the responses to the consultation will be published on the Commission's website at the beginning of October."
"Then there will be an impact assessment carried out with a view to a possible Commission proposal in the second half of 2008."
"The Members having had a look at this problem carefully will certainly be interested in this."
"Third, the Commission agrees on the need to promote the safety aspects of services because it is very important to better ensure the health and the physical safety aspects of services provided within the internal market."
"With the Member States, we will draw attention to possible shortcomings in national systems, or necessary enforcement of the assessment."
"We will promote consumer education and awareness-raising initiatives."
"We will facilitate access to existing information on accidents and injuries related to the safety of services offered to consumers, and one of the very important elements which has been stressed by several Members relates to collective redress."
"The Commission is carrying out studies and concerting stakeholders in order to assess the opportunity of an initiative in this area but one thing is certain, and I would like to underline it - this will not be a US-type class action."
"Finally, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his work and Parliament for the importance it attaches to this issue."
"We are sure the parliamentary report will be instrumental for our future work in the interests of the consumers."
"Thank you very much indeed, Commissioner, for an interesting debate, in which more than 50% of the speakers were women, which is just as it should be."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 27 September 2007."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (PL)"
"I should like to thank Mr Lehtinen for a well-prepared report."
"The freedom to provide services is one of the four fundamental freedoms of the internal market."
"Over the years, the services sector has become increasingly important for the economic and social development of the European Union and has undergone substantial change."
"Despite the provisions of the Treaty establishing the European Community and the ongoing process of transposition of the Services Directive into national law, in practice the free movement of services continues to be hampered by administrative provisions and differences between the legal systems of Member States."
"Bearing in mind the threats and challenges stemming from globalisation, together with the shortcomings in the services sector identified in the report, it is particularly important to take action aimed at eliminating obstacles to the supply of cross-border services."
"Lack of confidence on the part of consumers and the reluctance of companies to operate outside their home country limit access to the internal market."
"As a matter of urgency, the Community should introduce mechanisms making it easier for companies, especially SMEs, to benefit from the internal market."
"Community provisions on the supply of cross-border services should therefore be rationalised, and a minimum period for the harmonisation of quality standards introduced, so as to protect users' interests."
"Strengthening cooperation between Member States, limiting administrative procedures and appropriate control of cross-border services will promote an increase of cross-border activity."
"Harmonisation of quality standards will strengthen consumer and supplier confidence in cross-border services."
"Facilitating the provision of cross-border services will lead to a properly functioning single market for services, thus laying the foundations for an economically cohesive internal market."
"i2010: Digital libraries (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Marie-Hélène Descamps, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on i2010: Digital libraries."
"Once again, more than 50 per cent of the speakers in this debate are women, the first of which is Marie-Hélène Descamps, the rapporteur."
"rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the idea of a European digital library originated from six EU Heads of State and Government who wanted to allow universal access to the European cultural heritage and to preserve it for future generations."
"This federal project for Europe will strengthen the expression of a true European identity and help spread our cultural and linguistic diversity across the world."
"The project, which is without precedent for Europe, combines the past with the present and links the cultural with the digital dimension."
"It is the perfect response to the various issues now affecting our fellow citizens in the form of new information and communication technologies."
"The Internet, which is the third favourite medium of Europe's young people, is in effect one of the main means of access to knowledge and learning."
"While some real progress has been made, the digitisation of our cultural resources and their bringing online nevertheless remains very fragmented and relies on the various mechanisms that have been put in place by the Member States."
"If they are to be effective and reach the greatest number of people the initiatives for promoting and disseminating our cultural heritage need to be well coordinated."
"This is the intended objective of the European digital library, which the Commission is supporting through its beacon initiative 'i2010 digital libraries'."
"The first part of this initiative, namely the communication of 30 September 2005, was based on three main aspects: digitisation, online access and preservation of digital content."
"The Commission has set out to analyse the main technical, legal, organisational and financial challenges that a project of this scale would pose."
"At the same time, an online public consultation has been launched and a high-level expert group has been set up."
"On the basis of these different elements the Commission adopted a recommendation on digitisation, online access and digital preservation on 24 August 2006, in which it calls on the Member States to accelerate the pace of digitisation and to coordinate their efforts in order to achieve real synergy."
"On 13 November 2006 the Council adopted these recommendations unanimously."
"It is now up to the European Parliament to send a strong signal so that this exceptional project can become a reality."
"This undertaking is such that we need to proceed in stages."
"While working on the conceptual and technical organisation of all categories of cultural material, we therefore have to concentrate initially on the potential provided by the out-of-copyright text material held in libraries and to do this via a single, direct and multilingual access point."
"Our libraries offer the advantage of already being coordinated at European level through the TEL, the European library that was set up in 2005 by the national libraries, which holds a large stock of digital works that are in the public domain and therefore can be used immediately."
"As a second stage, and in order to promote the success of this tool, the library must also provide access to works of a more contemporary nature in addition to those documents that are in the public domain."
"Any decision in this area will inevitably have to be taken in consultation with all the parties involved."
"Indeed, the protection of copyright and other creative rights is vital for maintaining and protecting creativity in Europe."
"If this project is to achieve the success that is expected it will have to be based on a coherent economic model."
"The report therefore proposes, with the agreement of the copyright holders, that in the European digital library users should be able to browse the Internet to find any kind of digital documents, whatever their status, and to consult works in the public domain freely and in their entirety, whereas only short extracts would be accessible for copyright works."
"Beyond that, users wishing to scan through a certain work or access a protected document in its entirety would be directed to private sites specialising in secure digital dissemination, where a number of options would be open to them in return for payment of a fair remuneration to the copyright holders."
"Moreover, such a library needs to be organised so that it can provide access to content that is reliable and of a quality that is intended for all ages."
"To this effect the report calls for a steering committee to be set up in which the cultural institutions would play a major role."
"This committee would determine the priorities for, and the guidelines of, the European digital library, while ensuring the coordination, management and monitoring of its activities."
"Finally, in order to provide access to all European cultures, the other cultural institutions and sectors, including archives, museums, cinema, audiovisual arts and universities, have to be involved at each stage of the project."
"In this way we will shape the face of a Europe that is unified in diversity."
"I would like to conclude by thanking all my colleagues in the Committee on Culture and Education, especially Mr Weber and Mr Graça Moura, for their support and contribution to this report."
"I also wish to thank the Commission for having cooperated so effectively throughout the preparation of this document."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, this is a great report and Ms Descamps has done excellent work, together with her colleagues in the Committee."
"The digital libraries initiative is an example of how Europe can contribute, through concrete projects, not only to economic growth but also to quality of life."
"By bringing Europe's cultural and scientific heritage online, we can disseminate it through into different cultures."
"By using modern technologies, we can break down the walls which exist today."
"I am very happy that this initiative, taken by the national libraries of our Member States and developed by the European Commission for so many years, has been highlighted and supported by EU political forces at the highest level."
"They are right to do so; our Heads of State and Government are right to support this initiative, because there is real wealth in our libraries, our archives and our museums."
"It is not only books, but also newspapers, archive records and films."
"This is a multilingual wealth, a multicultural wealth."
"Knowing that less than 1% of this wealth is digitalised, we know what is in front of us and what kind of work we have to do."
"That work is necessary for two reasons."
"The first is to overcome barriers and to get people to study, work and enjoy these works from their own culture and works from our common European history, and then to allow these elements of our cultural institutions to be reused for added-value services and products."
"That is where industry comes in."
"That is the reason why the goal of the Commission's initiative is to achieve a common, multilingual access point to Europe's digitalised cultural heritage."
"We cannot do this alone."
"It requires collaboration between different types of cultural institutions, from all European countries."
"I am very glad to see that this is taking shape and is being formalised through the creation of a legal body that will increase the capacity of the European digital library to act."
"This common access point will be launched in 2008."
"In the years thereafter the content will be gradually expanded as more libraries, more archives and more audiovisual archives and museums contribute their digitalised collections."
"I am very glad, also, that the report by Parliament tackles not only the outcome but also the prerequisites for achieving that outcome."
"This means improving the general conditions for getting our cultural heritage online as an integral part of the digital libraries initiatives, and the need for Member States to intensify their digitalisation efforts."
"I would say very clearly that it is not enough to have a big cultural event where all the Heads of Government make beautiful speeches and then go back to their countries and cut budgets."
"That cannot be!"
"We need words to be followed by deeds."
"I want Parliament to move ahead and help us make this very beautiful project a reality."
"We have the high level group on digital libraries, which I chair and which is forging ahead on this matter."
"We are also very conscious that the preservation of digital material will be one of the essential questions of the future, and I am therefore glad that the Council has endorsed the Commission approach to the European digital library and that Parliament is now helping us move in the same direction and is putting its political weight behind this objective."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, I must warmly congratulate Mrs Descamps on her brilliant report."
"It is a document that will make an extremely important contribution to the issue of the relationship between digital technology and cultural heritage."
"It calls for a coordination of efforts between national institutions, particularly libraries, and in the future, other cultural institutions."
"It starts in a practical manner with works that are already in the public domain."
"It proposes the effective use of synergies and the exchange of good practices between those involved in the process at all levels."
"It calls on Member States to promote the project and to find ways of avoiding duplication of efforts in digitising holdings."
"It calls for coordination of all these efforts."
"The Descamps report will be a highlight of this legislature in terms of the relationship between cutting-edge technology and European culture through the ages."
"When we talk about European culture, we are also talking about universal culture."
"This is not only because European cultural heritage deserves this qualification, but also because the intrinsic cultural diversity of Europe forms a completely open system which will of course have positive consequences as the project advances."
"It is also a project that has evolved."
"It started as a 'chauvinistic' fallacy in competition with Google, but has been reformulated, following various changes, in more sensible, realistic and productive terms."
"It is no longer what the Financial Times previously called 'a blatant case of misguided and unnecessary nationalism'."
"The European digital library is different from other solutions because it is a European Union project, because it aims to reach out to all libraries, because it is intended to be based on existing initiatives and because it aims to cover all categories of European cultural heritage, without being confined to printed material."
"There are certainly still a number of problems: finding funding partners in the private sector; avoiding, as far as possible, different rates of digitisation between Member States; solving certain technical aspects relating to the coordination of access to digitised works; preserving digitised content; resolving the issue of the integrated search engine for meta-information in image documents and for direct searching of text documents; finding content interoperability solutions, and enabling multilingual searching by subject or keyword in addition to the current situation of searching by author or title."
"We also cannot forget that the exchange of experiences between institutions will be essential, particularly with American institutions, and also that a strong research and development component will be crucial to the project producing good results."
"In this context, by voting in favour of the Descamps report, this Chamber will take a positive step towards the future, whether the majority is made up of women or whether it reasonably consists of a percentage of women and another percentage of men, Mr President."
"Ah, but the women are very happy you are a man!"
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, 2010 is just round the corner."
"Given that the title of the report is 'i2010: towards a European digital library', that means that we still have a great deal of work to do and in my view, we have been dragging our feet."
"I am pleased that Mrs Descamps has presented a very good report, which points the way forward and shows us what can and could be done."
"However, we must all make efforts to get things moving."
"The report is a challenge and a response to the new technologies, the new management of knowledge and information, and above all, young people's access to learning, information and knowledge."
"We have a lot of catching up to do here and, as far as I am concerned, we really have to speed things up."
"It is not only about preserving and safeguarding cultural heritage. Every day, new things arise that we must add to the equation, for things that were invented and written down only yesterday will be our cultural heritage tomorrow."
"That means that we have a great deal of ground to make up."
"However, we must always look ahead at the same time, to be able to keep pace with developments."
"It will be very important to coordinate the process and urge countries - as has just been said - to put national sensitivities behind them and to move forward together along a European path to safeguard cultural diversity. There are hurdles to overcome."
"The first is the financial shortfall that we face."
"The Commissioner was right to talk about this."
"All the ministers and presidents are very good at giving big speeches and are proud of our cultural diversity, but when it comes to funding and implementation, they quickly pull back and forget all about the pride that they have been propounding."
"From my perspective, it is also very important to safeguard copyright, so there needs to be an agreement with the authors and publishers and everyone else involved, so that for an appropriate fee the information can be put on the Internet for people to access."
"I think that we have a lot to think about here."
"It is certainly no easy task, but the proposals are on the table and the countries could gain a lot."
"I am convinced that we can achieve a positive vote on this report tomorrow."
"In my view, we must use the new technologies and support this project in order not only to facilitate access for us as Europeans but also to carry our culture far out into the world."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (LT) Ladies and gentlemen, as has been stated in the Commission's initial document, a European digital library would be based on Europe's rich heritage combining multicultural and multilingual environments with technological advances and new business models."
"In the context of integration, this is a fine and welcome objective, an ambitious goal."
"However, besides reaching these ideal objectives we have to remain realistic and stay very attentive, prepared to meet the challenges that are inevitable during this process."
"The main problems related to the creation of digital libraries are universal, though they are described in different ways."
"Technical infrastructure, the creation of digitised resources, digitisation, the identification of copyright, content preservation and the preservation of documents are issues requiring developmental and essential decisions."
"The potential to provide virtual services and projects for their implementation are relevant for libraries of all types."
"However, it is obvious that digital materials, such as textual, visual and audio information, extend the traditional functions of libraries by adding different content."
"For example, access to information stored in a traditional library is determined by its working times which are usually longer than those of other public institutions."
"If a library is virtual its access is universal, because there is no physical door isolating information from its users."
"Access to information is ensured by the working periods of the server."
"Librarians can use traditional skills and knowledge to design virtual services, but these are not sufficient."
"Digital libraries are a phenomenon of the third millennium and it is therefore necessary to evaluate not only the specific knowledge essential today, but also that which will be necessary in the future, as technologies change."
"It is not so important to have a perfect knowledge of certain technologies, because any flexible and mature employee can attain the skills and experience necessary for his or her job."
"In my country, Lithuania, the long-term preservation of Lithuanian heritage through the use of information technologies has been determined by the adoption of legal acts."
"However, this problem is not being solved by coordinating the activities of the 'memory institutions' (libraries, museums, archives)."
"Neither the citizens of Lithuania nor those of other countries are yet able to use all the services provided by digital libraries."
"I hope that today's decision will accelerate these processes."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, Umberto Eco said that whoever reads books lives twice."
"The report by Mrs Descamps provides a good account of the modern approach to cultural and educational issues."
"I also referred to the matter in my report on the contribution of the future regional policy to the innovative capacity of the European Union."
"Just as Gutenberg's invention marked a turning point in human development at the time, so we can today refer to a cultural revolution brought about by the Internet."
"What is at issue is widespread access to the European, or indeed to the world, treasury of humankind's spiritual and material heritage."
"The latter comprises contemporary creations along with those dating back over the centuries arising out of different cultures and languages."
"Copyright and related rights are certainly an issue in this context."
"I recognise what has already been achieved in this regard in many Member States, including the work of the National Library of Poland."
"I would like to take this opportunity to stress the importance of more extensive broadband access."
"I believe we should find a way of cofinancing digitisation from the Union's resources."
"I shall conclude by referring to Goethe, who said that when he read a good book he felt as if he had made a new friend."
"Just think how many good friends we could make through the European digital library!"
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (ES) Mr President, the Commission has defined three essential axes to exploit the potential of digital technology: online accessibility, digitisation of analogical collections and preservation and storage of digital contents, and we are well aware of this."
"With respect to digitisation, it is common knowledge that the Commission, through a recommendation in August last year, asked the Member States to coordinate their efforts to ensure synergy on a European scale."
"The Council unanimously supported the recommendation, but I wish to take this opportunity - although it is a pity the Council is not in attendance -firstly to inquire of the Commission as to the real progress made by the Member States in this area, and secondly to ascertain whether sufficient consideration has been taken of non-state authorities, which, as we know, are responsible for culture in most decentralised countries."
"With regard to another aspect, online accessibility, as I said, we all agree that there must be a multilingual interface and content must be guaranteed."
"It is a true joy to enter the digital library webpage and see that, apart from the 23 official Community languages, the contents also appear in Icelandic and Serbian."
"Today we are celebrating the European Day of Languages and you, Mrs Reding, made a major contribution to its creation."
"You have also said on countless occasions, Commissioner, and rightly so, that big and small languages do not exist, that all of them form part of Europe's cultural wealth, and thus I would like to be given the chance to see an occasional reference in the digital library, or content rather than a reference, concerning languages such as my own, which are not official in the European Union."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, when the library in Alexandria burned down during Caesar's invasion of Egypt, a substantial part of all the literature written by mankind at that stage disappeared forever."
"In my view, nothing like that will ever happen again, thanks to the existence of digital libraries."
"I welcome the rapporteur's complex approach to the issue."
"I come from the Czech Republic where successful digitisation of the National Library in Prague has been under way for some time."
"Since the states have their own national libraries, it is only logical that the European Union should also have a similar institution, one that makes use of the latest technologies."
"This is not just going through the motions of accomplishing the task of European integration; this is a practical matter."
"More and more books are being published these days."
"This vast amount of literature cannot be concentrated in one place without the help of computer technology."
"This is a mammoth task."
"The plan is that the European digital library will absorb those digital sources that already exist and contain the literary works not affected by copyright."
"Literary works will be joined by technical, legal, journalistic and also audiovisual works."
"Setting up a system that is so universal and yet reasonably simple will be an interesting task for the digital technology experts."
"I am sure the European digital library will eliminate endless cross-referencing and complicated searches in virtual cyberspace and will become an enormous library that we will have, metaphorically speaking, at home."
"Of course there are also the risks."
"Will digital libraries make us even more dependent on computers and threaten the existence of printed books?"
"It may happen although I do not think it too likely."
"A traditional book is an integral part of our culture, just like theatre or art."
"It offers something digital libraries will never be able to provide: first-hand contact with the reader."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, the British Library has roots going back to 1753."
"It contains documents dating as far back as 300 bc."
"Famous people such as Karl Marx, Oscar Wilde, Mahatma Gandhi, Rudyard Kipling, George Orwell, George Bernard Shaw, even Vladimir Lenin, are just some of the figures who have studied in the reading rooms of the British Museum and British libraries."
"I wonder if they would have found so much inspiration from surfing the internet."
"I suspect that our magnificent facility, with its unprecedented collection of publications from every corner of the world and British Empire - and beyond, indeed - will be as treasured long after the EU has gone the way of other Eurofederalist projects from Charlemagne to the awful political nightmares of the last two centuries."
"Good luck, Ms Descamps, with your digital library, but in this area, as in so many others, I would rather concentrate on protecting and preserving and developing a heritage that I am proud of than creating the trappings of a new state out of the ruins of failed ones."
"Mr President, colleagues, first let me emphasise that I welcome the Commission and Ms Descamps' report on digital libraries as a timely and important contribution towards ensuring that digital information is preserved for future generations."
"It is true that the internet has become one of the principal means of access to knowledge and learning."
"Digital libraries would surely benefit many researchers, students, teachers and - as one specific group - people with physical disabilities."
"So this is a perfect initiative in the Year of Equal Opportunities for All."
"I would just like to draw your attention to one aspect that needs to be thoroughly assessed before making decisions."
"Public/private cooperation and private sponsorship for the digitalisation of Europe's cultural heritage is an important element of the system as it now stands."
"We need to make sure that new regulations in this field do not threaten the benefits of the current system, especially on scientific information."
"For example, we have to make sure that the peer review mechanism is safeguarded."
"Peer review is the process by which independent experts in a scientific discipline - the peers - critically assess a scientific paper reporting on research."
"The peer review system is critical for the scientific community as it is an important quality control mechanism and can influence scientific careers."
"We also need to avoid a scenario where open access puts the existing dissemination of scientific research through subscription journals at risk."
"One question to be assessed is also damage to the profitability of journals from small publishing houses."
"In short, the current system is perceived by many stakeholders as easy to access, efficient, cost-effective and also of high quality."
"We have to be sure that the benefits, especially for researchers, will be on the positive side and we must avoid any unintended negative consequences for the very people we are hoping to assist."
"(PL) Mr President, the idea of creating a European digital library, by creating an Internet site where resources would be stored that could then be accessed by any user free of charge is certainly an ambitious one."
"The library would have a multilingual interface facilitating direct access to the desired material."
"Every citizen would be able to access even the least well-known works of world culture in his or her native language."
"It should also be noted that this initiative raises an important issue, namely Internet access and the opportunity to connect with the world's cultural heritage being made available to residents of rural areas, island areas and to those experiencing mobility difficulties."
"Access to all categories of cultural material, including that which is protected by copyright and related rights will be another major problem."
"I trust it will prove possible to resolve it in due course, through investment in technology."
"Mrs Descamps has prepared a well-balanced report. I believe it deserves our support."
"(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to echo the previous speakers who congratulated the rapporteur on her well-prepared report."
"It sends out a clear message from the European Parliament in support of the idea of establishing a European digital library."
"I am pleased to be able to remind the House that Poland was involved in promoting this idea."
"My country was represented amongst the six Heads of State and Government who launched it."
"The report presents convincing arguments in favour of the gradual implementation of this project."
"It suggests progressive inclusion of the various categories of cultural heritage, together with documents protected by copyright and related rights, always complying with legal restrictions in the area of intellectual property."
"The idea contained in the proposal whereby institutions other than libraries that are involved in the dissemination of culture could be included in the project is worthy of consideration."
"It is only right and proper for museums and archives to play an important part in this system too, as they have enjoyed strong links with libraries over the centuries."
"I have high hopes, especially in view of the plan to include in the coordination system for the European digital library not only scientific research on digitisation but also the very important issue of the protection of digital resources."
"I believe that in this way it will prove possible to develop common unified requirements regarding the proper storage of digital materials collected in libraries and archives, and also digital materials - archived, I must stress -collected elsewhere than in archives, in other words in museums and libraries."
"It is well known that for centuries these institutions have experienced difficulties in properly protecting archive material received from different sources."
"We are at last in a position to remedy the situation."
"Member of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to Mrs Descamps and the other members of the Committee on Culture and Education for having produced this report, because it is a very important one indeed."
"You see, Europe's true wealth is to be found not in the euro or in our economic development: it is in our heritage, a heritage that across the centuries has been created and built up; that is what constitutes the real and profound source of Europe's riches."
"Now in a certain sense the scandal is that this heritage is disappearing into archives and vaults, into places where the public, the citizens of Europe, cannot go, where they cannot touch it, where they cannot understand it, where they cannot enjoy it."
"The precise aim of the digital library is to break down these barriers."
"I believe that this is one of the great advances that Europe has made and I would like to pay homage to the national libraries, to our national libraries, because they were there at the launch of this initiative, which has been so valid and so important for European cultures."
"The directors of these libraries have been true pioneers."
"They understood that symbiosis was involved, the symbiosis between culture, which is richness of the corpus, and technology, which is an instrument that provides access to this culture, and the fact that they undertook this pioneering work essentially means that in 2008 we now have the single multilingual access point."
"And yes, yes, yes I say to those who brought up the point, it will even give us access to the literature of Luxembourg."
"I am proud of this because Luxembourgish is my mother tongue and therefore for me it is the most important language in the world, just as every mother tongue is important."
"This is precisely why the works of art and literature that have been created in all these languages, and the special manner in which these are expressed, are what we need to be able to access."
"Take the culture of Luxembourg: of course the people of Luxembourg have access to it, but do you in this House know that there is a such a thing as the culture of Luxembourg?"
"No!"
"However, once we have the digital library the common access point will enable you to understand that there really is one."
"It is extraordinary that we can have access to these cultures, that we can share this wealth all around us, including - and I would emphasise the fact - outside Europe, because culture does not stop at our borders."
"Culture means sharing and therefore it is in a spirit of openness that we wish to create this library, for interoperability will be a very important aspect, and this will apply not just to the books but also to all the other forms of culture: films, music, museum collections and so on."
"We are therefore witnessing an extraordinary cultural opening-up that is both multilingual and multicultural, something that will truly show the very essence of Europe itself, which is this unified diversity."
"Of course there are problems to resolve and the honourable Members have been quite clear on this."
"There is the problem of financing, for one."
"I would therefore appeal to the Member States to ensure that the discussions are followed by effective action."
"Some have already done so and I would like to thank them for this."
"In 2008 we shall be presenting an analysis of what has been achieved and also, therefore, of what has not been achieved."
"I believe that this will be very important for moving the whole venture forward."
"Of course we are also going to recommend the private-public partnership, because that will be essential for the progress of digitisation, which is a very expensive business."
"I am also thinking about the preservation of fragile material that can be destroyed if it is not taken care of."
"How many reels of film are allowed to go to dust?"
"If we are to preserve this common cultural heritage then we simply have to digitise it before it is too late."
"I am also naturally thinking of other problems that need to be resolved, namely those relating to copyright - which is a real headache - and to scientific information."
"Our high-level group is currently working on solutions to these issues."
"Mr President, what we have here is an extraordinary project that shows what European value added really is, and I believe that the greatest thing is to unite Europeans around their cultures plural, around their respective histories plural, which are things of beauty and which have been developed through creativity."
"This really is the best of what we have."
"Let us preserve it and let us work together so that we can share it."
"I would like to thank all the speakers very much, and especially Commissioner Reding for her charm and intelligence."
"I would like to thank her in own language, Luxembourgish, because today is Lesser Known Languages Day."
"Merci!"
"(Laughter)"
"Efficiency and equity in European education and training systems (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Tomáš Zatloukal, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on efficiency and equity in European education and training systems."
"rapporteur. - (CS) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is facing a number of connected socioeconomic challenges: the emergence of highly competitive countries, the ageing of the population, migration, a fast-changing labour market structure, and booming information and communication technologies."
"Each one of these factors affects the issue of access to quality education."
"People with low qualifications are increasingly at risk of unemployment and social exclusion."
"Fair systems guarantee that education and training are independent of socioeconomic background and other factors that place individuals at a disadvantage."
"The challenge is to support the participation of pupils, students and adults from all social groups: the current situation in this regard is particularly unsatisfactory."
"The report I am tabling here in this Parliament urges Member States to take positive measures from the pre-school stage to ensure the social diversity of classes and establishments and run quality educational programmes."
"Skills that are hereditary or acquired at an early age provide the basis for learning in later life."
"The return on investment is highest during this period because the fruit of such investment lasts a lifetime."
"I would like to point out that at the level of primary education premature categorisation of pupils has a detrimental effect."
"Instead, I consider it important to adapt the curriculum so that it suits diverse groups of children and their capabilities within one school."
"On the other hand, differentiation and creating a flexible range of study options is very effective at secondary level."
"As far as vocational training is concerned, I would recommend improving access to tertiary education and developing opportunities for lifelong learning."
"Third-level education is vital to the success of a knowledge-based economy."
"It would benefit from more funding than it receives at present."
"The report states that free university tuition does not necessarily guarantee equity and calls for an analysis of the range of financial incentives and support options that can significantly reduce inequity in terms of access to university education."
"Education has an impact on the economy: it increases human capital and innovative capability and enables technology to be disseminated."
"Each additional year of average school attendance raises productivity in an average EU country selectively by 6.2% and in the long term by a further 3.1%, thanks to its contribution to more rapid technological development."
"Increasing the efficiency of education and training brings both individuals and society as a whole a return on investment of up to 8% a year."
"A further benefit is a reduction in unemployment: in today's EU the average unemployment rate is 12.6% amongst people who have completed primary or secondary education, as against 5% in the case of people who have completed higher education."
"Furthermore, recent research carried out by the Commission has shown that 75 million EU citizens - i.e. 32% of the workforce - have received insufficient education."
"In 2010 only 15% of new jobs will be available for that group of people, most of whom come from socially disadvantaged sectors of society."
"Education and training policies must have a significant positive impact on social and economic results, sustainable development and social cohesion, whereas inefficiency and inequity entail huge costs: loss of tax revenue, unemployment, a greater requirement for healthcare and support from public funds, and also the costs associated with a higher level of anti-social behaviour."
"Education and training are basic factors contributing to long-term European economic growth, to competitiveness and to social cohesion."
"In conclusion, allow me to thank all my colleagues who have worked with me on this report."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I really welcome this initiative of the Parliament to take further the message of our communication, which we adopted on this topic last year."
"I read your report with a lot of interest and I also listened now to Mr Zatloukal, whom I want to congratulate cordially because I think and I feel we are partners on this issue, in this debate and in efforts to improve the situation."
"We could listen now to a description of socioeconomic challenges that we are facing individually, collectively, together, but also of the importance of investment - better investment, more investment - in education and training policies."
"I think that education and training policy lies at the centre of our efforts to create a more prosperous and a more cohesive European society."
"All European education systems are marked by educational inequities that reflect socioeconomic inequalities."
"The paradoxical role of education and training in relation to these inequalities is that they very often contribute to their perpetuation."
"But they are sometimes the only vehicle by which inequalities can be ameliorated."
"Across Europe, the process of modernising education and training systems is largely driven by the search for greater efficiency in terms of cost-effectiveness."
"I think this is really desirable, of course, but it is frequently, and wrongly, assumed that efficiency and equity are mutually exclusive."
"As part of our commitment to helping Member States improve their education and training systems, the Commission's communication showed that efficiency and equity do not have to come at the expense of each other, at the expense of quality."
"Efficiency and equity are, in effect, mutually enforcing."
"I think this is the most important message from the whole communication."
"Your report stresses strongly the need for European education and training systems to be both efficient and equitable if they are to help us to achieve not only economic growth but social cohesion."
"I am especially pleased to see your emphasis on the need to develop efficient and equitable policies for the whole life-long learning continuum and on the need to invest in education early, as investing in quality early-childhood and pre-primary education and care is shown to be the most effective way of breaking the cycle of disadvantage."
"I am also pleased to notice that you confirm our message that early tracking of pupils has detrimental effects on efficiency and equity."
"And, of course, you place a lot of emphasis on the need to develop a culture of evaluation in order to develop effective long-term policies and create policies based on solid evidence."
"Your initiative will bring us closer to the development of life-long learning strategies that foster equality, inclusion, integration, and social cohesion."
"We will take full account of it in our forthcoming initiatives in the field of education and training, especially in the proposal for the 2008 Joint Report on the implementation of our work programme and our reflections for the future, and in the Green Paper on the links between education and migration, in which inequalities will be a central issue."
"We hope to present this communication next spring."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality. - (DE) Madam President, the question is: why are we talking about equality or inequality when more women than men reach a high level of education?"
"What this means is that we have the same educational opportunities and we are utilising them as well, but equality of opportunity is no longer guaranteed after that."
"In training, in the use of their acquired knowledge, women continue to suffer discrimination, which means that there is still no equality in the education and training systems."
"That is why it is essential that we take account of women who are already mothers and are studying, for example, that we demand particularly flexible organisation of studies here, and that we promote and support access for young women, especially from remote regions, and vulnerable groups such as migrant women and women from ethnic minorities, for there are major anomalies and inequalities here."
"This must start at pre-school and school age and then continue all the way through to vocational training."
"If I may, I will continue after a short break."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (HU) Thank you, Madam President."
"I will speak in Hungarian."
"Commissioner, last week, representing the Committee on Culture and Education, I took part in a conference in Lisbon entitled 'Young Voices - Meeting Diversity in Education', organised by the Portuguese Presidency."
"It was a profoundly moving experience to hear young people living with a variety of physical and learning disabilities present their school experiences."
"There was one common feature in their story: every one of them said that they felt that if they were able to participate in school activities alongside their able-bodied peers, they would not be judged according to their disabilities but according to their abilities and personalities."
"Integrating children living with a disability into mainstream education alongside their able-bodied peers is also vital in order to ensure that society accepts them and includes them more easily as adults."
"If children are accustomed from an early age to being around children who have some disability or other, and are accustomed to having to respect them equally and perhaps to helping them, then there is a good chance that they will demonstrate more understanding and more empathy towards disadvantaged people in their adult lives."
"The report we have before us speaks a great deal about integration issues relating to social differences."
"I am convinced that, by analogy to the example I referred to above, it is also important for children who are socially disadvantaged to be able to participate in an inclusive way alongside other children in all the various stages of education."
"To achieve this, two things have to be put in place."
"One is technological progress and removal of barriers."
"From this point of view, central and eastern European Member States are lagging far behind: schools, the school environment, transport facilities, even the hospitals, other institutions, public institutions, for example, are all inaccessible to wheelchair users."
"The other, and this will take longer, is the change in attitude that is needed on the part of decision-makers in order for them to acknowledge that inclusive education is the first crucial stage in the process that leads to social acceptance and integration."
"In conclusion, let me say that sports, too, are an important tool for education and social leverage, because social and societal differences disappear in sports; the only things that matter are talent, determination and application."
"Physical education in schools and sports contribute greatly to strengthening important social values such as solidarity and respect for each other's dignity."
"This is why I consider it important that when this House debates the quality, efficiency and equity of education and training, reference should also be made to the importance of physical education and its quality, efficiency and equity."
"We also need to ensure that inclusive education in this regard plays a major part."
"I congratulate the rapporteur and thank you for your attention."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Madam President, the right to unrestricted education, which means the right of access to education, is enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and yet it is still deficient and has still not been fully realised in practice."
"The considerable disparity in performance between education systems in the EU translates into differences in economic and social development."
"Education systems must be efficient, equitable and, above all, freely accessible."
"Efficiency must be promoted and emphasised from the pre-school level onwards, in schools and also in the vocational training system."
"It is extremely important that higher education should become accustomed to some measure of flexibility in order to respond swiftly to economic and social change, for this is the only way to create competitive advantages."
"Multidimensionality, quality and cooperation with the private sector and the promotion of research and development are essential."
"However, we must not educate people simply to supply the economy with well-qualified workers."
"Education is personally enriching and is the prerequisite for us to be able to live in social cohesion."
"It fosters personal development and self-esteem, and that is at least as important as specialist, vocational and business skills training."
"We need to work towards a situation in which teachers and all their students receive a high-quality education and, above all, have opportunities for advancement and flexible development, for here, we have been travelling down the same track for decades."
"That cannot continue!"
"It would be simplistic to say that education policy should be solely a matter for the Member States."
"This is only partly true."
"A European educational area with a common goal, namely the Lisbon objectives, also needs a common approach to achieve efficiency and equity."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (LT) Ladies and gentlemen, learning is an inseparable part of the European social dimension, because it reveals the significance of solidarity, equal opportunities and social inclusion."
"All citizens must gain the knowledge and skills required of them and continuously update them."
"Moreover, it is necessary to consider the special needs of people who are on the verge of social exclusion."
"The European Union does not regulate the development of national education systems directly, but it does have a significant impact on their development, firstly through the common objectives of the European Union; secondly through the monitoring of set European guidelines and reports on the development of education systems presented by the Member States; and thirdly through the education and training programmes funded by the European Union."
"I welcome the European Commission's recommendation to make investments in human resources a priority for the Structural Funds."
"The European Union has to provide the essential conditions for every Member State seeking to create and develop an effective European education and training system in order to solve the relevant problems."
"For example, one of the biggest problems in Lithuania today is violence in schools."
"To combat this, various prevention programmes have already started to be implemented at national level."
"Another issue is that we are searching for any methods that would help to improve the quality of higher education, seeking to ensure that the level of education provided by universities in our country is equal to that provided by the best universities in Western Europe."
"The Lithuanian education system faces other problems too. One of these is low salaries for teachers in all disciplines, inevitably leading to a lack of teachers."
"We do not have sufficient money to repair sports halls and grounds, and I believe that improving sports infrastructure is important not only for encouraging schoolchildren to enjoy sports, but also for preventing them from taking drugs and alcohol as well as smoking."
"One more very relevant problem is the generation of young emigrants returning home."
"They need extra funding and additional teachers for compensatory studies and special programmes."
"I have mentioned only a few problems that are no doubt also relevant in other new Member States of the European Union."
"I fully agree with the speaker who said that the current situation was unsatisfactory."
"Realistic assessment and active support for different education systems complying with common European goals and standards should be today's objective for the European Union."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, there is a popular saying in Poland according to which if you fail to learn certain things in childhood, you will suffer the consequences for the rest of your life."
"It wisely reminds us that teaching children is the best investment of all."
"The rapporteur is therefore right to suggest increasing the resources allocated to pre-school education, because that is when social integration begins. The latter helps to develop the individual and prepare him or her to carry out their mission in life."
"Integration should be strengthened at a later stage too."
"The rapporteur is also right, therefore, in identifying the problem of classifying individuals and the advisability of only introducing streaming at lower secondary level and of extending the period spent in school-based education."
"It is appropriate too that the draft resolution clearly identifies the need to link policies on vocational education and training with policies on employment, the economy, social integration, improving the competitiveness of higher education and enabling everyone to access it on equal terms."
"The most pressing reason for us to adopt these arrangements for education is the fact that 75 million European Union citizens, that is to say, 32% of the workforce, is inadequately educated. This has serious implications for the effectiveness of their work, the performance of our economies and the social situation."
"Change is needed."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, an equitable and efficient system should guarantee access to education for everyone."
"The rapporteur states that we need an improvement in pre-school education, which is when people form their habits and skills needed for later learning."
"He asks the Member States to increase funding for pre-school education."
"However, what is the reality?"
"In almost all EU countries pre-school facilities have been closing down in recent years."
"The adverse population trend is not the only reason."
"The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality agreed with this, too, and the situation in the Czech Republic is no different."
"Pre-school facilities have been closing down because they are expensive to run."
"That is how villages and towns try to hold on to substantial parts of their budgets."
"Company pre-school facilities practically do not exist any longer."
"Waiting times for placing a child in these facilities are starting to grow."
"Private nurseries that are run to high standards are beginning to appear: they offer foreign language tuition and other perks but only wealthy families can afford them."
"Pre-school education in the Czech Republic used to be, and still is, of a high standard but even there a certain inequality already exists."
"Furthermore, I cannot agree with paragraph 21 of the report, which states that free university education does not necessarily guarantee equity."
"The situation whereby young people get student loans and pay them back later will have a more serious impact on the poorer students as opposed to the richer ones; this may affect the psychology of young people who start their lives burdened with debts."
"Europe is experiencing a wave of immigration. Among those who come here are many children and students."
"These people have a lot of potential that can help the Union in its future development."
"They are also standing on an imaginary starting line and we should enable them to participate successfully in the education system."
"In this context, it is difficult to understand the legislation governing schools in force in the Czech Republic since January 2005, which regulates the extent to which education is allowed to be provided to foreigners with permanent residence permits, or with long-term or short-term visas, refugees or asylum seekers, or persons under temporary protection."
"One bureaucratic decision draws a line between children who must go to school and children who must not go to school."
"Everything depends on how quickly the person in question is granted the relevant status."
"Their arrival is dramatic enough to begin with."
"We must make every effort to ensure that their entry into our Union is easier."
"We do not want young people to be dragged into various undesirable social activities."
"(RO) Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, dear colleagues, I congratulate Mr. Zatloukal for the report, which I consider to be very good, because it refers to one of the most important and sensitive chapters in our life, namely education."
"Furthermore, I would like to refer to three aspects of the report: I requested increased support for the university excellence programmes, both at the level of Member States and of the European Union, to the extent of its competencies."
"This is essential if we want the Lisbon Agenda to be successful and the gaps in respect to other global actors to decrease."
"The lack of highly-qualified specialists in Europe is felt everywhere and extremely seriously in the new Member States due to the brain drain phenomenon."
"At the same time, I am convinced that the increase of the educational process efficiency is closely related to multilingualism."
"In the context of the free movement of European Union citizens, adjustment to the market requirements involves knowledge of foreign languages."
"Moreover, exchanges of pupils and students would be facilitated by multilingual education."
"As regards the equity of educational and training systems, I believe that Member States should find the necessary means to increase the degree of access to education and training of children, young people and adults."
"Subsidized positions should come as a support for underprivileged social categories, for the purpose of reducing illiteracy, social reconversion, for a better adjustment to the labour market requirements and reduction of unemployment."
"This way, the required labour force in third countries will be reduced."
"There are enough human resources, yet they are not trained and managed efficiently."
"(ES) Madam President, the review of the Lisbon objectives we carried out in 2005 demonstrated once more how important it is to position education and training at the core of future EU strategy."
"It is obvious, and this is borne out by Eurostat data, that we are falling short of the ambitious objectives we have set for higher education for 2015: investment in R&D, modernisation of universities, reduction of academic failure rates and the numbers of early school-leavers, more participation by adults in life-long learning, and an increase in the numbers of those who have completed secondary education."
"This time lag leaves us behind our international partners, the US, India and Japan, and to add to this we have the huge disparity of situations among European countries."
"Not only is making efficient and effective progress in the education systems of our Member States important in terms of international competitiveness and economic growth; it is also an essential component of making progress in terms of social cohesion in our societies."
"Investing in pre-school, primary and secondary education is a basic requirement to minimise the risk of social exclusion and ensure higher levels of employment and better pay."
"Both the public and private finance allocated to education must be increased, and Member States must seriously consider the need to build on the Bologna and Copenhagen processes."
"Likewise, university education ought to be adapted to our societies' increasingly heterogeneous social and economic needs, while not ignoring the fact that education is also the basis for training free citizens capable of playing an active role in society."
"Finally, we must update and improve the teaching of vocational training with all due haste, and adapt it to the new challenges posed by the extension of the working lives of Europeans, which increases socioeconomic and educational expectations in adults, without neglecting training on non-discrimination between the sexes at each and every level of education."
"(PL) Further to the recommendation of the European Parliament and of the Council in 2006, emphasising the need to develop lifelong learning, with particular reference to the unemployed, and the need to adjust to economic changes impacting on the operation of the labour market, I should like to draw attention to the importance of education in achieving greater mobility on the labour market, which represents an opportunity to reduce structural unemployment."
"I would like to emphasise the significance of the European Qualifications Framework in terms of increasing worker mobility."
"Equal access to education, which is such an important factor in ensuring that all children and young people have equal opportunities in life, is linked to the financing of education in the Member States of the Union."
"The differences between the financial resources allocated to education, qualifications and teachers' pay have a significant bearing on the chances of achieving that particular objective of the Lisbon Strategy."
"The report entitled 'Progress towards the Lisbon Objectives in Education and Training' adopted by the European Commission in 2005 clearly indicates that progress in that field had been inadequate in terms of achieving the desired outcome by 2010."
"That is why it is so important to focus on improving the quality of education, thus preventing social exclusion and increasing the competitiveness of our economy."
"I congratulate Mr Zatloukal on his excellent report."
"(PT) One of the areas of education which is still lagging behind in certain European Union countries, in particular Portugal, is pre-school education."
"It therefore seems essential to me to underline the call to Member States to invest much more in a public network of nurseries supplied with teachers with high-quality training, capable of dealing with all children, as this is one of the most effective means of developing their intellect, establishing the basis for future education, raising overall skills levels, significantly increasing the equity of the education system and combating social inequalities."
"Likewise, it is essential to ensure quality primary and secondary education, which must be universal, compulsory and free, in order to provide a basic education and key skills which will contribute to the achievement of fundamental social and civic values and education for peace and equality, thereby reinforcing social cohesion and inclusion."
"As for higher education, it should be recognised that this is a fundamental sector in developed societies, which is why lack of success at school and early school leaving must be prevented, as is the case in Portugal where unfortunately around 40% of pupils never even finish their secondary education."
"Budget cuts in education, rising costs of higher education and the difficult social situation of a high percentage of families and young people are preventing Portugal from rapidly improving the higher education of its population, resulting in the worst indices in the European Union."
"Given that studies show that, for every additional year of average school attendance, productivity increases selectively by 6.2% in an average country of the European Union, we can understand better the difficulties of those countries which do not give their citizens access to high-quality education."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, education has played, and continues to play, a key role in the development of the European economy and the personal development of young people."
"I fully agree with this and many other statements made in the report, and I would like to express my thanks and appreciation to the rapporteur."
"It is also correct to say that education systems are effective when the resources deployed produce the best possible results."
"These objectives are pursued by all the EU Member States, in fact, but comparative studies often reveal some interesting facts about the outcomes."
"For that reason, pointers and appeals to the Member States, as set out in the report, are more than justified from a European perspective, even though we have no direct powers in respect of the content and structure of education."
"The causes of such divergent outcomes can be found in the variations in educational quality and intensity, which result in different levels of performance and therefore also to unequal life chances for our young people."
"In my view, it is essential, as a matter of urgency, to make it clear, time and again, that today's generation of school students will be entering an international competition for training places after completing their education."
"Equal opportunities for all thus pose a challenge for Member States which they must meet in order to ensure that young people receive the best possible education that equips them with the intellectual skills they need in order to flourish."
"However, equality of opportunity always has to do with quality and performance as well."
"This, in turn, merits a greater focus on quality and performance in the education system."
"In this context, it should not just be about educational equality for everyone, but about giving everyone an equal start, followed up by the best possible education which takes account of individual talents and differences in physical and intellectual abilities."
"(RO) Madam President, Mr. Commissioner, by 2010, the European Union plans for the dropout rate for young people between 18 and 24 years old not to exceed 10% and over 85% of the young people over 18 years old to attend post-secondary studies."
"9.7% of the children in the European Union aged between 0 and 17 are part of a family with no income."
"Many of the children coming from poor families or a rural environment do not attend any form of post-secondary education for financial reasons."
"I consider that, in a social Europe, scholarships for pupils and students should be accessible to all those who want to learn."
"Disabled children must also have access to education."
"The Member States and the Commission must have as a priority the registration of at least 90% of the children aged under 7 in nurseries or kindergartens."
"In this way, young mothers will be able to reconcile their family life and their professional activity."
"I also request, in order to make education more efficient, ensuring the training and motivation of teachers."
"(PL) Madam President, I should like to highlight a number of issues."
"First, I agree with the rapporteur that investment in pre-school education brings the most rewards, because that is when the best results are obtained."
"It is also important to support modernisation of universities, to emphasise the need for equal access to higher education and to increase its competitiveness."
"Second, equal access to education leads to many positive outcomes."
"It has a bearing on social development, economic growth, increased innovation, the development of human potential and new technologies, and also on reducing unemployment."
"Third, although the return on investment in education only makes itself felt after a lengthy period and requires long-term planning, we should remember that such investment is vital."
"Fourth, I agree with the view that it is essential to link policies on vocational training and education with employment policy, economic policy and social integration."
"Fifth, we need to invest in our young people, because the younger generation represents the future of the European Union."
"It is very important to prevent children from dropping out of school early."
"Sixth, we are confronted by a demographic problem; namely that Europe's population is ageing."
"That is why we must promote lifelong learning for adults."
"And finally, education, education, education."
"Madam President, in general I am concerned by the uncritical acceptance by the Commission that Member States are cutting funding for education."
"In Ireland it is particularly glaring, with the growth in our population and, indeed, as a result, overcrowded classrooms."
"I have long been an advocate of pre-school and primary education as essential for the personal development of every child."
"All the evidence shows that the better the education, the better one's life chances are."
"It is even linked to a longer and healthier life."
"I believe the Commission and Member States must put as much emphasis on quality as on efficiency and equity."
"The quality of the school environment and teaching are prerequisites to efficiency."
"Children need good teachers with a curriculum that gives a holistic education, one geared to teaching students how to make rational decisions, how to cope with diversity and change, how to communicate with others and, indeed, provide a broad ethical basis for the values they can choose to live their lives by."
"These are skills they need to make the most of themselves and their society."
"But there is even a more urgent and basic issue - that of hungry children in our schools."
"Thousands of children go to school hungry in Ireland and I am sure we are not unique."
"It matters not how efficient or equitable the access is, these children cannot do well, and the long-term consequences of that dwarf the savings a state makes by not providing a healthy breakfast for these children."
"Member of the Commission. - (SK) I would like to thank you for a convergent debate since it confirms not only the report and the Commission communication on this matter but also the position of the Member States, which expressed their views at the ministerial meeting in November and subsequently in that half of 2007 when the Council adopted conclusions that also confirmed the basic points in the Commission communication."
"I would just like to make a couple of comments."
"I believe that promoting equity and efficiency in education is both a moral duty and a fundamental financial/economic need."
"Logic dictates that we need to make better and greater investment in education: firstly, better because there is scope to use every euro, every crown and every pound more effectively."
"Several speakers have stated that skills and the quality of education and vocational training have a decisive impact on the future position of both individuals and social groups and need to be constantly improved."
"Those who can improve them primarily are, for example, teachers."
"Investment in the quality of teacher training is one of the most efficient ways of achieving an overall improvement since teachers multiply such effects."
"In terms of improvement, there is a systematic need, for example, for quality assessment as a basic tool and not as an exception, not as something extraordinary but as a rule, where inputs, outputs and everything in between are evaluated, and quality is assessed and rewarded."
"I would like to say that the Commission will, as expected from the report, continue to focus on this matter."
"We want to pay more attention to the issue fair and efficient education, for example, in next year's topic on education and migration."
"There is presently an ongoing consultation on schools for the 21st century, i.e. what is expected from schools in this new era, and naturally we want this process to culminate in an up-to-date view of the position of schools in European society today."
"Another topic that we raised recently was the communication adopted in August on the quality of teacher training and the very important conclusions it presents."
"In conclusion, I believe that the processes that have been mentioned, such as the Bologna and Copenhagen process, and matters relating to adult education, pre-school education and lifelong education, must all come together under the topic of accessibility and quality as key factors in the truly fair education system that we require today and in the future."

"The vote will take place on Thursday, 27 September 2007."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (ET) Time waits for no man."
"It is clear that in 2010 Europe will not be the world's most competitive economy."
"An appropriate and well-structured education system would bring that objective within reach."
"It is impossible to ignore the academic and financial level of the individual top universities."
"According to various data, 20-30 of the world's top 50 universities are in the United States."
"A further five or six are in the United Kingdom."
"The rest of Europe is in third place with four or five, with Canada and Australia hot on their heels."
"Success stories have a habit of repeating themselves."
"Unfortunately, this success story owes its existence primarily to the fact that the English-language education market can tap into billions of powerful customers."
"The effect of scale does the rest."
"As a result Harvard is tens of times wealthier and more famous than its nearest competitor."
"Imitating the elite system of the Ivy League and Oxbridge in continental Europe is a hazardous project."
"I would even call it a blind alley."
"Both in the United States and in the United Kingdom the literacy and numeracy of many ordinary citizens is deemed to be inadequate."
"In the desire for success, especially rapid success, it would be more reasonable to rely entirely on those activities which are familiar to us."
"The most successful European Union country in terms of education is unquestionably Finland, whose national strategy includes public access to education at an equally high level everywhere."
"Education is by nature a strategic area."
"The effects of decisions and actions emerge only over decades."
"Consequently it would be pointless as far as equality is concerned to sacrifice another quarter of a century in the name of higher summits. Even if it were the right way to go."
"A uniformly high level remains Europe's best trump card in international competition."
"European strategy for the rights of the child: against ""dys""crimination of children and exclusion of ""dys"" people (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on a European strategy for the rights of the child: against 'dys'crimination of children and exclusion of 'dys' people, by Anna Záborská, Amalia Sartori and Marie Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, Roberta Angelilli on behalf of the UEN Group, Zita Gurmai and Catherine Trautmann on behalf of the PSE Group, Adamos Adamou on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, Hiltrud Breyer et Raül Romeva i Rueda on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, Elizabeth Lynne on behalf of the ALDE Group, and Kathy Sinnott on behalf of the IND/DEM Group - B6-0317/2007)."
"(FR) Madam President, Rule 173 states that a verbatim report of the proceedings of each sitting shall be drawn up in all the official languages."
"I would draw your attention to the fact that this debate on the exclusion of persons affected by 'dys' ability is not to be translated into the official languages of the European Union."
"This 'tool' has quite simply been done away with in practice, even though our Rules of Procedure require it."
"My point of order is quite a simple one: this evening's debate has to a large extent been requested by numerous schoolchildren, parents' associations, teachers, educators and doctors in different countries."
"However, the citizens who elect the Members of this House, since they will not be familiar with all the different languages used this evening, will never be able to know everything that is being said during this parliamentary debate, even though it is intended for them."
"Thank you very much for your point, which of course concerns us all on what is the day of European languages."
"The matter is being considered and a report is being prepared that will go to the Conference of Presidents, so your point is taken."
"We now continue with the debate on the oral question to the Commission on a European strategy for the rights of the child."
"author. - (SK) Allow me to begin with the testimony of a young 21-year-old woman in her third year at university."
"'When I was 17 my schoolmates laughed at me all year because I looked like an 11-year-old."
"In my report the teachers frequently asked when I would finally make up my mind to learn."
"Those of us with 'dys'abilities work much more than others and it's very hard to live with'."
"End of quote."
"Society is never aware of the 10-20% of children with 'dys'abilities because they are never diagnosed."
"Their difficulties hinder communication, prevent normal education and unfortunately sometimes lead to mental breakdown and social exclusion."
"As far as we are concerned, the European Union can do what it does best, that is to say it can act as a spokesperson and highlight, in a sufficiently varied manner, a problem which in other circumstances might remain taboo and hidden away."
"Europe provides an opportunity to identify good ideas and the tried and tested practices of organisations and governments, as referred to in Written Declaration 64/2007, which is currently before the European Parliament."
"A 'neuro-dys' programme already exists and the European Union funds projects that may be well suited to those affected by 'dys'abilities too, such as the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme, the ICT Policy Support Programme, support for research into information and communication technology skills, the Seventh Framework Programme for Research - health, the Lifelong Learning Programme, and the Second Public Health Programme 2008-2013."
"These programmes are the subject of amending and supplementary proposals for the 2008 budget, which we have put forward with our fellow Members from the five political groups."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in conclusion allow me to express my great admiration, respect, gratitude and encouragement to those who in their lives could have had plenty of reasons to be mothers without hope: 'des mères désespérées'."
"Nevertheless, none of them is giving up the fight."
"They are the best defenders of their children's cause, alongside the fathers where they are still part of the same family."
"I believe that the debate this evening will show that they will not be alone and that their problem will also become a concern of the European Parliament."
"author. - (ES) Madam President, first and foremost I wish to apologise for the absence of Mrs Zita Gurmai, the author of this oral question on behalf of the Socialist Group, who cannot attend this sitting due to unforeseen circumstances, and so with your permission, Madam President, I intend to speak on behalf of Mrs Gurmai and on my own behalf, since I had also asked to speak."
"My wish, Madam President, is simply to reiterate what has been said."
"We are talking about learning disorders that affect a substantial segment of our population."
"Almost 10% of Europe's children suffer from 'dys' problems: children who are usually invisible to our education systems, which all too frequently blame their academic failure on unrelated causes."
"The necessary measures must be taken to prevent such 'dys'crimination, and schoolchildren must be treated in a special, timely, intensive and multidisciplinary fashion, preferably at their usual teaching centre."
"This requires protocols for detection and courses of action at schools."
"For the first time in my country, Spain, a socialist government has introduced an education law to help pupils with specific learning difficulties."
"This is a major step, since in our various countries families are usually dependent on the goodwill of teachers and their willingness to make a voluntary effort with the proper training."
"Opting for other solutions means a substantial economic burden, which is often impossible to shoulder."
"We must remember that boys and girls with these dysfunctions are intelligent, and all they need is a different way of learning."
"Academic success is a genuine possibility for them."
"All that is required is the political will to implement the right mechanisms that produce genuine solutions."
"Making these pupils visible to society means having reliable statistics to allow proper decisions to be taken; it means providing access to clear and truthful information for everyone who seeks it and starting up awareness campaigns extending to all our countries."
"Making them visible to our education systems also means that, in addition to providing treatment in good time for all children affected in the early years of school, we must take account of their needs when designing syllabuses at each and every level of education."
"A number of universities are now using examinations and tests adapted to university students with this kind of problem."
"Community-financed education programmes such as e-learning or life-long learning must also be designed with 'dys' people in mind."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we must tackle the needs of this sector of the population."
"We cannot continue to turn our backs on a disorder that affects over 3 million Europeans."
"author. - (DE) Madam President, I am pleased, too, that this important topic - the increase in dyslexia - is being discussed here this evening."
"It is certainly the first time that we have talked about this issue, but it should not be the last."
"I want the Commission to do everything possible to drive this issue forward."
"We are not starting from zero."
"There are already programmes, there are already initiatives, in many Member States."
"It is important, in my view, not to talk about dyslexia as an illness or a disability, for that is incorrect."
"It has already been mentioned that many children with dyslexia are actually highly intelligent."
"We know that these children are quicker at thinking than in their motor skills."
"The first step that we need to take, therefore - and this is my urgent request to the Commissioner - is to obtain an overview of what has already been done in the field of research and the programmes and initiatives which already exist at European level, and then pull all this information together."
"I think it is important not to confuse dyslexia with ADS."
"It would be disastrous to lump the two together."
"We know that ADS is closely connected to excessive television consumption and over-stimulation."
"On the issue of dyslexia, we should also consider how we can introduce children to books and reading early on."
"We know that children who read a lot and have easy access to books are less susceptible to dyslexia."
"This might be one way of curbing the alarming rise in dyslexia."
"We urge the Commission to compile an overview of the diversity and the different approaches which exist in Europe."
"Another option would be to hold a conference to bring together all these people and their different experiences in this area."
"We know that children are our future and knowledge is our most important resource in Europe, so we need to do our utmost here."
"author. - Madam President, it is estimated that there are approximately 49 million people with some form of 'dys'ability within the EU."
"As many as 10% of children are affected by a 'dys'-type disability such as dysphasia, dyspraxia, dyslexia, dyscalculia, or attention-deficit disorder."
"Take the case of Sean in the UK."
"The teachers' report described him as stupid, awkward, disruptive and over-emotional."
"Because of his problem, he was marginalised and bullied by fellow pupils and teachers did very little to intervene."
"Sean's parents were eventually forced to withdraw him from school after he arrived home badly beaten and bloodied, but the local education authority refused to provide tutoring or assistance, so education was left to his parents, one of whom was forced to give up work."
"Thankfully, a local support group was at hand and offered help to Sean and his parents."
"Other children in the UK and some other Member States are not so lucky."
"We must exchange best practice across the EU, and this is where the Council and the Commission have an important role to play."
"Information must be made more available."
"Steps must be taken to spot, screen, diagnose and treat these disorders at an early stage."
"Structures must be adapted to integrate young people with disabilities into the world of work, and it is important that a European charter for people with 'dys' problems is drawn up."
"It is also vital that research under the seventh Framework Programme is increased."
"There is no point in paying lip-service to disabled people's rights."
"We have to continue to fight to ensure that individuals like Sean are treated equally and given the help and support they deserve."
"author. - Madam President, there are millions, literally millions, of children who are not considered disabled but who struggle with a significant and disabling condition in the area of learning, movement and communication."
"Although the number of children diagnosed with dyslexia, dysphasia, dyscalculation, dyspraxia and similar specific disorders is increasingly dramatically - dyslexia alone is estimated to affect 10% of children in the US - many, if not the majority, of children affected in Europe still remain undiagnosed and therefore largely unhelped."
"Often, when parents express concern they are ignored or told to stop imagining things."
"Often, children - even gifted children - are written off as intellectually weak or clumsy by well-meaning teachers and education authorities because they do not have the expertise to tell the difference."
"Ignoring these conditions does not make them go away."
"They just become more problematic for the child, who gets increasingly discouraged and frustrated."
"The children's self-image can suffer serious damage and their potential can be squandered."
"We have formulated this question and the written declaration to emphasise the enormity of the problem for children with a specific difficulty, for their family and for the community, and to ask the Commission, Parliament and Council to take these children seriously in research programmes, initiatives, guidelines and strategies."
"We need to learn more about these 'dys' conditions, how to identify them as early as possible, how to intervene effectively."
"We also need to learn why a child's developing brain is affected in these ways and how to prevent these 'dys'abilities where that is possible."
"We also need to ensure that no-one is considered less important or less valuable because of these conditions."
"I would suggest to the Commissioner that many adults also struggle with these specific learning or coordination difficulties but have no name for their condition or real knowledge of it."
"Many have come up with elaborate compensatory techniques to get by."
"I collected signatures this summer for a citizens' petition supporting persons with disabilities and was amazed at how many adults struggle to even write their names."
"People suffer in silence with their gifts and talents hidden even from themselves by these hidden disabilities."
"What is the price society pays?"
"People quitting education and working below their ability because of a problem in one area of learning."
"An educational psychologist told me that the tragedy of these children is that many of them would have done very well at university, where they could have worked to their strengths, but failed to get the opportunity as they cannot get through secondary school because the more general nature of the curriculum means that their particular difficulty becomes an insurmountable obstacle to the standard assessment system."
"I know one young man who has a specific learning difficulty."
"He failed primary and secondary school and had to leave the school system without a certificate but, on the basis of an aptitude test and the recommendation of teachers, he did get into a small college."
"Two years later he has proved to be exceptionally gifted in the study of philosophy and has become a popular student leader."
"Our education system in Europe tends to be competitive and rigid."
"The authorities seem to think this is creating a class of educated, skilled citizens, but this inflexibility - a one-size-fits-all approach - is destroying the potential of countless young people."
"This is not good enough and creates social exclusion which can lead many children to become disillusioned and even, in some cases, angry adults."
"In Ireland, 76% of the prisoners in Mountjoy Prison have a history of school failure and what are probably undiagnosed learning difficulties."
"To ignore these children and adults is clearly discrimination."
"I am very proud of this Parliament in the support it has shown for the written declaration, but have one word of caution. The UN Declaration on the Rights of the Child states that every child is entitled to primary education, but special-needs children are only entitled to the help they need according to resources."
"Before we ratify this Convention and introduce it into our strategies, we must examine it very closely."
"Otherwise we will bring this fault into our own policies."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I thank all those present, especially Ms Záborská and the co-authors of the question, because I think it is very important, not only as a question, as a topic for our discussions, but also in terms of action in favour of those who need more specific assistance or treatment or conditions for their life in society, for education, training and so on."
"I especially underline what was said at the beginning: that we want to be the voice of those with these difficulties, and I think this is a very strong moral and political commitment."
"The Commission is aware of the negative social and health consequences that these problems might have on affected individuals or families raising children affected by 'dys'-related problems."
"We agree that measures should be taken to improve the everyday life of children and their access to education, information and culture."
"Of course, the main responsibility for dealing with people with 'dys' problems falls on Member States, but the Commission, as well as European institutions, can support the action of Member States."
"For example, our Disability Action Plan 2003-2010 promotes access to support and care services for people with disabilities and their families."
"The Commission promotes a level of service which strikes an appropriate balance between security, freedom of choice and independence of life."
"The Commission Work Plans for 2005, 2006 and 2007 in the field of public health included specific reference to the need for further information and definition of indicators relating to attention-deficit hyperactivity disorders, cognitive retardation and disruption of motor, perceptual, language and socio-emotional functions."
"Several calls for proposals have been published to support research on 'dys'-related problems."
"However, the Commission has so far failed to receive any proposal in these areas."
"The Community programme PROGRESS provides support to a number of large European networks, including the European Disability Forum, as you know."
"We support the European Agency for Development in Special Needs Education."
"The agency provides policymakers and professionals with relevant information on special needs education and facilitates the exchange of good practices."
"Special education needs are also one of the general priorities of the Lifelong Learning Programme and, as such, they must be considered a priority for all its actions because it is a general priority."
"The Lifelong Learning Programme has a clear aim to integrate people with a range of special needs."
"Concretely, this is done through funding cooperation projects to exchange, develop and improve practice in general, including on the design of pedagogical structures in ordinary and specialist education and by offering increased grants to disabled participants to fund any necessary extra support arrangements."
"Furthermore, several research projects have been supported by the Commission, including the Neurodys project mentioned in the Oral Question."
"The Commission also promotes access to information and communication technology (ICT) and new technology in general for people suffering from 'dys'-related problems."
"The ICT part of the sixth Framework Research Programme co-financed projects on e-accessible and assistive solutions."
"I just want to mention two projects in this regard: the AGENT-DYSL project, which focused on developing the next generation of assistive reading systems and, secondly, the EU's 'For All' project, which aimed to develop technologies to make education accessible to everyone, including people with dyslexia."
"The seventh Framework Research Programme will continue to support 'dys'-related projects or research, including as part of the health priority and as part of the e-accessibility priority."
"We recognise the importance of collecting relevant statistics."
"This was one of the very strong issues here."
"Although the Commission does not currently collect statistics on specific 'dys'-related problems, Eurostat provides EU-wide statistics on disability and social integration."
"Following a special disability-oriented labour force survey in 2002, Eurostat is currently in the process of developing an EU-wide survey model."
"The survey is part of the European Health Survey System and focuses on disabilities and on various aspects of social integration of people about 18 years old."
"We recognise difficulties encountered by people or families caring for people with disabilities, including with those with 'dys' problems."
"Following up on our commitment in the Roadmap for Gender Equality, in 2005 and 2006 we launched a consultation with social partners on reconciliation policies."
"The consultation covered a broad range of issues, including maternity leave, parental leave, paternity leave, adoption leave and a new type of leave to care for dependent family members."
"Having finished the second phase of consultation in June 2007, the Commission is currently engaged in an impact assessment process."
"Depending on the outcome, the new proposals might be brought forward, possibly to 2008."
"The Commission constantly monitors the transposition of EU anti-discrimination legislation at national level."
"Directive 2000/78/EC, which prohibits discrimination in the field of employment and occupation, covers all citizens, including those suffering from 'dys'-related problems."
"However, the Commission believes that legislation should offer protection, not only to employees suffering from a disability but also to employees who care for a disabled dependent."
"In this regard, we follow with great interest the Coleman case currently pending before the European Court of Justice."
"Finally, I really want to say that this is primarily about real knowledge and awareness, and your contribution now is very helpful."
"It is a pity that it is so late, just before midnight."
"But, after raising proper awareness, I think we could focus more on implementation and concrete actions in favour of those in real need."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (EL) Madam President, Commissioner, thank you for staying so late and for your very thorough treatment of the issue."
"I see two other Commissioners in your seat, including the Commissioner responsible for the health sector."
"He is responsible for taking action to have behavioural and learning difficulties recognised as health problems rather than disabilities."
"He also directs research into early diagnosis and ensures that medical methods for treatment and therapy become specific proposals in research programmes."
"This in turn promotes your own education sector by giving special training to staff and parents, and special equipment to schools."
"It also promotes new technologies so as to adopt accompanying and assistance measures for pupils with special educational needs."
"The possibility of education leads to training and professional reintegration."
"I also see in your seat the third Commissioner, responsible for employment."
"He ought to take an interest in the measures for access to professional life, social rights and options for social integration."
"This is to prevent social exclusion of individuals who are differently able, who have a special characteristic without being disabled."
"You have used the word 'disability' many times and have expounded to us all the disability programmes."
"Here, however, it is a question of other dyspraxia problems."
"We can tackle these without the need for a host of new initiatives; we need no more than a little expense and funding, but mainly just care, organisation and the mustering of best practices already at the disposal of the Member States in a fairly broad sphere."
"Legal recognition is a fundamental precondition and allows for access to health and schools as well as to social provision."
"The use of technical means and financial aid for parents combine to prevent discrimination against families as well: they suffer from the time when they start to deal with a diagnosis of a dyspraxia problem until its cure."
"I hope that our question will give the Commission the opportunity to take action."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is pleasing to see the subject of 'dys'-type disorders, so often ignored, now being raised in Parliament and the fact that this topic has generated a response from practically all the political groups that make up this House demonstrates that for us no citizen of Europe, whatever their problems, should be subjected to discrimination."
"Such is the case for 'dys' sufferers, for increasingly sophisticated studies have shown that while this type of disability is still very widespread it is still not being properly identified."
"As the only French Member to speak this evening I can pride myself on the fact that France has been fairly active in its efforts to tackle 'dys' problems."
"Thanks to the initiative of parents' associations and professional groups, a national day, the first of its kind, is now to be held in Paris on 10 October and it is hoped that this will make the press more aware of the situation of the people, and especially children, who are affected by problems of this kind."
"However, the purpose of my question this evening is not to celebrate the positive advances made in one country or another, since there is still a huge amount of work to be done, but collectively to discuss ways in which we might pool the best practices that have been developed at European level, insomuch as certain Member States do not even recognise the existence of this type of disorder."
"It appears to me that the call for a European multidisciplinary network to be set up for specific training and learning problems, which is part of the written declaration, goes some way in this direction."
"A judicious use of Community actions such as the Seventh Framework Programme would also be beneficial."
"In this respect, the initiative that you mentioned, Commissioner, namely the NeuroDys project, which is aimed at highlighting the cognitive, cerebral and genetic origins of dyslexia, and which brings together 15 scientific research groups from nine Member States - and in passing I would like to point out, for this is important, that this body includes practically all the European languages - seems to set a good example because ultimately it appears to me that Europe should lead the world in understanding these conditions and in collecting the biological data that relate to them."
"However, it should also set an example in recognising the most effective forms of rehabilitation and therapy so that children can begin to hope again and face life with optimism."
"Does the Commission have plans for other programmes of this type in the future?"
"Commissioner, you referred to a call for tenders that received no response."
"It is our intention that the awareness campaign now being waged by the various associations and by the Members who signed the written declaration should perhaps make up for this lack of information and motivation."
"We hope that your capacity for mobilising the European funding that is needed to fulfil these expectations will enable the relevant research to be carried out into other 'dys'-type disorders, such as dyspraxia and dysphasia."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, it is quite alarming to learn that 10% of children suffer from dysfunctional disorders."
"That means that one child in every 10 either suffers from motor disorders, cannot express their thoughts or cannot do so clearly."
"What will the adult population be like in a few years' time?"
"It will be composed of people who have difficulty undertaking the normal tasks involved in day-to-day living and cannot play a normal part in society."
"Can we contemplate treating them as invalids and creating a society of invalids?"
"That would be unacceptable."
"If these conditions can be treated, we must do all we can to treat the children affected, instead of focusing on the prevention of discrimination and social exclusion, because one cannot exclude beings similar to oneself."
"I do not think it will come to that. I believe there are ways to manage the situation."
"Finally, I should like to offer my sincere thanks to those who brought this matter to my attention and say that I stand shoulder to shoulder with them."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (ES) Madam President, I wish to start by congratulating the staff and Members who took this initiative of a written declaration and an oral question, and also the Commission for its attendance at this time of night to discuss this issue which, regrettably, not only seems to be a secret issue, an issue for absolute discretion, but also an issue that is completely invisible in certain cases."
"Therefore, despite this situation, the fact that we are discussing it today means that we wish to put an end to the invisibility, and so I have lent my support with full enthusiasm not only to the written declaration and the oral question, but to this debate."
"I think by and large we all know people who have suffered, and are suffering, from these disorders, which are not illnesses."
"Therefore, from that point of view the perception we have in this context is that these are certainly not people who, we might say, require a special service from the point of view of health care for an illness. All they need is support, specific support, assistance and sensitivity, which must be forthcoming not only from institutions but also from families, teaching centres and especially from society in general."
"In my view, the worst thing that can happen in these cases is for discrimination to arise from ignorance in the first instance, from the perception that these people cannot be people who lead absolutely normal lives, although they may need a certain amount of support, and especially from the absence of political willingness and economic resources to implement the necessary programmes to allow these people not just to have, I repeat, a normal lifestyle, but also to allow them as fully capable human beings to contribute their wisdom, their knowledge, their hopes and their dreams to a society that frequently marginalises them and discriminates against them, when they have done absolutely nothing to deserve this."
"(PL) Madam President, I should like to congratulate those who have raised the matter of these specific disabling conditions."
"The 10% of children affected grow up to become the 10% of the population that has difficulty functioning in society. Their suffering is greater in adult life."
"Today, however, we are concerned with the fate of children detached from society for reasons that are not fully understood."
"As children develop, one difficulty generates another, and each complex leads to the next."
"'Dys'-type disabilities should be recognised as specific conditions or impairments. The problems entailed should be explained first to the child itself, and then to those surrounding it, namely parents, friends and schoolmates."
"Such children require a special approach and a personalised style of teaching."
"The identification and correct definition of these conditions is particularly important when the opportunities for treating them are limited."
"Member of the Commission. - (SK) Mr President, I would like to express my thanks for the many, very interesting speeches."
"I am not an expert on the matter but we need more expertise with regard to this topic."
"I am also personally aware of this issue but a much more profound approach by the various institutions and policymakers is necessary to address it specifically."
"Many have been put forward here with regard to the fields of social policy, equal opportunities, non-discrimination, health, education, vocational training and others associated with this issue."
"The starting point is in fact the interest and desire to change the situation because ignorance breeds intolerance."
"That is true of every problem, including this one."
"One of the tasks is clearly to align the views on this problem in the Member States and the EU, that is to say in the EU Member States, because no definition exists anywhere, although in some countries there are national days devoted to this issue."
"In my view, the definition the United Nations uses in the Disability Convention could provide inspiration for the Member States, but that is a matter for them."
"I would like to reiterate what I said at the beginning."
"We have several major programmes that can help in vocational and information and communication terms to identify possible solutions."
"I am thinking of the education programme, the lifelong learning programme, the research programme and the public health programme."
"Allow me personally and on behalf of my institution to thank the team of authors and also others seeking to ensure that people with 'dys'abilities are treated equally and that it is recognised that they are in fact frequently unrecognised and undervalued with regard to their talent, ability and potential."
"The Commission has been called upon to be more active on this issue and I would like to say that the Commission is active and willing, in collaboration with Parliament and the presidency, to be even more active than we may have been in the past."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner, for that reassurance."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (IT) I should like to thank the colleagues who prompted this important debate and the European Commission, in the person of Commissioner Figeľ, with whom I have cooperated on a few previous occasions, for being prepared to note the suggestions put forward by this House."
"Even though the health sector is primarily a matter of national competence, I appreciate the efforts being made by the Commission to try and encourage the Member States to adopt strategies enabling people with disabilities to access care and, above all, to lead as normal a life as possible."
"The Disability Action Plan 2003-2010 and the PROGRESS programme already go in this direction."
"However, it is important to raise awareness among European citizens so as to promote the integration of these people, especially children, into society."
"Integration and awareness campaigns against 'dys'crimination in schools, workplaces, sport and everyday life are needed, as is access to the health service, in order that such dysfunctions - sometimes purely physical - do not compromise the personal and working lives of sufferers and their families."

"Tribute"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I have the sad duty of informing you of the deaths of a fellow Member and a former fellow Member."
"Our fellow Member Fausto Correia died yesterday morning."
"He was born on 29 October 1951 in Coimbra and was only 55 years old."
"He leaves a wife and three sons."
"An illustrious career as a barrister, journalist and then a politician in Portugal followed after he finished law school at university in his home town of Coimbra."
"He was for a long time a Member of the Portuguese Parliament as well as Minster of State under Prime Minister António Guterres."
"He had been a Member of the European Parliament since 2004."
"Fausto Correia was and remains famous and well-loved in Portugal for his unremitting, life-long mission to establish democracy and his dedication to the core values of fraternity and neighbourliness."
"Fausto Correia will be sorely missed by his family, his friends and by us, his fellow Members."
"A book of condolences for messages of sympathy from Members and staff of the European Parliament will be open during this week's sitting on Wednesday and Thursday at the front of the Chamber."
"It is with great sadness that we learnt of the death of our former fellow Member Christian de la Malène, who was a Member of the European Parliament on two occasions - from 1959 to 1961 and from 1962 to 1994."
"Christian de la Malène, who was also a former Minister and Senator under President De Gaulle, died on 26 September at the age of 86."
"As a former Chairman of the Group of European Progressive Democrats and the Group of the European Renewal and Democratic Alliance, Christian de la Malène was a convinced European in heart and mind."
"He dedicated his long life to a strong and democratic Europe, and a political community."
"Christian de la Malène was a colleague and friend who will be remembered for his humanism and his political commitment."
"On this note we wish to commemorate him in gratitude."
"A moment's silence, please, in remembrance of our deceased colleague."
"(The assembly rose and observed one minute's silence)."
"Statements by the President"
"Ladies and gentlemen, your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen."
"Today is not just the International Day against the Death Penalty."
"The Council of Europe, with its 47 Member States, and with the support of the European Parliament and the European Commission, has also declared 10 October the European Day against the Death Penalty."
"We are very happy that the nurses from Bulgaria and the doctors who escaped the death penalty in Libya a short time ago are with us on this day."
"(Sustained applause)"
"I would like to take this opportunity to welcome very warmly on behalf of the entire House the nurses, Nasya Nenova, Kristiyana Valcheva, Snezhana Dimitrova, Valya Chervenyashka, Valya Siropulo, and the doctors, Ashraf Ahmed Gomma El Hagous and Zdravko Gueorguiev."
"Since February 1999 they were forced to spend eight years in detention while awaiting trial in Libya, falsely accused of having deliberately infected hundreds of Libyan children with HIV."
"We are opposed to the death penalty."
"In the past we have therefore repeatedly called upon the Libyan authorities to release the Bulgarian nurses and the Palestinian doctors."
"The death penalty is a severe violation of human rights and first and foremost the right to life."
"On behalf of the European Parliament, I would therefore like to emphasise our unflinching commitment here to the campaign against the death penalty."
"We set great store by it in relations with our neighbours and partners throughout the world."
"We thank those states which have just recently abolished the death penalty, particularly Rwanda."
"This example shows that even states whose citizens have suffered the most appalling crimes have dispensed with the death penalty as a means of justice."
"Another opportunity for promoting the worldwide abolition of the death penalty is the Olympic Games, taking place in Beijing this coming year."
"They provide an opportunity to break through the walls of silence, with which China surrounds the exercise of the death penalty."
"The European Union has submitted a draft resolution on the death penalty to the United Nations General Assembly."
"This initiative, praised on numerous occasions by the European Parliament, is an important step towards the abolition of the death penalty and we appeal in this respect to the Portuguese Presidency of the Council to promote this subject actively at the United Nations in New York."
"The European Parliament has held many debates on this issue and only this year adopted three resolutions on the death penalty."
"There has been such intensive consultation in the European Parliament on this subject as on no other issue."
"We resolutely reject the death penalty, in whatever form and on whatever grounds."
"The Member States of the European Union have, on the basis of our common values, succeeded in becoming a community without any death penalty."
"The commitment to this is also enshrined in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"Once the Charter becomes legally binding under the Reform Treaty, we will even be able to say that the death penalty has been abolished in the European Union at all levels."
"I am happy and grateful that no Member State of the European Union has questioned the abolition of the death penalty in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights or has ever seriously contemplated re-introducing it."
"The European Union, as a global player ,is also thereby able to point to this extraordinary achievement in the area of human rights and defend it."
"In remembrance of the victims, I would ask you now to observe a minute's silence."
"Today, on the European and International Day against the Death Penalty, we, the European Parliament, ask all those states that continue to carry out death sentences to follow our example and abolish the death penalty."
"The European Union is ready and willing to offer you its help in doing so."
"(Applause)"
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to make an announcement and ask for your support."
"As you know, our group had decided to hold an Enlarged Bureau meeting in Moscow to discuss the various problems connected with relations between Russia and the European Union with different Russian players - from the government as well as from the opposition."
"Unfortunately we discovered that the Russian Government would not be issuing visas to our colleagues and this meeting was not therefore able to take place."
"This happened a week after the Subcommittee on Human Rights wanted to hold a similar meeting in Moscow and had likewise not received any visas and therefore this meeting could not take place either."
"We find it intolerable that a government described by some Heads of State as a flawless democracy does not allow us to organise a flawless democratic event there in Moscow."
"We would ask Parliament to review this and you, Mr President, to support this with a written declaration both to the local ambassadors and to the Russian Government."
"(Applause)"
"Many thanks, Mr Cohn-Bendit."
"Out of a sense of conviction and duty I will respond to what you have requested."

"Preparation of the informal summit of heads of state and government (Lisbon, 18/19 October 2007)"
"The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the preparation of the informal summit of heads of state and government in Lisbon on 18/19 October 2007."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, and Mr President, you will understand that, before I refer specifically to the item on the agenda which brought me here today, I should like, on behalf of the Portuguese Government and the Portuguese Presidency of the Council, to thank you for such a warm and friendly tribute - so well deserved in my opinion - which you paid upon the such unexpected and sad loss of my fellow countryman and Member of this Parliament, Dr Fausto Correia."
"Portugal was shocked at the news because it was news on the loss of someone who was a truly good man and who was, for all of us, an example in the fight for human dignity and for the values we believe in: the values of the rule of law and respect for human rights."
"He is certainly a great loss; we should just try, if we can, to follow his example and I am sincerely grateful for the tribute this Parliament has paid to him, which the Portuguese Government of course reiterates."
"(Applause)"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, last year I spoke to Parliament about what the Commission saw as the motor of progress in today's European Union and we outlined the so-called 'twin-track' approach - an activist policy agenda and an ambitious approach to the Treaty reform were goals that supported each other."
"There was a lot of consensus in that debate, and I think there were three reasons for that."
"First of all, it reflects a degree of maturity in the European Union, because Europe today touches on so many areas of people's lives, and this has created expectations."
"Retreating into a lowest-common-denominator Europe would be a big mistake."
"Second, I think that the challenge of communicating Europe with and to our citizens demanded a fresh approach, with a more profound awareness of how Europe relates to their social needs, their economic aspirations and their underlying values."
"Finally, this new approach was based not just on political instinct: it was grounded in the work launched by the Commission in its Plan 'D' for Democracy, Dialogue and Debate, in which so many Members of this Parliament took such an active part."
"The informal European Council next week will be the twin-track approach in action."
"On the one hand, we should see the heads of state and government concluding the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) and agreeing a new Reform Treaty. On the other, the Presidency has signalled its intention to deepen the debate on how Europe responds to globalisation."
"So, to start with the Reform Treaty: we now have a text in front of us and this is a major achievement."
"I want to pay tribute to the work of the Portuguese Presidency, as we have to the German presidency, for the way they have moved the process forward calmly and steadily, showing great commitment."
"Like my colleague from the Presidency, I also want to pay tribute to Parliament for its constructive role in this last phase."
"We have worked well together, and, thanks to Mr Brok, Mr Barón Crespo and Mr Duff, we have a better Treaty, in terms of its provisions on rights and citizenship."
"We will also be giving the Charter of Fundamental Rights full status through a formal proclamation."
"Remember how many said that an EU of 27 would never be able to agree a treaty text again."
"We are on the verge of proving them wrong yet again."
"The determination of all of us to reach agreement also points to a Europe with plenty of ideas for the future."
"If we agree a deal next week, the agreement to stick closely to the mandate will have been vindicated."
"We now have to carry this past the final hurdles."
"I am sure that the heads of state and government will be fully aware that an atmosphere of recrimination and dispute at Lisbon would do nothing to help the process of ratification."
"Of course, we would have liked to avoid opt-outs, but, if that was the price of making progress with an ambitious Reform Treaty, we have to accept it."
"It is the nature of compromise and negotiation."
"I would also like to thank Parliament for having responded rapidly and efficiently to the invitation of the European Council to come up with proposals for its future composition."
"This is a difficult and sensitive issue for all of you, as it is for Member States, and I would emphasise the need for agreement by both Parliament and the Council."
"One last word on the Treaty: political agreement by the European Council is an important step, but, as we all know, it is not the end of the story."
"I hope we will be able to work together during the ratification process, seeing it as an opportunity to communicate, to explain and to listen about the European Union."
"Where possible, we should coordinate, as the Commission proposed last week in a new paper entitled 'Communicating Europe in Partnership'."
"We also need a treaty that is as accessible and understandable as possible, with a consolidated text that should be made available as soon as possible after the conclusion of the IGC."
"During this ratification process, leading up to the European Parliament elections in 2009, the delivery of our policy agenda for Europeans will be equally important in setting the mood, and next week, thanks to the Presidency, we will have a debate on Europe and globalisation."
"This is very timely: every year it becomes more and more clear that globalisation is central to the concerns of this generation of Europeans."
"It touches every citizen in one way or another: the goods and services we buy, the television we watch, the energy we use and the work we do."
"The European Union has been successfully developing a policy which recognises the fundamental link between economic success and social security."
"But globalisation is not static, as this summer's turbulence in the financial markets showed all too clearly."
"We need to adapt constantly to changing circumstances."
"Last week, as Mr Lobo Antunes has mentioned, the Commission adopted a paper for this debate that will also set the scene for proposals later this year on reviewing the Lisbon Strategy for growth and jobs."
"It argues that Europe must shape up for globalisation in order to deal successfully with the pressure it puts on our economies, our institutions and our citizens, but also to seize the opportunities for greater prosperity, for lifting people out of poverty, for new markets for our products, for closer cooperation and for more sharing of values."
"The paper also states very clearly that globalisation is not some irresistible external force of nature, with the EU as a passive bystander."
"We can shape globalisation and shape it, to some extent, in our own image."
"That is our task: to be confident enough about our values, our vision and the tools at our disposal to ensure that Europe succeeds in the age of globalisation."
"It also rejects protectionism."
"Yes to protecting our citizens, but no to protectionism that can only impoverish them."
"It also serves notice on our partners: we will not be a soft touch; we will defend the European interest."
"That means a level playing field; it means ensuring that openness is a two-way street; it means making clear that we will not water down our high standards of health, safety, environmental and consumer protection."
"The paper is equally uncompromising when it comes to our values."
"We can prosper in the age of globalisation, but we will want to do it our own way."
"Our growth will have to be sustainable."
"We have set ambitious targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions and using renewable energy sources, and we will meet them."
"The meeting will provide an important opportunity to restate Europe's leadership role in the run-up to Bali."
"We will use our social models to spread the benefits of globalisation throughout our society."
"They are among our biggest assets."
"They will help our citizens to adapt and equip them for dealing successfully with rapid change."
"The tripartite social summit just before the informal European Council will provide an excellent opportunity to set the scene."
"It is clear that, today, the European Union offers a route for Europeans to make the most of globalisation, to provide a continental context that individual countries cannot match."
"To deliver this European interest, we have a ready-made tool in the shape of the Lisbon Strategy for growth and jobs."
"Our economic analysis shows that the Lisbon Strategy is beginning to deliver."
"The paper points to a number of policy areas that deserve even greater attention during the next three-year cycle up to 2010: education and flexicurity, including more attention to active inclusion policies and adequate social protection; a fifth freedom for ideas and researchers; eco-innovation; a small business act for Europe to help millions of small companies across the EU to grow and create more jobs."
"None of this is easy, but it is achievable."
"I know that this Parliament will remain intimately involved in following the progress of the Lisbon Strategy at both EU and national level."
"Your views on the points sketched out here will be an essential input for the package, which we will adopt in December."
"The informal European Council is an important rendezvous at an important time."
"Let us use the opportunity to show Europeans that the European Union is looking ahead, shaping its policies to meet tomorrow's challenges and equipping itself with the right tools."
"(Applause)"
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Madam Vice-President, fellow Members, we have here an example of good cooperation between two Council Presidencies: the German Council Presidency, which prepared a mandate that has now turned out to be extremely stable, far-reaching and radical as it has been implemented by the Portuguese Council Presidency."
"The fact that after work by the legal experts, we are now faced with the situation in which the subjects are clear and definable and this success will perhaps continue this coming Monday at the meeting of the Foreign Ministers, shows that there is a really good chance here that the Reform Treaty will be in the bag on Thursday of next week."
"The three representatives have decided to support this mandate."
"Not because our dreams will come true with this mandate, but because it is the best that can be achieved as matters stand, with a view to attaining greater democracy and greater capacity to act. For an enlarged Union's capacity to act and greater capacity to act in line with the new challenges we have in today's world, from energy security, terrorism, foreign and security policy as a whole, globalisation, organised crime to climate change and much more."
"This success is because we have improved decision-making opportunities in Council, new competences have been added in the energy security sector and in the area of legal and domestic policy, on which my colleagues will be speaking further, we have the solution of the third pillar."
"Here the European Parliament - and this is the second gain - becomes a co-decision-maker on these issues, in order that in future, under this Treaty, the European Parliament will have equal power of co-decision in 95 % of cases of legislation, even in the area of agricultural policy and the budget as a whole."
"It is often forgotten that all this is included in this package."
"This means the democratic deficit which the European Union has had to date is crucially being closed."
"That is substantial progress!"
"Other countries having difficulties have had opportunities to adjust imbalances within the scope of this mandate and in negotiations on the basis of an opt-out that has clear deadlines, as a result of which growth as a whole will not be constrained, but their opportunities stemming from common law and so on will be maintained."
"Its 'red lines' are consequently guaranteed, which should also facilitate the ratification process without referendum, if I have correctly understood the relevant undertakings or statements given during the negotiations."
"As the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights becomes legally binding, this Union is becoming a community of values, even with the opt-out, which anyone may have."
"However, this does not apply to European decisions, because European legislation is made collectively."
"All that remains is the issue of application in individual Member States, in terms of the rights of the courts and citizens and we need to see that we are moving into new dimensions here too, with the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the creation of a legal personality."
"The European Union, however, needs to consider a few more items here."
"Item 1: Article 24 of the mandate - data protection in external relations - must in my view be re-formulated, or it must be specified by a declaration that general issues of data protection - such as passenger name records - are not affected."
"There must be further clarification on this."
"Data protection - citizens' data should not be passed on without judicial review and parliamentary involvement."
"I regard this as crucial."
"(Applause)"
"The second item concerns transitional arrangements."
"I would also like to ask the Council and the Commission for support and this is in the Commission's interest."
"When the Treaty enters into force on 1 January 2009, it cannot be that in a 'light' procedure the Foreign Minister, whom we are now no longer allowed to call this, so the High Representative, is appointed by Council."
"We should like all this to be resolved in one package in 2009, having due regard to the rights of the European Parliament."
"The High Representative is also Vice-President of the Commission and must be subject to everything here."
"There was also the Commission's interest here: a future Commission President must have a voice in selecting the High Representative, who is Vice-President at the same time."
"For this reason the High Representative cannot enter office until the European Parliament has elected the Commission President."
"We must keep to this sequential order if democratic rights are not to be undermined here and power imbalances are not to occur."
"We have to add a few more finishing touches here in the next few days."
"(Applause)"
"Many thanks, Elmar Brok."
"It would have indeed surprised me if you had taken nine minutes."
"The next speaker is the representative in the Intergovernmental Conference, Enrique Barón Crespo."
"rapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the representatives of the European Parliament speak a variety of languages and we belong to different groups, but we are united in the same desire, to move the European Union forward by completing the Lisbon Treaty, a treaty that includes legislative codecision, the unique personality of the Union, progress in the communitarisation of internal and justice policy and external policy, and participation by national parliaments."
"We want greater democracy and greater efficiency."
"We regret the fact that there is not more transparency, but this is part of the methods of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"I have to say that the lawyers - particularly those from Parliament - have enabled us to interpret the hieroglyphics that this exercise has become in a positive way."
"I would like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council to confirm to Parliament something that I understand to be a very clear commitment."
"The citizens, who were very unfairly relegated to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, have returned to the Treaty on European Union with the wording that it had had since the Maastricht Treaty."
"We see this as fundamental, as representatives of the citizens."
"I must acknowledge that, in an unusual gesture of political clarity, the President-in-Office of the Council himself told us that this was impossible, but it has been achieved: the first important achievement."
"The second one is the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is the symbol of the identity of European citizens."
"Now it is not a declaration - number 11; neither is it a protocol: it is 'the Charter', which we will vote on here next month, formally, with the Presidents of the three Community institutions, before starting the ratification process."
"The Charter will be legally binding, and I say this because I believe that it is important for it to be recorded today, because I think that these are absolutely essential conditions for the European Parliament, sine qua non conditions for supporting this treaty."
"There are also other elements on which we think progress can be made."
"My fellow Member Elmar Brok mentioned the subject of data protection, which is a sensitive subject if ever there was one."
"There are some other elements that are very important for us."
"One of them is the dialogue between the social partners - which was unfairly relegated to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union - and another important matter that we believe we are helping with through our support for resolution of confidence problems is to provide security through a declaration, like the Ioannina Compromise, which already exists, but should not go any further."
"We do not think it makes any sense in a Treaty on a Union that functions by majority, and qualified majority, to introduce elements of unanimity that would absolutely destroy the process."
"I mentioned in Viana do Castelo, as the President will recall, that it makes sense having the atomic bomb if it is not used."
"If it is used, it destroys everything."
"And I think that this is an important warning."
"Mr President, there is a point that is important to Parliament, and I think that I am speaking on behalf of the majority of Parliament, and the majority of the Member States, and very clearly on behalf of those that ratified the Constitutional Treaty, which we sacrificed in order to achieve unanimity, and on this occasion it is very important for us all to work together in mutual loyalty and solidarity in order to achieve ratification. If not, we would find ourselves in very difficult circumstances."
"I think that we all need to remain faithful to the commitment that we have made."
"Thank you very much, Mr President."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, like my colleagues, I agree that a political agreement is probable at the IGC in Lisbon."
"But the thing that concerns us still, of course, is the quality of the agreement."
"I have to express concern, at the present stage of the IGC, that we are seeing the emergence of a self-service Europe propelled principally by the British demands for the opt-outs in the field of justice and interior affairs and fundamental rights."
"Clearly there has to be a British domestic debate about why British citizens ought to be excluded from the benefits of integration inside all these important fields, but the British should also explain themselves more fully to the IGC."
"What is it, precisely, that they are seeking to achieve with all these opt-outs?"
"Can we be truly satisfied that the arrangements that are negotiated for the management of this pick-and-choose approach will stand up in practice and ensure that common policies in the field of freedom, security and justice will still enjoy proper commonality and the full resources and instruments to carry them out?"
"Surely the UK and Polish opt-out on the Charter risks subverting the decision to make it binding for everyone else."
"I hope that the IGC can be able to examine the question with sufficient care."
"Would the Presidency press the British to support the proposal from the Parliament for an escape clause from their unfortunate protocol on the Charter?"
"The same applies to Ioannina: the Presidency and the Commission should assure us this afternoon that they will not concede to the unreasonable demands to upgrade the Ioannina Clause from secondary to primary law."
"Ioannina is the historical descendant of the Luxembourg Compromise; the Luxembourg Compromise was a gentleman's agreement and so it should remain when included alongside the Treaty as a decision of the Council."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, I would like to thank Mrs Wallström and Mr Lobo Antunes for their speeches."
"The period of reflection and debate to decide the future governance of the EU of 27 is coming to an end."
"Have we gained in maturity?"
"Are we ready to switch from discussion to action?"
"In June, Mrs Merkel demonstrated a combination of courage, responsibility and political will."
"Far from skirting around divisive subjects, we managed to reduce our differences."
"The way was finally opened for the European Union to equip itself with the tools necessary to function more effectively."
"Three months have gone by and the Portuguese Presidency has kept us on course."
"If the roadmap fixed in June is respected to the end, until the European Council in Lisbon, the Portuguese Presidency will be able to secure agreement on the reform of our treaties."
"Here I salute the determination of the Portuguese Presidency during the work of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"For the European Parliament, and in the opinion of our fellow members Messrs Brok, Barón Crespo and Duff, whom I would like to thank most warmly, the assessment of the IGC is in line with expectations and the agenda set by the heads of state and government has, generally speaking, been respected."
"Ladies and gentlemen, though we are prepared to make do with a balanced compromise, let us not forget that it is by default."
"Personally, I think it is more worthwhile to highlight the reasons why we support the draft Treaty."
"Firstly, we believe that only a united, strong and effective Europe can influence the affairs of a world which is moving so fast, changing, and becoming complex and unstable."
"If we support the draft Treaty, it is also because an effective EU of 27 cannot build on the rules of the Treaty of Nice."
"Furthermore, faced with the misgivings expressed by European citizens, we have demanded greater democracy and transparency."
"We are in favour of a clear division of competences, in favour of increased participation by our fellow citizens in the process of building the EU and in favour of an active role and strong contribution by the national parliaments."
"Treaty reform is the correct response to citizens' expectations."
"The revised Treaty is a means, not an end in itself."
"The form it takes and its name are unimportant."
"What counts is its substance and the progress it enshrines for European citizens."
"We, the members of the PPE-DE Group, do not want a European superstate."
"We only want effectiveness, democracy, transparency and respect for the principle of subsidiarity."
"We are demanding effective European institutions capable of making decisions, and as long as national opt-outs are a frequent reality, it is up to us to limit their negative effects to prevent Europe from being paralysed."
"Any attempts to block the EU's decision-making process should be ruled out."
"Citizens expect Europe to act where it can make a difference: on climate, energy, immigration, innovation, terrorism."
"My hope and wish is that this Treaty will enable us to do that, and we will support it."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my sincere thanks to Parliament's representatives at the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Our fellow Members Enrique Barón Crespo, Elmar Brok and Andrew Duff have represented the interests of the European Parliament superbly."
"For this I would like to express sincere thanks on behalf of our group."
"(Applause)"
"We have rightly heard from our fellow Member, Mr Daul, that the Portuguese Presidency now has it in hand to bring to a close the necessary work following the abortive attempt at a European Constitution, namely submission of a reworked and revised Treaty, agreeing on the key elements of the reform imperatives among 27 countries in the EU, safeguarding the construction of a united Europe legally and politically at an Intergovernmental Conference now coming to an end, rounding things off at a summit in Lisbon and then bringing them into the intrinsically crucial phase, ratification of this revised Treaty in 27 Member States under the specific legal and constitutional conditions of each country."
"I therefore specifically want to emphasise the fact that we can be optimistic about Lisbon."
"If we differentiate between what has been achieved at the summit here in Brussels under the German Council Presidency as a mandate for the Intergovernmental Conference, and what was worked out at the Intergovernmental Conference, we can also assume, according to the reports from our representatives, that - with few exceptions - this is almost identical."
"As the Social Democratic Group we say: this is how it must be!"
"As Socialists we cannot and will not accept amendments that date back to before the mandate agreed here in Brussels - this should be clearly stated."
"But we assume that we have a draft on the table which corresponds to what was agreed here in June and for which we all commended Mrs Merkel."
"When we send this draft on its way to Lisbon, it will be interesting."
"The question will then be whether this Treaty will be ratified in 27 Member States and it will then depend on the Members of this House, and we will have a fight on our hands."
"We will also have to fight for the construction of a united Europe to be accepted in all the Member States."
"I would venture the thesis that a further collapse of this revised Treaty - just as the Constitution collapsed - will be the end of the European Union in its present form."
"Anyone who does not want to tread the path of the anti-Europeans sitting here in this House, anyone who wants to follow the path of promoting Europe and its consolidation, is therefore called upon to fight for this Treaty."
"I hope, Mr Daul, that all the Members of your group will also do this. I have slight doubts about this."
"I would also tell you what we must keep in mind in this House if the project collapses."
"What happens if the European Union does not succeed in its further attempt to secure the revised Treaty?"
"What lies ahead for the European Union?"
"Europeans believe we are a large continent of 500 million inhabitants in 27 Member States, a large internal market."
"We make up 8% of the world's population."
"India has 1.1 billion inhabitants, China 1.3 billion, both these countries together representing one third of the world's population."
"If we want to remain competitive in the long-term, if we want to defend what we have achieved socially in Europe, if we want to stabilise the economic base, which is the prerequisite for social justice, then we have to be able to co-exist harmoniously throughout the world."
"We can only hold our own throughout the world, however, if this Union is consistent - economically, socially and politically."
"It needs this Reform Treaty to do this!"
"If the EU is broken down into its individual parts, if we follow the nationalists who tell the people we can achieve more on our own than together as 27 countries, then this continent will face bad times ahead!"
"I therefore hope that what is agreed in Lisbon survives ratification and so we will need to fight."
"Anyone who wants peace in Europe, anyone who wants Europe as a factor for peace in the world, anyone who wants economic growth and more jobs and a fairer distribution of wealth in the Union, must strengthen this Reform Treaty, defend it and implement it."
"Anyone who does not want this, anyone who focuses on renationalisation, should be told what François Mitterrand said in this House: nationalism is the opposite of European unity and nationalism in the long-run always means war."
"Europe, however, is a concept that grew out of the wounds of war on this continent, and therefore European unity based on a reformed Treaty is the goal of all democrats and progressive powers on this continent."
"Good luck, therefore, for the Intergovernmental Conference and for the summit!"
"But I wish you even more luck for ratification in the 27 Member States."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, Prime Minister Sócrates must feel like England's Henry V before the battle of Agincourt: hostile governments preparing for a fight, intent on weakening, even perhaps vetoing, treaty reform."
"President-in-Office, your Prime Minister must hold firm to Europe's red lines and he must deliver next week a treaty able to underpin a strong, responsive and effective Union."
"So it is 'Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more', for what should be the final battle in this constitutional war."
"This Parliament will be your foot soldiers."
"We know that failure to agree on treaty reform would be a tragedy of Shakespearean proportions."
"Why?"
"Because the status quo has not worked, does not work and never can work."
"What Council unanimity means in practice is that essential legislation is either shelved or lowered to the level of the common denominator."
"In an increasingly cut-throat, globalising world, where challenges like climate change, migration and terrorism demand radical responses, the lowest common denominator is just not good enough."
"It may not be the Constitution but, for all its legalese, the Reform Treaty is a document which can quietly revolutionise Europe."
"It develops democracy, putting codecision and qualified majority voting at the heart of decision-making. It favours subsidiarity, with a clearer division of competences, reinforcing the role of national parliaments and the Union's single legal personality, and it helps transparency, extending the ordinary legislative procedure to cover freedom, security and justice - an area where laws which breach the spirit of a rights-respecting Union have been made behind closed doors for too long."
"The draft text of your amending Treaty is not without its faults: the loss of Europe's symbols is a blow to federalists, as is the fudge on voting systems wrought by the Poles."
"But we can live with them, so long as the Ioannina Compromise is not anchored in the Treaty for all time."
"One thing we cannot live without, however, is a definition of European citizenship in Article 8 of the Treaty of European Union, because citizenship is a symbol which, unlike a flag or an anthem, has a real life, real implications for over 450 million people."
"Similarly, calling our Foreign Minister the 'High Representative' is no grave cause for concern, but a High Representative who is merely a puppet of the Council certainly would be."
"Parliament and the Commission must unite to ensure that the joint character of the external action service is respected in full, and that the Court of Justice oversees the use of personal data within the common foreign and security policy."
"Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we cannot have two classes of citizen."
"That goes entirely against the spirit of European integration and we must do our damnedest to ensure that British and Polish opt-outs are not preserved in perpetuity by demanding a clause allowing revocation without reconvening the IGC."
"It is not only opt-outs we must guard against: it is also 'opt-ins'."
"If not properly formulated, they could allow governments first to water down, and then to wash their hands of, essential Community laws in justice and home affairs after five years of dialogue and debate."
"If certain countries cannot accept reasonable compromise, our message should be this: they should start thinking about an amicable divorce from the Union and cease holding it hostage to their own vested interests, for the interests of Europe must take precedence over these."
"(Applause)"
"So I urge the Council, the Commission and our own representatives, in Shakespeare's words: 'Stiffen your sinews ..., Hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit to his full height' in defence of our common interest."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, today we are facing the last leg of our work on treaty reform."
"If the Lisbon summit is to end in success, we need political imagination."
"Those who recognise treaty reform as a priority should ask themselves today especially: is it worth taking a firmer stance on Poland and the United Kingdom; is it worth placing a question mark over the outcome of many years of negotiation?"
"If we are to believe its advocates, the Charter of Fundamental Rights can only reinforce the binding provisions we already have."
"But perhaps those who point to the essentially incalculable consequences of its provisions being used by the European Court of Justice are right."
"I have similar concerns, and I therefore entirely understand the reservations expressed by the United Kingdom and Poland."
"A major element of the compensation for the losses that Poland has decided to incur along with leaving the Nice system is the Ioannina mechanism and the permanent position of the Polish Advocate General at the European Court of Justice."
"The undermining of these settlements is currently raising questions for us about sincerity of intent."
"Like any other country, Poland has a right to expect better instruments to scrutinise the EU's legislative process."
"The absence of proper legitimation will, after all, bring defeat for the European project in the future."
"Lack of scrutiny of the legislative process is not something dreamed up by Eurosceptics or warmongers, as the constantly somewhat agitated Martin Schulz would have it."
"It is something that worries sincere Europeans."
"The former President of the Federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe and former President of Germany Roman Herzog asked recently whether Germany was still a parliamentary democracy, considering how many regulations have come into being outside the Bundestag."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, just a few days away from the conclusion of the Intergovernmental Conference we are preparing for the usual night and day of horse-trading, as has always been the case, which will end up, as always, with a compromise tending towards the lowest common denominator."
"A look at the various texts - those that we have managed to obtain via pseudo-secret channels, because here very little is done in public - reveals that they are very complicated to read and are certainly user-unfriendly."
"The negotiators, however, as we very well know, are not at all interested in being user-friendly, in explaining or in involving their citizens in what ought to be an important time in their democratic lives."
"On the contrary, back at the briefing stage we condemned the fact that the argument that 90% of the text of the Constitutional Treaty has been incorporated into the reform treaty cannot conceal the reality of an obscure text, full of annotations and derogations that weaken the European Union, particularly with regard to foreign policy and clarity of law."
"This has been a negotiation totally in the hands of the governments, conducted behind the backs of citizens and profiting from the fact that endless linguistic and bureaucratic theorising has prevailed over passion and democratic participation, which for good or for ill had been a feature of the Convention stage and also the referendum stage."
"Three of our Members participated in the work of the Intergovernmental Conference and followed the work of the jurists, but it cannot be denied that they failed to improve the transparency of the process to any significant degree, and although perhaps they succeeded in reducing the damage done, they were not able to make any specific improvements because they did not have the opportunity."
"So, Mr Schulz, Mr Brok, Mr Barón and Mr Duff, to be honest I do not see the logic behind it."
"We ought to act in a considered manner, we ought to consider ourselves jointly responsible for this text and, although obviously I agree that we should try to ensure that the Member States ratify this text - although it now depends on what will happen in the final agreement - why should we go over the top?"
"According to Mr Schulz, we are supposed to say, even here, among ourselves, that if this text is not adopted it will be a tragedy, because this text is fantastic, because this text here .... this text is horrible!"
"Anyone reading it can easily see that it is not what the citizens wanted."
"Having said that, it is obvious that it is better than nothing."
"Having said that, it is obvious that it is better - no Martin, calm down, because I am not saying that I want to reject it - I am merely saying that we ought to be responsible and credible in the eyes of the citizens and that even if this is not by any means a particularly adequate compromise, we will back it."
"We cannot lie, though, and we cannot say that this is the best we could manage, because the governments have hijacked this constitutional process from us and have made it what it is today, and it certainly could be much better than it is."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FR) Mr President, I will not go over our group's general assessment of the new draft Treaty again."
"We oppose it, not through nationalism, Mr Schulz, which is something I despise as much as you do, but because none of the basic criticisms that characterised the debates on the old draft Constitutional Treaty - and I am not talking about the symbols of the EU, which we did not have a problem with, but the EU's political thrust - have been taken into consideration."
"I get the impression we will pay for this casual approach sooner or later."
"Just now, I want to dwell on one specific article of the new draft, which we have already talked about: Article 24 of the Treaty on European Union."
"There seems to be a broad consensus among us on challenging this, and that is a good thing."
"It is, in fact, a sensitive issue: the protection of citizens with regard to the processing of personal data."
"Now, the legislative procedure that would apply would not be the same depending on whether these data were being processed within the European Union or sent to a third country."
"In the former case, Parliament would have full competence, but in the latter it would have no say at all."
"This is a legal monstrosity and a serious denial of democracy."
"In fact, it relates directly to the precedent set by the PNR case, where the Council agreed to send the US authorities confidential data on passengers travelling to the United States, despite complete opposition from the European Parliament."
"The Council would like to continue with this situation, and is giving itself the means to do so."
"This is unacceptable and Parliament should signal this clearly to the European Council."
"I will simply add this: this dispute indirectly reveals several facts to which my group has constantly drawn attention."
"The first is the little real impact the Charter of Fundamental Rights will have."
"In fact, Article 8 of the Charter is devoted explicitly to the protection of personal data, yet this protection is cheerfully violated and will be violated in future too."
"Next there is the almost indecipherable nature of some key passages of the treaties, only a very well-informed reading of which reveals this kind of trap."
"Finally, there is the deliberate opacity of the work of the IGC, which is as far as it could be from a public, transparent drafting of a text whose purpose is to determine the life and future of the EU of 27 and half a billion citizens."
"All this confirms our demand for democracy on two fronts, on the one hand for a major pluralist debate in each country on what is at stake in the treaties, and on the other for ratification by referendum."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (DA) Mr President, the EU published the new draft Treaty at 5 p.m. on Friday - thus satisfying itself that the media would not write about it at the weekend."
"If the objective is to smuggle a treaty in, these are expert media relations - but what scheming, lousy behaviour."
"At the last Strasbourg meeting of the Conference of Presidents, the President solemnly promised that all the political groups would have access to all the IGC documents."
"We still have not received them."
"Three groups have privileged access to the Intergovernmental Conference, whilst five groups are excluded."
"This is discriminatory and in conflict with the principle of equality - again, scheming, lousy behaviour."
"The new treaty contains 105 new powers for the EU - just like the Constitution."
"The right of veto and representative government have been cut in 62 areas as against 61 in the Constitution."
"What is new is that 255 pages of changes have now been inserted in 2 800 pages of treaty, making the text unreadable for everyone but nerds - again, what scheming, lousy behaviour."
"The new EU constitution will run to 3 000 pages as against the rejected Constitution's 560."
"This is what came of Sarkozy's so-called mini-treaty."
"Imagine going to the people with the issue of a practical mini-treaty and then serving up the rejected Constitution again, but now without a referendum - again, scheming, lousy behaviour."
"There is not a single piece of legislation that can be adopted on the basis of the Constitution that cannot also be adopted on the basis of the new Treaty."
"The two texts are identical in terms of legal obligations; the difference is the name and the jettisoning of referendums - again, scheming, lousy behaviour."
"What wimps!"
"Come forward with your plans and present them to the electorate."
"Sign the petition for referendums at www.x09.eu."
"on behalf of the ITS Group. - (NL) Mr President, besides the previous speaker's reservations about the resemblance with a new Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, which is being rammed down our throats in a completely undemocratic way, the European Presidency has evidently made it a kind of prime objective to achieve a breakthrough on a common European immigration policy."
"The least that can be said in this regard is that such a policy at European level, decided in none-of-my-business cenacles by means of the particularly dubious Commission and Council decision-making with which we are sadly already familiar, would be completely undemocratic."
"The immigration problem affects our citizens personally and their private sphere."
"Besides, in my view, the transfer of decision-making in this area to European level with no real visibility to anyone is not only undemocratic but plain dangerous."
"The Portuguese proposal to 'channel' illegal immigration via legal immigration is too absurd for words."
"Illegal immigration must be tackled by means of a 'tit for tat' policy, a firm policy of tracing and expulsion, watertight external border controls, and also European detention and reception centres in the countries, or at least the continent, of origin."
"As regards what has been described as the 'absolute necessity' of legal immigration, I should like to point out that Europe already has approximately 20 to 25 million unemployed, among them millions of unemployed immigrants, with all this entails."
"A new wave of legal immigration, with all the associated 'family reunifications', would only mean an exponential increase in the particularly serious problems of integration and assimilation."
"If it is really only a matter of highly skilled workers - which I dispute - then we are organising a brain drain from the poor countries, which is absolutely scandalous; or is it the intention to keep countries poor and underdeveloped - in which case the Council should just say so?"
"(PL) Mr President, what is it we are discussing today?"
"A constitution for Europe."
"We are discussing a document under a different name, with different wording, but with the same essential content as the constitution that has already been rejected."
"This is an allegedly lower-ranking document, just so that it does not have to be put to referendums."
"Here we have the EU's political elites, among them members of this House, the European Commission and national governments, trying to deceive their own electorates and their peoples."
"We are supposed to support a Reform Treaty which is in reality the European Constitution, the renamed European Constitution, which the voters in France and the Netherlands rejected in referendums, and a number of other countries failed to ratify within the prescribed time."
"Let us recall the words of Angela Merkel, and I quote - use different terminology without changing the legal substance, for example with regard to the title of the treaty, the denomination of legal acts, and the Union's minister of foreign affairs - end of quote."
"That is exactly what has been done, and we are being called on to accept this deception."
"We must not deceive ourselves and our voters."
"(PT) In my speech today, in my own name and on behalf of the Group I represent in this Parliament, I would like to express deep sadness at the passing of Fausto Correia."
"He was a man of conviction, but a kind man, a very good man, a man of great solidarity."
"He is sorely missed."
"Secondly, I would like to say that the Portuguese Presidency has shown determination, and this should be stressed, in not allowing any modification of the objectives of the Treaty, as agreed by the Heads of State and Government."
"We are sure it will stand its ground and that we will have a new Treaty before 20 October."
"I will therefore say no more."
"As regards the Lisbon Strategy, I must congratulate the Presidency and the Commission on having finally realised what we have been saying for ages: unless the Commission is awarded wider powers and responsibilities within the Lisbon Strategy than it was given in 2000, the Lisbon Strategy will not bear fruit."
"An appropriate line to take would be to strengthen the Commission's role, making it the pivotal point of the Lisbon Strategy, and we are hopeful that such a fresh approach could eventually bear fruit."
"Finally, the inclusion of globalisation in the debate at the forthcoming informal summit is a good sign, because the world in which we live today is about globalisation and we cannot imagine that the summits with Africa or Russia - and we hope they are a big success - or the debate on exchange rates for the Japanese yen or the US dollar do not come under the phenomenon which is globalisation."
"It should be pointed out, as the Commissioner did, that it is important to have joint rules in international trade and the opening up of markets, as it is equally important to have reciprocity in our arrangements with other business and trading partners."
"That is an important point and for that reason alone, even if that were the only reason, it would be sufficient to sing the praises of this Commission communication."
"Mr Lobo Antunes, I wish you every success with the informal summit which will perhaps be one of the most important we have had in recent years in the European Union."
"(DE) Mr President, fellow Members, I believe we should commend the Portuguese Presidency for the way in which the negotiations have been conducted: in a very dedicated and targeted manner."
"I think it is good that you have adhered closely to June's mandate, with a few exceptions, and staved off the many extra requests, starting with the European Central Bank's request for an article on Austria's desire to limit the number of students from other countries."
"None of this is part of the new Treaty and I believe you are on the home stretch."
"There is not a great deal now to stop us reaching a consensus on the new Treaty."
"The opt-outs are sad."
"They give the impression of dissension and inconsistency."
"They fragment the EU and are it also takes time to make decisions in the third pillar."
"They really are a downer and predominantly what the United Kingdom wanted."
"Andrew Duff had talked about a self-serving mentality."
"I hope it does not set a precedent."
"I believe London's fundamental requests have all been met."
"I read with concern what was still being discussed yesterday in the House of Commons."
"There is nothing more to be said on this."
"It would be totally unacceptable to make even more demands now."
"There will be discussion on Poland's request to anchor Ioannina somehow, but the capacity for a blockade cannot be increased."
"We do indeed want to increase the capacity to act."
"This must remain an exceptional case."
"It was a gentlemen's agreement, and it should not become the rule."
"I want us with the Commission and Council to be able to proclaim the Charter here in the Chamber with the three Institutions."
"That would really be a good signal to send to the citizens."
"I would also like see Mrs Wallström's request back again in the Treaty, namely that the citizens are given a right to receive information."
"Two thirds of people feel uninformed."
"This would be a good addition to the Treaty."
"President-in-Office of the Council, Parliament will do everything it can to ensure that the Treaty of Lisbon comes into being."
"I thank our three representatives as well as the President who will take care of this at the summit in Lisbon."
"Mr President, I note with great regret that citizens' rights are clearly not at the heart of the new Treaty."
"Unfortunately, the Charter of Fundamental Rights has been sacrificed to the Dutch Government's fear of a referendum."
"The Charter of Fundamental Rights must be legally binding in full and for all because the Charter of Fundamental Rights is the application in practice of our shared values."
"So, what does an opt-out mean?"
"Is it an opt-out from those shared values?"
"Or, does it mean that Poland and the British Government simply pay lip-service to those values but then deny their citizens the means to enforce their rights?"
"What does an opt-out mean?"
"Are we not creating a dangerous precedent here?"
"Let us ask ourselves, will future countries, future Member States, have the same right to an opt-out?"
"If Turkey, a country that I very much want to join the European Union, asks for an opt-out from the Charter of Fundamental Rights, will it be granted the same right?"
"The other issue is that, between the Constitution and the Treaty, an additional, lower standard of data protection has somehow been created - a lower standard that applies to the area of the common foreign and security policy."
"I predict that in the future the Member States will try to circumvent data protection rules by labelling, for example, counter-terrorism measures as common foreign and security policy instead of police and justice cooperation."
"Finally, I would ask the Commission and the Member States to consider, as soon as the Treaty has been signed, acting in the spirit of the new Treaty and involving the European Parliament as a full co-legislator on matters of justice and home affairs, and rapidly closing the democratic gap that we have been living with for so long."
"(PL) Mr President, Heads of State and Government are once again engaged in modifying the way the European Union functions by giving it a new treaty."
"This concern for the peoples of Europe and their future is touching."
"But we cannot have the decisions of an informal summit replacing the democratic path of referendums held in the individual states on whether to accept the treaty."
"It would be a deceit practised on the peoples of Member States who have a right to decide independently on a matter of such importance."
"The old constitutional treaty has been subjected to an operation which essentially consists in some slight modification to the text."
"This enables the document as a whole to be presented, depending on current political needs, either as an entirely new document, or as the previous treaty with no fundamental changes."
"I therefore wish to ask: how do the Council and the Commission define the document in question?"
"Is this a new treaty, or is it a trimmed-down version of the old treaty, and will the process of ratifying it begin from scratch in all Member States?"
"(DE) Mr President, anyone who has seen how governments have been attacking the Constitution over the past year, making it unrecognisable and illegible and robbing it of its spirit and European charisma, must acknowledge that all this has nothing at all to do with what the citizens wanted - even those who said no in France and the Netherlands."
"Anyone, however, who was able to observe the patience and time spent on what is now happening in the run-up to the Intergovernmental Conference must see that the governments have been attacking the structure of this Constitution like termites with their lawyers and state chancelleries."
"Grain by grain, element by element, this Constitution has been dragged out."
"I am really wondering why nobody is asking the governments what they are pushing here."
"Is it really only their own power, is it really lack of awareness of people's expectations or is it plain nationalism that we see rising again in Europe?"
"The language!"
"Today a delegation of Members of the Austrian Parliament asked me: how am I to make your 'yes' to this Constitution comprehensible to anybody?"
"I cannot read it."
"I cannot understand it any more."
"I no longer know what the texts, references, footnotes and traps mean."
"I believe that at the end of this Intergovernmental Conference a Europe is looming in which for the first time in history people will no longer be able to recognise the political order under which they are living."
"And then you will lose a lot of supporters, even those who have fought for this Constitution for many years."
"Fundamental rights!"
"Vice-President of the Commission, you invoke the spirit of compromise."
"But why do you not invoke the nature of universal fundamental and human rights, which make it unthinkable for us to form a community of values in which a few states declare 'but I do not belong to this community of values'."
"How are we to counter a Mr Putin and tell him: we are a huge community of values in favour of universal human rights - except for a few of us."
"This is such a gap in Europe's credibility that we cannot invoke the spirit of compromise here!"
"This is a completely different spirit."
"It is a great political demon that dominates here."
"I do not believe that what is happening here at the moment will meet with the citizens' approval, which we no longer intend to seek."
"(PT) Mr President, I would like to begin my speech by expressing my own sadness, as well as the sadness felt by my group, on the death of our fellow Member, Fausto Correia."
"On the subject of reform of the Treaties, the Council Presidency only repeated that it very much hoped to reach a further stage, not the final stage, in the process of recovering the project set forth in the European Constitution."
"That is, to take one more step in the process begun at the beginning of June under the leadership of the German Presidency to impose the content of a rejected Treaty by presenting it in another form, trying to move forward by default and against the express wish of the people, which is a real political fraud."
"This Treaty is an attempt to pave the way for neo-liberal policies which run counter to social rights and advances gained, serving the interests of the large multinationals."
"Federalism is being imposed under the domination of the major powers within a framework which grants legal personality to the Union, where the States are deprived of their powers and the European Union is regarded as a pillar of NATO; that is in order to favour meddling and interventionism in accordance with the interests of the major powers."
"It is a Treaty which aims to set up an economic, politico-military bloc with imperialist ambitions."
"It is a Treaty which will not overcome the deep and irremediable contradictions of this European integration, but which will, on the contrary, tend to accentuate them."
"We, for our part, shall continue to condemn the real objectives of this Treaty, to argue that it needs to be rejected and to demand a broad national debate and consultation of the Portuguese people in favour of a Europe of cooperation on progress and peace between sovereign States which have equal rights."
"Finally I would like to express my support for the great demonstration promoted by the CGTP-IN to be held in Lisbon on 18 October next."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, whether we rejoice or lament, everyone agrees that the Treaty to be signed in Lisbon is just a recycling of the European Constitution rejected by two referendums in 2005."
"As a report yesterday by the House of Commons pointed out, it has everything: the primacy of European law, even secondary law, over national law, even constitutional law; legal personality for the EU, which will allow the Commission to represent the Member States on the international stage; the Minister of Foreign Affairs under another name; the largest transfer of competences in the entire history of European integration; at least forty new subjects; and the vast field of fundamental rights."
"Within these walls, where the word 'democracy' is constantly on our lips, I would like to try and appeal to the consciences of you all."
"What genuine democracy could think it normal to bring into force a text that the people have rejected in a referendum?"
"Why should the people be deprived of their right to express themselves on the new Treaty and on any fresh enlargements?"
"What sort of political regime do you think you are building by subordinating our democracies a little further to a system characterised by no separation of powers, no political accountability on the part of governments and no representation of the people, except of a single European people?"
"The Italian federalist Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa has already given the answer. I quote: 'Between the two poles of popular consensus and the leadership of a few governments, Europe has been created by a method that could be defined by the term ""enlightened despotism”'."
"He is right!"
"And the people's no to their enlightened despotism has convinced federalists that they have to proceed once more under cover, because the only difference between the rejected Constitutional Treaty and the one that is coming is that the first one did not lie."
"Mr President, on past performance, I suspect that the Council will be an occasion when British red lines will become pink smudges, later to be rubbed out entirely by the federalising European Court of Justice."
"Opt-out, opt-in, shake it all about, the British Government will claim victory, others will publicly indulge them, knowing that any apparent concessions are really without any substance."
"All this is to con the British public into believing that the Reform Treaty is actually materially different from the rejected Constitution, when patently it is not."
"Now that Gordon Brown has bottled out of an election, the need for a British referendum is greater than ever."
"No election means Labour's 2005 manifesto commitment of a referendum must stand."
"No referendum means no mandate for Mr Brown to proceed to ratification, and that is the bottom line upon which all democrats in the United Kingdom should unite."
"Mr President, I want to thank the Council and Commission for their statements."
"The Lisbon informal summit is going to be a crucial event, having had the publication of the draft Reform Treaty, which heads of state and government will focus on when they meet there."
"But the IGC process has been rushed too much."
"Indeed, the British Government says it has only had two days to consider the draft mandate."
"The proposals are, of course, as has been said by other speakers, very much the same as those contained in the original constitutional text."
"The British Prime Minister has a problem."
"It is called trust - trust in what he says."
"For the past few weeks, he has encouraged his Ministers to talk up prospects of an election in the UK and then, when the political going got rough, he backed down."
"I think his European colleagues, fellow European leaders, should be very careful that whatever he says in Lisbon, he is likely to mean something completely different."
"British Conservatives, of course, will continue to demand a referendum on the Treaty."
"The vast majority of British people want one, including most of the Government's own supporters."
"If the Prime Minister continues to resist that pressure, despite a clear election manifesto pledge, then the British people will have further confirmation that he cannot be trusted."
"The leader of my party said that this could well be a blatant breach of trust - one of the greatest and most blatant breaches of trust in modern politics."
"I do also wish that Europe would concentrate more on the paths of globalisation, alleviating world poverty and tackling climate change."
"These are the lessons that we should, by now, have learnt."
"I hope that our Prime Minister will be straight with the British people on the issues that arise at Lisbon."
"We want a successful Europe, but it must be a Europe that concentrates on the things that people really do support and understand."
"(PT) I would like to begin by thanking you, on behalf of the Portuguese socialist delegation, for all the expressions of sympathy on the death of my dear friend, Fausto Correia."
"We are all - Portugal's democracy, the Portuguese socialist party and this Parliament - the poorer for his passing."
"With one week to go before the informal summit meeting, I want to be optimistic and believe that good sense will prevail. I want to be optimistic and believe that each of the 27 Member States will assume its political responsibilities towards the citizens of the respective countries, towards European citizens and towards the world."
"I want to believe that on 19 October the European Council will conclude a political agreement and will approve the Reform Treaty, putting an end to this impasse which has existed for too long."
"I am optimistic because we are all aware of the need to respond to the European citizens' expectations and doubts and they are legitimately wondering about the global role played by the European Union and about the advantages it will bring for their future."
"I want to be optimistic because we all know that the world is watching Europe and waiting for a positive sign."
"We all know that the world needs a united and cohesive Europe."
"We all know that the world does not stop and that Europe cannot remain imprisoned in its national egotisms."
"We all know that it is necessary to overcome the impasse in order to channel our energies towards promoting economic development, creating jobs and combating climate change."
"Those are priorities."
"The lawyers have reached agreement on the drafting of the text for the Treaty plus its annexes."
"Technical/legal difficulties, although complex, were resolved."
"The IGC fulfilled the mandate entrusted to it by the Council."
"The Portuguese Presidency did everything within its power to overcome the obstacles."
"The European Parliament did its work both within the IGC and outside that Conference, where our colleagues Elmar Brok, Enrique Barón Crespo and Andrew Duff made an invaluable contribution."
"That means that to date all have done their duty with a great sense of responsibility and within the time allowed."
"It is now hoped that no artificial obstacles will be raised, dictated by short-term national political circumstances rather than by any objective reservations about the Treaty content."
"No one would understand if those same Heads of State and Government who approved the IGC mandate were to go back on what they had already said."
"That would be to their discredit."
"We would then certainly be entering a crisis with unforeseeable consequences."
"The text might not be the best, but it is an opportunity and is better than nothing."
"Let me end by quoting what Jean Monnet said: 'I have always believed that Europe would be built through crises and that it would be the sum of their solutions'."
"Wise and prophetic words."
"Let us hope that Europe is able to make history, to write another page in the story of the building of Europe."
"(DE) Mr President, we have been fighting with some success for greater democracy and efficiency in the constitutional process - now in the process towards this Reform Treaty - but the discussion cannot really be about transparency."
"We could have already read everything that the Council Presidency has presented here by way of a briefing to this House in the press."
"A few more substantial statements by the Presidency would have been apt."
"The fight for transparency must therefore continue!"
"Where this Parliament has been very heavily involved - for which I am extraordinarily grateful to our representatives - is in fighting for the greater rule of law."
"Data protection in the common foreign and security policy, greater parliamentary participation, the abolition of the third pillar in favour of a common justice and home affairs policy, the legally binding nature of the Charter, these are all subjects which are important even for the Liberals in the centre and based on our common values."
"With regard to the opt-outs, let me say the following."
"A distinction can be made between those based on home affairs policy and those that concern foreign policy."
"In home affairs policy they perhaps concern a legal culture, national traditions, and different notions of social values."
"I can even understand, if not actually approve of, the fact that we are voting for an opt-out here."
"What I cannot understand or approve of at all is the blockade by a few Member States, particularly the United Kingdom, in the area of common foreign and security policy."
"Timothy Kirkhope has just said: we should be developing policy where the citizens support it."
"The citizens support a credible common foreign and security policy."
"It is an objective necessity in view of the challenges we are facing: combating terrorism, the crisis in the Middle East, fighting poverty, infectious diseases, and migration."
"There is a range of challenges here which we can only meet together."
"We are therefore wondering quite objectively (and Martin Schulz has done so and I think he is completely right) who will be deciding the world's destiny in twenty or thirty years' time?"
"The United States, China, India and ... the United Kingdom?"
"Nobody believes that!"
"Nor will Germany or France be doing so either."
"We will either be doing this together or not at all!"
"We therefore need a European spirit and we need this Reform Treaty!"
"(PT) If I might mention lack of transparency, the Charter of Fundamental Rights states that in Europe 'no one shall be condemned to the death penalty, or executed'."
"So far so good, but that is not the full picture."
"The basis for interpretation of that article is the framework of the European Convention and that lays down some unacceptable exceptions."
"For example, the States may reinstate the death penalty if there is an imminent danger of war."
"What kind of a idea is that, ladies and gentlemen?"
"That same source of law gives law enforcement officers licence to kill in the event of insurrection and even authorises, to quote once again 'preventive detention'."
"You will certainly remember Jean Charles de Menezes, killed in 2005 on the London Underground."
"Was that an unfortunate mistake or a crime which would be licensed under the future Treaty?"
"Today in Lisbon José Sócrates and Durão Barroso spoke against the death penalty."
"What authority can there be for sponsoring a Treaty which now lets it in through the back door?"
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, other Members will confirm this in the debate to come, but I believe that it is right to stress - partly with a view to the upcoming Summit - that a European citizen is somebody who holds citizenship of a Member State under national law."
"Thus, a citizen is anyone who benefits from the rights conferred upon him by such status, and especially the right to vote and to be elected as a Member of the European Parliament."
"Who have we been working for, for years, when we talk about the right to free movement, to education, to health, to work, to dignity, if not the citizens who have democratically elected us?"
"I consider it equally important to maintain mutual respect between the Member States: for decades a gentlemen's agreement has enshrined the equal weight accorded to the three largest EU states after Germany."
"On the linguistic front, this has already been infringed countless times."
"Now, the Lamassoure-Severin proposal sets out to eliminate this parity in terms of political weight too."
"If this is the underlying sentiment, then we should not be unduly surprised that it is so difficult to reach an agreement to define a future together."
"The European Summit should thus reflect deeply upon the ideas of European citizenship and democratic legitimacy."
"(CS) I trust that during the upcoming Lisbon Summit the final agreement on the wording of the Reform Treaty will be reached."
"Its signature and ratification will put an end to the institutional crisis caused by the referenda in France and the Netherlands."
"The institutional reform is necessary, but is not in itself sufficient for the EU to succeed in the context of a more globalised world, and in relation to its citizens."
"The institutional reform is an indispensable part of the solution; it is not, however, in itself, the solution."
"Once the Reform Treaty has entered into force, we will need to engage in the fundamental debate on the future direction of European integration."
"Answers to Europe's economic, social or security issues will be sought in a rigorous revision of existing policies."
"The ultimate objective of the European project and related questions on the borders of the EU must take centre stage in these debates."
"Referenda in France and the Netherlands and the complex negotiations on the wording of the Reform Treaty signal that the fundamental debate on the contents of the European project will be much more challenging than has been the case to date."
"That is why it is so important to respond properly and without delay to President Sarkozy's proposal to establish a so-called committee of wise men, which would provide the much-needed impetus and direction for this debate."
"This body should have a clear mandate, but in no case be composed of representatives of Member State governments."
"Rather it should be a select group of eminent scholars, outstanding entrepreneurs, former diplomats and politicians."
"They should be personalities who inspire natural authority and respect, not officials with tasks delegated to them by their governments."
"The objective of this committee should not be to replace public debate but rather function as a catalyst for debate and come up with concrete proposals on the future of European integration."
"Mr President, through the Reform Treaty we will gain perhaps imperfect but necessary working tools, and it is up to us to use their full potential."
"Europe's citizens are expecting concrete, tangible results from the EU."
"It is our job to fulfil these expectations."
"(FR) Mr President, the Intergovernmental Conference probably met in the deepest part of the Channel Tunnel to get away from public opinion."
"The result, Mrs Wallström, is impossible to communicate to the ordinary citizen."
"More than 300 amendments buried in 150 pages have transformed the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on its functioning."
"As a bonus, there will be 53 declarations and 12 protocols."
"In the wake of the symbols of the EU, such as the flag and anthem, other political achievements will also be whisked away."
"Social dialogue will no longer be a horizontal obligation for the EU."
"The social partners are asked not to bother themselves with economic policy, but only with social policy."
"The Protocol on Services of General Interest indirectly enshrines the primacy of competition law over all services provided to citizens by municipalities or regions, however vaguely commercial they are."
"National governments, like night watchmen, can only decide on non-economic services of general interest."
"We are being lied to about the binding nature of the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"Protocol 7 says, I quote: 'for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in Title IV of the Charter creates justiciable rights applicable to Poland or the United Kingdom'."
"In plain language, the European Court of Justice cannot enforce the Charter."
"I will skip all the opt-outs that make for a two-speed Europe as far as the euro zone, the Schengen agreement and the rules on justice and home affairs are concerned."
"Article 24 is worthy of a totalitarian State, allowing as it does only the Council to set the rules on the protection of the personal data of our fellow citizens and to permit those data to be circulated freely to the United States."
"Neither the Parliament nor even the Court of Justice will be able to protect fundamental freedoms."
"George Orwell's Big Brother is not far off!"
"Finally, we are being threatened with the inclusion of a permanent right of veto for governments, derived from the Ioannina compromise."
"This is unacceptable, Mr President."
"Personally, I am starting to rediscover some of the virtues of the Treaty of Nice."
"(RO) The Lisbon Summit will offer the European Union the opportunity to debate and perhaps decide on a subject of major importance for its future and role in the 21st century."
"The context of the year 2007, when the European Union comprises 27 countries and the international scene becomes ever more globalized, forces us to question the goals, priorities and the way in which the European Union operates."
"It is unquestionable that the European Union's actions in the 21st century should be based on two fundamental principles: democratic legitimacy and a close relationship with the European citizen, as well as an increased coherence and efficiency in its activity, including externally."
"First of all, this means respect for and promotion of democratic values, the rights of our citizens, including minorities and, from this point of view, I welcome the explicit mention of this aspect in the proposed Treaty wording."
"Secondly, the European Union cannot be only a strategic actor in today's globalized world without focusing its foreign policy on solving disputes and encouraging international and intercultural dialogue, especially in the policy of promoting regional cooperation."
"Last, but not least, we should not forget about the propelling force of any development, namely education and the position it should hold in the revised version of the Lisbon Strategy."
"Without giving increased attention to the European education and research policy, we will not be able to speak of a reformed, competitive and strong Union."
"I hope that the Lisbon Summit will also bring clear answers to the questions we have today."
"(DE) Mr President, my fellow Member Mr Goebbels said after his speech that despite his criticism, he would not die for Nice - which I very much hope he will not, and that he will live for a long time."
"First and foremost Nice is not a treaty for which it would be worth dying!"
"I hope that this Treaty which we are getting will at least have a much higher added value than Nice."
"I would like to take up where Mr Lambsdorff left off."
"Our citizens want a strong European Union, not as an intrusion into daily life, but as an outward representation in order to be better able to represent our citizens."
"I now think that this treaty, for all its weaknesses, still represents substantial progress."
"It is a necessary, albeit insufficient, prerequisite for us to pursue an active foreign and security policy."
"The Kosovo problem is, of course, preoccupying us."
"We shall see whether there is the will generally to promote a common foreign and security policy."
"Both the Portuguese and the Slovenian Presidencies are having to gear themselves up intensively for what we are doing, should no amicable solution be reached here."
"However, it is important that we create the appropriate conditions in the long run."
"I would like to bring up two things here: on the one hand, we do of course need a workable diplomatic service, which must be located at the Commission."
"It makes no sense to place foreign policy with the Vice-President of the Commission and High Representatives if the diplomatic service then simply has to be organised elsewhere."
"On the other hand - something several fellow Members like Enrique Barón Crespo and others have already pointed out - we must make clear that this Parliament has been involved from the outset in the appointment of the High Representative."
"Finally, one further comment to the Vice-President of the Commission: you repeatedly point out how important the negotiation of this treaty is."
"The matter will not be settled - as my colleague Mr Schulz has said - with the agreement which will hopefully be reached in the Council and not even with ratification, but our citizens must be convinced during and after ratification that this Treaty will help them by allowing their interests to be represented in this world."
"(PL) Mr President, a few reflections on Lisbon."
"Recent events linked to the constitutional crisis have made the citizens of Europe aware that there is a need for reform and change."
"The essence of a democratic system of decision-making is arrival at a consensus, through majority or unanimous support for some idea, where a frivolous veto is not issued by one partner in important matters."
"We are discussing the question of numerical representation in decision-making in the forum of a united Europe, and through this we are touching on the principles for the functioning of a common organism."
"This is why it is also important to heed the voice of the minority, which, because of its geographical situation, for example, or its historical experience and political situation, may often express a view of reality that is of relevance to Europe."
"The living and dynamic organism that is Europe must not be closed off within a rigid and universal legislative framework introduced by the current Parliament or Commission for good."
"A person or a national grouping has an unlimited behavioural repertoire, and life and the ongoing situation demand adaptation of regulations, though not of values, which should remain constant in relation to reality."
"We must not underestimate the immediate eastern dimension of the economic, political and energy aspects."
"It is not just the west that counts, or Brazil, and I feel that the current Presidency needs to be more flexible in this regard."
"And another reflection: the expanded economic perspective which we are discussing and which will be the subject of discussions, should become an element of the so-called Lisbon Strategy, if we wish to catch up with the USA."
"And lastly, Mr President: greater involvement of national parliaments elected by citizens will bring EU matters closer to the people."
"What this really means is that more of the decisions on the shape, content and future of Europe should be taken by citizens, and not just by representatives of the government that happens to be in power."
"Mr President, may I congratulate the Portuguese Presidency on the progress they have made towards securing consensus."
"But, of course, we have heard from many colleagues today that there is considerable disappointment in this Parliament."
"There are many who are disappointed at the loss of the idea of a constitution that would have replaced the current treaties and refounded our Union on a new legal base."
"There are others who are disappointed at the numerous changes that have been secured and the special provisions and derogations for certain Member States."
"Some of these changes are, of course, unfortunate."
"But they are the price that has to be paid to secure agreement of all 27 countries capable of being ratified by all 27 countries."
"That is the situation that we are faced with."
"There is no way around the fact that this Treaty has to be acceptable to all Member States and ratified by all Member States."
"Colleagues should not lose sight of the overall picture."
"This Treaty, even in this form, contains many vital reforms."
"We need those reforms; the Union needs those reforms."
"Anyone who wants a well-functioning and democratically accountable Union should support these reforms."
"The alternative to the reformed Treaty is more of the same, but with years more wrangling on the institutions and the mechanics of the European Union."
"I would rather secure the reformed Treaty and then move on with a greater capacity for the Union to address the real issues that citizens are interested in: climate change; the performance of our economy; overseas development aid; the environment - all those things for which we need the Union, because alone and separately, we are not effective, but together we can do more."
"Let us move on and get these institutional issues settled once and for all."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Lisbon brings us yet another important step closer and successfully brings to an end the aftermath of the meetings."
"However, Lisbon still does not bring us to our goal."
"The ratification process is still ahead of us and will demand everything of us, indeed, of us all."
"We shall manage together or not at all to make the European Union more democratic, closer to its citizens, more transparent, more capable of action, inwardly and outwardly."
"The Reform Treaty signifies a further step in the right direction."
"Only if we do this together will we succeed in anchoring the Reform Treaty in the public consciousness as added value for the citizens of Europe, the European Union and Europe as a whole."
"The only thing is that we have still not put egotism, nationalism, protectionism, the EU naysayers and the EU mendaciousness in their place with the Reform Treaty alone."
"They are the cancer of commonality, the cancer of Europe's future."
"The opt-out method is inconsistent with a united Europe."
"The opt-out method weakens the community of values."
"It creates first and second-class citizens and I am wondering why the representatives of Poland and the United Kingdom want to thwart the European Union's common foreign and security policy."
"We want data protection to be controlled by law with parliamentary participation."
"We want staffing decisions to be taken after the elections to the European Parliament."
"We want the social partners and social dialogue to continue to be anchored and strengthened."
"We want public relations work to be carried out on the added value of the Reform Treaty and the further extension of the European Parliament's co-decision-making rights, because only by doing this will Europe become more democratic, closer to its citizens and more transparent."
"Mr President, as far as the Treaty is concerned, the devil is not in the detail, he is in the ratification."
"We should remember Denmark in 1992, Ireland in 2001, France and the Netherlands in 2005, and even Sweden on the euro in 2003."
"Nowhere is safe from a no vote."
"Obviously each Member State is in charge of its own ratification, whether through parliamentary channels or through a referendum, but is it really impossible to coordinate the whole thing?"
"I think that bringing all the ratifications together would prevent an endless stream of national debates and would allow European public opinion to emerge more strongly."
"I can suggest a date, Mr President: the first fortnight in May 2008, because this is the fortnight that saw the end of the Second World War, and sees Europe Day on 9 May, and this year it will be the sixtieth anniversary of the Hague Congress, which set Europe in motion, chaired by Winston Churchill."
"For us, the French, it is also the election of a great European, François Mitterrand, on 10 May."
"It would help a little if the ratifications were coordinated."
"After all, we have got rid of the symbols of the Treaty, but symbols can be put back in a calendar."
"Why not write them into certain dates?"
"Because regardless of what we think of the drafting of the treaty - and our fellow member Mr Goebbels was rather harsh about this - we must at all costs nevertheless ensure that this step in European history is taken."
"So I put this suggestion to you: agree on this fortnight!"
"(Applause)"
"(PL) Mr President, Prime Minister, Madam President, just as it did seven years ago, the Portuguese Presidency faces some major tasks and major challenges."
"I am convinced that the European Treaty will be adopted in a good atmosphere and with consent, providing a basis for effective and efficient management of the EU."
"This is the most important matter today; because only then can Europe gradually become a political power and have a positive impact on the fate of the world."
"But economic power in the EU is always something essential, and today this is even more true than it was seven years ago."
"We are faced with the challenges of globalisation and we wish to become, and I quote 'the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth, with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion'. But today we know how difficult that is."
"So a social Europe increasing employment and also battling against climate change, which it was not seven years ago, must be a Europe of a completely free market."
"An open market, a market free of protectionism and monopolies."
"We owe this to our citizens, if we wish to act on the principles of the Lisbon Strategy in the sphere of competition, innovation and progress."
"Let us also remember that management of the Strategy's guidelines from a free-market position has worked much better than management from Member State level."
"And lastly, a third matter - our success depends to a large extent on relations with our neighbours."
"I congratulate the Portuguese Presidency on the far-reaching rapprochement on the EU's southern borders, but we should not for a minute forget the eastern dimension, especially as the results of fair and free elections in Ukraine have presented us with the chance of a democratic, free-market and pro-European stabilisation of the eastern border of the European Union."
"Elections were held just two and a half weeks ago, and it is worth proclaiming this in the European Parliament."
"(HU) Mr President, as has emerged from the previous debate, there is a huge amount at stake with the current Reform Treaty, since the operability and credibility of the Union are at stake."
"In any case, European citizens do not understand that we have been working on the Constitutional Treaty and institutional problems for years and that from this we, as the political elite, know very well that they are extremely important in the interests of reforming and renewing the Union; at the same time it is a foreign, incomprehensible debate for us."
"Ultimately we have to work on the real issues for European citizens, and I agree with Martin Schulz that there should be no more failures in the life of the Union."
"There should be no more failures, because the 2004 enlargement was the first that was not prevented by radical reforms or radicalisation."
"It is no longer surprising that the British are behaving as they are, and yet, as a representative of a new Member State, I am not pleased that my Polish fellow members are taking a political course that unfortunately does not serve European unity."
"There is no alternative to the Reform Treaty."
"It is vital in order for the European Parliament not to be a place for quibbling, but for the Commission and the Council to take it seriously."
"It is also vital in order for us to make progress with matters such as the issue of national minorities, in which, finally, one of Europe's great problems - we should look at the Western Balkans, or Ukraine and Russia - (sentence unfinished)."
"Without the Reform Treaty, we will not be able to make any progress in this area either."
"Mr President, there is no alternative to the Reform Treaty; it is either the Reform Treaty or the death of the Union!"
"Thank you for your attention."
"We have before us an important occasion to make a more efficient and democratic union out of the European Union."
"The new treaty will offer the necessary tools so that the European Union will keep progressing after more citizens have now joined in its midst."
"We have a unique opportunity, and together we must see that the necessary compromises that guarantee a better future for European citizens are now found."
"Several people have mentioned Poland and England and their opt-outs."
"Yes, it is important that everyone keeps national interests present, but it is more important that we keep European Union interests present because we all form of the European Union."
"This applies not only for the Council, but also particularly for the European Parliament."
"I do not agree that there should be a particular European Union for certain European citizens and a different European Union for certain European citizens in another country."
"We must therefore use this opportunity that we will have in the coming days in Portugal to send a clear signal to our citizens that the European Union is not stagnated, and with the new treaty we will guarantee that we will continue to move forward."
"We guarantee that after long and difficult years of continuous debate about the future of Europe, we would have found the way of agreement that will lead us to continue to attain more success."
"A treaty that should ensure more transparency and as has been said more efficiency."
"A Treaty that should help us strengthen the voice of every European citizen."
"I note with pleasure that even my country, which I represent, will increase its strength in this Parliament."
"The European Union is facing important challenges that we must face as soon as possible."
"We must compete in this globalised world and therefore we should have the necessary targets to meet these challenges, challenges like climate change, immigration, how to create more work and better conditions for our workers."
"We can meet these challenges only if we have a more efficient and transparent European Union."
"(PL) Mr President, I hope that the understanding that was reached in Berlin concerning the most important problems currently inherent in the Reform Treaty will culminate in a positive outcome during the forthcoming summit in Lisbon."
"I also hope that the Polish government - bearing in mind that 80% of the Polish people supports our membership of the European Union - will see its way to final acceptance of the draft treaty, and will thus demonstrate that it understands the slogan of 'a strong Poland in a strong Europe'."
"One of the most important achievements of this understanding will making the Charter of Fundamental Rights legally binding, and I am pleased that the President of the European Parliament, the President of the Commission and the Presidency are planning a ceremony of joint promulgation of the Charter during the plenary session of the European Parliament."
"This is evidence of how important this document is, dealing as it does with such problems as dignity, freedom, equality, solidarity, citizens' rights and the administration of justice."
"Consequently I do not understand and do not support the stance of the Polish government, which wants an exemption from the duty under the provisions of Chapter IV of the Charter, entitled Solidarity, where Polish citizens are concerned."
"This Chapter contains provisions that are particularly dear to the Polish and European left, relating to employee and union rights."
"Any wise government should care about providing the citizens of its country with greater and more effective protection of employees' rights, especially in a country like Poland, whose freedom was brought about by the workers' uprising of the Polish Solidarność."
"I therefore call on the Polish government to change its stance on this matter."
"(PT) The informal summit in Lisbon could bring to a close a troubled period in which Europe's ambition crossed swords with crisis."
"The new Reform Treaty will not have the power to restructure Europe; that would take a European Constitution."
"The new Treaty is an under-achievement compared with the lost Constitution; it is a small leap in history, rather than a great leap; it is all it can be, not all it should be."
"But it does represent certain progress in terms of Europe adapting its institutions to the new geopolitical challenges and future debate."
"We must recognise that the emotional element in the referendum restricted the purely rational element of political representation."
"Public opinion was ill-prepared for a visionary and cosmopolitan approach, which brought us to a more timorous and closed process than the process in the Convention which paved the way for a Constitution."
"That point should not be forgotten by those who sit round the table at the next meeting of the European Council."
"The Council's task is now to secure the unity needed for the Treaty in accordance with a principle of maximum limitation of exceptions; to avoid, in the derogations from the Charter, hidden erosion due to opt-out clauses in the original gentlemen's agreements (such as the Ioannina compromise) and to ensure that the Treaty is of a unitary rather than a fragmented order."
"The Council's other task is to stage-manage ratification of the Treaty; that is essential in order to avoid a change of direction in the European trajectory so dear to all citizens."
"It is time to accept that the legitimacy of Europe comes above all from the universal values it is upcoming, from the consistency of its democratic institutions, from the shared project to achieve global justice born precisely of excellence of reasoning."
"That is the legitimacy of Europe."
"(PL) Mr President, I would like to join in congratulating the Portuguese Presidency in dealing with the process of reaching a compromise over the Union Treaty."
"This was a very difficult process and really did require a huge effort to bring about an understanding."
"This Treaty is not the treaty of our dreams, and it is not a treaty that illustrates the visions and dreams of Europeans today."
"Nevertheless, it is what we have at the present time on the road between dreams and reality in the European Union."
"I am convinced, and I hope, that this Treaty will be accepted by all European states."
"Meanwhile, here in the European Parliament today, I must express my firm opposition to the declaration made by the government in Warsaw that it does not accept the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"Non possumus, I am saying this non possumus in the European Parliament as a Solidarity activist from the period of military rule."
"Poland pointed the way to freedom and democracy for all Europe, and today the Polish government has the audacity to state that it will not apply the Charter of Fundamental Rights in our country, in my homeland."
"I protest against this, in the name of that part of the Polish population, men and women, who will never come to terms with Poland not being bound by the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"(EL) Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate the Portuguese Presidency on the determination, speed and proactiveness it has shown."
"Thanks to it, we today have a text of the Reform Treaty, which is to be put forward to the Intergovernmental Conference in Lisbon."
"I hope that the governments there will rise to the occasion and assume their responsibilities so that we can emerge from the deadlock we find ourselves in."
"I would also like to assure the Portuguese Presidency that the overwhelming majority of this Parliament's Members stands by its side and we expect a positive outcome on this issue."
"First of all, we need agreement, then ratification by all the states."
"I have heard various observations about the efforts being made for the further unification of Europe and I have been surprised by those who hide their anti-Europe philosophy by invoking the better in order to destroy the good."
"Let them be honest: if they do not achieve better unification or integration of the EU, then let England, France, Germany, Poland face the challenges of globalisation alone."
"Let them come to ensure peace when nationalistic rivalry leads us once again into crisis and perhaps to war."
"We must understand that the vision of the EU cannot simply be swept under the carpet; we must promote and realise it."
"Our aim should be to maintain constant progress, so that all these states and peoples face a global future rather than a merely European future, on the basis of principles and values."
"That is the vision that we must promote, and this European Parliament stands by your side, Prime Minister."
"Mr President, it is very nice to have my name on the wall together with a Secretary of State and a Commissioner - it is a big moment!"
"I would like to make three points if you would allow me."
"I have been involved in three intergovernmental conferences myself as a civil servant."
"My view on intergovernmental conferences is that, for the past 25 years, we have either been preparing, negotiating or ratifying a new Treaty."
"I do not know about you guys - Mr Corbett and the others - I, at least, am getting to the stage of IGC fatigue."
"We need to get this over and done with."
"There have been too many IGCs; they have been constant."
"I am not against change - quite the contrary - but at some stage we need to calm down, and I think, in two weeks, we will end up doing that."
"My second observation is that, of course, I would have liked to have had a Constitution, but let us live with the reformed Treaty as it stands."
"It is a great improvement on what we have."
"Of course, we all have criticisms, not least on the opt-outs, not least on the question of whether it is simplified or actually more complicated."
"We all have our qualms, but remember: it is very strong on foreign policy; it gives us a legal personality; it gives us fundamental rights - at least some of us - and it gives us more qualified majority voting."
"Of course, there is always room for improvement at the end of the day, but this reformed Treaty is what we have."
"So, to the UK and to Poland I say, 'Calm down and accept it'."
"The final point I have is that I really do believe that it is time to try to restore trust between the Member States."
"We have been on a negative wave ever since the Nice negotiations, when the small were pitted against the big."
"Now it is time, I think, to bury the axe and restore trust, the way in which we used to have it before Nice."
"It is time to calm the institutions down, settle the issues and focus on real policymaking."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the first place I would like to thank the Members of the European Parliament for their very significant support for the endeavours and the work carried out by the Portuguese Presidency within the scope of the Intergovernmental Conference leading to the approval, we hope, of a new Treaty for our Union."
"To those who spoke less favourably, or even against, I would like to say that the Presidency will take note, and it is our obligation to do so, of those concerns and criticisms because we regard them all as part of the collaboration in our work and our endeavours, and they must naturally also be taken into consideration."
"I think it was Graham Watson who said here that Portugal's Prime Minister must feel that he is preparing his army to fight the Intergovernmental Conference battle on 18 and 19 October."
"That is one way of looking at it and I would say that I am a soldier in that army, hoping that many other soldiers also present here will join our army, so that in Lisbon we can actually achieve a new Treaty on European Union."
"The Intergovernmental Conference has finished its work of the lawyers and experts."
"Now it is the politicians' turn to pronounce at the level of justice and I am sure that the politicians and governments will be equal to their responsibilities."
"It has been said here that we cannot fail and the Portuguese Presidency fully concurs with that statement."
"We cannot fail and we are going to build an agreement which will, I am sure, have everyone's support; it could not be any other way."
"We will pay attention to the sensitivities, interests and concerns of all."
"We will not disregard anyone."
"As I say, we are therefore confident of success, given the feeling that a debate which has perhaps been running for too long needs to be drawn to a conclusion as well as the perceived urgent need to create a spirit of construction, union and positive energy in order to face many other problems which we shall have to confront in the future and which have been mentioned here: climate change, energy issues, immigration, our own internal reform, which we need to achieve in order to face the more general problems of globalisation."
"I am sure that the feeling of urgency with regard to the conclusion of a Treaty, in order to inspire us to win other battles, will be felt in Lisbon and that when we return here for the next Plenary, we shall be bringing you glad tidings, bringing you good news."
"I would like to thank the Members of the European Parliament once again for the support they gave to our team of lawyers and I am sure that they will continue to support them in subsequent phases, as many speakers have mentioned here."
"Just a word about the question of the Lisbon Strategy in order to thank João de Deus Pinheiro for his speech."
"We are going to introduce a new element into the debate on the Lisbon Strategy and that is bound up with the foreign policy dimension of that strategy."
"It is fundamentally bound up with the need to lay down rules, to regulate, on matters where there are no rules and there is no regulation, in order to achieve effective progress, social stability, economic stability and peace in an ordered and regulated world where the rules and standards are clear for all to see because we must all, so to speak, deal with them so that in fact the world we are building will be a fairer world for all."
"As I say, I shall be here with the Presidency."
"I know that the Prime Minister of Portugal will also be intending to come here and I shall be with him at the next plenary session; we are confident that we will be able to announce that the European Union has a new Treaty: the Reform Treaty."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, thank you for this interesting debate."
"You always learn a lot of new things and I can, of course, promise that I will report back to the Commission."
"I have taken careful notes so that we can follow up also at the meeting that will take place in Luxembourg next Monday."
"I have heard three direct questions that I would like to respond to as well as I can."
"The first one alludes to Parliament's involvement in the procedure of appointing the first High Representative."
"The Treaty here reproduces the 2004 text."
"I am sure that everybody will want to find a pragmatic political solution that can satisfy all sides when this moment comes."
"You may remember, of course, the precedent of Commissioners appointed after recent enlargements."
"There, too, Parliament got satisfaction in practice, although the legal texts were not clear."
"I think it is in our interest to make sure that there is a satisfactory role for Parliament in this whole procedure."
"The second question had to do with Article 24 of the Treaty, on protection of personal data in the field of security."
"Here, at least, I can respond for the Commission, which understands Parliament's concerns on provisions relating to the transmission of confidential data by the Member States."
"As it stands now, Article 24 of the EU Treaty allows the Council alone to define the rules in this field, with no possibility of involvement of the European Parliament."
"This new provision, of course, stems from the IGC mandate."
"It applies to Member States only, whilst the European institutions remain subject to the general regime, and the foreseen procedure complies with the very specific regime that exists on the common foreign and security policy."
"Here, it means that the competence of the Court is restricted."
"I am afraid that there is little margin to change the substance agreed in the mandate, but, in any event, I want to reassure you that we do not read this article as covering, for example, the EU agreement with the United States on passenger name records."
"That agreement currently has a third-pillar legal base and, therefore, in the Commission's view, it will therefore be covered by the normal competence of the EP and the Court in the future."
"So this is how the Commission sees those issues."
"I am seated so that I can actually watch all our visitors."
"I am not sure that we can always explain very clearly what we are discussing here, but I am sure that the visitors have felt the type of frustration that comes from this debate and the fact that some are very happy with this, they say it is a good compromise; others are not pleased at all and say that this is not good enough; others say that we are going too far."
"Of course, it reflects the political situation and the difficult political game that comes after a long period of actually having discussed how we can adapt our decision-making procedures to enlarge the European Union of 27 Member States; how we can actually incorporate also the new issues that have emerged lately, like climate change and energy; how we can be more open and effective."
"All the visitors also remind me that, whatever the outcome - and we think and hope, with the help of the Portuguese Presidency, that we will have a good outcome, that we will be able to agree a new Reform Treaty - we will have to communicate; we will have to engage with citizens to try to do our best to explain."
"I hope that the Commission and the European Parliament will be able to plan also the communication activities together by making sure that we also provide a text which is as accessible and readable as possible; that we can create a debate which is European, so that you can, hopefully, follow the debate in other Member States as well - and with a political commitment from all of us, all the institutions, to engage with citizens: to explain, to advocate and also to listen."
"This is our role from now on."
"This is only the beginning."
"We also have the ratification and the implementation awaiting us."
"But, for me and the Commission, we believe that this is a good Reform Treaty - not a perfect one: it is, of course, a compromise; we would have wanted no opt-outs but really good support for what is in there on the Charter of Fundamental Rights especially, but we have a compromise, we have an agreement between all the Member States - and now we will make the best of it."
"(Applause)"
"That concludes the item."
"Written declarations (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (HU) Hungary has always championed support for the Constitutional Treaty - or, in its new form, the Reform Treaty."
"Hungary's interest, and the Union's objective, is that we should safeguard peace and our fundamental interests, and promote the welfare of the citizens of the Union, already approximately 500 million in number."
"Europe has changed, and the world has changed."
"The new security threats must be responded to with new strategies and new policies."
"Europe must prepare for change in all areas."
"I believe that the Reform Treaty can help to set Europe's course, and to define its future operating framework, policy and the Europe in which we would like to live and succeed."
"I consider it important that the heads of state and government act responsibly at the informal summit on 18-19 October, setting aside their historical grievances, and that they reach a unanimous decision on the final text of the Reform Treaty, which can move the Union in the right direction."
"The objective of the summit is to adopt the text of the Reform Treaty, thus reinforcing the effectiveness of the enlarged European Union, and to increase the role of the European Parliament, the only elected body, and also the Union's external action."
"The European Parliament has guaranteed and will guarantee its full support for the constitutional process and the creation of the Reform Treaty right up to now, and it trusts that the 27 Member States will ratify it as soon as possible."
"The representatives of the parliamentary groups will ensure that the Parliament is present at the Lisbon summit, thereby also reinforcing the creation of the Reform Treaty."
"The essential thing is that we need a Europe in which 27 Member States feel a joint responsibility for us to take suitable steps together for a better future."
"The time has come, and we have to prove it in Lisbon!"
"in writing. - (FR) The draft Reform Treaty corresponds precisely to the mandate approved by the 27 in June."
"It translates their political commitment to the letter, and should enable the European Union to leave behind the political impasse it has found itself in for more than ten years."
"I now ask the members of the European Council to keep their word and stop raising 'off-mandate' questions in extremis."
"This is not the time for minor last-minute arrangements, sudden nationalistic reactions, or withdrawal reflexes that are in danger of making this Treaty lose all its coherence, by introducing lots of accommodating opt-outs."
"The adoption of this text should respect the timetable envisaged, with a view to the Treaty of Lisbon entering into force on 1 January 2009."
"We should now be focusing on raising awareness among our fellow citizens, who are now more demanding and critical of the European Union."
"They need explanations, and we should be providing them, showing ourselves to be good teachers."
"It is the responsibility of every one of us to share our enthusiasm in this new context characterised both by a return to the European mindset and by the imperative of democratic transparency."
"Membership of Parliament"
"The next item is the report by Alain Lamassoure and Adrian Severin, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the composition of the European Parliament."
"rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the motion for a resolution is a response to an invitation by the European Council in June."
"Article 9 A of the draft Treaty states that in future the composition of the Parliament will be a matter for secondary legislation."
"This will be a decision of the European Council, adopted by unanimity, on the initiative of the European Parliament and with its consent."
"The Council is inviting us to explain how this procedure should work."
"It wants to see us deal with this hot potato."
"For our Parliament, this is a real political challenge."
"Are we capable of coming up with a reform that applies to ourselves?"
"The last time we were asked to do this was in 2000, and Parliament did not manage to do it."
"For this reason the vote secured in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs is already a remarkable political result."
"We obtained a large majority: two thirds in the final vote and three quarters on the main point, the distribution of seats, in terms of actual numbers, between the Member States."
"What is the problem we are facing?"
"We should first remember that the current Parliament of 785 MEPs no longer complies with the new legal position resulting from the amended Treaty of Nice."
"It is this system that would apply, based on 736 MEPs, in the absence of any new decision."
"Up to now, in the Council and in Parliament, the Member States have been divided into categories: one supersize state, some large ones, some medium-sized, some small, etc."
"This is over!"
"The future Treaty introduces two types of innovation in relation to this system."
"On the one hand, there are actual figures: a maximum of 750 MEPs, a ceiling of 96 and a minimum of 6 seats per Member State."
"On the other, there is a principle: between the maximum and minimum, the Member States must be represented according to degressive proportionality, and it is our job in Parliament to define this principle today, namely to choose how much proportionality and how much degressivity there is, or how over-represented the least populous countries are and how under-represented the most populous countries are."
"Your committee is proposing that this principle should be translated in the following way: firstly, the minimum and maximum numbers set by the Treaty must be fully utilised."
"In particular, the use of the ceiling of 750 seats will give us a small reserve -as it were - of seats, so degressive proportionality can be applied without reducing the number of seats of any country."
"This is a fundamental political choice, and is absolutely necessary to obtain unanimity in the European Council."
"Secondly, the larger the population of a country, the greater its entitlement to a large number of seats, of course."
"Thirdly, the larger the population of a country, the more inhabitants are represented by each of its Members of the European Parliament."
"So at present, a Spanish MEP represents more than 875 000 people, Mr President, while a German MEP represents only 832 000."
"Up to now, Germany has had twice the population of Spain."
"This anomaly will be put right by the allocation of four additional seats to Spain."
"In total, ten countries are affected by the proposed increases."
"We are fully aware of the fact that this is only a temporary solution."
"It would be desirable to come up with some sort of mathematical formula that would automatically apply to any future enlargements, but the tight timescale given to us did not allow this."
"However, the resolution makes some recommendations on this point."
"Similarly, we had to use the only population figures available, those from Eurostat, since we did not have any figures from the citizens themselves."
"Adrian Severin will say more about this."
"Finally, we would warn our fellow members against amendments that contradict the fundamental principles of the report and will have the effect, depending on the case, of giving the large countries an abnormal advantage over the smaller countries or small countries over the large countries, in which case our work will have been in vain, because without unanimity in the Council we will have to stick with the 736 seats of the Treaty of Nice."
"So, ladies and gentlemen, please refrain from bidding up your countries."
"We have spent the afternoon proclaiming that we are the only democratic institution protecting the interests of Europeans before the other institutions, above national egotism."
"Now, today, we have the perfect opportunity to show that our actions are faithful to our words."
"(Applause)"
"rapporteur. - Mr President, our proposals - Mr Lamassoure's and mine - confirmed by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, bring a number of improvements to the current practices regarding the composition of the European Parliament."
"If adopted, and properly enhanced, there will be no more artificial groupings, no more arbitrary negotiations, no more enlargement at the expense of the efficiency of the European Parliament, which is always growing with the number of Members."
"There will be more representativity, based on demographic realities and not on nominal or symbolic legal relations, more solidarity between the big and small states resulting from the digressive proportionality of the representation, and full legitimacy based on the civic representation resulting from the fact that the European Parliament is elected by European citizens."
"One should note the difference between the democratic legitimacy of the European Parliament, which is based on the vote of the European citizens, and national representativity within the European Parliament, which is based on the demographic realities within the Member States."
"We, the European Parliament, are representative of citizens and of the states at the same time."
"(Murmurs of dissent)"
"You see, immediately, some say only citizens, others say states."
"We are a Bundestag and a Bundesrat at the same time."
"A clear separation of this dimension should, perhaps, be considered in the future, but for the time being - once we have accepted that the citizens are voting and that digressive proportionality should take into consideration the size of the communities living on national territories - I am sorry, but we are both."
"Of course, within this framework, the concept of European citizenship is still to be clarified, and I hope that this will be done in the near future."
"Our report, however, is not provisional but transitional."
"It is transitional because I believe the principles we have defined are long-lasting, but progress is needed, and I am sure that in the future we can add to what we have already proposed to you."
"Therefore, we have included a number of revision clauses which to our minds - Mr Lamassoure's and mine - will assure flexibility, adaptability and future progress in the way in which Parliament is composed."
"Nobody is penalised by this report."
"Maybe those with a better demographic policy are rewarded, and certainly it is an invitation for a better demographic policy, including migration policy."
"I do not think anybody loses - and, perhaps, nobody wins - in terms of a zero-sum game."
"As long as we have a more democratically legitimate Parliament, everybody wins."
"We have some amendments."
"Some colleagues would like to reduce digressivity in favour of proportionality - more proportionality means more seats for the big countries."
"Some others would like more digressivity and not more proportionality."
"More digressivity means more seats for small countries."
"Therefore, I believe that we have to reject both these extreme options in order to promote the option which is, I agree, imperfect, but which for the time being is the best one."
"This is the option proposed by Mr Lamassoure and myself."
"Some would look on the basis of reference."
"Some would like all their national citizens, irrespective of their country of residence, to be taken into consideration."
"Others would like to see all inhabitants in their countries being taken into consideration."
"Others are trying to see only the European citizens residing in a certain country."
"So we are divided on that."
"The only solution is to stick with the actual practices and the actual Eurostat figures."
"Finally, there are some who are fighting for political prestige and think that, if we are not equally represented in this Parliament, we are unequal in our political weight."
"I think that once we have accepted digressivity - and proportional digressivity - these artificial groupings cannot survive any longer."
"If we fail to adopt this resolution, I am afraid that the European Parliament will send the message that it is not able to adopt an important reform and that it has to always wait for the executive institution to decide for it."
"I think that the IGC will suffer a first failure before it can even consider the issues on its agenda, and this failure might be a prelude to a total failure."
"I am afraid that everybody will go back to Nice and not to illusory dreams."
"I am afraid that, then, we will give a message which will mean a split between the big and small countries, and this will undermine any dream of unity, fairness and inclusion."
"Therefore, I end with an appeal to all my colleagues."
"I make this appeal to our sense of European responsibility and European solidarity."
"Hic Rhodus, hic salta!"
"Here is Rhodes, and let us prove here that we are true Europeans, and not when giving lessons to the Commission and the Council."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, the report provides clarification for which I would like to express my sincere thanks to both rapporteurs, Messrs Lamassoure and Severin."
"It makes clear that we are constantly exceeding the stipulated upper and lower limits."
"I would like to express my thanks specifically for this."
"This clarification is important for us all."
"Secondly, there are two outcomes to this report."
"Firstly, the less degressive the scale we have, that is, the more we gear ourselves to proportionality, the more genuine authority and legitimacy Parliament has."
"The conflict as to how much degressivity we need - how much less, how much more - must be continually managed and it is logical here, I believe, for us to say the less the degressivity, the greater the legitimacy."
"As a German, I would also add that it is somewhat problematic, of course, that we as Germans are the only ones getting less than we did on the basis of Nice."
"We would like a little bit more support here because the discussion in the German press is very explicit in this regard."
"We shall accept this because we too believe that the European aspect is more important than all the others."
"Finally, two findings which we ought to utilise for the future."
"Firstly, we really ought to be working towards obtaining a logical system in the long-term, which we do not have to be constantly renegotiating."
"Secondly, there are two controversial amendments, 2 and 3."
"Our Group has decided that irrespective of how the vote goes on the two controversial subjects, in the end the Group will vote in favour of the Lamassoure/Severin Report."
"The Council has no excuse."
"In Amendment 2, which differs only minimally from the figures in the Lamassoure Report, the outcome would be that the Council is given a message from Parliament for the period 2009-2014."
"Hence our Parliament and all the Groups have on balance, as I believe, fulfilled their duties and the Council can decide, if it is willing."
"Many thanks for a fair discussion on such a difficult subject!"
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, on behalf of the PSE Group, I would like to support this report."
"My group will be voting for it and we hope that this text that was adopted by a 70% majority in committee can now be endorsed by an equally impressive majority in Parliament as a whole."
"The rapporteurs have - sensibly, in view of the legal constraints laid down by the new Treaty, in view of the time constraints laid down now before the conclusion of the IGC - focused on correcting the main anomalies in the current distribution of seats rather than embarking on proposing a radical overhaul of the system, which could only have led to deadlock in the IGC and endangered the approval and ratification of the new Treaty."
"In particular, no Member State will see a reduction in the number of seats that it is entitled to under the current treaties where they provide for the distribution of seats from 2009 onwards - except, of course, where it is laid down in the Treaty itself for the Federal Republic of Germany."
"With that sole exception, no country will see a reduction compared to what is planned already in the Treaty for 2009."
"Now, of course, some of our colleagues are trying to win more seats for their own Member State, sometimes arguing that their country's population is suddenly much bigger than we had all assumed beforehand, bigger than the Eurostat figures that are used by everybody, including the Council."
"Others are arguing, for reasons of national prestige, that they should have the same number of seats as another particular Member State."
"I must confess that I am very surprised at the attitude of the Italian Government."
"I understand that Mr Prodi, and indeed some Italian Members here, have been arguing that it is essential for Italy to have the same number of seats as France and the United Kingdom."
"Yet they accepted - we all accepted - the principle of proportional degression: proportional to population."
"I accept that my country will have one seat fewer than France although we have always had the same size up to now."
"I do not see why it should be so difficult for Italy as well to accept that it has fewer seats than France for exactly the same reason."
"And I am surprised that a government from a country that has so often said that it is the example to us all in terms of being communautaire, that it has a strong European commitment, that it is not nationalist, it always puts Europe before its national interests, that now Italy and Mr Prodi is arguing that Italy, for reasons of national prestige, should have the same number of seats as France and the UK, even though its population does indeed differ."
"To conclude, may I urge that this House support this report, reject the amendments and send a clear strong message to the European Council."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, the ALDE Group will also support the Lamassoure-Severin proposal."
"The IGC is asking us to change our composition to suit the terms of the Reform Treaty, and that is a perfectly proper request."
"We, as a Parliament, need to send a strong, clear message back that we are able to take such a sophisticated and brave decision."
"There is no pure, definitive formula."
"Paragraph 6 applies a practicable and sensible definition of degressive proportionality."
"Of course, I, too, accept that some national delegations are seeking to improve their position on the league table, but it transpires that all such proposals are mutually contradictory."
"All those who seek to alter the system fail."
"The D'Hondt proposal would give too much clout to the larger states, and I would say to Mr Friedrich that his proposal breaches the Treaty principle of degressive proportionality."
"The square root system gives too much clout to smaller states."
"I completely accept that the Italians raise an interesting point about the statistical basis, and we should examine, as a Parliament, the distinction between nationals, citizens, residents and voters."
"But the issue is extraordinary complicated, and it treads firmly upon national sovereignty in the area of electoral law and citizenship."
"We cannot possibly solve such a problem inside the space of a week before the end of the IGC."
"Following the IGC, there will be a report from the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, for which I have the privilege to be appointed rapporteur, that can address all these questions and propose a reform of the primary law of 1976."
"But all of that is for next year rather than the present state of affairs."
"Meanwhile, let us give solid support to the proposal and send a solution, rather than a problem, to the IGC."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - Madam President, I would like to join my colleagues in thanking the co-rapporteurs for their efforts with regard to what is a very difficult and complex issue."
"Ultimately, despite what some colleagues may say, turkeys do not vote for Christmas, so why would any present Member of the European Parliament look to see their seat being taken away?"
"There is a legitimate reasoning behind the desire of those who seek to have the highest number of seats available to them in each of the national categories."
"I would be slow to denigrate that attitude in anybody."
"Because, if anything, when we look back over the changes that have occurred since the first direct elections to the European Parliament took place in 1979, there have been phenomenal demographic and population trend changes across the European Union, not least because of the expansion of the European Union into eastern Europe in 2004, which allowed for the free movement of so many people into other countries, which has altered the populations greatly."
"I think one of the careful elements that we have to speak about (and we can speak about degressive proportionality till the cows come home) is that there has always been a balance between the different institutions - and also a balance between the larger and smaller Member States - to ensure that no one institution would have total domination over another, or that larger Member States could not dominate medium-sized or small Member States."
"That is why it is important to maintain this balance as much as possible."
"I welcome the rapporteurs' inclusion, in a compromise amendment, of maintaining that interinstitutional balance."
"But, as well as that, when we look at the figures that have been used - and much has been quoted by other colleagues here with regard to the Eurostat figures - out of the 27 countries, the figures that Eurostat for 15 of those countries are using are only provisional figures from the central statistics offices of those countries."
"So, decisions are being made on only provisional figures when that could have a lasting impact with regard to the future allocation of seats in Parliament."
"We must also keep an eye on further enlargement taking in Croatia, which would also impact negatively."
"Therefore, I would urge caution when voting on this issue."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, my Group will not be voting for this report because the proposed system of representation, and the distribution of seats, disregards basic democratic principles, sustains historic inequalities and is contrary to the nature of this House as representative of the citizens and of its electors."
"These are not dreams that are not being fulfilled."
"Yes, Mr Severin, there are many who are wanting a great deal, but what we should all be wanting is to be getting some idea of what a Parliament is."
"A Parliament is not - as the rapporteurs told us in their letter yesterday evening - the representation of the Member States' socioeconomic capacity."
"No, it is the representation of the electors and nothing more."
"It is the representation of citizens or it is not a Parliament!"
"It is not a Parliament if there is no demos on which to base ourselves, and it is not true that the term citizenship in Europe has nothing to do with the term under international law or the term citizenship in the United States."
"It is precisely the same and I would advise you to look at the existing treaties."
"I would advise you to look at the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, in which the rights of those citizens are laid down."
"I would advise you to look at the rules governing access to the European Court of Justice."
"I would advise you to look at the rules on how we become voters."
"Then you will recognise that it is the easiest thing in the world to find out who is a citizen of this Union and who is entitled to vote for this Parliament."
"This is decided every five years."
"The inhabitants, the population, these are a symbolic expression of socio-economic capacity."
"But we have already failed here once, when we were asked in Nice: dear Parliament, just tell us yourself what you want your composition to be."
"We failed on that occasion."
"Unfortunately, we have not used those seven years to clarify what this Parliament is."
"We are therefore reassessing the historical nonsense and the historical practical constraints that have arisen to date."
"These do not have anything at all to do with democracy and thinking on the Constitution."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Madam President, there are different views in my Group."
"I, however, support the report by Messrs Lamassoure und Severin."
"With the report Parliament responsibly keeps its right of initiative to submit a proposal itself on its future composition."
"It does so thanks to the intensive work done by both rapporteurs in a genuine European spirit."
"The proposal is well balanced, it is based on a clear, comprehensible and transparent system, and can also be sustained for future enlargements."
"The proposal follows the principle of diversity."
"By using all 750 possible seats, it also ensures that in future Parliament will reflect the whole range of the main political orientations from each country."
"The proposal is also based on the principle of solidarity, hence the larger, most populous Member States agreeing to have less influence in order to allow the smaller, least populous Member States to be better represented."
"All this helps strengthen the Union's cohesion."
"I therefore hope that the Council unreservedly and speedily implements Parliament's proposal before the 2009 elections."
"One further comment in conclusion."
"All the people who live in the Member State concerned form the basis for calculating a Member State's seats - as with the Council - including third-country nationals living there, because they are part of this society."
"However, this is only one side of the coin."
"Third-country nationals whose homes are in our Member States must also have the right to vote for the European Parliament."
"I have always fought for this and I shall continue to do so!"
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Madam President, the usual thing to do when we have such a report before our hands is to argue what one country should get and what another should lose, which only proves that European solidarity is a myth and national egoism always triumphs."
"In light of the recent German aggression by Mr Schulz against the President of the European Commission, let us look at a good method of winning at the zero-sum game."
"In paragraph 8, we witness a lamentation that Germany will lose seats."
"We hear more and more of this lamentation: that more EU documents should be translated into German, that Germany is the biggest net contributor to the EU budget, that it should have its own seat on the UN Security Council and so on."
"At the same time, Mr Severin is trying to convince us, through his undefined degressive proportionality - which, coincidentally does not affect his own Romania - that when Poland loses three seats, it actually gains one."
"I only wish that his concept would work this well in the casino."
"But let us get things clear."
"Only a socialist from Yorkshire could accept that two plus two is five."
"on behalf of the ITS Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Lamassoure-Severin report should be scornfully rejected because of its ideological anti-Italian subtext and the superficial nature of the technical arguments versus the political arguments on which it rests."
"I will not enter into a discussion of the merits of how much the ius sanguinis weighs with me as compared with the Jacobinism of the ius loci, as this is clearly absent from the thinking of the rapporteurs and those who commissioned the initiative."
"I am not a legal expert, nor do I have a major reputation like Professor Manzella, chairman of the Italian Senate's Committee on European Affairs, nor like other fellow Members, who can challenge with equal precision the legal inconsistency of the assertions made in the report."
"I believe, however, that it is worth stressing that for the rapporteurs incontestable facts do not count: in politics it is the assessment and the role that Italy has had in the past and still has today in the institution of Europe."
"The very poorly Italianised principle of degressive proportionality, redefining the allocation of seats established in the Constitutional Treaty that has been put on hold, has been applied with clear discrimination against Italy."
"For some countries brackets have been left in the system, and there are some glaring instances of distortion of the facts, such as the allocation to Estonia of the same number of seats as Malta, although it has three times the population."
"We can accept that in the United Kingdom people with the right to vote include residents who are not European citizens, and on this basis the rapporteurs allocate the UK one more seat than Italy, even though of those with the right to vote only a little more than one third voted in the 2004 election."
"We can accept that France, which compiles its electorate and fills up its demographic profile with the same variety of birthplaces that can be seen in its national football team, is allocated two more seats than Italy."
"We can accept the sloth of the Italian Government and we saw the flight at the time of the preliminaries to the debate in the Council."
"There is something, however, that cannot be accepted."
"The rapporteurs cling to their debatable sense of citizenship."
"They claim that anyone living in Europe, even if they hold passports and citizenships from outside Europe, is a voter."
"They exclude from the calculation, however, citizens living outside Europe."
"This gives an idea of the gross, manipulative and unacceptable anti-Italian discrimination that we most strongly reject!"
"(SK) First and foremost, I would like to express my support to the rapporteurs, Mr Lamassoure and Mr Severin, for their report."
"We must reconcile ourselves to the fact that the Slovak Republic will lose one Member as a result of the agreed principle of digressive proportionality."
"In relation to the proportional allocation of seats in Parliament, this principle should be extended to all areas of EU employment policy."
"I therefore ask for an increase in the number of representatives and employees from the 12 new Member States in all EU institutions."
"I think that every Member State has a sufficient number of qualified people who can make a valid contribution to the EU."
"Equality is one of the principles underlying the EU."
"Even the original Member States committed to honour this principle when they welcomed among them the 12 new Member States."
"It should apply to all areas and not just the positions of Member of the European Parliament or Commissioner."
"I call for the principal of equality to be observed and honoured."
"When the new Member States joined the EU they had to fulfil many criteria."
"Now I appeal to the EU as a whole to fulfil its commitments towards them."
"(SV) Madam President, by supporting Mr Lamassoure's report the European Union can take a historic step."
"With this report we can leave behind a time when the number of seats in the European Parliament was distributed on the basis of a system where different countries were categorised in different groups, on the basis of the negotiating skills of different heads of government, and where it is assumed that the EU's Member States have conflicting interests."
"If Parliament chooses to support Mr Lamassoure's report, we will leave behind this system and move to one based on the proportionality principle, where a country's size affects its representation in Parliament."
"The system that we have had up to now has been very difficult to explain, but the system that we can get with the Lamassoure report is possible to explain."
"It is based on a maximum and a minimum level and on account being taken of the number of people in the different countries."
"This principle is also tenable looking to the future."
"It means that the interests of one country or another are not furthered, but the number of citizens is taken into account."
"This is a step forward in the democratic process in the European Union."
"I want it to be quite clear what alternative we are facing."
"We either support the proposals set out in the Lamassoure report or we go back to the Nice agreement with its arbitrariness and negotiations marked by conflicting national interests."
"When I hear the latest speakers from the benches up here and their agitation, I can also hear the national interests in relation to conflicts."
"The Lamassoure report should be supported because it is based on a principle."
"(PT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the report of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs drawn up by Alain Lamassoure and Adrian Severin on the future composition of the European Parliament is an important contribution which highlights a balanced and objective solution on a matter which is, politically speaking, highly sensitive."
"I should therefore like to congratulate the two co-rapporteurs."
"We should remember that it was last June's European Council which promised the European Parliament, by October 2007, a solution to the problem of its future composition so that the solution could be applied in time for the 2009 European elections."
"To those who feared that Parliament would be unable to resolve that question due to the prevalence of nationalistic ideology this report is an apt response and demonstrates that this institution is proficient at pinpointing and expressing the common European interest within the national dynamics which tend to complicate intergovernmental matters."
"It is important to set out the European Parliament's position for the smooth running of the work of the IGC, which should be completed in Lisbon on 18 and 19 October."
"It is therefore essential to acknowledge the political link between this new proposal on distribution of seats in line with the principle of degressive proportionality and the reform package for the Union's institutions, in particular the double majority principle for the definition of a majority in the Council."
"I would like to take the opportunity to stress that the institutional aspect of the Reform Treaty needs to be coherent and that, as regards the question of double majority, which will ostensibly enter into force only in 2014-2017, the Treaties should not contain any gentlemen's agreements like the Ioannina compromise, which remain in force but, whilst they are legally recognised in the current framework, would merely serve to block the decision-making process in the Council."
"We knew from the outset that the composition of the European Parliament would not merely be a question of mathematics."
"Within the limits of the present factors, the solution to be devised would have to meet three principles: the principle of solidarity according to which the Member States with the biggest population accept that they will remain underrepresented, the principle of plurality to make it possible to have representation over the full range of the principal political orientations in each country and the principle of efficiency keeping the maximum number of representatives limited to a level compatible with the role of a legislative assembly."
"With the application of the principle of degressive proportionality, the reports will achieve a reasonably consensual proposal."
"In conclusion, Madam President, I would like to say that the European Parliament does not need to regard the agreement obtained as perfect before it can give its political consent."
"Despite its weaknesses, the current text enhances the European Parliament's credibility and is infinitely better than the irresponsible dragging out of an arm wrestling match between national egotisms, which would cost the Union and its citizens dearly."
"On the eve of an important European Council, this House, which represents our citizens although I find it hard to follow the idea that this House also represents the Member States, is putting the European interest first trusting that the Heads of State will do the same."
"(SV) There is a large group of citizens who have been ignored in the discussion on the composition of the European Parliament."
"I am thinking of the almost 50 million Europeans who belong to a regional or a national linguistic minority."
"Today we are only a handful of MEPs who represent these groups."
"This is not acceptable and, sadly, it gives a false image of the European Parliament."
"It is as if we do not understand the vulnerable position in which certain linguistic minorities still live."
"The report by Mr Lamassoure and Mr Severin, which is based on the principle of 'degressive proportionality', is a brilliant display of statistical work and I too will be voting in favour of it, but we must now also dare to begin discussing other substantive issues."
"How will we increase the citizens' trust in the European Union?"
"How will we guarantee that the EU and the European Parliament live up to the aims that we want others to pursue, that is to say how will we ensure that the voices of minorities are also heard?"
"Ladies and gentlemen, will we MEPs tolerate regional and national linguistic minorities being left at the mercy of the goodwill of national governments which may give them a seat, or do we want those minorities not to be represented in the European Parliament?"
"The answer should be a resounding no!"
"So as to ensure diversity it is therefore time to reserve a number of seats in the European Parliament for linguistic minorities."
"I myself speak for the Swedish-speaking population of Finland and for the province of Åland."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report on the composition of seats at Parliament contains some obvious contradictions, reinforced by the letter sent by the rapporteurs yesterday, as if to justify their position regarding such politically delicate questions, and it distorts the legal concept of citizenship as it has always been codified."
"The principle put forward by the report goes beyond both nation states and the treaties."
"From a legal viewpoint, European citizenship is the legal status enjoyed by those, and only those, who hold citizenship of a Member State and who are, as a result, in possession of all the rights and duties connected with that status."
"It is citizenship, and not residence, which must be the test."
"This proposal also distorts the approach taken in the draft of the next treaty, which clearly specifies that the concept of citizenship has nothing to do with residency."
"The European Parliament has wasted a great opportunity to demonstrate to the other institutions the capacity to find within itself solutions based on legal principles that are commonly recognised and shared."
"I would ask the rapporteurs why they did not even consider the possibility of using, for the purposes of allocating seats, the number of citizens in the Member States rather than the resident population."
"Perhaps it was to benefit some states more than others?"
"Look at the case of the United Kingdom, which grants the right to vote in European elections even to those who are not EU citizens."
"Mr Lamassoure and Mr Severin: stating, as you have done, that nobody has been penalised as compared with the Nice agreements, seems to me an obvious distortion of the truth, which others will be called upon to remedy."
"For this reason, we cannot back this report."
"Not only that, but it is also detrimental, not only for our country - my country - but also for the other countries of the Union."
"It is also detrimental to representative democracy and the future treaty, which, as you yourselves recognise, contains guidelines and principles on which the distribution of seats at Parliament ought to be based."
"We cannot ignore the concept of European citizenship as the basis of the democratic legitimacy of our Parliament."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am in favour of a decisive role for the European Parliament, which is often argued against, but it seems that the governments wish to use this proposal to manipulate our Chamber."
"This proposal for the composition of seats is, in our view, ill-advised."
"Italy is being penalised, and that is a cause for concern, but what matters most of all is that the reasons for this penalisation are ill-founded."
"A historical parity is being destroyed, and, worst of all, the allocation of seats is being altered in the name of a resident population not granted the right of citizenship."
"Those who, like Italy, have given the right to vote to citizens not resident in the country are being penalised."
"What we need is something totally different: I think, for instance, that we really need a citizenship of residency, but one that would count not only in terms of the number of Members of Parliament to be elected, but also in terms of the right to vote and to be elected."
"We need to guarantee representation for political minorities and small states, setting this out expressly in the criteria to be adopted in national electoral laws, and we need to think about new arrangements that make the most of the European parties and their ability to present themselves as such in elections."
"None of this appears in the report, and for that reason I will be voting against it."
"(DA) Madam President, the report that Parliament will be adopting tomorrow will effectively halt the accession to the EU of Turkey and other populous European countries."
"Germany will have its say in the Council doubled, whilst smaller countries will have theirs halved."
"At the same time, some of the larger countries will obtain more seats in Parliament."
"On the whole, Germany will continue to be compensated for having had the same number of votes in the Council as Italy, the United Kingdom and France, even though it currently gets maximum value out of every German in the Council."
"I do not think that the larger countries will produce such gains again, and the smaller countries cannot produce any more if the electorate is to perceive decisions as legitimate: listen to Mr Lax."
"I would appeal to the largest countries to stop and think."
"There cannot be both voting according to population figures in the Council and an approximation of the same voting principle also in Parliament."
"In the United States, there is equality between states in the Senate."
"In Germany, Saarland, with one million inhabitants, has three votes in the upper house of the German Parliament, whilst Rhineland-Palatinate, with a population of 18 million, has six votes; thus the German system is hardly fair."
"When my country joined the EC, Germany had three times more votes in the Council than Denmark; now it will be 15 times more."
"Previously, Germany had three-and-a-half times more seats in Parliament than Denmark; now it will be eight times more."
"That is too uneven, and will never have the understanding of the electorate."
"It will destroy the EU - that is the problem."
"(NL) Madam President, allow me to begin by expressing my doubts about the timing of the resolution now under discussion."
"It is true that the June European Council asked Parliament to present a draft concerning the future composition of Parliament, but we now discover that the whole proposal is based on the Reform Treaty, a text that has yet to be ratified, let alone enter into force."
"In other words, we are putting the cart before the horse."
"Incidentally, it is not the first time this has happened, and it is really starting to become sickening."
"I am speaking here not on behalf of the Identity, Tradition and Sovereignty Group but as a representative of a small Member State - or rather a future Member State, as it is no longer a question of if but when Belgium will be split up and Flanders becomes an independent state."
"I digress."
"I think that the principle of degressive proportionality advocated by this report is the most workable and also the fairest starting point if one believes at least that the smaller Member States and their representatives in this Parliament must be able to go on playing a meaningful role."
"In any case, I support a broad interpretation of this principle of degressive proportionality, and therefore intend to support the relevant amendment by Mr Bonde."
"In my view, it is in the interests of the European Union that the smaller Member States have the best possible representation in the European Parliament; if not, we shall see a further fall in popular support for the European institutions."
"(PL) Madam President, today we have two successive debates here in the European Parliament which will tell us what the order will be in the European Union and how power will be shared out."
"For me, as a representative of Poland and the League of Polish Families, this is a very sad debate."
"I take a highly critical view of this new attempt to introduce the Constitutional Treaty under the new name of Reform Treaty, as well as of the new distribution of votes in the European Parliament, which discriminates against my country."
"The report, based on highly dubious and far-fetched arguments that was adopted in the European Parliament's Constitutional Committee, clearly strikes at some countries and favours others; and not for the first time, either."
"I cannot give my consent to that."
"I am also calling on the President of Poland to reject this Treaty in a week's time in Lisbon."
"Madam President, I think this is one of the saddest days in our plenary work over these five years because it is the first time I, at least, personally, feel that this has become an intergovernmental body."
"This reminds me of the nights in Amsterdam in 1997; this reminds me of the nights in Nice in 2000."
"And today in the group, and I think here in plenary, we can see what it is all about."
"I really thought that the European Parliament was here to represent the interests of all European peoples, not narrow national interests."
"We have three options on the table: one is the Severin-Lamassoure proposal, which I think is a European proposal."
"It is an excellent proposal and they have done a fantastic job and should be congratulated for it."
"(Applause)"
"The second option that we have is to go back to Nice."
"Perhaps some of us want that;"
"I do not know."
"But do we really?"
"Is that why we are going through this whole debate?"
"Do we want to go back to Nice?"
"Does Spain want to lose seats?"
"Does Poland want to lose seats?"
"I do not know."
"The third option is what I call a provocative option and that is two provocations: one, to give the big states a hell of a lot more and the small states a hell of a lot less."
"The other provocation came from the other side, to give the little ones a lot and give absolutely nothing to the big."
"Is that what we want?"
"Is that what we are here for?"
"I do not think so."
"At least, I do not hope so."
"Tomorrow's debate is about the credibility of the European Parliament and whether we can take a rational, logical and fair decision."
"Are we capable of coming up with a proposal, or are we just like the Member States?"
"(Applause)"
"(DE) Madam President, fellow Members, Parliament is providing an input with this Lamassoure/Severin Report."
"We will be distributing the seats in 2009, whereas the new formula for distributing votes in the Council of Ministers will not apply until 2014."
"We are now ready to introduce this operation for the next period."
"The entire proposal, however, only applies if there is a new treaty."
"If the new treaty is not implemented, the Treaty of Nice and the accession treaties will remain in force, which means that all countries will have fewer seats."
"There should therefore be great interest in backing this proposal in the Plenary tomorrow."
"I thank both the rapporteurs, Messrs Lamassoure and Severin, for the work they have done."
"We cannot satisfy everyone; that would be a miracle."
"However, I do protest against what has been said by the Polish here, that somebody is suffering discrimination."
"There is no discrimination against anyone."
"On the contrary, a proposal has been put forward, which is plausible and adheres to objective criteria, on the basis of which the seats we have can be distributed."
"We must, however, continue a debate which our Italian colleagues have started, namely the debate as to whether the concept of citizenship in the European Union is the same as the concept of citizenship at national level."
"The nation state has closed the borders and excluded all others."
"The EU is based on a different concept and we are in fact broadening this debate in order that all residents of the EU are represented by us and not just those in possession of a Member State's passport."
"There are 30 million in the EU who do not have the passport of a Member State, but who abide by our laws."
"We shall be coming back to this once again next time."
"Thank you for this proposal, which now brings us on track to a successful conclusion for the Intergovernmental Conference and for a new European treaty."
"Madam President, I would just like to say to Mr Stubb that Lithuania does not gain in any of the cases he gave."
"(LT) I would like to say to Mr Alexander that Lithuania will have the same number of seats in all three cases, because in the first case it is determined, in the second case it is determined, and in the third case..."
"When we are debating here as Parliament (as the President of the Parliament is not in the chair for this important session), when we are debating about Parliament and I do not see Mr Lamassoure."
"Is he here in the Chamber?"
"Why should we talk?"
"The key individuals have left."
"Everything is obvious."
"I speak about this because we really have to talk about a common home, a common Europe, and hear every voice of every country."
"The problem of my country is that we have fought for our survival for many centuries."
"We are a small nation."
"Now many people live in other countries, they work in your enterprises and, practically speaking, they will be unable to solve Europe's problems."
"We try to maintain a relationship, to be together, to be a nation and will not disappear from the map, but these people will not be able to vote because the number of Members of the European Parliament will be set in respect of the number of citizens, yet they live in your country, Alexander, as well as Great Britain and Ireland and they work there honestly."
"Of course, they can elect the representatives of Sweden, Finland, Britain or Italy, but in this way we are simply declining as a nation."
"So this is the most important issue that makes me worry and am so sorry that, as Mr Lamassoure says, in this Chamber we really talk little about values."
"Today's debate is a perfect example."
"Looking at the surnames, I know who has got how many seats and I can say in advance what opinions will be presented."
"(PL) Madam President, I have long since become used to the flagrant hypocrisy that prevails in this House."
"But today I would like to ask one question."
"Alright, what you want, as I am hearing from most of the speeches that have been made, is for there to be a change in the voting principles and the allocation of seats in the European Parliament so that citizenship of a given country should not be decisive, in other words you are saying that we are already looking at an integrated European people with a unified standard and unified interests."
"This then is a European people."
"I would like to ask all you hypocrites how it can be that poor old Poland has only one third of the agricultural subsidies, that the Germans, the richest of all, despite the common energy policy, want to negotiate over the heads of other states with Russia and run a pipeline under the sea, with its threat to environmental protection?"
"Can these two things be reconciled?"
"And if what I say is true, then is it not too early yet to create the myth of a European state?"
"We need to work towards it, but slowly and systematically, whilst accelerated actions of this type can only lead to results that are the opposite of what is intended."
"(ES) Madam President, I understand the difficulty of the undertaking, and I acknowledge and commend the work done by the rapporteurs."
"However, on some points the proposal for the distribution of seats that they make is, in my opinion, too discretionary and also does not take sufficient account of the necessary institutional balance inherited from the current Treaty of Nice."
"Some MEPs have therefore signed amendments that will be submitted to the plenary tomorrow and which, I would like to stress, fully respect the principle of degressive proportionality; and also in our view, they objectivise the allocation of seats for the future, linking it to clear and transparent criteria."
"One of these amendments, which I should like to focus on, which would enter into force in the 2009 elections, is in line with one of the most prudent studies produced by the Spanish Government and sent to Parliament and the Council."
"As you will understand, ladies and gentlemen, I am not guilty of defending the proposals of the current Spanish Government for partisan reasons, but what is true is that, in this case, the demographic factor is taken into greater account, and it should be considered to be essential in shaping the institution that represents the interests of the people."
"Therefore, Madam President, I would ask the rapporteurs to take them into consideration, and my fellow members to vote for them, and in any case, I hope that they will be submitted, defended and taken into account by the European Council when it makes its decision next week."
"(ES) Madam President, this was not an easy undertaking, and I think that Mr Lamassoure, from the Group of the European People's Party, and Mr Severin, from the Socialist Group, have presented us with a magnificent report that has a profound sense of being European and pro-European."
"Mr Stubb is right: this is one of the saddest debates that I have attended in this House, but I hope that tomorrow the result of the vote on this report will be one of the best moments that we experience, because this report, which is not only theirs but also belongs to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, with 70 % support, firstly responds to what the Council has asked of this House; secondly applies the principle of degressive proportionality, thirdly, guarantees a representative Parliament, something that would have been impossible with the Treaty of Nice, partly because under this treaty, in an unjustifiable and unjustified way, some countries like Spain ended up with no proportional logic in terms of their representation."
"Fortunately, the proposal by Mr Lamassoure and Mr Severin, of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, adequately resolves this problem."
"This is the question: either this report or Nice."
"Either this report, with a representative Parliament, or Nice, with a Parliament that is not fully representative."
"All the promises we want can be made about this, but, of course, what we need is a realistic report so that at the Lisbon Summit, Parliament will have its efforts recognised, and also supported along with the adoption of the new Reform Treaty. Thank you very much."
"(DE) Madam President, allow me to begin by saying that the Members of the Free Democrat Party (FDP) have allowed a free vote for tomorrow."
"There will therefore be no party line."
"Why is this so?"
"There is a dilemma."
"The situation for Germany is, of course, deteriorating."
"Instead of the 832 000 voters per MEP to date, there will now be 858 000."
"Parliament wants to make this happen from 2009 onwards."
"This will not happening in the Council until 2014."
"Reference is being made to this among other things."
"Even good German newspapers like the Berlin Tagesspiegel write that the seats are being redistributed tomorrow."
"There are fellow Members here in Parliament who are saying: Germany will lose three seats tomorrow."
"The problem is - and this now skips to the part by which I personally stand - this is wrong."
"The Lamassoure/Severin report secures the highest possible number of seats that Germany is able to have under the Treaty."
"The Treaty of Nice already stipulates that there is a maximum of 96 seats."
"The report clearly endorses this."
"Why, then, this debate?"
"Why the provocation with the d'Hondt method, in which only the larger countries gain and the smaller ones lose massively?"
"It is a proposal backed, even initiated, by fellow Members from the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) to my great surprise."
"What does it actually mean?"
"I believe that it is an un-European proposal."
"The balance, the just and fair balance between large, medium-sized and small countries, is lost here."
"What is more it is a proposal, which does not have the slightest chance in the Council."
"Do we and our fellow Members in the CDU therefore really believe that in Belgium, Ireland, Sweden or Estonia they cannot carry out any analyses and they will vote for this proposal in the Council?"
"No!"
"This proposal is an empty bubble, which is being replaced without any consequence - with one exception."
"This consequence is a further deterioration in the atmosphere as regards European policy at home in Germany."
"We should support the Lamassoure/Severin Report."
"We should ensure that a strong political signal goes out from the European Parliament to the Council that we are able to deal with the problems ourselves."
"If this signal, a European signal, is strong, it is good for us all and I expressly include Germany in this."
"(NL) Madam President, as has already been said repeatedly in this House, it is ultimately Parliament's credibility that is at stake in this debate."
"At issue is its ability to carry out its task of presenting a proposal with a broad majority, thus making it difficult for the Council to disregard the proposal."
"The virtue of the Lamassoure/Severin report is that, pragmatically, it makes a proposal that meets all the requirements of the Treaty."
"There are not four alternatives, but in fact only two, namely the Lamassoure/Severin report or Nice."
"After all, if we fail to win the support of a broad majority for a proposal, so will the Council, and we will revert to Nice."
"I do not really understand a number of the amendments tabled."
"Although it is clear that the square root amendment strongly supports the smaller countries, this is actually a caricature of proportionality."
"Nor do I understand, however, the amendment instigated mainly by German Members, which takes no account of the position of the smaller countries and requests that more opportunities be given to the larger Member States in the Council."
"Am I to understand, perhaps, that this is a vicious way of returning to Nice and restoring 99 seats to Germany?"
"If that is the case, I find it very debilitating for this Parliament."
"I hope that, tomorrow, Parliament understands that its credibility is at stake, and that this can only be retained by supporting the Lamassoure/Severin report with a broad majority, as that is the only realistic amendment."
"(PL) Madam President, it is hard for me to accept a report according to which my country - I should say, and I shall say, the Polish people, as it is they who elect their representatives - loses the opportunity to elect three additional MEPs."
"That is by how much the Polish representation in the European Parliament is diminished under the proposal that has been tabled today."
"Why do I think that this is unfair, and why do I think that the criteria adopted in this report failed to take into account such obvious facts as those which my fellow Member from Lithuania has already mentioned today?"
"This is about workers, about employees, about Poles who are temporarily living abroad - 3 million Poles abroad."
"Let us assume they have a right to vote in Great Britain or Ireland, but they come home."
"My question is: who is going to represent them?"
"They are deprived of the right of representation even if they had a right to vote."
"This report, and this is my second point, accentuates the institutional imbalance which has existed to date, fragile though it may have been, between the position of the states in the Council and in Parliament."
"Poland is losing the most in the Council with the transition to double majority voting, and it also loses out in Parliament."
"My final point concerns a certain imbalance that has been spoken of here today, in the employment of officials in EU institutions, and especially in Parliament."
"This imbalance, which affects all the new Member States, could be ironed out here in Parliament."
"I am requesting an amendment of this report."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, of course I realise that the task with which my fellow Members Mr Lamassoure and Mr Severin were burdened was not easy, but I must say that the result, despite the efforts that have been made, leaves me rather perplexed, both from the legal viewpoint and in purely political terms."
"The proposal refers for the first time to a criterion for calculation based on the resident population in each Member State, replacing the criterion of citizenship."
"Here a problem of legal and political consistency arises as regards the provisions of the future Reform Treaty, and specifically Article 9A, which expressly sets out the principle of the representation of European citizens."
"I also see the issue as political, partly because Parliament is making the function of the voice and the expression of citizens a little opaque - and what is more, at a time when the Union is undertaking to disseminate the culture of European citizenship, identity and the rights of European citizens."
"And please do not take the issue back to the level of national claims or, worse, reduce it to a mere quantitative issue."
"That would be a totally reductive and vulgar approach, and would in fact be ungenerous to the reputation of Italy."
"I also note, however, a disparity in treatment; there is a lack of homogeneity between one bracket and another; in many cases the reference parameters do not justify the difference in the number of seats between one country and another."
"I will finish, Madam President, by calling upon my fellow Members to vote in a way that is consistent with what is laid down by the Treaties and with what our role as members of parliament has been up until now and ought to continue to be: the expression of citizenship."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Stubb, who has unfortunately left, mentioned sadness this evening, and other Members have also expressed the same feelings."
"I believe, however, that it is sad to see discrimination between countries and MEPs, particularly those who are trying to ensure that fundamental principles are observed, as Mr Voggenhuber and Mrs Muscardini rightly said."
"Here, what is important is not to cast doubt upon the Lamassoure-Severin report; it is probably well constructed, albeit built upon a foundation of sand."
"In fact, there is a legal principle whose import is being completely destroyed, and that is the principle of citizenship."
"This point has also been made by those who have supported the report, as well as in the compromise proposals by Mr Lamassoure and Mr Severin;"
"Mr Leinen mentioned it, and Mr Duff also put it excellently: here we are not sure of our electorate!"
"Still, on this total uncertainty over the electorate we wish to construct a criterion or a castle that has its own internal consistency - apart from the basis or foundation - and this will give us a composition that in no way respects pre-existing realities or the citizens."
"It will also bring us, as a further consequence - and heed what I say, for I do not wish to be a prophet of doom - before the Court of Justice."
"It is natural, and probably a duty, for those who find themselves injured to go before the courts as the extrema ratio, as the supreme decision-making body for such an important decision."
"I appeal to my government, the government of my country, which has shown extreme weakness so far on this process, from the outset in Berlin, to finally rediscover its pride and exercise the right of veto on this proposal."
"(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, between today and tomorrow we have a historic opportunity to influence the decision on the future composition of the European Parliament."
"The report prepared for this purpose by the rapporteurs, Mr Lamassoure and Mr Severin, shows a good measure of quality, balance and responsibility."
"It brings a pragmatic solution, which should be embraced unchallenged by the Intergovernmental Conference, as it does not constitute an obstacle to the adoption of the Reform Treaty."
"The proposed distribution of seats in the European Parliament is based on the principle of digressive proportionality."
"It is a just principle, which expresses solidarity between big, medium and small countries."
"The proposed solution is also based on the principle of demographic realities of individual Member States."
"Again this is a just and correct principle."
"In spite of it, some Members expressed their disagreement with this solution."
"They are of the opinion that their countries were discriminated against."
"I, however, do not see any sign of discrimination."
"Discrimination and inequality would be allocating the same number of seats to two countries with a difference in population of five million."
"I trust that Parliament will grasp the historic opportunity tomorrow and adopt the Lamassoure and Severin report by a decisive majority."
"Not supporting it would signal a return to Nice."
"That is returning to an alternative, which would also represent a loss for those Members who only recently have been touting the slogan 'Nice or death'."
"(PL) Madam President, today we are debating a very important report, on the basis of which the distribution of seats in the next term of Parliament is to be made."
"The rapporteurs have put forward a proposal that is very interesting and certainly must have required a great deal of work, both analytical and conceptual."
"I would like to express my sincere thanks to them for that."
"But as far as I am concerned it does have two serious weaknesses."
"Firstly, our fellow Members are proposing a solution that is ad hoc in nature, temporary, and solely for the next term."
"However, I recall that when we began work on this report in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs we agreed that we would look for systemic solutions enabling an automatic change to be made to the composition of the Parliament when new states accede to the EU."
"The alternative proposal announced by about 80 MEPs, including me, meets this condition."
"Use of the d'Hondt method to calculate the number of votes from individual states is an objective instrument eliminating political horse-trading."
"By accepting this amendment the European Parliament could become the first institution to rise above political and national disputes."
"I accept a neutral, mathematical method of weighing the strength of individual countries."
"This would be a step in the right direction and a model to follow for other multinational European institutions."
"Another weakness in the conception presented is the lack of consistency in the approach to European citizens' rights."
"These include the right to be represented in this forum."
"In my view, the criterion of calculating the size of the Parliamentary representation from population numbers weakens this right."
"For example, how are citizens of Poland who live and work in Ireland or Great Britain supposed to feel?"
"Various estimates suggest that there are between 2 and 3 million such people."
"Under the electoral regulations that are binding in Poland, votes may be cast for candidates standing in Poland."
"But if we take the criterion of population as is suggested in the report, as a result of people leaving the country the number of MEPs elected in my country is diminishing, while it is rising on the islands."
"So who is going to represent them here in this forum?"
"Irish MEPs, or British, or Polish, of whom there will be fewer?"
"The report does not answer these questions."
"In this context I feel it is essential for changes to be made to the report's text, and along with many fellow Members we shall be voting for certain amendments."
"(EL) Madam President, it is widely accepted that the current distribution of seats in the European Parliament does not properly represent the demographic realities in the Member States and that the correlations are unfavourable for certain medium-sized and smaller countries."
"The fact that the report does not reduce the number of seats laid down in the Treaty of Nice is certainly a positive one."
"I must also stress, however, that in the case of Greece an increase in the number of seats provided for, from 22 to 23, would be absolutely fair, since the country's population exceeds by 10% that of other countries with the same number parliamentary seats."
"I should like today, however, to focus mainly on the various amendments that have been tabled and which relate to the method of calculating the number of MEPs."
"One issue is failing to assess the entire population of a country, but only its citizens."
"I am in favour of the concept of the European citizen, but I disagree completely with its application here."
"As an MEP, I feel that I represent those in the section of the population of my country: without necessarily being citizens of Greece or of Europe, they are bringing up our children, looking after our elderly people, building our houses, staffing our universities, contributing to the insurance system and sending their children to our schools."
"Our decisions on the environment, services, immigration and insurance issues, and dozens of others, also in reality affect the lives of these fellow citizens of ours, who are, of course, often the least privileged."
"I therefore believe it to be democratically imperative that the number of MEPs ought to be based on the total number of residents of a country."
"(DE) Madam President, today's debate on the future composition of the European Parliament has unfortunately not been a highlight in the history of European democracy."
"It is perhaps good that neither the Commission nor the Council have found the time to listen to it."
"We have had to listen to speakers who have put forward principles with a very great deal of pathos, principles which have still not brought us any further forward in practical terms and which therefore have nothing to offer apart from pathos."
"We have actually heard very many speakers who have focused on their own national interests."
"This has certainly been no way to success in the search for a European solution and as such, will probably not bring us any closer to a solution either."
"Thankfully we have also heard some who have been pragmatic and looked for comprehensible solutions and therefore in the proposal of both our rapporteurs - Alain Lamassoure und Adrian Severin - have found a suitable base."
"I believe we should express our sincere thanks to both rapporteurs for the work they have done in committee as well as in what follows next."
"This is something that Mediterranean courteousness would normally always demand, but in this specific case both rapporteurs have really earned these thanks."
"From someone who does not come from the Mediterranean, therefore, my sincere thanks to you."
"I hope and am also looking forward to us perhaps experiencing an historic moment for this Parliament tomorrow at the vote."
"That is, if we manage to get clear and definite majorities for the proposal by Messrs Lamassoure and Severin and are thus able to give another clear signal to the Council."
"The European Parliament has at any rate put forward a sensible base for the 2009 elections."
"(EL) Mr President, in order correctly to assess the report by the two rapporteurs, Mr Severin and Mr Lamassoure, we need to take into account certain facts and to apply certain rules."
"First of all, we must approach the report in a European manner, not a nationalistic one."
"If we fail to do so, we will be faced with competition over which country gets more seats and which fewer."
"Secondly, we must take into account certain facts, for example the European Parliament is not deciding today on the composition of Parliament, but is making a proposal to the Council."
"The Council has a certain margin and foundation on which to build, even it is based on the past, which we may think is not particularly well-balanced."
"In addition to this, we have to apply the arithmetical facts we have been given."
"There are 750 MEPs, 96 per country at most and 6 per country as a minimum."
"We cannot also start bargaining about parts of the population which are inside and outside."
"We ought to reach a compromise based on the existing situation in line with the population and with what applies to other sectors."
"We are not here to re-found the EU."
"When we do, let us use different calculations."
"What matters today, therefore, is that we reach a result which has the widest possible support from the European Parliament, so that we retain our credibility and at the same time open up the way for European and not nationalistic movements."
"Let me appeal here to the esteemed Germans, who have always been generous; besides, if in the past they had displayed the tendency they have today we would have no EU."
"I also appeal to my fellow Members from the other states, so that tomorrow we can adopt the Lamassoure and Severin report with the greatest possible majority."
"Mr President, once we move away from strict proportionality in elections, we inevitably end up applying political compromise rather than pure mathematics."
"The democratic principle that all votes should have equal weight is something that cannot be applied until such time as the European Union becomes a fully federal system."
"Within the limits set by the Council, this political compromise by Mr Severin and Mr Lamassoure is a reasonable and well-balanced effort to achieve fair play and solidarity for all the people of the European Union."
"I support it, and I oppose the alternative systems that are being proposed as less fair and less balanced."
"But, because some have approached this exercise as a national ego trip, it needs to be emphasised that we are dealing here with how citizens elect their representatives to this Parliament according to their political preferences, to act as a co-legislator with the Council; it is the Council that represents the state, and not this House."
"(MT) Like the European Constitution, the Reform Treaty will introduce the principle that a Member State, no matter how small, should have adequate representation and cannot have less than six seats in the European Parliament."
"Malta, my country, which at the moment has five seats, will increase to six seats."
"This gain will heal a wound, as it were, that happened no less than seven years ago when in the Treaty of Nice Malta was given five seats instead of six, like Luxembourg, which has the same population."
"Six seats instead of five means a 20% increase in representation and it also means that the Maltese Members in this Chamber will be in a better position to perform Parliamentary duties that are always on the increase."
"Suffice to say that in this House we have more than 20 Parliamentary committees which, with six MEPs, it is very difficult to keep up with. With five it is impossible."
"These Committees are now preparing laws that bind all citizens including Maltese citizens and it is appropriate that the citizens of each country, even the smallest countries, are in an adequate position, in a good and reasonable position to be represented and heard in each of these committees."
"Even more so when one considers that under the new Treaty, the European Parliament will increase its powers and will be co-legislator with the Commission, indeed in all sectors."
"The minimum threshold of six seats is thus a positive step that will increase the small countries' faith in the European Union and therefore I believe that we should support the Lamassoure-Severin report."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, it is never more difficult to understand an explanation than when the promotion of your interests depends on not understanding that explanation."
"I am afraid that many of our colleagues have vanished because they are not looking for an explanation: they simply wanted to make their points, and that is all."
"However, I would like very briefly to make some clarifications."
"Firstly, if this report fails, we are not only going to go back to Nice, but worse than Nice because, according to the mandate of the IGC, the Treaty will mention the 96 seats as the maximum level for one country - so it will be Nice, and Germany will have 96."
"By acting against this report, Germany will not secure the 99 seats they have today; they should be aware of that."
"Ms Grabowska asked, what about the Polish citizens who live partially in Poland and partially abroad?"
"It depends on their residence: whether they are tourists abroad or abroad for a short time does not matter, but if they are resident abroad and they are just visiting their families in Poland, they will be taken into consideration where they live, but they will, of course, be able to vote in the same way as any European citizens."
"Ms Grabowska also asked, who is going to represent them?"
"This is absolutely clear - the MEPs for whom they vote."
"All European citizens will have the right to vote, and all European citizens will be represented by those MEPs for whom they vote."
"A number of colleagues said, and I am only quoting an Italian colleague: for the first time in the history of the Union, we take into consideration the residents and not the citizens."
"False!"
"We have always taken into consideration the inhabitants, the population, since the Treaty of Rome."
"If you want to change this custom, you can certainly change it, but please do not say things here which are completely false."
"I will end with this: if there is a problem, the problem lies with the lack of harmonisation of the national legislation on elections."
"Certainly, I would be in favour of the approximation of that legislation, but this is a different issue."
"This takes time and we have to address this issue separately."
"I wish luck to the rapporteurs who are going to deal with the approximation of the electoral legislation;"
"I hope that they will succeed."
"For the time being, I only hope that tomorrow, after a night of reflection, we will have a vote that will indeed reinforce the credibility of this institution."
"My fellow Member has been given additional time as rapporteur."
"I would like to reassure Mr Severin that this is not connected either with his report or with his person."
"My experience tells me that parliamentarians are people who speak better than they listen."
"And this was the way it turned out during this debate."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, 11 October 2007."
"Written declarations (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (PT) This proposal falls within the ambit of the 'European Constitution' which is to be taken up again at the Lisbon Summit in relation to a new Treaty, once again asserting the pressures and threats previously brought to bear before it was rejected in the popular referendums in France and in the Netherlands in 2005."
"Instead of upholding the principle of sovereign States with equal rights, which would require at the minimum that much-vaunted solidarity on the part of the more populous countries and respect for the balance within the various institutional bodies (Council, Commission and European Parliament), the intention is to set minimum and maximum numbers and to apply degressive proportionality based on population, thus subordinating countries as a function of their population and constantly detracting from the representative nature of democracy."
"The imbalance which existed before the Treaty of Nice is not even taken into account."
"Thus, for example, Portugal loses two Members and is left with only 22, whilst Spain gains four; it is certain that Germany will lose three, leaving it with 96; in addition France will have 74, the United Kingdom 73, Italy 72, Spain 55 and Poland 51."
"The six European powers alone account for 420 Members, many more than the majority of a European Parliament with 750 Members representing 27 Member States."
"That is why we will be voting against the report."
"in writing. - (SV) The distribution of seats among the Member States in the European Parliament must not on any account be arbitrary."
"At the late-night negotiations at the Nice summit the Member States were generally reliant on how awake a single man, a Head of State or Government, was during the night-time hours."
"For Sweden the outcome was extremely bad."
"Even though our population is roughly only one million smaller than Hungary and the Czech Republic, we were given five fewer seats in the European Parliament, 19 seats rather than 24."
"It is important that we have a principle for the distribution of seats that is fixed over time with a view to the continued enlargement of the Union's membership."
"It is also important to establish the principle of over-representation of smaller states in accordance with a degressive distribution."
"This report proposes improvements on the current distribution of seats in the European Parliament."
"We therefore support it."
"However, we are firmly opposed to the idea of creating one constituency across the whole EU."
"It would mean having to reduce the size of national delegations even further."
"Creating a separate EU constituency is an artificial way to try to create a European demos."
"There is no common political arena in Europe."
"An attempt to break barriers of language and tradition by creating an EU constituency is doomed to failure."
"The humanitarian situation in Gaza"
"The next item is the statement of the Council and the Commission on the humanitarian situation in Gaza."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the short-term regional and international outlook before us presents a window of opportunity for a peaceful dynamic for resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and setting up a Palestinian State, an opportunity which the international community cannot miss."
"We are at a crucial moment which could enable us to make significant advances in the Middle East peace process."
"The bilateral political dialogue under way between Prime Minister Olmert and President Abbas and the recent setting up of the negotiating teams on both sides are courageous and encouraging steps which we approve of and support and which we hope might enable tangible results to be brought to the international meeting in the autumn, a meeting instigated by the United States of America."
"We hope that the current dynamic, which also notably includes participation by Arab countries, will make it possible to move towards the setting up of a viable, democratic, independent Palestinian State, to coexist alongside Israel in peace and security."
"The European Union, both within as well as outside the Quartet, has shown itself to be a trusted impartial partner committed to the success of the dialogue between the parties."
"Thus we remain committed to the political process, the mission to create the bases for a Palestinian State and to supporting the economic development of the Palestinian territories."
"The meetings of the Quartet and the ministerial Ad Hoc Liaison Committee in New York on 23 and 24 September respectively, once again emphasised the international community's support for the diplomatic efforts under way."
"In the Quartet meeting's final communication, the European Union and its partners in the Quartet expressed their concern over conditions in Gaza and stressed the importance of continued humanitarian and emergency assistance, and also regarding the provision of essential services for the Palestinian people."
"Moreover the Quartet's representative, Tony Blair, warned of the urgent need to develop the Palestinian economy and the respective institutions, as prerequisites for the appropriate functioning of the future Palestinian State."
"It was stressed that it was important for the Quartet's representative to draw up a multi-year agenda for economic and institutional development of the Palestinian territories."
"That concern, as well as the need to mobilise financial and technical assistance from the international community for those projects, was also stressed by the international donor nations meeting at ministerial level within the meeting of the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee."
"Various international reports mention the deterioration in humanitarian conditions for the population in those territories; a situation which nurtures poverty and violence, promotes radicalism and extremism - a cycle which urgently needs to be broken."
"The Israeli decision of 19 September to declare Gaza a hostile territory and the possibility envisaged of broadening the scope of sanctions imposed on Gaza would, if applied, potentially exacerbate the current situation."
"Although the European Union recognises Israel's legitimate right to defend itself, it also underscores the need for the Israeli authorities to carefully weigh the implications and consequences of its decisions on the life of the people of Gaza."
"The European Union has consistently reaffirmed its full commitment to continuing humanitarian assistance to Gaza."
"The Union is the major donor."
"In 2006 the total amount of Union assistance from the Commission and the Member States was EUR 688 million."
"In 2007 the Commission allocated more than EUR 425 million, divided between humanitarian assistance and social assistance, strategic support for the setting up of the State and advice on economic reforms."
"The Temporary International Mechanism, extended for three more months until the end of the year, was one of the means favoured for channelling donor assistance in view of the complex situation in that area."
"Furthermore, the Commission is intending to restructure assistance to the Abbas/Fayad Government in order to make it more efficient and productive."
"We do, however, think that the European Union should not bear that financial burden alone and that it would therefore be desirable for other partners, in particular the Arab States, to make a contribution to this effort and to bear some of the cost of building the Palestinian State."
"The EU stressed the importance of reopening entry and exit points in Gaza, with a view to securing the movement of people and goods in accordance with the agreement on access and movement."
"European support also envisages assistance to the private sector, the motor for economic development in the long term, in particular by granting support to the Palestinian Government to settle its debts with the private sector."
"These are short-term solutions which must not lose sight of the long-term objective of economic development of the Palestinian economy and finances."
"In fact, the long-term outlook should be evaluated in order to move progressively from the current phase of emergency assistance to a phase of assistance for economic development - that is, a transition from hate to trade."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, two weeks ago I was in New York where there were many meetings of the international community on the question of Palestine."
"There was an important meeting of the Quartet, of which I am a permanent member as part of the EU delegation, and an Ad Hoc Liaison Committee meeting of the major donors to the Palestinians, in preparation for a pledging conference that will probably take place at the end of December, after the international meeting that is now being prepared."
"The main conclusion for all of us, as the President-in-Office has already said, is that there is indeed a crucial opportunity for regional and international partners effectively to support the peace process."
"I must say that, knowing how difficult this is, I am at least cautiously optimistic about the prospects of a serious and substantive meeting being hosted by the US this November."
"I wish to thank those who have mentioned the contributions we have made, but let me also say that I have spoken out very clearly to our Arab partners, because it is those partners that have not yet contributed in the same way as we have."
"I have called on them emphatically to do the same for their Arab friends."
"We also stand ready to play our part in the future, and indeed we hope that this international meeting on the Middle East will be a next step towards having more ongoing, positive talks and hopefully, at the right moment, a Palestinian state living side-by-side with Israel within secure borders."
"I am well aware, of course, that the delivery of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip has become much more difficult."
"For instance, two projects in the sector of water and sanitation, financed by the Commission's humanitarian office, have had to be suspended."
"The partners implementing those operations did not succeed in importing the necessary materials, because the importing of items such as spare parts for hospitals and water pumps has been banned."
"The European Commission has not been idle in responding to this situation."
"On the contrary, humanitarian and emergency aid to the occupied Palestinian territory, including Gaza, has reached unprecedented levels."
"We also continue our support for the precious work of UNRWA in Gaza."
"Commissioner Michel has recently deployed new support through the World Food Programme in order to respond to the basic needs of the most vulnerable Palestinians."
"Our direct emergency support to low income and social hardship cases continues through the payment of social allowances."
"In September we disbursed allowances to 35 000 poor families in the West Bank and Gaza."
"This demonstrates the added value of the temporary international mechanism, which is able to operate efficiently throughout the occupied Palestinian territory."
"By September our fuel provision to the Gaza Strip had surpassed 90 million litres. That fuel provides 25%, or one quarter, of the electricity needs of the local population."
"For those reasons, I requested the Quartet, at the latest meeting in New York, to extend this financial mechanism until December."
"Also in New York, at several meetings and with different interlocutors, I yet again pleaded on several occasions for progress on the access and movement agenda."
"We are very happy that Tony Blair is awarding close attention to this, as he wants there to be an economic possibility of development."
"This, of course, is not possible without freedom of movement and access, notwithstanding the justified security concerns of the Israeli Government."
"I believe that much more could and should be done, but that will require more political will than we have witnessed so far."
"I also agree with Parliament that the closure of the Gaza crossings has dire implications for the livelihood of an already impoverished population, as well as for the required humanitarian response."
"The Karni crossing point has been closed for almost four months now, so our aid has to pass through Karem Shalom and Sufa."
"We only see this as a temporary arrangement, firstly because the facilities at those crossings are inadequate and result in extra handling costs - up to 40% of the cost of aid supplies - and secondly because restrictions on the equipment we want to get into Gaza create problems for our project work."
"Having said that, our actions must also take into account the illegal takeover of the Gaza Strip."
"Our policy is consistent with the Quartet's line and the position of the legitimate government of the Palestinian Authority, and we of course support President Mahmoud Abbas."
"On 23 September, we and other Quartet partners made our position quite clear."
"We expressed great concern over the continued closure of major crossing points."
"We agreed on the importance of continued emergency and humanitarian assistance without obstruction, and we called for the continued provision of essential services."
"Allow me also to refer finally to the situation within the West Bank, which should not be forgotten."
"Despite recent announcements made by the Israeli authorities about the reduction of checkpoints, the reality on the ground is, unfortunately, quite different: things are getting worse."
"It is not only that the settlement policy and construction of the security barrier continue, but also that 48 new checkpoints have been installed, according to a recent report by OTCHA."
"It is essential that we see progress in the access and movement agenda."
"Otherwise, the chances of a future sustainable Palestinian state are being undermined."
"Let me just add that already, with a view to the next Foreign Affairs Council, the preparations for the draft Council conclusions emphasise very clearly the dire situation in Gaza and underline the importance of uninterrupted emergency and humanitarian assistance without obstruction."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, once again we stand here and we repeat: the situation in Gaza is appalling."
"Once again we all agree: something must be done."
"Therefore, it is my honour, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, to table this resolution, and I welcome Article 5 fully supporting the Maryland Convention."
"But, frankly speaking, can I be positive, knowing that we urged you, and I called on you in this place before summer started, to be ready for a humanitarian crisis operation and for contingency planning?"
"Many of you thought I was asking for foreign intervention."
"No!"
"I simply knew that being ready for a humanitarian operation would help us to react in a fast manner when the inevitable situation comes."
"It is October, and we are not very much farther."
"Of course people in Gaza deserve our help: our immediate, short-term quick fix."
"But for many years of our collaboration in the Middle East, we all know well that quick fixes do not count."
"What we really need here is to solve the causes of suffering of Palestinians."
"Many here think - and I strongly disagree - that Israel is the only cause of suffering."
"I was in Gaza for the first time in 1990."
"I also saw Hodeida, Tanta, Benghazi, Ismailia, to name just a few other places in the Middle East which look very much the same: no occupation, no military intervention."
"Mismanagement, corruption, nepotism, police regimes - these are the Pudelskern."
"We have to name them; we have to focus on how we can help those who suffer from both."
"We have to have patience to see the truth, to analyse properly and objectively, to design help, to prepare tailored projects, to invest money, to teach and to lead."
"And to be unforgiving. To be sharp, to be responsible."
"In Gaza, Ottomans, the British, Egyptians, Israelis, Americans and Europeans are all part of the problem. But the main part is Palestinians themselves."
"We can only help them."
"They have to stop any use of threats, abuse, violence, terrorism and killing."
"They have to stop corruption."
"They have to stop nepotism and pashaliks."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Mr President, since mid-July, when Hamas seized power in Gaza, one-and-a-half-million people have been confined to what the inhabitants themselves call a ghetto, a cattle farm."
"Even cancer patients are not allowed out of the region."
"Israel takes the view that they live in a hostile entity."
"The only things that come in are food, medicines and a few humanitarian goods - but people cannot live on just flour, lentils and medicines."
"Israel's definition of humanitarian goods is absurdly restrictive."
"Components for medical devices cannot be imported, the water supply system cannot be repaired."
"There is a constant threat of Israel interrupting the energy supply."
"The economy of Gaza has collapsed, the people are unemployed and despondent, and there is no money left."
"Malnourishment is beginning to rear its head."
"The blockade breeds despondency, anger and hatred, not peace."
"Gaza is experiencing an unacceptable humanitarian crisis."
"Calls for assistance are growing and, on top of this, the costs of assistance are rising as a result of the blockade."
"Thus, the Member States must provide more financial support to UNRRA and the other organisations on site."
"The European Commission has already taken that step, as have some Member States."
"The European Parliament, too, yesterday voted in favour of increasing assistance."
"My group urges the Council to support that decision."
"Assistance alone is not enough, however."
"The Presidency has remained diffident, cautious, on the subject this evening - but the European Union can no longer take the moral responsibility for providing assistance, whilst refraining from taking political action against the blockade."
"On behalf of my group, I would therefore request that the Presidency, the Council and the European Commission call on Israel to end the blockade immediately."
"In Gaza the whole population is being punished - which is illegal under Article 33 of the Fourth Geneva Convention."
"Besides, this method does not befit Israel, and the European Union should be telling Israel this instead of remaining passive - precisely because it is an ally."
"This would give meaning to the Association Agreement with Israel, as only by taking action against the blockade will the EU do justice to the section on human rights."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I speak not on behalf of my group, but as a Member who has seen things he did not wish to see."
"I hope the Minister does not believe the sanctimonious claptrap he read this House."
"To suggest for one moment that the policies of this European Union are impartial is just ridiculous."
"Everyone knows that we pursue a policy of double standards."
"We expect and demand the Palestinians to obey every requirement. We merely request that the Israelis meet our wishes."
"Those double standards reek."
"Commissioner, do you remember standing here just a few months ago, after the Palestinian delegation had returned from meeting Mr Haniyeh in Gaza, before the breakdown of the Palestinian Unity Government, saying to this House that you wanted to do everything you could to support that Government?"
"Within a fortnight, of course, it had fallen!"
"It had fallen partly because we had refused to talk to the elected representatives."
"We had refused to talk to Mr Haniyeh and, not surprisingly, having undermined the democratic forces, the forces of violence took over."
"We never seem to learn the lessons of history."
"We have to stop ignoring the wishes of the Palestinian people."
"We have to start paying some respect to the forces of democracy, and we have to recognise that you cannot make peace without talking to your enemy."
"(Applause)."
"The continuing refusal to deal with some of those elements in Hamas who want to take a step towards us just makes promotion of peace in the Middle East impossible to attain."
"One question about the motion for a resolution before us: why are we even thinking about giving money to Gaza?"
"What has it got to do with the European Union?"
"Gaza is an Israeli prison camp!"
"It is nothing to do with us."
"It is the Israelis who should be responsible for keeping one and a half million people alive."
"They are the ones who keep them in misery."
"It is not our responsibility to be providing our taxpayers' money to meet Israeli responsibilities."
"Finally, again on this question of impartiality, we have heard within the last couple of weeks that the Israeli defence force has ordered the confiscation of more Palestinian land to build the roads to enable the building of the E1 settlement - the further expansion of Jewish settlements in East Jerusalem - against every commitment we have requested the Israelis to make, and against every hope there could be for a genuine outcome from the forthcoming peace talks."
"As the Palestinians see all hopes of a viable, independent Palestinian state disappearing before their eyes, what is the European Union going to do about it?"
"You know very well that it is going to do nothing except mouth a few words and take no tangible action!"
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, I was a member of the five-man delegation from the European Parliament which spent a couple of important days in the Palestinian Autonomous Area."
"I can categorically state that our mission was humanitarian in nature, not political."
"I am saying this because I would not like our debate to turn into a very political debate, where the European Parliament takes the role of a prosecutor acting against someone."
"I would like us to stand above political divisions and consider how we can help civil Palestine."
"Let us, however, make it clear that it appears that raising the standard of living in the Gaza Strip, normal functioning of hospitals and schools, full access to drinking water, food and electricity, the potential to work normally in agriculture are more likely to cause a fall in tension in Palestinian-Israeli relations and to ensure a weakening of the potential for enmity, where Jewish settlers, Israeli settlers and the State of Israel as such are concerned."
"A few months ago I spoke in this House about the controversial texts delivered in some Palestinian schools, in Palestinian textbooks, but now we have moved from one extreme to another."
"We cannot criticise certain aspects of Palestinian schooling any longer, as that system of schooling has effectively died."
"But this coin has another side to it, an intra-Palestinian aspect."
"The political stalemate between Hamas and Fatah and the President Abu Mazen camp continues."
"This impasse makes it difficult for Palestinian institutions to function, and thus hurts Palestinians who live there, and is certainly not Israel's fault."
"We speak a lot about lasting peace between the State of Israel and the Palestinians, but that is a bit like talking about a house and starting with the roof."
"We should always talk from the foundations up, and the foundations in this case are an improvement in the functioning of Palestinian power structures, public institutions and humanitarian assistance for the people of Palestine."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DA) Mr President, the visit to the West Bank and Gaza a couple of weeks ago that has been mentioned was a shock - even for those of us who have been there many times."
"Israel's closure of the borders and the countless roadblocks make it impossible to develop a healthy economy, and for the EU's rules on humanitarian assistance to be followed."
"The Council and the Commission should intervene immediately to help the Palestinian economy back on its feet."
"Let me make myself clear: without such intervention a peace conference cannot succeed."
"As has been said repeatedly, the economic dimension is inseparable from the political."
"In other words, Israel's occupation must be brought to an end or there will never be peace."
"Besides the economic exhaustion, radicalisation of Palestinians is currently taking place."
"It is growing among the poor - of whom there are more and more as a result of Israel's blockade - and among the young."
"Older generations of Palestinians have warned repeatedly that the young people growing up today have never lived side by side with Israelis, and that their only experience of them is ugly walls, military invasions and teenage soldiers humiliating their fathers."
"This is not the way to create peace, only implacable enemies."
"Nor is there any confidence in the EU, which disregarded the democratic elections in the Palestinian territories and, by isolating Hamas, has demonstrated both diplomatic incompetence and, once again, double standards."
"Unless all Palestinians are represented in the ongoing negotiations there will be no peace, as anyone involved with the issue is well aware."
"As Mr Davies and others have mentioned, all hope of peace will shatter if, as has been reported, the Government of Israel means to expropriate E1."
"Both the USA and the EU have said in no uncertain terms that this must not happen."
"The question that Council and Commission should answer now is what action is planned to prevent this expropriation of Palestinian East Jerusalem."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one minute is nothing."
"Mr Lobo Antunes spoke of courageous gestures and steps: the courageous step Mr Olmert ought to take is to close all new settlements, to free thousands of Palestinians, to stop the military incursions in the West Bank, to remove the checkpoints and to reverse the blockade of Gaza!"
"He should come to the negotiations with concrete steps; instead, yesterday we saw new seizures of land inside Jerusalem."
"Our courageous step, here in the European Union, ought to be to reject any form of collective punishment imposed by the Israeli Government on the civilian population."
"Our plans in Gaza are blocked because there is no cement, there are no pipes, costs have quadrupled and UNRWA continues to instigate emergency measures."
"In the resolution that we will adopt tomorrow we are calling for the lifting of the blockade of Gaza and free movement of people and goods everywhere, but we are aware that the Palestinian issue is not a humanitarian one."
"Our responsibility is political: it is the responsibility to put an end to the military occupation and to call for two peoples and two states, able to coexist in mutual safety."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, at the end of last week a delegation from our Parliament debated the grave situation in the Middle East with our US counterparts as part of the Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue (TLD)."
"During this, the US peace negotiator Dennis Ross gave us the very practical advice to offer the Palestinian population assistance with its precarious existence."
"A network of reliable, politically independent NGOs is needed."
"Council and Commission: to what extent do you envisage real possibilities for both the West Bank and Gaza?"
"I now take the view that the behaviour of Hamas lies behind the present internal and external crisis situation in Gaza."
"It unfailingly delegitimises the State of Israel and legitimises violence against Israelis and Palestinian 'dissidents'."
"Mr President, the recent brutal murder of the Palestinian Christian Rami Ayyad, who was only thirty years old, underlines the perilous position of this minority in Gaza."
"I expect of the Council and the Commission that they devote attention and provide support to the Christian minority in all the Palestinian territories."
"Mr President, Mr Davies asked, earlier on, what role the European Union had in the Middle East."
"Of course, I know it was a rhetorical question, because he is very committed to a solution, but it is a fact that the European Union has a direct interest in the outcome of the Middle East peace process."
"I speak from a constituency in Yorkshire from which the four bombers who attacked London several months ago came."
"They were motivated by what was happening in the Middle East."
"The bombers in Madrid also."
"So the security of Europe is directly connected to the Middle East."
"I believe that we also have historic and humanitarian commitments to a peaceful outcome."
"After all, the process of peace has been slow and patchy, and has resulted in numerous initiatives, numerous intergovernmental conferences - Madrid, Oslo and so on. We have got to the point now, in October 2007, where there is almost a desperation to try and find some solution."
"So I believe that it is now time for some fairly radical new thinking."
"One of the propositions I would make is that the recent talks between Mr Olmert and Mr Mahmoud Abbas about - in effect - a final status solution, should reflect the negotiations that Mr Olmert himself, a young parliamentarian, had in 1987, where he and the PLO negotiated privately actually to talk about the capital of the Palestinian state in East Jerusalem, about the borders of 1967, and about some settlers returning."
"In other words, he got there in 1987, and maybe now the time will come, this autumn, when these two leaders, encouraged by the international community, will come together radically to shape the future for a peaceful, two-state solution to the Middle East peace process."
"Mr Triantaphyllides and his delegation, who went to Palestine the other day, came back with two fundamental conclusions."
"Let us focus on the humanitarian situation in Palestine, but let us also think about the role that elected parliamentarians there and elsewhere can play in this process."
"We should not be forgotten."
"(FR) Mr President, while preparing this resolution, we said to ourselves 'no politics, just humanitarianism'."
"It is intolerable that today, in an immense open-air ghetto, a people is slowly dying, hounded by the cameras of the whole world, a people bled dry, without the right to develop, to move freely or to educate its children, but a people for whose survival we pay a high price and who most of all must not die on us, because that would taint us and our democracies could not cope with it."
"This year the European Union will have paid more than EUR 300 million to prevent this crisis."
"It is too little for the Palestinians to be able to live, but it is ten times, a hundred times too much, because if all the international obligations, the fourth Geneva Convention and human rights were being respected, it would not be necessary."
"Shame on the ghetto!"
"Shame on us Europeans!"
"We were able to supply Berlin when the people there were under siege!"
"Shame on us who welcomed the fall of the wall in Germany with tears of joy, but who are now prisoners and accomplices of other walls and other ghettos!"
"Stop the closure!"
"But today, humanitarianism cannot let politics be forgotten."
"On 24 September the Israeli government issued an order for the confiscation of 1 100 dunums of land in four Arab villages between Jerusalem and Jericho, to build a road that will cut the West Bank definitively in two."
"It is an old Israeli plan from 2004 that Europe and even the United States have always rejected."
"Today, on the eve of the international meeting in Washington, it is a real time bomb."
"With Gaza trapped and the West Bank cut in two, how can we still dream of two states living together peacefully."
"On 8 February 2005 at Sharm el Sheikh, Sharon declared: 'We have an opportunity to start on a new path."
"For the first time in a long time, there exists in our region hope for a better future for our children and grandchildren.'"
"It is an extremely fragile opportunity that the extremists want to shatter."
"If this road, and many others, see the light of day, the extremists will have won."
"Architects and geographers are now using more perverse weapons than bombs."
"They are encircling Palestine with walls and roads that are pulverising any dream of a viable state."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, there is nothing more demoralising than life lived in poverty, life without any prospects and life marred by a conflict."
"As a humanitarian catastrophe haunts the people of Gaza, it is clear that the only objective Israeli and Palestinian leaders are securing is the transmission of pain, poverty, misery and hatred to a new generation of young Palestinians."
"As a direct result of the Israeli blockade on the movement of people and goods, children do not even have basic educational facilities."
"Everyone is denied the basic utilities that all of us in this House take for granted."
"Livelihoods are destroyed, as fishermen, farmers and others cannot trade."
"Individuals suffer needless pain and death owing to limited medical services and treatment."
"All of this is set against a background of violence and oppression."
"NGOs estimate that there are nearly 2 000 newly severely disabled people in Gaza."
"They are mainly young people, who are shot at by tanks or snipers, often resulting in loss of limbs, brain damage or spinal cord injuries - but organisations working to support disabled people are being hampered by the Israeli blockade and are unable to obtain the specialist supplies that they require!"
"Israeli must fulfil its international obligations, such as the Geneva Convention, to guarantee the flow of humanitarian assistance, humanitarian aid and essential services, and to open up the borders."
"The Council and the Commission must keep up the pressure, but they must talk to all sides."
"That is the only way we will find a solution."
"It is pointless saying we will not talk to one side."
"We have got to find a solution by talking to everyone."
"If nothing is done, people will continue to die needlessly."
"1.3 million people in Gaza will continue to be stripped of their dignity and the transmission of pain, poverty, misery and hatred to a new generation of Palestinians will only continue."
"(FR) Mr President, at a time when the crossing points into the Gaza Strip are closed and are controlled by the Israeli army, at a time when murderous incursions are being conducted there on a daily basis, at a time when the number of settlers in the occupied territories is continuing to grow, at a time when, in violation of international law, the construction of the wall and security surveillance are continuing, within these very walls, in the European Parliament, there are still people who would deny Israel's status as an occupying power."
"It is shocking!"
"Israel is an occupying power, and as such has obligations under the Geneva Conventions and, in particular, must not use collective punishment under any circumstances."
"We would be well advised to ensure that Israel meets its obligations instead of sending disastrous signals, as we did for example by suspending funding for the fuel supply for the power station in Gaza."
"The crocodile tears we have shed over the divisions between Palestinians are really inappropriate after the European Union was incapable of supporting Mahmoud Abbas' efforts to co-opt the pragmatic wing of Hamas."
"Can you imagine anything worse?"
"Playing Ramallah off against Gaza?"
"Deciding who are the good Palestinians and helping them to get rid of the bad?"
"Who can believe in a lasting solution if the political and territorial unity of Palestine is not guaranteed?"
"Who can believe that peace for the Israelis and Palestinians will be built through a policy that in fact leads to the radicalisation of the people of Israel and of Palestine?"
"The humanitarian situation in Gaza breaches all the standards of human dignity."
"The lifting of the blockade of the Gaza Strip needs to be secured as quickly as possible."
"Due pressure needs to be exerted on Israel."
"This question cannot remain a taboo anymore and I am asking you, the Council and the Commission, what measures you intend to take in order to encourage the lifting of the blockade and to force Israel to comply with its obligations and commitments."
"I am asking you what you intend to do to make Israel give up its plans to cut the West Bank in two by linking Jericho with East Jerusalem, a month before the international conference."
"(Applause)"
"(EL) Madam President, developments in Palestine are moving exceptionally swiftly and leave us scarcely any time to react."
"Thus we are now discussing the humanitarian situation in Gaza, whereas the Israeli authorities have unilaterally decided to expropriate thousands of hectares of Arab land in order to proceed with plan Ε1, the construction of a road that will in practical terms cut the West Bank in two."
"You know that the international community has opposed this plan."
"I believe that it would be useful for Parliament to take a stand on this issue."
"Political developments behind the scenes, however, have not permitted this."
"The result is simple: once again we remain observers while the situation in Palestine gets ever worse; every day the Palestinians' negotiating position weakens and doubt is cast on any existing prospects for success at the imminent international conference on the Palestinian issue in November."
"Mr President, last night I was privileged to attend the inauguration of the Brussels offices of the European Friends of Israel, which starts from the premise that we should support the democratic State of Israel's right to exist and prosper."
"In contrast, Hamas is committed, under its 1988 charter, to Israel's destruction and remains a terrorist organisation banned by the EU."
"It is no surprise to me that this resolution seeks to heap much of the blame for the current situation in Gaza on Israel."
"Clearly, Israel's unilateral withdrawal from Gaza as a bona fide gesture of land for peace is of very little significance to Israel's critics."
"The resolution refers to a humanitarian crisis in Gaza without exploring the reasons why."
"The appeal of Hamas to Palestinian voters was that it provided many of the social services that were neglected by the corrupt Fatah Administration."
"Yet the same schools are now devoid of children, who are too scared to leave their homes."
"The hospitals are treating those injured in the daily violence that has characterised the Hamas violent takeover of Gaza and the defeat of secular Fatah."
"Prominent Gazan Christian, Rami Ayyad, was murdered last Saturday, and on Sunday, eight mortars and a Katyusha rocket were fired by Hamas at Israel indiscriminately."
"Bizarrely, Hamas has even been shelling the border crossing at Khani."
"The resolution also calls on Israel to take steps to ensure the free passage of humanitarian supplies and essential utilities."
"In fact, Israel has not stopped the movement of such goods as food, electricity or water into Gaza and is actually acting with restraint and moderation, even though Hamas has been attacking Israel militarily."
"I appreciate that Israel has come to expect a steady stream of invective from this House, but Israel should know that it does have some friends here, and throughout Europe, who are committed to peace and security in the region."
"That will never happen while the agenda of Hamas is so readily indulged by so many in this House."
"Mr President, a humanitarian crisis requires a humanitarian response, and our first priority tonight should be to deal with medical supplies and school books being held up on one side of the border, while students and ill people wait on the other."
"International humanitarian law does give the European Union a direct obligation to act and, four months after Gaza was cut off, our direct commitment to the border assistance mission is a commitment that we are failing to meet."
"I thank the Commissioner for the cautious optimism she expressed tonight on the revival of the peace process and on the operation of the temporary international mechanism."
"We of course urge her to do whatever more she can."
"I agree with Mr Tannock that we should condemn rocket and mortar attacks by Palestinian militants, but his complaints would be much more credible if he also condemned the killing of civilians by the Israeli Defence Force in air missile attacks."
"I ask you Commissioner, and the Presidency-in-Office too, to make urgent representations condemning the seizure, as was reported this morning, of a further 3% of West Bank land between Jerusalem and Jericho as part of the E1 annexation plan."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(SK) In the light of the European Parliament resolution of 21 June on the MEDA programme and financial support to Palestine, the resolution of 12 July 2007 on the Middle East and the Quartet's statement of 23 September 2007, it is vital for the European Parliament to express a clear stance vis-à-vis the situation in Palestine."
"We must, however consider, the situation from at least two perspectives: the humanitarian and economic perspective, as well as the political and security one."
"From the humanitarian and economic point of view, it is up to Europe, after having committed enormous financial resources to assist Palestine, to ensure the technical feasibility of delivering this assistance and humanitarian aid."
"It is unacceptable for Palestinian civilians to be denied access to medicines and for health care institutions, schools and private homes to be devastated."
"As it stands, access to proper drinking water and food is often denied as a result of the blockade on the movement of people and goods."
"From the political and security perspective, it needs to be clearly stated that just as the international community recognises the Palestinians' right to autonomy, Palestine, including the governing Hamas movement, must also recognise the State of Israel."
"To date Hamas has not taken any action to distance itself from its own founding document, which includes destroying the State of Israel as one of its objectives."
"Therein lies the political problem, which has escalated into an armed conflict: terrorism on one side and tough defensive actions on the other."
"Mr President, first of all, could I say that Mr Tannock is doing Israel a disservice by his unquestioning support for Israel's illegal activity against Palestinians, particularly in relation to Gaza."
"I support this resolution, including paragraph 5."
"The humanitarian crisis in Gaza is not new, nor has it been unforeseen."
"Those of us who have visited the area regularly over the years have consistently warned against the Israeli actions, which were driving the population to despair."
"The economy is now in free fall."
"Social services have virtually collapsed."
"Malnutrition and chronic diseases are rife, and medicines are not available."
"Gaza is now entirely dependent on outside aid, which is being blocked by Israeli embargoes."
"It is a prison tightly controlled by Israel, and we cannot allow the well-being of the people of Gaza to be held hostage to the political manoeuvrings that are under way. Hopefully, these manoeuvrings will lead to peace talks."
"I condemn the unilateral Israeli decision to seize land from four Arab villages, which cuts East Jerusalem off from the West Bank."
"I regret the fact that neither the Council nor the Commission have made reference to this, and I would be surprised if they did not know about it."
"We know about it in this House, and it is public knowledge."
"This action by Israel is totally in breach of the Road Map, and it is in breach of the agreement that the 1967 borders will not change without a joint agreement between Israelis and Palestinians."
"(PL) Mr President, hopefully we might expect that with time the conflict will sort itself out."
"That is the hollowest hope there could be."
"New generations are growing up, and the conflict goes on and is even getting worse."
"You would think that two nations that are quite close to each other, the Hebrews and the Arabs, could cohabit, but not under the conditions of a hierarchical system."
"Every dependence of one upon the other, inequality, and above all the lack of a sovereign state structure for the Arabs, will be constant sources of negative emotions, convictions and retaliation."
"If the State of Israel cannot entertain a territorial division, I find it difficult to foresee peace in this area, I am afraid."
"Just as the Jews have a right to their country, their state, in the same way the Arabs, the Palestinians, have a right too."
"Historically, before World War II, Palestine existed, and as we are seeing, it is not easy to erase it from the Arab memory."
"Every day the situation is deteriorating for the people in Gaza to such an extent that explosions of built-up aggression are inevitable, and all we can do is look on in embarrassment and sadness."
"The most we can do, for our part - besides trying to calm impulses towards mutual destruction and besides attempts at mediation - is to extend humanitarian assistance to people to enable them to live in as decent sanitary conditions as possible, to have something to eat and somewhere to go to school."
"But I emphasise that this is only a substitute for a solution, a solution towards which, we are ashamed to admit, we are not able to lead."
"Experience gained in central and eastern Europe in the nineteenth century and the twentieth century horrors of Europe and Africa: these clearly demonstrate the power of a people's striving for independence."
"This striving is what we are dealing with there too."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, of course the European Union must do everything it can to release the stranglehold on the population of Gaza in an unprecedented humanitarian crisis."
"Personally, I would like to point out that the Israeli government's designation of Gaza as a hostile entity has a number of dramatic consequences."
"Israel can conduct much larger-scale operations in this area than in the past."
"The Israeli electricity company can reduce the supply of electricity to Gaza's 1.5 million Palestinians to a bare minimum, and the company Mekorot will ration the water it distributes, leaving it to Hamas to distribute it to the districts."
"This Israeli strategy, clearly aimed at causing a popular uprising against the leaders of Hamas, is unacceptable and can only lead to a fresh escalation of violence."
"Not to mention the new settlements that will turn Palestine into another Bantustan."
"Personally, as a member of the Quartet, I would like the European Union to obtain an assurance that the sole aim of the peace conference planned for November is not to provide the United States with a way out the stalemate it finds itself in in Iraq and Afghanistan, but that it is a real summit for peace, bringing together all the Arab players."
"Mr President, civilians are the silent victims of any conflict and we have an obligation - indeed, a duty - to stand up and protect them, and to live up to the covenant of Noble Peace laureate Elie Wiesel 'never to be silent whenever and wherever human beings endure suffering and humiliation'."
"I welcome, therefore, the initiative of this House to debate the situation in Gaza and also welcome the call in the resolution to call upon Israel to fulfil its obligations and guarantee the flow of humanitarian assistance to Gaza."
"But today we also need to ask some other questions."
"We need to start by asking ourselves, why is it that every time there is a movement towards peace, the violence intensifies?"
"Why it is that every time the voices of reason in Israel and the Palestinian territories seek a resolution, there are terrorist groups to take up arms against peace?"
"Why is the fear of a two-state solution, of Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace, so dreaded by some that they prefer to inflict pain and suffering on their own people?"
"Let us not shrink from admitting that responsibility for the dire situation of the people living in Gaza also lies squarely with Hamas, who oppose a settlement, who call for the destruction of a legitimate member of the United Nations and who fear peace and promote violence."
"In 2005, 400 rockets were fired into Israel from Gaza."
"In 2006, 1 726 rockets were fired."
"In 2007, it was close to a thousand rockets."
"Many have died, hundreds have been injured and thousands evacuated."
"They are also civilians: men, women and children."
"On 26 September, 54 mortars were fired from Gaza on the Sufa crossing terminal."
"The next day, the crossing points to which the Commissioner was referring - Erez and Karem Shalom - were targeted."
"Indeed, they were targeted because Hamas believes that closing those points fulfils their goal of increasing the suffering, and of people siding with Hamas."
"That is the wrong strategy."
"Let us acknowledge that there are forces of terror and forces of fear in Gaza who seek to profit from the suffering of their own people."
"(PT) Jimmy Carter said in an interview this week that since President Clinton there have never been any good-faith talks on the subject of the Middle East under the patronage of the United States of America."
"Expectations are therefore running high for the international conference in November."
"It is expected that there will be some tangible development so that we can actually envisage a time-scale for resolution of the human drama and conflict."
"The humanitarian situation in Gaza is currently deteriorating."
"Although a few months ago we had a real open prison which constantly closing in, that is becoming ever more apparent when every day we count the dead, the hunger, the fear, the power of weapons and their effect, on both sides of the walls, on civilians' lives."
"Humanitarian assistance is urgently required in the light of the Geneva Conventions and it is imperative that Israel should allow that assistance to be administered."
"The movement of persons and goods must become a reality, unless we are to see a real human tragedy in that coastal strip."
"The major objectives which we should be launching at the next international conference are to put an end to the violence and to seek a solution based on the existing resolutions which will allow Palestinians and Israelis to live together in peace, before it is too late."
"Mr President, 20 years ago there were three theatres of violent conflict which caused worldwide consternation: South Africa, Ireland and the Middle East."
"In the first two there has been reconciliation and political transformation."
"In the Middle East there has been no progress made."
"Arguably, the situation is worse."
"The humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza obliges us to act, conscious that reconciliation and political transformation are possible, are necessary, are expedient."
"But, equally, it is clear that the Palestinians and the Israelis cannot resolve their differences by themselves."
"They both resort to violence, which perpetuates the impasse."
"The humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza marks one of the lowest points in the 60 years of continuous conflict in the Middle East."
"We call for security for the State of Israel and we call for security for the state of Palestine."
"Today we have neither."
"A new way, a new method is required."
"It is clear that the United States Administration has the responsibility and the ability to exercise decisive influence on Israel, for example calling on them to dismantle the blockade of Gaza."
"Just as the European Union must exercise equal guidance to the Palestinians to desist from violence, so that both may achieve their objectives for secure statehood through the only available effective means, which are peaceful means."
"As this resolution will be forwarded to the parliaments of Palestine, Israel, Egypt and the Euro-Mediterranean Assembly, a constructive contribution could well be for us to support and promote a parliamentary dialogue to replace the existing war of attrition, which must be brought to an end so that it no longer disfigures the Holy Land."
"(FI) Mr President, Commissioner, there is human suffering in Gaza."
"The humanitarian crisis there has in the last few months indisputably grown into a catastrophe."
"No longer is it a matter of just a shortage of basic food."
"The Palestinian economy has collapsed and it has become harder to conduct business."
"People's everyday lives have been shattered and the relief organisations cannot operate in the region."
"The people who live there are caught up in a blockade, and as the Commissioner said, on the West Bank the same problems loom."
"The residents of Gaza are the victims of a failed policy by each of the parties in the crisis."
"It is one thing to speak about Hamas as the enemy and a terrorist organisation; it is quite another to declare the whole of Gaza enemy territory."
"It is one thing to speak about Israel as the enemy; it is quite another to refuse to cooperate with providers of basic services and international organisations."
"Although the parties in the crisis have reached deadlock, they both have responsibility for fundamental humanitarian rights."
"The resolution by Parliament's groups is an exceptionally straightforward expression of opinion on the crisis in the Middle East."
"It is stripped of any ulterior political motive."
"All that is left is Europe's profound concern about the lives of the people in Gaza."
"I would like to remind everyone that this is the self-same concern we expressed earlier on this year."
"We cannot take either side and we cannot point a finger."
"The suffering of innocent people makes the desire to excuse and seek justification for the Gaza situation irrelevant."
"We demand just one thing: that the parties in the crisis allow us to help and that they should help themselves in particular, because this is a human crisis on a huge scale."
"Commissioner, I hope you will take this one demand by Europe regarding the situation in Gaza to the parties in the crisis, the Arab League and the Quartet."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you all for your comments and speeches, to which I listened carefully."
"We understand that continuous and sustained support for the economic development of the Palestinian territories is one of the bases for peace."
"There is a close link between security, political stability and the economy."
"Peace and security cannot therefore be achieved unless a solid and lasting economic foundation is laid together with a peace process, which needs to be a credible peace process."
"All these initiatives reflect our commitment to assisting and helping to improve the living conditions of the Palestinian population in Transjordan and also in Gaza."
"These are tasks we wish to pursue and we are confident that the Conference of Donor Nations, scheduled for December in Paris, will provide an opportunity for the international community to express its support, in a practical way we hope, for the Palestinian Authority and the Palestine people in general."
"It is vital that the international community does not abandon the people of Gaza, so that their highly precarious humanitarian situation does not continue to be a political factor of instability, tension and dissent."
"I would like to say that the European Union has a political strategy for the Middle East Peace process based on sound pillars and principles and that is why the European Union is a welcome partner in the political process."
"We also have a consistent aid policy for those who need it most in the Palestinian territories."
"The figures which I myself presented and to which the Commissioner referred are, I think, undoubtedly proof of that."
"I hope that all will follow the example of the European Union in this respect."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, we all know that the situation in Gaza is dramatic."
"However, we also know that, even if we are donating a lot of humanitarian aid, in the end we also have to find a political solution."
"I said before, and the President-in-Office has mentioned now, that this international meeting is a very important occasion."
"We have all clearly stated that it cannot be just a photo opportunity."
"It has to be a substantive meeting, at which we hope the negotiations and personal talks between Prime Minister Olmert and President Abbas indeed materialise into an important initial document, not least on the very difficult issues, knowing that from then onwards working groups will have to take ideas further."
"We all know that there are many possible alternative solutions on the table."
"At the same time, until now, there has for a very long time been no possibility of getting the two parties together at such an international gathering with the support of the European Union, with the support of the US, Russia and the United Nations, and also with the backing of the Arab League."
"It is very important that this time the Americans too have said that they are also ready to invite the so-called 'follow-up group' of the Arab League, including Syria and Saudi Arabia."
"That shows there is a certain opening-up."
"Having said that, we also know very clearly, and this was apparent from the second meeting we had, the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee meeting, that we cannot only have political negotiations."
"We also have to make a change on the ground."
"That is, indeed, essential."
"It is about promoting economic development, and this is part of Tony Blair's mandate, in which we also want to support him as much as we can because this is a possibility and an opportunity that we have to seize."
"We of course know, as he does too - I have had lengthy discussions with him - that the pre-conditions for economic recovery, as the World Bank has also clearly mentioned, are an improvement in movement and access, promotion of the private sector in Gaza, which must remain part of the economy there, and of course also promoting things like good governance."
"What we want to do is create a viable Palestinian state for when things are, so to speak, ripe in the political sphere."
"I agree that we cannot have a 'quick fix' but, at the same time, what we do need now is a negotiation process that will finally start, and quick-start projects."
"This is an area that we are already preparing, so that things are ready after the international meeting and maybe after or at the moment of the pledging conference."
"We are considering projects - which, by the way, have been selected and supported by us and also by Tony Blair - such as projects for refurbishing schools, through which people see something is being done on the ground."
"There are also many other projects that we are studying at the moment, in trying to find the right answers, and for which, of course, we also need Israel's support."
"It is also clear that Israel's security concerns have to be taken into account."
"But, at the end of the day, we have to find a political solution, and it is President Abbas who is the elected President of all Palestinians."
"Therefore, we now have to give him credit and work with him and support him."
"I want to thank you also for having very generously given the Commission the possibility, for 2008, of straight away having EUR 10 000 more in the budget for the Palestinians."
"We will definitely need this and it will be particularly important for our pledging conference."
"Let me also say that we are not only supporting Christians - this was mentioned by Mr Belder - but are also supporting the most vulnerable sectors of the Palestinian population, of which some, but not all, are Christian."
"Our criterion is need, not religion, as I mentioned before."
"Let me say finally that we are very much aware of what many of you have said."
"We have analysed the situation."
"The only course is to try to come up with political solutions, while at the same time trying to mitigate the suffering as much as we can."
"I have received a motion for a resolution tabled pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, 11 October 2007."
"Written declarations (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - I join others in calling on Israel to fulfil its obligations under the Geneva Conventions to guarantee the flow of humanitarian aid, humanitarian assistance and essential services, such as electricity and fuel, to the Gaza Strip."
"Israel needs to lift the blockade of the Gaza Strip, and ensure the movement of people and goods at Rafah, in compliance with the Agreement on Movement and Access and the EU Border Assistance Mission, as well as the movement of goods at Karni."
"All the Union's institutions, including the Council, the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the Commission must face up to their full responsibility on the implementation of this Agreement."
"Finally, I echo the call on Israel to guarantee the flow of financial assets to the Gaza Strip, which has been suspended since 25 September 2007, given that the lack of access to any financial assets has a serious negative impact on the economic, social and daily life of the Palestinian people."
"A Maritime Policy for the EU"
"The next item is a debate on the Commission's communication relating to a maritime policy for the European Union."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, today is a noteworthy day."
"Exactly 500 years ago the German cartographer Martin Waldseemüller created his striking single vision of a brave new world in which Europe was linked to Africa, Asia and the Americas by its oceans and seas."
"10 October also marks the day when the King of Portugal mandated Bartolomeu Dias to seek a trade route leading to Asia, and in the United States Columbus's discovery of the New World is celebrated today."
"It is therefore a day worth recalling in the maritime world."
"For my part, I am proud to come here today to this Parliament to talk about a new and exciting maritime future for Europe."
"This is a future that builds on the strong maritime heritage that Europe has inherited from the past, yet which also looks strategically forward to determine how Europe's well-being and prosperity, so closely dependent on the oceans and seas, can be enhanced."
"Inspired by our own distinct vision of the oceans and seas, the Commission earlier today proposed an integrated maritime policy for the Union."
"For the first time in its 50 years of existence, the European Union has explicitly recognised that an integrated approach is needed for the seas and the oceans."
"This radical departure has its origins in the compelling argument that there is a maritime dimension to virtually every major issue facing Europe today - energy, climate change, innovation, international competitiveness, job creation, environmental protection, trade, transport and so on. Whichever sector one looks at, one can see strong links that run between them and the maritime sector."
"It would be unwise, indeed short-sighted, for the European Union to operate in these policy areas without taking account of their overlap with maritime affairs."
"What we need is a single vision where policymaking can be done in a cohesive and all-embracing manner so as to maximise the potential of these intense and complex interrelations."
"At a time when the discussions about global warming, globalisation and EU competitiveness have acquired new urgency, one can hardly ignore the undeniable need for a maritime strategy that directly treats these issues."
"Today I am pleased to announce that the College of Commissioners backed an integrated policy document that will deliver exactly what the European Union has lacked until now: a genuine, single vision of the oceans and seas."
"It is not just a question of fisheries or shipping, or of trade or regional development, or of research or employment, or of the environment or relations with third countries."
"It is a policy that encompasses these, brings all these strengths together and treats them as an interrelated whole."
"It is a policy that will feed from and into other Community policies."
"At the College meeting earlier today, it was in fact a package of documents that was adopted."
"This package is made up of three key components."
"The first is a communication which details the aforementioned integrated maritime policy for the European Union."
"This is accompanied by an action plan which outlines the first steps that will be taken towards implementing the policy."
"Then there is a communication which sets out the conclusions reached following the broad and immensely successful public consultation that was held over a period of one year."
"You will quickly recognise the key elements of the package, I believe, because they reflect in large measure the priorities you yourselves have expressed."
"Allow me to just mention the following: deploying Europe's strengths to combat climate change through research and innovation, through more sophisticated planning for vulnerable coastlines and by taking the lead in international discussions; a European strategy for marine research and a commitment to excellence in marine research technology and innovation to help meet the Lisbon goals for growth and jobs and to fully exploit the opportunities that lie in new technologies; better regulation of maritime transport to help create a true, barrier-free European maritime transport space in the internal market and to support Europe's external trade in this era of globalisation; respect for the crucial role in driving economic growth and an examination of how EU funding can best reinforce sustainable growth and boost prosperity in remote and disadvantaged regions; ensuring that all forms of development take account of the environmental impact by fostering environmentally friendly shipping, reducing pollution risks and promoting ecosystem-based fisheries; better use of planning tools, data networks and horizontal coordination to support decision-making for marine spaces and coastal areas and to ensure international compliance with rules; backing maritime clusters and regional centres of maritime excellence to raise Europe's competitiveness."
"This will particularly help small firms that are such an important part of Europe's high-tech maritime industries."
"It will help realise the huge growth potential of coastal and maritime tourism and it will be an additional element in helping to improve the attractiveness of maritime careers."
"The Commission today also adopted a communication aimed at boosting the attractiveness of maritime careers by initiating a review of the exclusions faced by seafarers and fishermen from various pieces of the European Union's labour legislation."
"This is a sensitive area of great concern to many of our stakeholders."
"A background document on the important links between the European Union energy policy and maritime policy has also been published today."
"We well know that there are enormous challenges ahead."
"To address these, we need concrete proposals - proposals that are ambitious enough to meet the challenges we face head on."
"In past centuries the seas and oceans have opened up new and exciting opportunities for Europe."
"Now, at the start of the 21st century, we hope to discover our own modern-day New World of opportunities."
"I believe that we really are at the start of something new."
"I also believe that by setting in motion the actions detailed in the package adopted today we will be firmly setting Europe on the path to explore these opportunities in a novel way."
"As the saying goes, 'Nothing ventured, nothing gained' and, while that is true and most certainly is part of the inspiration that propels us forward, it is prudent to note that, like the voyages of discovery of the past, today's venture will have a cost too."
"There will be a first stage in 2008 characterised by a series of preparatory actions; these will need the involvement of other partners and we will need to secure, together with your support, the necessary funding."
"These actions are a direct follow-up to the thinking behind your report of 12 July, where I was delighted to see that you had clearly indicated your backing for these actions."
"There are a number of other supporting actions which are already well advanced and which include a communication of 17 October on port policy, another on illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, and a third on sustainable tourism."
"These will later be followed by actions on maritime clusters and on maritime transport."
"Complementing all of this will be a discussion on 22 October in Lisbon with the 27 Member State ministers responsible for maritime affairs, which will include ministers of transport, fisheries, the environment and defence, amongst others."
"This will feed into a later discussion which will take place at the December European Council with a view to endorsing this policy."
"Today is, therefore, not the end of the voyage, nor is it the beginning."
"It is, however, a significant milestone, marking a decisive shift away from a period of reflection to what you in Parliament requested of us and what we in the Commission are looking forward to: a period of action."
"The European Parliament has been a key player in this process and has given us invaluable feedback."
"I would, therefore, like to renew my thanks to Parliament in general and to the rapporteurs and Members who have shown particular interest in this project more specifically."
"I have been particularly glad to take part in many of the hearings and meetings held in Parliament."
"I sincerely look forward to continuing this dialogue."
"Parliament will remain a central figure in the evolution of this policy."
"Making a success of the maritime policy is not something that the Commission can, or wishes to, undertake alone."
"Its success depends on maintaining a common approach."
"I hope that I can count on your continued collaboration."
"As I said at the start of my statement, today is indeed noteworthy."
"We have set sail on a new and exciting adventure."
"This is an adventure that we trust and believe will bring increased and sustained prosperity to Europe."
"We have ahead of us an ocean of opportunity."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr Commissioner, I would like to present the apologies on behalf of Parliament's rapporteur for the Green Paper on Maritime Policy, Willi Piecyk."
"He is unable to be here today and I am to pass on his best wishes."
"I should like to express my praise - I am a member of the Environment Committee - with regard to onshore transport connections for ships."
"This has been included and, if we can bring about a decision such as this, is very good for air quality in Europe and it is also very good for reducing CO2 emissions."
"In the Green Paper on Maritime Policy there is also discussion about the fact that ships should be included in the Emissions Trading Scheme."
"We are only at the first reading concerning the inclusion of air traffic in emissions trading."
"There has been no provision either for air traffic in the Kyoto Protocol and a very practical question is therefore: when does the Commission want to put forward a proposal for including maritime traffic in emissions trading?"
"Madam President, may I, on the occasion of this Commission communication on a maritime policy for the EU, remind this House of the continuing embargo imposed several years ago by Turkey on all shipping associated with the Republic of Cyprus."
"This embargo inflicts significant damage to the shipping industry not just of Cyprus but of the EU in general..."
"(Remarks from the floor)"
"I am speaking English."
"It would indeed be exciting if we had interpretation from English to English."
"I was just talking about the embargo that Turkey has imposed on Cyprus for several years now, and I was saying that this is causing extreme damage not just to Cyprus, which is a Member State, but to the EU in general."
"May I once again ask the Commission to redouble its efforts to convince the Turkish Government to reconsider its decision to continue to uphold this unfair and unnecessary embargo on the shipping of an EU Member State."
"I understand that we must be soft - rather soft - on Turkey, but our patience is running out."
"After all, what sort of maritime policy can we have if the ships of a Member State cannot use the ports in the shipping lanes of a candidate Member State?"
"Please, Commissioner, can you reassure us that you will give this matter your urgent and serious attention?"
"Madam President, I want to congratulate Commissioner Borg on this very welcome and visionary action plan addressing specifically the fisheries points which are of interest to me: the integrated network for maritime surveillance, which I think is absolutely vital if we are going to improve safety and stamp out illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing; the plan to stop destructive bottom trawling in the high seas; the plan to improve the conditions of the people who work in the fishing industry, one of the most dangerous and poorly paid jobs in the EU; the improved cooperation between coastguards; the ending of discards and the promotion of aquaculture, which provides 65 000 full-time jobs in the EU - all of these are wonderful."
"I particularly like the idea of the road map towards maritime spatial planning and my question is on that specific issue."
"Who will pay for this?"
"Some Member States have already done this. They already have spatial plans for their maritime areas."
"I think there will be a commercial value for these maritime spatial plans."
"Who is going to pay for it in the mean time?"
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, on the question put by the honourable Member, Mr Groote, concerning CO2 emissions: I would like to underline the fact that emissions coming from vessels in connection with maritime transport in absolute terms are lower than in other categories like air transport and even road."
"However, on an individual basis, it is true that the CO2 emissions coming from individual vessels are significant."
"Therefore, it makes sense that action is taken and that the shipping industry is encouraged to take the necessary action in order to reduce CO2 if we want to maximise the potential for growth with regard to maritime transport - because there is no doubt that there is enormous potential to grow further with regard to maritime transport, but this has to be in conjunction with a reduction in CO2 emissions if we want to bring about a situation which makes maritime transport even appear to be much more consumer friendly."
"To do this, it is important to underline the fact that, since we are dealing with a global industry, initiatives should be taken first and foremost on the international front."
"Therefore, there should be an international effort and the European Union would be prepared to take the lead, within the International Maritime Organisation, in order to set standards with regard to CO2 emissions."
"In the absence of progress, the Commission would consider other options in order to bring about a situation whereby CO2 emissions are effectively reduced."
"One can also mention the fact that there are cases where, because of the existing discrepancies, there is, in a way, an incentive to increase CO2 emissions."
"For example, in berthing, since there is taxation for the use of electricity in a port, many vessels end up leaving their engines running in order to save on costs because there is duty exemption on fuel."
"Therefore, if there is a measure whereby this discrepancy is removed, then there would be an incentive for vessels to make use of the electricity grid imports."
"Concerning the question raised by Mr Matsakis concerning the embargo of Turkey on Cyprus, I would like first of all to underline the fact that, with regard to accession negotiations for Turkey, one or two of the chapters that have not been opened and will not be opened until Turkey remedies, relate to transport and fisheries, which is my area of responsibility."
"Therefore, we are doing our utmost in order to convince Turkey to reconsider its position."
"Obviously, we are looking into this in order to see how one can work closer with Turkey, in order for it to apply - and also in preparation for its eventual accession - the Community acquis on suchlike measures."
"I would also like to say that with regard to the question raised by Mr Stevenson concerning spatial planning and who will pay for spatial planning, what we are proposing is not that there would be a communitisation of spatial planning, but that spatial planning should be the responsibility and the function of the Member States."
"However, we would like to see and encourage Member States that have not adopted the spatial planning system to introduce it as other Member States have done."
"We can quote examples of spatial planning that have been introduced by certain Member States as examples of this practice for other Member States to follow."
"We will try to see that there is a certain congruency of the spatial planning measures that are introduced by different Member States so that we do not end up with the situation with regimes which are significantly different from one another."
"So we will incentivise the formation of spatial planning systems; we will help build the necessary tools in order to be able to operate spatial planning in a more effective way and we will try to set guidelines in order to establish a common pattern for spatial planning, but it is ultimately the responsibility and the function of Member States to introduce spatial planning with regard to their own waters."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I can only welcome wholeheartedly the European Commission's desire to bring together what were previously separate and sometime rather incoherent sectoral policies within an integrated policy."
"I welcome the stress placed on the sustainable use of resources, the desire to develop maritime expertise, promote sustainable employment and maximise the quality of life of coastal communities."
"All this is heading in the right direction."
"The future maritime policy should do more to integrate the specific features of the ultraperipheral regions as well as their assets."
"The ultraperipheral regions benefit from protected fish stocks."
"This needs to be taken into account."
"But above all, these regions could be a real laboratory and a fantastic place for trialling and developing marine renewable energies."
"Is the Commission planning to make the most of the exceptional land offered by the ultraperipheral regions, and that makes up the European Union?"
"(PT) Mr Commissioner, my warmest congratulations, since this document does indeed achieve harmonisation, which is what we need with regard to the two major issues on fishing."
"There is the need on the one hand to safeguard fishermen's working conditions and on the other to harmonise fisheries by ecosystem-based management."
"In the meantime, I would like to ask the Commissioner if he can confirm the report in the Financial Times, according to which a study commissioned by the Directorate-General for Fisheries bitterly criticised the effects of the micro-management of ecosystems from Brussels, delivering a disastrous review of the Common Fisheries Policy over the past twenty-five years and stating that fisheries subject to the CFP suffer a much higher rate of overfishing than occurs on average worldwide."
"Does that report exist, is it to be submitted to the European Parliament Committee on Fisheries and what does the Commissioner think of the criticisms?"
"(FR) Madam President, I am also going to add my congratulations to Commissioner Borg for the work done."
"He concluded with 'believe and trust' and it immediately made me think of 'believe and dare', which was a lovely motto at one time."
"Believe and dare!"
"You have dared."
"I think the vision you have now developed particularly clearly in the communication before us is obviously a step in the right direction."
"I would like to ask one question which has been a particular feature of the concerns - and there are some - of the fisheries sector in this matter."
"The implementation of Integrated Coastal Zone Management will of course draw some of its credits from the European Fisheries Fund."
"The concern is that this European Fund, about whose inadequacy we have already had much cause for complaint, is the only fund used."
"I would like the Commissioner to reassure us on this point and confirm that the Structural Funds, of course the funds necessary for the development and protection of the environment, will also be contributing to the implementation of this policy."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, first of all with regard to the question put by Ms Sudre concerning the ultraperipheral regions: there is no doubt that in a maritime policy we do not intend to formulate - as is clear, I think, from the blue paper, which has just been adopted, and the action plan - a one-size-fits-all policy."
"Therefore, the specificities of peripheral regions and ultraperipheral regions in particular need to be taken into account."
"The other side of the coin is that the ultraperipherality offers the European Union enormous advantages."
"It gives us a reach into other oceans to which we would otherwise not have had direct access."
"And, if I can quote fisheries as one example, the fact that you have ultraperipheral regions in the Indian Ocean, for example, like La Réunion, is an example whereby we have a direct voice in the regional fisheries organisations that already exist and the ones that we are trying to promote for that sea."
"So, I certainly would encourage looking at the specificities of ultraperipheral regions."
"We also have to see to it that we maximise the advantages that these ultraperipheral regions can enjoy."
"And, yes, where we can use them as a laboratory, for example, for the development of renewable energies, we should certainly try and promote and encourage that at the same time, seeing to it that their vulnerabilities are not prejudiced in any way."
"Concerning the question put by Mr Casaca concerning the ecosystem approach, I would like first of all to say that, yes, we in the Directorate-General for Fisheries and Maritime Affairs had commissioned a study by experts."
"It is a normal periodical exercise that we undertake, on how the common fisheries policy has operated, what the possible pitfalls are that have been encountered, in order that, from that exercise, we can learn from past experience and try to improve things."
"First of all, I have no problem with making this study available to the Committee on Fisheries."
"We know that it is very critical, but we accept that criticism because at the end of the day we are trying to implement the 2002 reforms of the common fisheries policy."
"We are still, in 2007, in the initial phases of real implementation of the 2002 reforms by moving in the direction of multiannual management and recovery plans, by moving in the direction of more ecosystem based management of fisheries."
"We have inherited a large number of years of management of fisheries, in a way whereby it was overtaken by the scientific advances, by the enormous increase in the number of vessels that went beyond any limits of capacity so to speak as a counter to what can sustainably be caught."
"And we have to see to it that we redress the situation and bring about a system of sustainable fisheries, measures and initiatives again which I hope will have the full backing of Parliament: like a discards policy; measures and initiatives with regard to multiannual management of fisheries; management of fisheries by having more closed areas, closed seasons - these are all measures which go very much in the direction of the ecosystem approach to fisheries and the maximum sustainable yield."
"We have had the first example of a management plan on the basis of maximum sustainable yields in the plaice and sole management plan which was adopted in Council only last June."
"So, we hope to continue moving in that direction in order to regain proper management of fisheries on the basis of the ecosystem approach."
"On the question put by Mr Morillon, I would like, first of all, to assure him that the integrated approach towards maritime affairs will not be financed through the European Fisheries Fund."
"The European Fisheries Fund for 2007-2013 has been committed."
"We have received the national strategic plans and the operational programmes from virtually all Member States, we are looking into them and they are directed towards fisheries and aquaculture obviously."
"However, with regard to maritime affairs, one has to look at other sources of financing."
"I would say that the most logical source of financing could be through the Structural Funds, though the Regional Funds, because, at the end of the day, coastal areas are regions of the European Union."
"Therefore, one needs to create more focus on the specific needs of coastal areas and of the surrounding seas so that, in that way, one would redirect, as necessary, funding for initiatives and projects, which would very much go in the direction of establishing the proper tools for the management of an integrated maritime policy."
"(PT) I would like to add my congratulations to those already offered here to the Commissioner on his presentation today of the document on the action plan for the development of a maritime policy for the EU and I would like to say that the document presented today contains a series of initiatives worthy of mention, including the proposal for a European Strategy for Marine Research, support for an integrated approach to national maritime policies, plus the recommendation that Europe should operate as a network at the level of maritime surveillance as well as the proposal to set up multi-sectoral maritime clusters with the relevant financial adjustment at European level, among many other features, of course."
"Finally in this public debate, I would like to put the following questions to the Commissioner: a large part of the action plan presented can be pursued and encouraged by the Commission itself, but obviously it will not have the support of the Council and the Member States."
"We heard the Commissioner say here that it is important to obtain such support in the European Parliament's December part-session."
"So, the question is: is it hoped that there will be effective support which would lift this strategy to the front line of the Union's priorities and keep it there, or support purely as a matter of form?"
"I would like to end with the following, my second, question: how can it be ensured that a European maritime strategy will result in greater cooperation and coordination without sliding into communitisation of maritime policy, and in particular of national maritime resources?"
"(EL) Madam President, the Commission's communication on a future common maritime policy for the EU takes the same anti-worker line."
"It includes new measures to reinforce competitiveness and increase profits of large maritime business groups, and it is indicative of the intensity of the attack on workers."
"Its basic goals are: increasing the speed with which vessels and capital become concentrated in the hands of the large maritime business groups; full liberalisation of maritime transport and related services; the assumption of a strategic role by EU bodies so as to express completely the full interests of capital in international organisations; sweeping changes to employment relations; devaluing and privatising maritime education to produce a cheap work force; imposing on dockers multiple duties, bureaucratic directives and regulations which do not improve safety conditions on vessels or the protection of human life at sea."
"Commissioner, the international agreement on the codification of legislation on maritime workers is pending."
"What is the Commission's position on this issue?"
"What measures does it intend to take - and I am just finishing, Madam President - with regard to a situation for which perhaps you do not have exclusive responsibility, i.e. the encroachment by monopolistic tourist groups and individuals on the coastline of the Member States?"
"Madam President, the Commissioner made some nautical historical allusions, so I would like to do the same."
"Most people are familiar with the chorus of the anthem 'Rule Britannia', but people sometimes get one word fundamentally wrong."
"The correct version is not 'Rule Britannia, Britannia rules the waves'; it is 'Rule Britannia, Britannia rule the waves'."
"The word 'rules' makes the meaning a bombastic assertion."
"The correct word, 'rule', makes the meaning an exhortation and a warning."
"It used to be understood that Britain had to rule the waves in order to maintain her freedom and independence."
"Now the British do not even rule themselves, with over 80% of our laws made by the European Union."
"The common fisheries policy has ruined Britain's fishing industry and caused an ecological disaster in British waters."
"Given the EU's record, why should we think that the EU maritime policy should be any less disastrous than the common fisheries policy?"
"There is much interest among the Members in putting another set of questions, and I believe that we ought to use this important debate to the full."
"Commissioner, I would like to ask whether you can give a brief reply so that we can give the floor to other Members and then close there."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, on the question put by Mr Queiró, let me underline the fact that we are expecting substantive support."
"We will be having an informal ministerial meeting on 22 October in order to get the views of all the Member States on the package that we are proposing."
"We hope that this package will be endorsed by the European Council in December."
"That is a first stage."
"However, we need to be careful not to try to overstep what is achievable in the short term."
"If this proves successful and if the first initiatives that are being launched prove successful, then we can go to the Member States to see whether there is a willingness to proceed further in the direction of greater integration of maritime affairs."
"However, it is important to underline the fact that this is a policy which is based not on the legislative approach but on incentivising, on facilitating and on creating the necessary tools in order to bring about more coordination, more cooperation and more stakeholder involvement."
"So, if one looks at the plan of action, one can clearly see that the underlying principle is establishing certain cross-sectoral tools which are needed to develop an integrated approach to maritime affairs and also starting to look at sectoral measures in a more holistic way, therefore taking into account what impact there would be, for example, if fisheries decisions are taken on other sectors as well as vice-versa."
"On the second question, I would like to underline the fact that, with reference to maritime policy, we have in actual fact today also adopted a communication from Commissioner Špidla which launches the discussion as regards the exclusions that workers in the maritime sector - in maritime transport and in fisheries - have from the normal labour law legislation."
"We need to look into this to see whether there is a possibility of reducing these discrepancies, to start with, so that the differences between land-based workers and sea-based workers are reduced without, however, creating problems of competitiveness, given that we are dealing with an international sector."
"We must, therefore, do this hand in hand with the operators so that, in that way, we can incentivise them and promote the elimination of these discrepancies between land-based workers and sea-based workers."
"On the question raised by Mr Batten, I would like to say that a maritime policy, an integrated approach towards maritime affairs, is not a case of the European Union reinventing the wheel."
"It is something which has already been done by countries like the United States, like Canada, like Australia and now by Japan, and we are, in a way, lagging behind."
"We need to step up the momentum so that we are on a par with our international partners on maritime affairs."
"May I remind Mr Batten that the problems with regard to the UK and fisheries date back to before the introduction of the common fisheries policy."
"We all recall events like the Cod Wars between the UK and Iceland, which happened in particular before the introduction of the common fisheries policy."
"We are talking about a problem with regard to overfishing and fishing rights that already existed and which we are trying to redress through a more rational approach towards the management of fisheries under the reformed common fisheries policy."
"Madam President, I join in the congratulations to Commissioner Borg on this very important integrated policy document."
"I agree with what President Barroso said today: that a great part of our future lies in the untapped potential of the oceans and the seas and that this policy will generate growth and jobs."
"We must seize all opportunities that the seas and oceans offer us, while always acting in a sustainable way."
"Commissioner Borg, I fully support your work on marine science technology and innovation and your commitment to the Aberdeen Declaration."
"I would like to acknowledge the contribution of Ireland, especially through the Irish Marine Institute, in helping to form this policy."
"I welcome your announcement of the package of documents to be launched during the mandate of this Commission but, as you have only two years left, I wonder, is this more in hope than expectation that the entire list of the concrete actions will actually be implemented by you?"
"Commissioner Špidla's presentation today on the review of labour law exemptions in the maritime sector and Commissioner Piebalgs' report on the interlinkages between the EU energy policy and the new integrated maritime policy are a very good start, but how many of the other items in the package that you announced today will require separate legislative proposals?"
"(RO) I also want to congratulate the Commissioner for the integrated approach."
"I would like to draw the attention to the fact that, following Romania's and Bulgaria's accession, the European Union now borders the Black Sea, a new sea, and it is important for us to promote the common maritime policy in this region."
"I would also want the delta and estuary areas to be protected and to be part of the common maritime policy; also, I would like the measures for combating sea pollution to be extended to internal waters that flow into seas and oceans and to the industrialized areas along the coasts as well."
"I believe the Commissioner's communication is important as regards the work conditions for sailors and for those who work in the shipyard areas and I also consider it important to maximize the financial support for developing infrastructures and activities in the coastal areas."
"(ES) Madam President, I would first of all like to express my disapproval at the way in which this debate is being conducted today in Parliament."
"I was the first MEP who raised a hand to ask for the floor, the first, and now I am condemned to be last, or among the last, and not to speak for more than a minute."
"Having said that, I would like to congratulate the Commissioner and the Commission, both for this Communication and for all the work that they have been doing for a year in consulting the parties concerned, in an attempt to develop an integrated maritime policy for the whole of the European Union, taking into account the importance of the marine environment and the attacks that it constantly suffers due to human activity."
"In this respect, I would like to ask the Commissioner whether the military sector, whose activities sometimes interfere with and affect the marine environment, is going to be taken into consideration in Community policy in this field in order to prevent encroachment on the environment."
"In addition, there is the uncontrolled dumping that is constantly taking place."
"When are black boxes going to be introduced in order to monitor all movements of liquids in the bilges and in the liquid in the tanks of the vessels?"
"Mr Ortuondo, as I was not present at the beginning of this debate, I am not aware of the order of priority that you set."
"(FI) Madam President, the EU's Maritime Policy is one of the most important initiatives which the present Commission will remember with good reason, especially if it understands how to take advantage of its expansion and the sort of political muscle given us in enlargement to rescue our marine environment."
"I now appeal to the Commission to take special action to save one of the EU's very special seas, the Baltic."
"I would like to ask this."
"Could the Commission see the Baltic Sea not just as an environmental challenge, but also a political one?"
"If that dying sea can be rescued we can show the public that the Union provides a genuine benefit and that together we are in a stronger position to save our environment than we are alone."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, first of all, with regard to the question that was raised by Ms Doyle: yes, I would like to reiterate the fact that we have received significant support from the scientific community."
"The Aberdeen Declaration was very welcome, and Ireland itself was extremely supportive."
"On the remark that was made, I would like to stress that this is not my initiative: it is a Commission decision that has been adopted and, irrespective of the persons involved, there will certainly be continuity."
"If, in the first two years, we manage to register some success, I am sure that the new Commission will be more than willing to take up those successes."
"So it is a crucial two-year period, where we need to see that the initial seeds for a future maritime policy do actually start to grow."
"In that way, we can guarantee that future Commissions, with the support of the European Parliament, with the support of the Committee of the Regions and, I am sure, with the support of the Council of Ministers, will be able to bring this maritime policy to fruition."
"On the second question that was raised regarding inland waterways, there is no doubt that inland waterways are a very important part of the whole concept of a maritime policy, just as the coasts and the coastal areas are a very integral part of a maritime policy."
"In fact, next week Vice-President Barrot is going to present a package which covers internal waters, including a ports policy and therefore going into internal ports as well."
"So the whole parameters concerning waterways and ports - even inland ports - are part of this package that will be presented next week."
"On the question raised by Mr Ortuondo Larrea concerning military activities, whether they are to be included in the Community policy, one needs to underline the fact that, here, we are entering into a very sensitive area concerning the sovereignty of Member States."
"Therefore, one needs to be careful."
"If you want this maritime policy to succeed, we should do it hand in hand with the Member States."
"Where Member States are willing to take steps in the direction, for example, of joint activities with regard to national coastguard services, concerning questions on the environment, questions with regard to fisheries, questions with regard to illegal immigration, questions concerning drug trafficking and trafficking of human beings, then in those instances I think that there is a lot of scope for having a system of national coastguards coordinated in a more effective and efficient way by, for example, sharing the assets that different Member States enjoy, by exchanging data and by creating necessary tools, including for example sea mapping, which could be an asset for coastguard and other activities."
"But, on the other hand, if we go into very sensitive military aspects, then that could be more difficult to handle."
"My underlying message is, if we want an integrated maritime policy to succeed, we have to do so hand in hand with the Member States, who, after all, have the primary responsibility for ensuring that the necessary instruments are in place for such a policy to succeed."
"On the question concerning the Baltic Sea, there is no doubt, as I said in a previous reply, the maritime policy needs to take into account the specific features or characteristics of the different maritime regions of the European Union."
"Therefore, if there are particular problems, as there are, with regard to the Baltic Sea, then the maritime policy has to create the tools in order to tackle those problems of the Baltic Sea."
"Therefore, if there are particular ecological problems in the Baltic Sea that need to be addressed and that can be addressed in some way or other, then we should do our utmost in order to do so."
"For example, with regard to fisheries, we are taking measures in order to try to attain, against various odds, sustainable fisheries in the Baltic."
"We are also taking measures with regard to the Baltic in order to try to reverse the problems that there are concerning maritime transport traffic routes through the Baltic Sea."
"Therefore an integrated approach to maritime affairs would certainly mean that we look at all these problems and try to bring about more coordination between the different stakeholders, between the different Member States and also third countries like Russia, with regard to the Baltic, so that in that way we can achieve a better result with regard to the management of the different sectoral areas concerning the Baltic."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"I apologise to the Members who were not able to speak; it seems that we ought to set aside more time for debates like this one."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday 11 October 2007."
"Written declarations (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (PT) The Commission has presented its proposals on a 'vision' and 'action plan' for a future 'integrated maritime policy' at EU level."
"Although it has not been possible to carry out the analysis required (not forgetting that the devil is in the detail), my initial reactions are as follows:"
"Any initiative in this area must safeguard the Member States' competence as regards spatial management, in particular its territorial waters and exclusive economic zones (EEZ), as represented for example by: resource exploitation, transport, research, border controls and security, regional planning, the environment, or economic activities such as fishing."
"That is, we should not have a Trojan horse, under the guise of the so-called principle of subsidiarity, posing a threat to the sovereignty of the Member States."
"The 'sound financial basis' mentioned for the 'maritime policy' should not be created at the expense of the European Fisheries Fund, since new and increased financial means should be allocated to meet the new priorities."
"Aquaculture should not be promoted, since that would not achieve optimum results in the fisheries sector in view of its strategic importance for various countries like Portugal; the relevant socio-economic sustainability should be secured by means of suitable policies and financial resources."
"in writing. - (FR) With this 'Blue Paper', the European Union is taking a step forward."
"Though it is regrettable that on certain points - like the issue of European coastguards and a European flag - the European Commission has had to scale down its ambitions because of a lack of support from certain Member States, this document is a good basis to start from."
"I hope it will keep all its promises."
"However, the issue of finance will be decisive, something the Commission itself recognises."
"Will our ministers shoulder their responsibilities?"
"For the rest, I am particularly delighted by the Commission's decision to address the revision of social legislation in the maritime sector, to which traditional employment law and its protections do not apply."
"It was about time!"
"This decisive factor in making maritime careers attractive should therefore help Europe to protect its maritime expertise."
"Murder of women in Mexico and Central America"
"The next item is the debate on the report (Α6-0338/2007) by Raül Romeva i Rueda, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, on the murders of women in Central America and Mexico, and the role of the EU in fighting this phenomenon (2007/2025(ΙΝΙ))."
"rapporteur. - (ES) Madam President, although the murder of women is a global problem, there are areas of the world that, due to both the magnitude and the complexity of the phenomenon, have become paradigmatic cases."
"Those places are also, very regrettably, mirrors that reflect many of the problems that, to varying degrees, affect societies governed by social patterns based on a patriarchal culture."
"This is the case, for example, with Mexico and the countries of Central America."
"In fact, it was in Mexico where the concept of feminicide began to take shape, especially when the Special Prosecution Service for investigating and prosecuting cases of feminicide in the Republic of Mexico, chaired by the congresswoman Marcela Lagarde, established that the concept referred to, and I quote, 'the sum total of crimes against humanity consisting of criminal acts, kidnappings and disappearances affecting girls and women in a context of institutional collapse'."
"In short, it is a breakdown in the rule of law that promotes impunity."
"Although the concept is in the progress of being developed, some advocate the use of the term 'feminicide' in order to contrast it with the term 'homicide'..."
"I would like to ask for a little quiet in the House."
"rapporteur. - (ES) Thank you, Madam President."
"I will continue."
"I was saying that, although the concept is one that is constantly evolving, in fact some feel it is necessary to talk about feminicide in order to contrast it with the concept of homicide, and it is significant that what it highlights is the existence of one of the most alarming phenomena of our time: the murder of women for the simple reason that they are women."
"Over the last two years the European Parliament has done a great deal of work on this issue, and there will be an important milestone in this process when tomorrow, 11 October, the Plenary adopts the report on the murders of women in Mexico and Central America and the role of the European Union in fighting this phenomenon."
"The report is also the result of a long and intensive process of dialogue with all the sectors involved and numerous compromises between the political groups."
"I would like to take this opportunity, in fact, to thank all the shadow rapporteurs for their support and inform you that also present here today are Marjo Searle and Arsène Van Nierop, the mothers of Brenda and Hester respectively, who were both murdered in Mexico."
"With the adoption of this report the European Parliament will be in line with other institutions that have already expressed their positions on the issue."
"This has been done by the Council of Europe and the United Nations, and of various parliaments and governments all over the world."
"Its content will represent considerable progress, both in defining the problem and in various parties taking responsibility in the fight to eradicate it."
"One of the principles that comes out of the report is recognising, as a starting point for any analysis, the multiple causes and forms of this type of crime that exist."
"It is certain that, for example, the highly publicised case of Ciudad Juárez - more than 400 women murdered since 1993 - has a great deal to do with the fact that it is a border city with the typical problems of such areas."
"However, there are also many factors that require efforts to be concentrated and integrated public policies to be implemented."
"These policies include: prevention, investing in education for equality and reversing the patriarchal culture; improvements in data collection and forensic investigation; facilitating and speeding up reporting of crimes; training police, judges, prosecutors and doctors in this type of crime; monitoring of local businesses and multinational companies that operate in the area, many of which subject female workers to incredibly vulnerable conditions; legislative reforms and transposition of regulations at the appropriate levels of society; and finally, placing a special emphasis on support for victims and their families."
"Regarding the latter issue, however, I would like to report here and deeply regret the fact that, on many occasions, the victims are despised and even criminalised; and their families are persecuted and even accused of harming the good image of a city or country simply because they want to raise awareness of the problem and because they want to demand, and do demand, justice."
"Obviously those with the main and biggest responsibility for implementing all the measures proposed are the governmental institutions of the countries directly concerned, and in this case it is obvious that they are Mexico and the countries of Central America."
"However, bearing in mind that the European Union has an association agreement with the former, which, moreover, includes a clause for democracy and respect for human rights, and that, in addition, a similar agreement is being negotiated with the Central American region, it is more than justifiable for the European institutions to take sides and make specific commitments regarding this problem."
"Nobody should see this as interference by the European Union in the internal affairs of another country, especially given that, even though considerable progress has been made, as acknowledged in the report, especially from a legislative point of view, the magnitude of the problem requires greater effort and commitment from the whole world, especially Europe."
"In short, I hope that after all these months we have achieved the necessary level of agreement and consensus so that tomorrow, in the vote, this resolution will be adopted by a majority of the House and we will finally send a clear and firm message about what it means to fight violence against women, in particular in the regions concerned."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, as a woman and also as a member of the Commission, first of all I would like to thank the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality for the defence of women in Europe, but also worldwide."
"This report, presented today, is indeed to be seen within this context of a global fight against gender-related violence."
"This is how we see it, and I thank the rapporteur very much, Mr Romeva i Rueda, for what he said."
"Feminicide is a tragic issue which covers a much broader problem, that of violence against women, which we must fight at all levels: at local, but also at global levels."
"And I would like to talk to you about what we as a Commission are doing to address the question of gender violence in general, again, and also in particular. To promote it through our external relations policy in Mexico and in Central Asia."
"Also, if you allow me, I would like to say a few words about my recent visit to the region, because I was there just last week (but not in Mexico)."
"I visited Panama, El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua."
"I had already been in Mexico and I will go there most probably next year."
"I can tell you that the Commission is on the frontline in the effort of preventing violence against women."
"Let me remind you that, on 8 March 2006, the Commission issued what we called a 'road map for equality between men and women', outlining the eradication of all forms of gender-based violence as a priority objective."
"In March of this year, we adopted a communication on gender equality in development cooperation, stating that gender-based violence in all its manifestations violates women's human rights and is indeed a serious obstacle to the achievement of equality, development and peace."
"The Commission also supports projects on education and on awareness-raising interventions aimed at engaging all adolescents in programmes aiming at changing their behaviour in relation to violence against girls and women."
"For instance, as I said, I was just in El Salvador, and I visited a programme that is called 'Pro Jóvenes', which is for girls and boys - but especially for girls - who have either already been in the so-called Maras, or who could enter into the Maras, in order to prevent them from doing so."
"I was most impressed by this programme."
"The New European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights also provides a wide scope for activities in the field of gender equality."
"Concerning the situation in Mexico, I would like to point out that EU-Mexico relations are based on our 1997 global agreement, in which Article 1 identifies human rights as a fundamental element of EU-Mexican relations."
"On that very basis, both parties have established what I think, in the mean time, is a fruitful cooperation in the fields of human rights and justice, a cooperation which is then carried out through our different Commission programmes implemented by the Mexican federal authorities, as well as through projects carried out also by non-state actors and by NGOs."
"The Mexican authorities also keep us informed about gender-related violence in Mexico."
"So we learned that a number of cases had been resolved and many others were under investigation."
"My last personal conversation with the new Mexican Foreign Minister - who is, as you know, also a woman - was in Santo Domingo, where we mentioned this question of feminicide and where I got some relevant information about what the Mexican Government is doing."
"They have also a special human rights adviser, another lady who is also working particularly on this issue."
"In the case of Central America, as a region, the country where the issue is most critical is Guatemala."
"Our approach has been to confront the issue, both in our dialogue with the authorities and through, again, a number of activities on the issue of violence against women."
"This includes the mainstreaming on the gender dimension in all the cooperation programmes."
"The Commission also organised, in March last year, an important communication campaign targeted at young people and decision-makers on how to stop violence against women."
"In the same period we also welcomed the creation of a national commission on feminicide, composed of officials from the executive, the judiciary and also the congress, and a total of 18 state institutions."
"Recently, we also noted the creation of an international commission against impunity in Guatemala, which we also strongly support."
"As a part of this Commission programme supporting the judiciary, a specific component is dedicated to feminicide. In particular to activities carried out by the so-called CEPROM."
"This is the presidential office in charge, with whom we have a memorandum of understanding on cooperation."
"Let me also mention our support for the preparatory work for the revision of the law against feminicide, now before Congress, with a view to the revision of the penal code."
"Finally, let me say that I found a lot of goodwill and pro-European spirit in this trip to Central America on this issue."
"I was really positively surprised by the interest in enhancing regional integration, and cooperative attitudes also towards the forthcoming negotiations of an association agreement."
"I must say it was very important to see that even the interest in Panama was much higher than I expected. I am looking forward to the possibility of everybody there being included."
"The first message that I passed on there was the importance of achieving progress on the negotiations that will finally start at the San José Process in Costa Rica."
"This is important because, naturally, it will be a political dialogue there; there will be a cooperation programme, and there will also be free trade negotiations."
"But it will be a compact programme."
"Social cohesion will be among the most important issues in the whole of Latin America, including Central America, and there this programme also has a very great importance."
"Indeed, juvenile violence and violence against women are issues that we find have to be there because we have to all do everything in order to diminish violence in society."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we cannot ignore the reality of feminicide in Central America."
"In many regions of the world, women make an essential contribution to the most worthy societal structures of humanity."
"Thanks to their feminine intuition, women enrich our understanding of the world."
"They help to make human relations between people more honest and authentic."
"The time has come to condemn and severely punish all forms of violence perpetrated against women, not only in Central America but also in several countries of Europe."
"In this regard, the participation of women in managing material aid and assistance given to the victims of this violence could be of fundamental importance."
"Ladies and gentlemen, if the EU Member States can bring their experience to resolving problems, we should not withhold our expertise."
"That is why I remain convinced that bilateral cooperation between the Member States and the states of Central America can be effective."
"I bear witness here to a frankly sensitive job within the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality."
"I thank the rapporteur, Mr Romeva, for his political sense and cooperation."
"We have tabled some amendments by common agreement."
"If these amendments are adopted, we can take pride in a job that may improve the situation of women and thus of the whole of Central American society."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PT) I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur for the excellent work done, for the ongoing dialogue with the shadow rapporteurs, and for the openness and receptivity to suggestions presented to him."
"Many people took part in the process and I think that is quite exemplary."
"The Socialist Group will therefore support the content of the report and the proposals for amendments tabled."
"We know that when there are problems of any kind it is always the women who suffer most throughout the world, Europe, America, Asia, Africa, everywhere."
"Poverty and social exclusion are the lot of women, as are violence, psychological and physical violence and extreme violence resulting in death."
"This report deals with that extreme violence, with the death of many women in Central American countries and Mexico."
"I had the opportunity to visit Guatemala, along with the rapporteur under the umbrella of the European Union-Central America Delegation, and to hear the amazing accounts and reports of many non-governmental organisation officials."
"We know that many feminicide murders are committed in Guatemala and in Ciudad Juárez."
"Feminicide, as the report mentions, cannot be explained purely in terms of a general climate of violence."
"Account must be taken of the context and of the discrimination which still continues against women and it is an absolute tragedy that many cases go unpunished."
"There is, moreover, the case referred to in the report of two Dutch citizens who were also feminicide victims."
"Therefore, although some progress has been made and some measures have been taken, these are not enough; we need to go much further and, above all, we need to create effective protection measures for witnesses and victims, so that the perpetrators may be punished and the European Parliament's missions to those countries can always place that item on their agenda."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, violence against women in Mexico and Central America has, in recent years, reached dramatic proportions, with thousands of women having been the victims of violent deaths, which on many occasions have been extremely cruel in nature and often accompanied by sexual abuse and torture."
"Although in many cases the perpetrators of such atrocious crimes are sick-minded individuals, in many situations organised criminal activity is very much involved, and the implication of human trafficking, prostitution and drugs is largely in evidence."
"It is very sad that in Mexico and Central American countries the functioning of the rule of law in certain cases leaves a lot to be desired, either because of real organisational deficiencies in the police and judiciary systems, or because of corruption and impunity."
"The rapporteur, Mr Romeva i Rueda, is to be congratulated for making sure that this report is strong enough to send the necessary message not only to the governments of the countries concerned, but also to the world as a whole, about the totally unacceptable high level of femicides in the aforementioned states."
"The small number of final amendments - which incidentally have the rapporteur's full support - are useful and make this report more complete."
"My group fully supports all those amendments."
"It is to be hoped that this report will be voted through this House with a very large majority, so as to give a very clear signal to all concerned that the problem of the killing of women in Central America, as indeed in other parts of the world, is a matter that should attract our full attention and necessitates the taking of very drastic and effective remedial measures."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, as a member of the Mexico delegation, I would particularly like to thank the Committee on Women's Rights and specifically the rapporteur for the fact that this problem, which has also cast a shadow on many discussions with our colleagues in Mexico, has been dealt with."
"I am hoping for a very broad majority tomorrow, which expresses one opinion and which emphasises how seriously we heave dealt with this problem."
"In view of the appalling figures, the reports on the harassment of witnesses and solicitors, death threats and threats of torture, harassment of families, of situations which can in no way be accepted, it is the European Union's duty to speak out and it is also its duty to point out the peculiarity of this phenomenon."
"It represents a particularly dramatic development of a global phenomenon concerning the way in which women are treated, which must be quickly brought to an end in the 21st century."
"It must be addressed on a very amicable basis with our counterparts in the countries concerned because a positive development is only possible in a society when women are able to live free of fear and aggression and when threats, which are made against them and from which they suffer because they are women, are prosecuted appropriately."
"I therefore welcome all the positive measures being adopted here."
"We need witness protection, we need a better legal system, we need education."
"Then we shall be able - so I believe - to support women in Mexico, in Latin America, in order to achieve a level of protection for them that is acceptable to us."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (SV) Thank you, Madam President."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur very much for his excellent work and also for his commitment and the knowledge that he possesses in this area, and I want to say straight away that our Group fully supports this report."
"This form of feminicide that we are now discussing has grown, above all in areas where we have companies investing in subcontractor plants and where women are completely dependent on men, socially, economically, in all areas."
"The young women employed in these assembly plants are not only likely to be affected by the increased violence but they also work under highly degrading conditions that reinforce the image of women as inferior beings who can be murdered, tortured, kidnapped and so on. I note the measures stated by the Commission, but I would also want to see even tougher and stronger pressure being put on these countries by the European Union."
"We must show that it is completely unacceptable to sign agreements on respect for human rights while murder is still going on."
"We should be able to freeze trade agreements until we can see that the demands we have rightly made are being complied with, until for example the governments in the relevant countries invest sufficient resources in finding and bringing to justice the authors of the crimes."
"This wide-scale brutality against women has now been going on for almost ten years and rather than being reduced, it has actually grown, so it is high time to take action."
"Thank you."
"(ES) Madam President, I would also like to thank the rapporteur for his work and, in particular, for being willing to express Parliament's inescapable and unwavering commitment to the serious and urgent problem of violence against women."
"I welcome the fact that, since it was in committee, this report has become more balanced, less paternalistic and has gained the right perspective, as, sadly, violence against women is not confined to one region, one country or one continent, but is global and universal, and we should take this into consideration for future work done by this House."
"Unfortunately, and perhaps under different circumstances, it also happens in the European Union."
"I would like to say, without going any further, that in my country the statistics are devastating: 166 000 cases reported to the courts, 48 000 people detained last year (one every twelve minutes) and almost 70 women murdered; the last one yesterday, her throat cut by her partner."
"I think that these terrible statistics, Madam President, should lead us to think profoundly about the role of our Parliament, which I do not see as a court that punishes and pontificates, but as an institution that has its own effective strategies for seeking, by mutual agreement with our partners and on the basis of dialogue, cooperation and good practice, solutions for eradicating this process."
"The case of Mexico, which is very significant and is cited in the report: this is a country that has a high level of violence to start with, which European Union citizens have been victims of, and whose families we stand with."
"However, we also have to recognise that it is a society that is fighting, which is not happy with the situation and is valiantly struggling to overcome this problem, by mobilising the State authorities, the federal authorities and the local authorities, and the whole of society and all its political parties, and therefore, Madam President, the report recognises the progress that has been made."
"It is important, and I will conclude with this, to ask the Commission for the human rights action plan to be concluded quickly and ambitiously, Madam President."
"I would like to finish by saying that violence against women is a problem of abuse, it is a problem of cowardice, it is a problem of intolerance and, above all, Madam President, it is a problem of fear and powerlessness, of fear of accepting the will of others and, above all, fear of peacefully imposing will and reason based on argument, peacefully and not through violence."
"(HU) Madam President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Romeva i Rueda for his report, which takes a position on an important problem."
"I am very pleased that, as a fellow member, he is taking the situation of women so seriously."
"Violence against women is a violation of human rights that prevents women from exercising their fundamental rights."
"It therefore counts as one of the greatest global barriers to equality of the sexes in society."
"This phenomenon occurs to differing extents but is present globally, and so action must be taken against it globally, in harmony with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights."
"States themselves, Mexico in this case, are responsible for respecting and creating the freedom and safety of their citizens, so they must guarantee the instruments necessary to prevent, shed light on and punish violence against women, even if the violence occurs within the family."
"I think it is very positive that Mexico has taken legal steps towards equality for men and women."
"Nevertheless, the fight against violence against women cannot merely be restricted to the use of legal instruments, since this is a complex phenomenon that requires complex treatment, legal, administrative, preventive, advisory, victim-support, dialogue and monitoring tasks and obligations for the state in question."
"The European Union - which has committed itself on several occasions to ensuring global equality, and which has defined the road map for equality for the period 2006-2010 published by the European Commission, and to which the Commissioner referred as one of its main priorities, as well as the halting of violence against women - cannot remain silent in the face of such atrocities."
"When forming external relations, developments in human rights and the equality of women must be considered as emphasised criteria."
"The report is excellent, and I recommend that it be adopted."
"(PT) We cannot stay indifferent to violence committed against women in any part of the world, in particular in our own countries."
"We are therefore paying particularly close attention to this serious problem in Mexico and some countries in Central America, where there is still feminicide which cannot be attributed solely to a general climate of violence."
"We know that it is also necessary to take account of discrimination within the local social and economic context which is unfavourable to women and is even worse in the case of indigenous women living in serious poverty and economic dependence, with the additional problem of the activities of criminal gangs."
"Here too, we therefore proclaim our solidarity with the women who are victims of such violence and add our voice to the call to see women's rights upheld, and their dignity respected; we naturally support the report of our fellow Member, Mr Romeva."
"(ES) Madam President, firstly I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur on this report."
"I would like to highlight a few issues from it and also point out one aspect that I think perhaps is missing."
"In order to win the battle against murders of women and against impunity we need to attack on a variety of fronts."
"In the short term, we need to eliminate all discrimination in legislation, facilitate reporting of crimes and protection measures for victims, witnesses and family members, and improve the judicial and prison systems."
"In this field, I agree that there is a need for the European Union to offer its full cooperation to these countries in order to overcome the difficulties and delays in the implementation of women's rights in legislation, to encourage the ratification of international agreements on the protection of human rights and to support the revision and updating of national legislation in this field."
"I will therefore support the Obiols-Estrela amendment along those lines."
"Improving the situation in the long term requires that we promote education in values through gender equality and education campaigns and awareness-raising from childhood in schools, in order to promote a social conscience that will bring an end to violence against women and the stigmatisation of the victims by the authorities."
"Perhaps a more specific mention of the issue of education is what I think is missing."
"I think that all the efforts that we are making in this direction will do little to put an end to this blot on society that should not have a place in 21st century societies."
"Madam President, many thanks for this truly important debate, and in particular my sincere thanks once more to the rapporteur."
"As I said a little while ago, as a woman and as the Commissioner for External Relations and European Neighbourhood Policy this issue is of course particularly important to me, and it is absolutely correct to say - as indeed I did at the start - that it is a general issue, one that unfortunately affects all of us in all countries."
"This includes the European Union, but it is of course much more the case in poor countries, countries without the proper socioeconomic conditions, countries lacking, in particular, an effective police system - meaning that difficulties arise even at the detection stage - and also, in most cases, an effective judicial system."
"After all, that too is crucial."
"We are also aware that, in many of the countries that have been mentioned here, such as Central America and Mexico, along with many others, the phenomenon of corruption still exists, and mafia organisations work together with leading figures in the judiciary in some cases, which means that the detection rate is still very poor."
"I agree with much of what has been said today: firstly legislative measures and secondly implementation measures."
"In addition, I can reiterate that the Commission already has programmes in place and is working on these matters."
"However, the time factor also has to be taken into account, of course."
"Unfortunately, this phenomenon is not one that can be eradicated overnight; it can only be brought under control gradually in the context of socioeconomic development."
"Sadly, it is something that we shall all have to deal with for some time to come."
"Preventive measures must be taken, of course;"
"I have just highlighted the example of 'Pro Jóvenes' as it is such an interesting programme."
"Ladies and gentlemen, if you ever return to El Salvador - or even Guatemala, but particularly El Salvador - I would recommend taking a look yourselves."
"This is at least a dash of good news."
"I can only affirm that we shall of course continue our programmes, and shall also continue to conduct our assuredly critical dialogue with Mexico, but I readily admit that, as Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra said, Mexico itself must be prepared to tackle this issue and take up the cause."
"The thing is that, when a crime has been detected too late, it is very difficult to determine all aspects after the event."
"Consequently, it is also very important to draw on all the relevant methods of modern police technology, as detection is the first factor and justice the second, and of course the question of general non-discrimination in society is also decisive."
"I can only assure you that I am most certainly on your side in this matter."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday 11 October 2007."
"Written declarations (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (SK) On 8 March 2007 on the occasion of International Woman's Day, the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament began its campaign for the eradication of violence against women."
"This report on feminicides in Mexico and Central America is part of the overall initiative, the aim of which is the global eradication of violence against women."
"It is in these countries in particular that the number of violent deaths has grown significantly in the past years."
"According to the official Mexican statistics, 6 000 girls and women were killed between 1999 and 2006."
"The most alarming statistics come mainly from countries that have deep-rooted economic inequalities in society, and in particular where women traditionally are economically dependent on men: countries such as Guatemala, Salvador, Honduras - the third poorest country in South America - and Nicaragua."
"Feminicides in Ciudad Juárez and Guatemala are particularly alarming, and for this reason I welcome today's debate."
"I believe that only through in-depth analysis of these issues, which should take place prior to the 2008 EU-LAC summit in Lima, will we be able to assess the measures adopted, including the experience of the Mexican authorities, which will help to combat violence against women both in the EU and South America."
"We must step up our efforts to protect women from all types of violence."
"The problem of feminicide and the impunity of the perpetrators in Mexico and Central America has not improved in spite of massive efforts."
"Therefore, the governments of Mexico and Central American countries should continue to step up their endeavours towards the prevention and detection of feminicide and other cases of violence against women."
"In this connection, I would ask the governments of Central American countries to intensify their monitoring of the exercise of corporate social responsibility by the maquiladora (sub-contractor) companies."
"In addition, the European principles of equal opportunities and equal rights for women and men must influence the proactive human rights policy of the EU more strongly."
"Consequently, I call on the Commission to make a proposal concerning how the various European initiatives designed to combat feminicide can be better coordinated with local authorities and institutions in future."
"All the available external policy instruments must be used."
"In this connection, I would ask the Commission and the Member States to step up activities to verify compliance with the democracy and human rights clauses of existing and pending agreements."
"When negotiating the association agreement with the countries of Central America, an assessment of the impact on gender equality should be carried out as part of the assessment of the impact on sustainable development."
"The European human rights policy, and in particular women's rights, must on no account be up for consideration as a result of economic and geopolitical interests."
"One-minute speeches (Rule 144)"
"The next item is one-minute speeches on matters of political importance."
"Madam President, 7 October last year will be remembered as a dramatic wake-up call to what is going on in Russia."
"On that day, Anna Politkovskaya, considered to be a living symbol of honest journalism, was brutally murdered."
"President Putin dismissed Anna Politkovskaya's role as marginal and her case still remains unsolved."
"Last October in this House parliamentarians called on the Commission and the Member States to honour the legacy of Anna Politkovskaya by making the restoration of free media in Russia a primary condition for the further development of our relations, because, only if we send a clear signal that we value Anna Politkovskaya's quest for truth and freedom more highly than oil and gas, will conditions in Russia start to change."
"There is no question that we in Europe share the values for which Anna Politkovskaya gave her life."
"Sadly Mr Putin does not seem to share these values."
"Respect for Anna Politkovskaya commits us to make this clear to President Putin in forthcoming summits."
"(RO) I will speak about the issue of zoological parks in Romania."
"According to the assessments performed by some nongovernmental international organizations of this field, the transposition of the Directive regarding zoological parks into the Romanian legislation is considered one of the best in Europe."
"Nevertheless, bringing the 41 Romanian zoological parks up to European standards within the established deadline, namely by the end of this year, seems to be almost impossible to achieve."
"Under the pressure of this deadline and the conditions of an existing public-private partnership, I support the importance of immediately implementing the common action plan, which comprises the next priority steps: to conduct a national study for classifying the existent zoological parks, to organize an emergency rescue team and to temporarily prevent the reproduction of animals."
"I also consider it is necessary to offer some time for implementing this plan, before making the decision to close the zoological parks that do not meet the legal requirements."
"(PL) Madam President, despite the numerous remarks that have been heard in this Chamber in respect of Mr Schulz, he has not ceased his attacks and insults on European Union members, which are not worthy of this House."
"As someone who holds an important position in a Community institution, he is interfering in the internal affairs of a Member State and constantly insulting its representatives."
"Most of those in this House would never dream of interfering in the democratic elections of peoples of the EU."
"I am curious to know how this gentleman would feel if an MEP called on the German people to change their Chancellor, because there are organisations legally acting to spread Nazi thinking and to undermine the borders between European states."
"I think this gentleman is sorry he was born so late, in the wrong historical epoch."
"Mr President, earlier today Mr Pöttering made a statement on the World/European Day against the death penalty and said he rejected the death penalty 'in any form'."
"He seems to assume that we all agree with him."
"I do not."
"Last Sunday, just a mile from my home in London, an innocent boy of 17, Rizwan Darbar, was stabbed to death in West Ham Park because, it is reported, he attempted to stop a friend's mobile phone from being stolen."
"This is not an unusual occurrence in Britain."
"Innocent people are being shot, stabbed and beaten to death with increasing frequency."
"Why is this?"
"It is because the thugs and criminals do not fear the law."
"Even if they are caught and convicted, they often receive very lenient sentences."
"Personally, I would like to see the reintroduction of the death penalty in Britain for perpetrators of these kinds of murders."
"Of course this could not be done unless we were outside of the European Union, which is yet another good reason for leaving."
"Mr President, we have already had mention today of Libya, and I want to give it another billing."
"Libya, quite properly, was made to pay for the Lockerbie terrorist atrocity, but Libya as a global sponsor of terrorism has yet to make full reparation."
"The IRA's vile campaign of terror reached its most deadly when equipped with Libyan Semtex and weaponry, permitting Martin McGuinness and its other army council leaders to unleash the most vicious phase of their campaign."
"Without Libya, hundreds of innocents would not have died."
"Thus, tonight in this House, I want to back the present campaign by the victims' group in Northern Ireland - by the name of FAIR - to bring Libya to international account by forcing it to pay compensation, as occurred with Lockerbie."
"Just as the EU pressurised Libya over the Bulgarian nurses, so it should support justice for IRA victims by pressing Libya to settle the litigation now issued against it by FAIR in the United States of America."
"(RO) Through the Committee on Budgets, the Parliament has made an extremely important decision."
"Through the 30% reserves established from administrative expenses for the European Social Fund, the European Fund for Regional Development and the Cohesion Fund as well, we send a strong signal to the European Commission."
"The approval of operational programmes should be done within the time specified by the European directives, in this case four months."
"Although Romania was one of the first countries that submitted these documents as early as in January, at present, two of the most important operational programmes have not been approved yet."
"I am talking about the operational programme for administrative capacity development and the operational programme for human resources."
"Taking into consideration the fact that we are not the only Member State in this situation, I would like to know the reasons, if they are not bureaucratic, that cause the Commission to postpone their approval to November."
"According to the common statement we adopted together with the Council following the conciliation of July 13th, the Commission should ensure the rapid approval of the Member States' programmes and projects and submit a roadmap for their adoption."
"Mr President, I welcome the opportunity to raise the report on industrial relations in the postal sector, which has just been published by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions."
"Indeed, I wish this report had been available before we voted on the postal services."
"But even now, it is a timely wake-up call for all governments that will be privatising their postal services over the next number of years."
"In the EU we are committed to the Lisbon Agenda, more and better jobs."
"Unfortunately, this report tells us that privatisation of the postal sector so far has delivered fewer but, more critically, worse jobs with poorer working conditions."
"The report states that since the beginning of the liberalisation process, sectoral pay developments in all but three countries have been below the average."
"But crucially, in all countries, a pay gap exists between employees of the main providers and those of the new entrants or the alternative providers."
"If left unchecked, the situation will, and I quote from the report, 'erode employment conditions and lead to more conflictual industrial relations'."
"So far, postal privatisation has failed the Lisbon test."
"(PL) Mr President, during the present term of the European Parliament I have already appealed several times for an end to discrimination against Poles, especially Catholics."
"This time too we are viewing the demand being made by certain media to withhold the subsidy for the University of Social and Media Culture as a blatant expression of discrimination and of a motivation driven by criteria other than intrinsic merit."
"The accusations levelled against that institution by certain media are no more than slanders formulated by people who at one time enslaved Poland and the Poles."
"Nowadays, in democratic times, they cannot come to terms with the loss of absolute power."
"The University, which is appealing for financial support, provides education and training in a universal value system, and particularly for students from poor families."
"A tightening of criteria and refusal to allocate funds resulting from the media witch-hunt, particularly in the Year of Equal Opportunities for All, would, in our view, be not only a manifestation of discrimination in respect of religion and outlook, but actually a symptom of the application of totalitarian methods, which stands in contrast to the declared values, standards and requirements of European law."
"(PL) Mr President, I wish to draw attention to a very important problem in the European Commission, and one which is constantly neglected here in the forum of the European Parliament: it concerns transport communications."
"The shortest transport route from Scandinavia, the north of Europe, to the south - to Turkey, Greece and Bulgaria - lies via the Central European transport corridor."
"This is a corridor that would begin at Ystad, in Sweden, would run through the Polish cities of Szczecin and Wrocław, the Czech city of Prague, the Slovak city of Bratislava, Vienna, and on through Constanţa, Thessaloniki and Trieste."
"This route continues to be ignored, and in my view, its inclusion on the list of European road and rail routes would speed up and shorten transport routes along this line, and would also give a boost to the whole Central European corridor and to all the cities and regions that lie around this line."
"Mr President, earlier today we had the publication of the European Transport Safety Council report on EU progress on reducing road deaths by half by 2010."
"It contains some good and some bad news."
"Yes - countries have made improvements, and that is to be welcomed, but overall road deaths are still too high and the EU will not, on current trends, achieve its road death reduction targets."
"In fact only three Member States - Luxembourg, France and Portugal - will achieve the target set."
"They have succeeded in reducing road deaths by over 8% a year."
"It is worth remembering that over 39 000 people were killed on the roads in the EU in the last 12 months."
"Had we achieved our targets, 5 000 people would still be alive today."
"I regret that Ireland, my own country, is still in the lower half of the league when it comes to making those necessary improvements."
"We could take messages from the best performing countries."
"They have put in a great deal of commitment and political will to improve enforcement in a number of key areas."
"The EU has just three years left to put in place measures that could see us achieving our targets of reducing road deaths by half."
"The experience shows it can be done but we need a fresh impetus at EU level to achieve that."
"(FR) Mr President, I would like to draw Parliament's attention to the problem of Kosovo and, particularly, to the need for the European Parliament to be able to answer for this European internal matter and to ensure that the right of the people to determine their own future can, quite rightly, be respected."
"Many political elements are appearing and exerting pressure to bring about the partition of Kosovo, which is not an answer."
"This is very clear to us, particularly in relation to the problems associated with the Palestinian Territory and the division of that territory in 1946."
"Strong pressure should therefore be brought to bear, with the European Parliament, to prevent a partition, to prevent conflict from being generated in this way and to enable the people to decide their own destiny, making sure that the European Parliament can be present, present on the European stage, and also present throughout our territory."
"Mr President, unfortunately, by the time I have finished this speech, two people will have killed themselves."
"This is because worldwide one person commits suicide every 30 seconds."
"A staggering one million persons, many of them young men and women, end their lives every year."
"Suicide is very relevant to the EU because five out of the top ten countries in terms of suicide rates are EU Member States: Lithuania, Estonia, Hungary, Slovenia and Latvia."
"In fact, Lithuania has the highest suicide rate record in the world."
"These are very sad statistics for the EU as, in most cases, the cause of suicide is preventable."
"The EU has a duty to its citizens to urgently reduce suicide rates in its Member States."
"I request you, Mr President, to address personally all EU Member State governments and national parliaments, especially those of the five aforementioned countries, and urge them strongly to redouble their efforts to prevent suicide amongst their citizens."
"By so doing, many thousands of lives may be saved each year."
"(RO) A recent study shows that, in Romania, approximately 170,000 children in the 5th-8th grades have one or two parents that have left to work abroad."
"The large number of children left with their grandparents or families increases every day in the European Union new Member States, as well as in the candidate countries."
"For this reason, I would like to emphasize the need to create adequate structures, which would help children and parents be together, as well as the need for a social policy that would focus on solidarity."
"I consider that the facilitation of family reunion, as a factor of economic and social integration, should constitute an essential aspect of the legal immigration policies."
"At the same time, I request the European Commission both to draw up a strategy regarding the situation of children who remained in their countries of origin after their parents left and to provide support for creating adequate structures in the Member States, in order to help children and parents adjust to new family situations."
"That concludes the one-minute speeches."
"Financing the common agricultural policy"
"The next item is the report by Jorgo Chatzimarkakis, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy - C6-0116/2007 -."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, thank you for giving me the opportunity to say a few words about the report on Regulation 1290/2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy."
"First of all, I would like to thank Mr Chatzimarkakis and the committee members for their efforts."
"The Commission proposal contains two items which are of political importance."
"First, to provide for the necessary follow-up on the relevant part of Article 53b on the Financial Regulation, which stipulates that the transparency obligation and ex post publication of beneficiaries by the Member States must be ensured by sector-specific legislation."
"Second, to reinforce the mechanism by which financial discipline is safeguarded through a new reduction-suspension mechanism of agricultural aid, which is more structured and more transparent than the current mechanism already laid down in the Regulation, and by introducing the possibility for the Commission to make financial corrections for failing ex post controls."
"The Commission is very much in favour of openness and transparency."
"One element of this is the right of the public to know what is happening with the Community aid and to see who is receiving what amounts."
"Article 53 of the Financial Regulation sets out that there should be an ex post publication of beneficiaries by Member States."
"The follow-up to this general obligation is, as far as EAGGF and EAFRD spending is concerned, to be found in the Commission's proposal."
"The Commission insists very much on the Member States publishing this information, as, under shared management, they are the contact for the farming community and are therefore in a much better position than the Commission to validate the information to be published."
"I am very grateful for you support on this issue."
"The Commission will take inspiration from some of the amendments proposed when it adopts the implementing legislation, but it would not be in line with better regulation and simplification if all the - sometimes very technical - details were put into the Council regulation."
"However, let me make one thing clear."
"Beneficiaries are to be informed beforehand of the fact that certain information needs to be published, and publication will take place only within the context of the full respect of the privacy legislation applicable."
"As you know, there is already a reduction-suspension mechanism in Regulation 1290/2005."
"In comparison with that mechanism, the proposed provision offers a new transparent and effective mechanism allowing a further simplification of the existing possibility to reduce or suspend payments to a Member State in case of serious and persistent deficiencies in the national control systems."
"This new provision has the advantage that certain elements are determined in advance, so as to ensure a more efficient use of such an instrument."
"It goes without saying that the reduction mechanism already in place will continue to be applicable for other types of cases."
"However, amendments aimed at diluting the reduction mechanism are not acceptable to the Commission."
"Finally, I have noted quite a number of amendments aimed at further reinforcing the overall system for the management of agricultural expenditure which are not related to our proposal."
"On these, I think that the present text strikes a good balance, and we should give all actors time to put it into practice before considering any changes to the rules which, after all, just entered into force less than a year ago."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, many thanks for finding the time to be present here this evening despite the late hour."
"Indeed, the issue under discussion is not just some unimportant, marginal one - it is the common agricultural policy."
"I would like to start by reminding the House what this common agricultural policy actually means to the vast majority of our nearly 500 million citizens."
"After all, it is with these citizens in mind that such plenary debates are held."
"Nevertheless, it can be noted in this regard that many citizens see the common agricultural policy first and foremost as an advertisement for the EU - but unfortunately an extremely bad one."
"Export subsidies, supposedly unfair trade with 'third world' countries, feed scandals, farmers' protests, excessive subsidies, genetically modified plants - the number of negatively perceived issues relating to the common agricultural policy is immense and unfathomable."
"Misdemeanours in the common agricultural policy have contributed significantly to the EU's poor reputation in many parts of Europe."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this reputation is not something that can be dismissed out of hand this evening."
"This report, however - provided the Council supports it - could put the common agricultural policy on a new course, one that is closer to the ideas of the majority of citizens."
"I should like to start by discussing the Commission proposal once more."
"It essentially comprises four elements: transparency, i.e. the publication of the names of the beneficiaries of agricultural payments; introduction of the possibility of suspending payments to Member States under the first pillar in the case of serious breaches in their management and control systems; shortening of the periods of time for Commission auditing if Member States fail to comply with their control obligations (exceptions to the so-called 24-month rule); and adaptation of implementing powers."
"In political terms, the proposals on transparency are certainly of outstanding importance to the EP."
"With these, the Commission is finally implementing the decision of the Council and Parliament on the 2007 budget."
"In general I warmly welcome this project, although the Commission proposal is rather late in coming, probably partly owing to the incorporation of further facts into the text."
"Commission implementing regulations on the EAFRD are already envisaging publication of the names of all beneficiaries of payments under the second pillar."
"The other funds too (European Regional Development Fund, European Fisheries Fund, Cohesion Fund) now all contain publication rules."
"The budgetary decision has meant that, in essence, transparency has ceased to be controversial: it is no longer a case of if but only of how."
"Eleven Member States are already publishing all payments comprehensively."
"We need more transparency, therefore."
"The absence of transparency has allowed the emergence of rumours and campaigns of disinformation, which have harmed the CAP more than the odd actual error."
"The only problems are with the how: after all, the Commission gives no details of the procedure and wishes to lay down all the more detailed provisions in implementing regulations."
"As we are looking at an intrusion on the right of self-determination over personal data, my report proposes some clarifications regarding which data are to be published and under what conditions."
"These expressly follow an opinion of the European Data Protection Supervisor."
"In spite of the desire for speedy implementation, data protection must be taken very seriously - and the European Parliament is doing so."
"The objectives of this report are as follows: greater transparency, and at the same time clearer data protection requirements."
"In addition, the general public must be informed."
"How can this balancing act be achieved?"
"In my view, it is essential to inform those concerned in advance, and there is no transparency unless the figures mean something."
"Therefore, I propose differentiating more clearly, for example according to intervention purpose."
"My report proposes name, payment and place of residence/registered office."
"Nowadays, transparency means publication on the Internet."
"We are talking about the creation of a general Internet platform with links and references by the Commission."
"It is up to Member States to make the information comprehensible by means of the relevant explanations."
"Member States are permitted to publish the information at regional level, too, if they consider this appropriate."
"Different databases must be linked."
"In the Council, the issue of who publishes the information was very controversial."
"The financial management is mixed, so the Member States have clear responsibility - including under Article 53b of the budgetary decision."
"In addition, publication by the Commission would give rise to problems of legal protection, as persons affected by incorrect publication would have to go straight to the European Court of First Instance."
"This is neither citizen friendly nor particularly transparent."
"The Commission proposal is simpler, more transparent, less cumbersome to administer and more citizen friendly, and therefore has my support."
"It is in line with the provisions in all the other fields (the Structural Funds and the rules applying hitherto to the second pillar)."
"As the publication of the information is to be seen in the context of budgetary control, my report proposes a (moderate) flat-rate fine for cases of failure to publish information."
"On the subject of penal reductions in funding, I would say that I am broadly in favour, but there are some points where I should like to see greater regard for the principle of proportionality."
"In the Committee on Budgetary Control, my fellow Member Mr Mulder made proposals concerning the budgetary dimension of the dossier, which I can wholeheartedly endorse."
"In the Opinion of the Committee on Budgets, the committee expressed its views on the transparency aspects, and these largely correspond with my proposals."
"Ladies and gentlemen, and particularly members of the Council, this report was adopted unanimously in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"I hope for a large majority in tomorrow's vote, too."
"I implore the Council and the Commission to take this vote by the representatives of the European people seriously."
"There will also no doubt be a correlation between this report and the way all those involved deal with it, and the expected Health Check."
"We will undoubtedly return to this subject when we deal with the Health Check."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I am much obliged to my colleague Mr Chatzimarkakis, who has presented a report that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats can endorse in all respects."
"It is a legitimate question, however, whether this regulation was even necessary."
"It will provoke intense covetous discussion, as it is difficult to explain the context to citizens."
"Therefore, I think it a good thing that farming businesses are to be given an explanation of the reasons for the payments when details of these are published."
"Our farmers do indeed make a valuable contribution to our society, supplying us with food day by day, taking care of our cultural landscape and making a large contribution to the functioning of rural areas."
"Transparency cannot be a one-way street, however - it has to apply to both sides."
"For this reason, my group supports the report's call to make users sign on or register when using the information."
"As my colleague has just mentioned, it is also important that this directive does not invalidate data protection provisions, particularly those of Member States."
"In the interests of equal treatment, however, I would ask the Commission to present a regulation ensuring transparency also in non-governmental organisations, for example."
"I am convinced that more EU funds are being channelled into shady projects in the case of NGOs than is happening in the agricultural sector."
"This report gives us the opportunity to show the public why taxpayers' money is being spent on agriculture."
"Using the report appropriately will facilitate success in demonstrating to the public the great importance of European agriculture, in which case this Transparency Directive will have served its purpose."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, concerning the first objective of this Regulation, which is to comply with the obligation to publish information on the beneficiaries of Community funds, I think it is quite right that we should finally know who receives what from the CAP."
"This is a long-awaited measure, though it is not a question of stigmatising farmers but of creating transparency in finance, which concerns us all as taxpayers and consumers, and over which we have a right of information."
"I even think that this publication could be utterly beneficial and improve citizens' opinion of farmers and the payments they receive for services to the community in terms of supplying quality food that meets high production standards and in terms of maintaining the land and the countryside, for example."
"The publication of an explanatory statement for the payments made and the farm income, as the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is requesting, will also be very useful."
"I fully agree with the practical procedures for publication, defined in the report by our fellow Member, Mr Chatzimarkakis, which consist in setting up a European Internet platform linked to the Member States' Internet platforms on which the names of regional aid beneficiaries and where they live are put online."
"In the case of public limited companies or private limited companies, the names of the investors and members of the management board must also be known."
"I also support the evaluation reports requested of the European Commission in the years following the implementation of this regulation, which will be very useful, the assessment of the benefit of the centralised publication of information by the Commission, and the evaluation of the distribution of the funds, possibly accompanied by legislative proposals to achieve a more objective distribution of funds in the first and second pillars."
"On the other hand, as regards the methods for accessing these data, I do not agree at all with the proposals for confidentiality or a barrier to entry which, in my view, would completely diminish the transparency effect of this regulation."
"If transparency is being introduced, particularly regarding public funds, I feel that everyone should be able to access the information, without restrictions."
"In practice, because the data are first published by each Member State then taken up at EU level, it also seems almost impossible to introduce a registration system, and in any case thirteen Member States have already made these data public without any restriction."
"I therefore ask you to reject, wholly or in part, amendments 4, 20, 21 and 23, which require registration of the identity and motivations of the users of the public data."
"As regards the second objective - the tool to reduce or suspend agricultural payments when certain key elements of a national system of control fail or are ineffective - I think this is a useful means of taking action for the European Commission."
"But obviously it must be used in proportion to the nature, duration and seriousness of the offences."
"In the same way, the reduction percentage is cut if the Member State has gone some way towards remedying the shortcomings and increased if it has not applied the recommendations previously made."
"I also hope that the requirement will be retained for Member States to inform the Commission on the way they have decided or plan to reuse the cancelled funds following irregularities."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, first of all, I wish to congratulate the rapporteur for his excellent work."
"This regulation will have positive outcomes, in that it will ensure greater transparency and accountability."
"This is needed because that should be a requirement in itself for all European funding, but also because it will help to dispel some of the exaggerated myths that abound about the CAP."
"Indeed, Court of Auditors reports tell us that in recent times the checks on agricultural expenditure have greatly improved."
"This needs to be brought to the attention of the general public."
"I agree with the rapporteur's suggestion that there should be a similar requirement for structural funds."
"It should not only apply to the CAP."
"This transparency initiative should relate to other areas."
"As we await the so-called 'health check' on the CAP, it is important that we deal with this issue now, to get it out of the way, as it were."
"The CAP often comes in for bad press but very often these comments focus only on negative aspects and totally ignore the hugely positive benefits which consumers have gained from the CAP."
"Since the introduction of the CAP, food price inflation is way below overall inflation."
"The CAP has delivered cheaper food for EU citizens, but the CAP has also delivered safe food and traceable food."
"The phrase 'from farm to fork' means just that."
"The CAP is improving our environment and animal welfare continues to improve."
"Furthermore, the CAP has ensured food security for the EU."
"Many people deride the idea of food security as if such an idea belongs to the dark ages."
"The world has enough food to feed itself."
"For how long?"
"A week maybe."
"Just consider the pressure that will come about when we really begin to grow fuel as opposed to food."
"Just consider the pressure that will come about when emerging economies like India and China compete with the EU for food and for fuel grown instead of food."
"Then we will look to the EU and the CAP for food security."
"The CAP, like any policy, has its problems, but it has delivered for EU citizens and this regulation will ensure that it continues to deliver in an open and transparent way."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, I entirely support both Mr Jorgo Chatzimarkakis's report and the draft regulation itself."
"This is an important step in the right direction; we are introducing greater transparency in accountability relating to European Union expenditure."
"The most valuable provision of all is the one that makes it possible to publish, or rather makes it a duty to publish, information on who made use of these funds and in what context, as part of the Common Agricultural Policy."
"Public opinion has been demanding this information for some time, and so has the press, so it is a very good thing that this particular principle has been introduced."
"Anyone who has benefitted from public aid should not be ashamed of information to the effect that he has received such aid; and farmers in particular have no reason to be ashamed of it, because after all the aid is clearly due to them and is for the good of the whole of society."
"The regulation is aimed at exerting stronger control over EU expenditure, and a very good thing too."
"I would like to take this opportunity to say two sentences about a problem that cropped up when the Committee on Budgetary Control visited Poland, at the beginning of October."
"The problem relates to the detection of irregularities by national control agencies."
"This is a solution that would enable us to avoid the consequences of restrictions on expenditure in a situation where irregularities are detected by a national control agency."
"It is about these agencies cooperating properly with the European Court of Auditors, and them being motivated to identify such irregularities without consequences for their own country."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, transparency is necessary in agriculture."
"Mr Deß said that money is going into shady projects."
"It is true that we want to expose this, too, through such transparency, but perhaps he will also agree with me that not much money is finding its way into European agriculture and Europe's rural areas; some of it is flowing into the wrong channels."
"Billions of euro have been earmarked for farmers in the budgets of past years but have failed to reach farmers."
"All the export subsidies in favour of farmers, the EU's whole practice of intervention involving storage - these have swallowed up billions of euro but have not helped farmers."
"At best - as Mrs Harkin from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe said - it has kept prices down by means of downward stabilisation of the market, which is a kind of brake on inflation."
"Naturally, it is the general aim to keep prices stable, but it cannot be in the interests of farmers to be the nation's or Europe's lackey in order to ensure this."
"The rapporteur was right when he talked of the need for a frame of reference: publication alone is not enough."
"I should like to give a frame of reference: even after the reform of the CAP, at a rate of EUR 300 per hectare, a rationalised business where one worker takes care of 400 hectares - that is, the highest level of rationalisation - receives approximately EUR 120 000 per worker."
"80% of farmers do not even receive a tenth of this."
"Therefore, we also need to explain what happens to this money."
"This frame of reference must be created by politicians - it will not automatically come with publication."
"When the Commission states in its proposal that these payments may have to be graduated, that modulation into the second pillar must be introduced - as here the funds produce better results in terms of workers, the environment - then this is a foretaste of what lies ahead, namely the discussion following the publication of this information. And then we shall have to give politics free rein once more."
"However, the figures must first be allowed to speak, they must be published, and we must be patient, and if they prove incorrect, the policy will have to be changed so as to put them right."
"Many thanks for your report - we shall be supporting it."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (NL) Many thanks, Mr President."
"I would also like to thank the rapporteur for his work."
"European taxpayers want to know how their taxes are spent."
"Publishing the names of those receiving agricultural subsidies is absolutely necessary in the interests of a transparent European policy, particularly given the enormous proportion of the EU budget represented by these subsidies."
"More importantly still, however, this publication can be the start of a very necessary, genuinely thorough reform of the common agricultural policy."
"When subsidies were made public in the Netherlands in 2005, we realised that a disproportionate share was going to a small, wealthy group."
"We are providing large subsidies to multinationals and large landowners whilst thousands of ordinary farmers can scarcely get by."
"To begin with, there must be a cap on the subsidies that one person or business can receive - and not EUR 300 000, as Commissioner Fischer Boel recently proposed."
"I would suggest no more than an average annual salary."
"After all, most subsidies are intended to supplement income."
"Member States failing to ensure the correct transparency should receive less EU funds as a penalty."
"It is also important that, where Member States have poorly functioning control mechanisms, this be made known so that farmers and the organisations representing their interests are able to call those authorities to account if they suffer damage as a result."
"Of course, this should be only the beginning of a whole series of transparency initiatives by Parliament."
"The distribution of the Structural Funds should also be made public."
"I hope for the broadest possible support from Parliament for this report, as it would make our primary supervisory function, in particular, so much easier."
"A transparent agricultural policy is the first step towards a fair agricultural policy."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (SV) Thank you, Mr President."
"I, like my voters, think that the EU is too closed and bureaucratic."
"I therefore welcome the Commission's proposal, which seeks greater openness and transparency in the institutions' expenditure."
"Support for agriculture is a debatable issue."
"It is therefore important for the citizens to be allowed to see who their taxes are going to and how much."
"It is regrettable that the committee's amendments run counter the EU's role as a transparent institution."
"The committee's demand for registration in order to have access to information is a serious infringement of privacy for all citizens, whether they are a farmer, a journalist or a pre-school teacher."
"Permitting registration of citizens who wish to consult public documents is a development we do not want to see in the EU."
"I therefore urge all members to vote against Amendments 4 and 23 from the committee."
"Thank you."
"on behalf of the ITS Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Chatzimarkakis, we are short of cereals, we are short of milk, the price of maize and butter are soaring, and what are we doing?"
"We are discussing putting premiums per cow, per ewe or per hectare on the Internet and, while the world is about to go hungry, like teenagers we are playing at organising farming and financial emails on the Internet."
"Of course, there are good reasons: transparency, the right to find out and control what is being done with the billions being paid to farmers."
"However, in a democracy, control is exercised by Parliament in the Chamber, and not by surfers on the Web."
"Also, if transparency applies to agricultural credits, why not also, in a spirit of populism, have transparency over the pay of the EU's senior officials?"
"If we are putting premiums for dairy cows online, why not also put the premiums being milked by senior officials online too?"
"That is the first injustice."
"There is a second."
"Small farmers will be transparent, but large commercial agricultural companies will not be."
"That is because the real objective of this regulation is not transparency."
"It is a diabolical machine of war, which has two hidden aims."
"The first is to divide farmers into large and small and destroy their unity in the trade unions."
"The next, and most important, is to stir up public opinion against farmers through the press, particularly the British press which will highlight the premiums received by Prince Charles and Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, by the trade union leaders, the large farmers, and perhaps even the husband of Mrs Fischer Boel, who is a pig farmer."
"Using these few examples of large landowners fed on hormones from Brussels, public opinion will be made to believe that farmers get a huge boost, particularly because the public does not know that farmers are paid against their will because they are banned from producing."
"They are forced to leave land fallow."
"Once public opinion against farmers - paid not to produce because of decoupling - has become white hot, in 2013, at no political or electoral risk, it will be possible to remove the aid and recover about EUR 20 billion to finance other non-agricultural activities."
"In the guise of democratic transparency, this regulation is a moral ignominy that is using the odious motivations of envy and jealousy to serve the Commission's strategic plot since the 1980s: to do away with agricultural exports as part of a major worldwide agreement."
"Agriculture for the southern hemisphere, and financial, banking and energy services for the northern hemisphere."
"That is the truth about this regulation!"
"Mr President, it can be a fine line between transparency and infringement of privacy."
"Many farmers - in my view, quite rightly - will resent the details of their single farm payment being posted over the internet because of the distorted perception of free hand-outs which it creates."
"The reality, of course, is that for most the single farm payment is in fact subsidising our cheap food policy."
"Take the beef sector."
"A task-force report in my constituency demonstrates that in that small area beef producers are losing EUR 260 million per annum."
"Only their single farm payment keeps them going by subsidising production."
"So, when it is publicised that a farmer has received EUR 20 000, it misleads for there is no mention that at the same time he is losing EUR 40 000 or more in his production operation."
"To be fair, publication should be accompanied by typical profit-and-loss statistics from the commodity sales in each sector."
"(EL) Mr President, I was pleased to note that we all want both transparency and control: we all want the EU's money contributed by taxpaying citizens to be protected and to go to those who are genuinely entitled to assistance."
"Where there are irregularities or illegalities the specified sanctions must be imposed and I think that on this point we are all united and determined."
"It goes without saying, however, that the proposed measures ought to be put into force after the relevant regulation has been passed and ought to relate to the following financial year."
"We believe that this clarification is absolutely necessary, and that is why we have tabled the relevant amendment."
"We want this amendment to make it clear that the measures for suspending monthly payments laid down in Articles 17a and 27a of Regulation No 1290/2005, concerning the funding of the common agricultural policy, will not be implemented before 16 October 2008."
"Thus we believe it right that the measures should not have retroactive force."
"To conclude, let me emphasise that we all want:"
"firstly, protection of taxpayers' money;"
"secondly, the money to go to those who are genuinely entitled, as my fellow Member very rightly pointed out;"
"thirdly, lawbreakers to be punished;"
"fourthly, let us be fair, as happens throughout the world; the laws do not have retroactive force, nor should they."
"If these conditions are met, we will wholeheartedly and gladly endorse and vote for the report by Mr Chatzimarkakis."
"(HU) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the institutions of the European Union are making up for long-standing neglect."
"If there is anyone who is interested in having us sort out European agriculture and make it transparent, it is the European agricultural sector."
"The rapporteur, Mr Chatzimarkakis, whom I would like to congratulate, put it very well in saying that the European Union does not have a good image in the eyes of European citizens, and they have most often made European agriculture a scapegoat."
"Therefore, at this late hour, I would like to quote General de Gaulle, who said that we must stand on the brink of the inevitable."
"Yes, we, to whom the Common Agricultural Policy is so important, must stand on the brink of the inevitable, of transparency."
"It is a big problem for the Common Agricultural Policy - and I agree wholeheartedly with Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf - that the whole European Common Agricultural Policy is a tangled mess, hardly transparent and, in many respects, unfair."
"Both of us, and, I think, those sitting in this chamber, would like to safeguard the future of the Common Agricultural Policy, but at the same time we would like to protect it."
"My dear friends, what does it tell us when the Common Agricultural Policy has its favourite, spoiled children, such as the cereals, sugar and tobacco sectors, and that it has hostile sectors, such as the fruit and vegetables, grapes and wine, pork and poultry sectors?"
"Nobody in his right mind could explain this to a European citizen."
"Often, nobody in his right mind could explain to a European citizen either that a whole heap of aid does not go to the producers, as Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf said, but is creamed off by commercial organisations."
"Nowhere has a report yet been produced, and it would be good if the Commission and the Council were finally to prepare a report on the amounts that go out of the agricultural sector."
"Enormous amounts."
"This report is therefore very important for showing clearly who receives aid, and how much, so that it does not come about that the media give the negative example that 200 head of cattle have been on a sixth floor in Rome for years, while several hundred thousand Italian peasants are going honestly about their business."
"My dear friends, transparency and data processing are therefore very important, and the European Union has to do this in other areas, so I support the report by Mr Chatzimarkakis."
"Thank you very much."
"(FI) Mr President, I also right away wish to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Chatzimarkakis, on this report."
"We might well ask, of course, what sort of a report could be expected of a rapporteur who has the common sense of a German, the heart of a Greek, and even a bit of the Finnish landscape in his soul."
"We might say in such a case that the report might turn out to be rather good in many respects, and that happens to be true with this one."
"My congratulations once again."
"It is true that, when we speak of agriculture and the system for financing it, it is very important that we stress the importance of transparency."
"Transparency is the basis of everything."
"Of course, another factor that has to go hand in hand with transparency, with regard to financing programmes, is fairness."
"In my few years here in the European Parliament, however, I have come to see that fairness, if anything, is a relative concept, and that the way we perceive it varies."
"In any case, I hope that increased transparency will also boost the confidence of the public in our decision-making system and in the notion that we here want to make the right kind of decisions on the financing of agriculture as much as in any other area."
"I would nevertheless like to mention my concern about agriculture in a broader context."
"In mentioning fairness, I hope that in future we will pay attention not just to transparency but also to fairness."
"Now, with the Commissioner present, it is very important to ensure that the small Member States also get treated properly."
"In the future too we could make sure that any sort of national self-sufficiency can be preserved."
"We in Finland have some serious examples of this, with the decision on sugar taken very recently by the European Union and the decisions on agricultural payments too."
"They do not treat the small and the big Member States in the same way, and in this respect I hope there will be greater attention paid to fairness in future, now that this matter of transparency has been sorted out in the context of Mr Chatzimarkakis's report."
"We must ensure that the European Union and our decision-making system are open and something which our citizens can trust in and which they feel they can support in the future."
"(PL) Mr President, today's report on the financing of the common agricultural policy, and especially the matter of its transparency, are of huge importance for social acceptance of residents of the Community, and primarily for European farmers."
"By publication of the beneficiaries of public aid, we will be able to see in detail in what context the division of funds is taking place; and particularly in the countries of what are known as the old and the new EU."
"One very important proposal made by the rapporteur is the mention of a requirement concerning comparability of data between Member States."
"This will enable false accusations between EU members concerning the size and methods of support for individual markets in given countries to be avoided, and will enable action to be taken with the aim of levelling out farmers' opportunities in the sphere of public support."
"As a general point it should be stressed that suitably clear financing of agricultural policy, along with a suitable quantity of such products, guarantees food security for European consumers."
"This is why European farmers should have long-term security and financial prospects with reference to investment in farms."
"The voices that are currently being heard calling for a speedier review of the common agricultural policy are irresponsible and bring with them a threat to the EU's food security."
"Nor should we forget the guarantees that have been given that subsidies for farms will be levelled out for all EU members by 2013."
"To end, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur."
"(NL) Mr President, I too would like to thank our fellow Member for this thorough report, which on the face of it concerns very technical rules, budgetary rules."
"In reality, however, these rules are capable of affecting the work of our farmers - who are after all the legitimate and indispensable producers of our daily food."
"I would like to discuss a couple of these in greater detail, without starting a very wide-ranging debate about the Health Check or anything else."
"I do just need to get off my chest, however, that it puzzles me where my highly respected fellow Member from the Dutch Socialist Party (SP) found the large landowners of whom she spoke in a country as densely populated as the Netherlands."
"Anyway, I digress."
"First of all, I would like to express my support for the Commission proposal to make it possible, in the event of shortcomings, for the Member State concerned to be penalised - to have deductions applied - more efficiently, possibly by suspending or reducing its intermediate payments."
"In my opinion, the Commission should look not only at the gravity and nature of the non-conformity, as it wrote, but also at its duration."
"For example, in the event of sustained breaches the Commission should increase the percentage reduction every year."
"We must also ensure that the new rules we are now introducing do not lead to an increase in the administrative burden."
"I should like to conclude by discussing the tricky subject of the publication of the names of those receiving support from the European Agricultural Fund."
"My country is doing this already to a great extent, and the Commission is now proposing to introduce it throughout the EU with a view to transparency and the legitimacy of this expenditure."
"I can endorse these efforts, but with two brief comments, which are also expressed in the form of amendments."
"First of all, the publication of this data may infringe the rights of those involved."
"We must thus ensure adequate data protection to prevent the data falling into the wrong hands or being used to benefit the actions of radical animal-rights activists, for example: a phenomenon with which several Member States are already confronted."
"Finally, I would like to say that the Commission believes that this proposal will also enable it to improve budgetary control."
"This may be the case to a certain extent, but I take the view that it is of even greater benefit to budgetary control to introduce national declarations concerning the budgetary resources managed at national level."
"Therefore, I would just like to devote my last second to calling on the Commission and the Council to speed up the process of introducing these national declarations."
"(HU) Increasing the transparency of the Common Agricultural Policy is an important Community objective, and so I support the report by my fellow member, Mr Chatzimarkakis."
"But since the Common Agricultural Policy is already being discussed, I would like to draw your attention to one of the most important issues in environmentally conscious farming, the Natura 2000 programme."
"As you know, those who farm in a manner that sustains protected flora and fauna receive aid from the Community and Member states, within the framework of Natura 2000."
"Nearly 1/5 of the territory of the European Union, and 21% of the territory of Hungary, comes under the protection of this programme."
"Farmers expect this aid, since sustaining natural interests requires financial self-restraint on their part."
"However, it is crucial for a sustainable future that we protect as many natural interests as possible."
"This is why it is important that we put as much money as possible into aid for areas affected by the Natura 2000 programme."
"At the time, I was the shadow rapporteur for the Socialist Group for the Natura 2000 programme."
"Unfortunately, since then it has not been possible to bring about the amount for which we pressed at the time, EUR 3 billion a year."
"However, it is the eleventh hour if we want to stop the obliteration of nature, particularly in Europe, which is already over-populated."
"It would be useful to have the planned Internet list of how much aid is given to farmers within the framework of Natura 2000, thus popularising practices that point forward."
"This openness will hopefully also stimulate environmentally friendly farming and the protection of our unique natural interests."
"Thank you."
"(PL) Mr President, we are talking about the common agricultural policy, but in reality there is no common policy."
"I can say this because that aid for agriculture is differentiated not only in individual regions, but the differences are very clearly to be seen between the old Member States and the new ones."
"In order to talk about a common agricultural policy, we must have common and standard principles, duties and potential to obtain support for production."
"It is my view, however, that the report is very welcome and necessary, because at the end of the day who gets what must be disclosed, as well as how these funds are utilised."
"An improvement in statistics will not directly provide an increase in the funds for agriculture, but it will improve thrift, there will be transparency, greater trust in people, and we as parliamentarians will be in a position to draw our own conclusions and to search for common solutions, which would in fact build a common agricultural policy on the same democratic and partnership principles for all countries of the European Union and for farmers, regardless of the region where they happen to work and live."
"(RO) Limiting payments made from the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund and the European Fund for Agriculture and Rural Development should be done only in exceptional situations."
"In this respect, the Commission's proposal does not clearly define the situations which require the reduction or suspension of agriculture payments."
"The Regulation, in the form proposed by the Commission, only specifies that the suspension is required when the key components of the national control system are not efficient due to the gravity or persistence of identified deficiencies."
"I consider that this criterion cannot be used arbitrarily and may have dangerous effects for certain Member States."
"It is true that we should have extremely good Community control over the expenses of funds, but it is also important to take into consideration the progress made by the relevant institutions in the Member States that are responsible for this control."
"This is why I consider that the instrument we provide today to the Commission should be used very cautiously, under very clearly delimited conditions and doubled by a rigorous parliamentary control."
"Moreover, the Regulation should not have retroactive effects."
"The year 2007 is a year of enlargement for the European Union and it would be unjust for the provisions of this regulation to be enforced as of the present, as the European Commission proposes."
"This is why I support the variant of granting an additional year until the regulation becomes effective."
"As regards the publishing of the names of European funds beneficiaries, as well as of the global amounts they have received, I consider this to be a measure that obviously contributes to the transparency of the allocation system."
"This might stop from the start any potential fraud attempts or attempts to grant the European funds for rural development according to political criteria and proves responsibility in spending public money."
"(PL) Mr President, the European Commission's initiative to impose on Member States the duty to publish information on the beneficiaries of EU funds obtained under the umbrella of the common agricultural policy is worthy of support in every respect."
"Publication of such information on the Internet using standards that ensure comparability of data between individual countries will not only do much to improve the transparency of budget expenditure and the efficiency of the budget control process, it will also shed a bright light on at least two serious problems linked to agricultural expenditure in the EU."
"To begin with, a very large proportion of direct subsidies in individual countries goes not to farms but to large concerns like Smithfield, or large landholdings like the Crown Estates of Elizabeth II."
"Perhaps data like this on the scale of the whole EU will make it clear to the decision-makers that there is a need to limit subsidies allocated to a single farm so that these subsidies help family farms more than large estates."
"Secondly, there is a very large disproportion between the support per hectare of agricultural land utilised in the old Member States and in the new Member States."
"In the period 2007-2013, this indicator will be a little over 60%, and when Romania and Bulgaria are taken on board it will be even lower."
"So for each Euro paid out in the old EU there will be barely 60 cents in countries of the new EU, even though agriculture in the new countries has to catch up with the more developed agriculture in the old Member States."
"Mr President, I wish that a group of farmers who I spoke to this afternoon from the North West of Ireland were here to listen to this debate because they might even want to contribute."
"Let us be honest: no one wants their financial affairs made public, and I think there are Members of this House who are talking about openness and transparency who would run a mile from it themselves."
"I liked the point made by someone else this evening that it may be right that we publish the payments of everyone who gets money from the public purse."
"Having said that, I believe we are going to have publication of payments and I believe generally in this term 'openness and transparency', but it is a two-way street."
"I also would question the notion that information is equal to understanding and it is because of that question that I think you do need to have clarification about what the payments actually mean."
"The group of farmers I met today were in beef and sheep farming, and many of them were using their single farm payment to subsidise their production."
"Perhaps they are silly to do that."
"Maybe they should stop farming and let the farms go to rack and ruin and continue to accept the cheque."
"Some comments have been made here about the failure of policy as though it were farmers' fault."
"But I think it is the policymakers of Europe who should take the rap for the failures that have been identified."
"Those who talk about intervention and export refunds must have forgotten about the 2003 reforms."
"We now have a problem of shortages within the European Union."
"We import beef."
"Global demand is rising for dairy products, and grain is in short supply so we have moved on a great deal."
"Yes, publish, but explain."
"Protect people and make sure that they are not ridiculed wrongly for the payments they receive."
"Do not use this as a weapon to beat farmers with. The Commission are doing it already in the health check, where they have talked about how, now that publication will be made, we could look at cutting back on payments."
"Perhaps we need to do that at the higher level, but let us be honest in how we debate this topic."
"I think we do need to review the use that the information is put to."
"(PL) Mr President, we are debating an important report concerning the financing of the common agricultural policy."
"A policy to which we devote some 45% of the EU budget."
"The European Commission's proposal is aimed at increasing the transparency and credibility of expenditure for EU farmers and rural areas."
"By the same token it is supposed to improve the way the policy is accepted and assessed by EU citizens."
"But people keep on popping up who are not well disposed towards the common agricultural policy, people who wish to deprive our farmers of support at any cost and expose them to open and unequal competition with farmers from third countries."
"The question is - what would then happen to food security in the EU?"
"I am sure that MEPs from the Committee on Agriculture will share my view that no cuts can be made in the envisaged budget for the common agricultural policy."
"This budget is steadily shrinking, and in 2013 it will constitute only 33% of total budget expenditure."
"Let us hope that the new rules will help to simplify legislation in line with the slogan of 'better regulation' promoted by the Commission."
"Our citizens will be able to check and find out for what purposes we are handing out EU money."
"In November of this year the Commission is to present a communication on the matter of a health check."
"I am of the opinion that the EU direct payments system should be very much simpler and also transparent, and that the level of subsidies should be standardised for all Member States, in other words be fair and understandable."
"I also hope that our colleagues from Romania are coping with the current problems connected with their payment systems."
"We cannot allow Romanian farmers to be harmed and punished by a drop in subsidies."
"They are just as necessary in Romania as in other Member States."
"Instead of punishing Romanian farmers, we should be helping to sort out the system of subsidies."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, honourable Members, I thank you for your interesting remarks."
"I am very happy that I have an opportunity to participate in this discussion because, when the Commission started discussing the proposal to have more transparency concerning the beneficiaries of EU funds, the information was published only in two countries: in Denmark and in Estonia."
"Now it is 13, and finally it will be in every country."
"This, in terms of Europe's decision-making process, is very fast."
"I would like only to say some factual remarks."
"First of all, what was mentioned - the disclosure of beneficiaries - will be done in full respect of Community legislation on data protection."
"It is already laid down in the proposal."
"Several people raised the issue of the publication of information on structural funds, but absolutely the same logic applies to the Structural Funds, to which the same Article 53b of the Financial Regulation applies."
"So there is no difference."
"All benefits which will be paid out from the European budget will be open, including the salaries of the highest officials and Commission members."
"This is totally public."
"So there is nothing - and this has been public since the adoption of the staff regulations."
"I would like to ask Parliament to endorse the Commission's approach as reflected in its proposal."
"We have sympathy for the substance of some of the amendments proposed, and some of these will be mirrored in the implementing legislation or in the final text to be adopted by Council following the Presidency's compromise text."
"I am confident that the innovations now on the table will make Regulation 1290/2005 an even more effective instrument than it already is."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday 11 October 2007."
"Written declarations (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (HU) I support the Commission's recommendation for several reasons."
"Firstly, it will become transparent who is benefiting from the CAP, and the scale of agriculture grants among EU Member States will become comparable."
"Secondly, it will increase the legitimacy of all the EU institutions and of all Union policies towards European citizens."
"Thirdly, this initiative will extend not only to agricultural grants but also to grants in all sectors of the EU, and may thereby also increase the effectiveness of budgetary monitoring."
"I agree with the second point of the recommendation, which recommends that, if the monitoring systems of the Member States are wanting, the rules relating to sanctions should be made more stringent."
"In Hungary, at the expense of great effort, we have managed to develop the institutional system so that it works as effectively as possible and complies with the Commission's stipulations."
"I support the rapporteur's recommendation, which would prescribe the publication of data on the Internet as a compulsory requirement."
"The Internet sites of the paying agencies in the Member States would be connected to the Commission's websites, or to a common network of websites within a Member State."
"Naturally, such data provision must comply with the stipulations of the European Data Protection Supervisor."
"Among other things, it is crucial that the relevant parties receive advance notification of the publication of data, as soon as possible and where possible, even when the data is collected."
"in writing. - More transparency means less unfounded anti-EU propaganda."
"Therefore it is easy to support the rapporteur's approach welcoming the Commission's proposal to improve transparency and implementation of European agricultural expenditure."
"We have to keep in mind that agricultural expenditure constitutes one of the largest shares of EU spending."
"Therefore it is a question of legitimacy for the Union."
"The lack of a clear view on all expenditure, not only agricultural, results in a distorted picture of EU spending."
"At the same time we know that management of agricultural expenditure has steadily improved."
"Data on Community expenditure should be easily available on the internet."
"Full transparency is essential for budgetary control."
"Therefore I am happy to note that Mr Chatzimarkakis received 100% support in the committee."
"Combating cigarette smuggling (EC-Philip Morris agreement) (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Bart Staes, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the implications of the agreement between the Community and the Member States with Philip Morris on intensifying the fight against fraud and cigarette smuggling and progress made in implementing the recommendations of Parliament's Committee of Inquiry into the Community Transit System"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the reports by the Committee on Budgetary Control often contain fairly bad news - it is the EP's anti-fraud committee, after all."
"This often concerns weaknesses, irregularities, trickery - sometimes even fraud and deception."
"I am glad, ladies and gentlemen, that today I have something positive to report, a success story, a story that demonstrates how the cooperation between the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Member States can ensure the resolution of problems."
"What is the context?"
"At the start of the 1990s, fraud involving cigarette smuggling was found to be big business."
"Hundreds of millions of ECU - in those days we still spoke in terms of ECU rather than euro - disappeared into the pockets of criminals at the expense of the budgets of the European Union and the Member States."
"Back in 1994 the then UCLAF - the predecessor of OLAF - set up a Cigarettes Task Force."
"In 1996 and 1997 an EP Committee of Inquiry - which, incidentally, was the very first Committee of Inquiry launched under the Treaty on European Union - examined all aspects of transit fraud."
"The Committee of Inquiry found that the monitoring system in the transit sector was archaic."
"Lorries in transit had to have a document stamped at the customs office where the goods entered the Union, then drive through the Union and have the same document stamped again at the customs office where the goods left the Union."
"The document then had to be sent back to the customs office of import."
"A great many problems arose in this connection."
"The documents arrived back much too late: sometimes three or four months."
"There was the problem of forged documents, and also of forged stamps."
"Consequently, one of the most important recommendations of the Committee of Inquiry was the replacement of this whole archaic system, based on paper and stamps, with a computerised system."
"This New Computerised Transit System (NCTS) was gradually introduced and is now operational in all Member States."
"It helps the customs services detect in real time whether goods are illegally escaping customs supervision - and thus represents tremendous progress."
"This does not, of course, rule out false declarations still being made, and that is why we are asking the Commission to set up a system for this, too, to prevent the false declaration of goods."
"We also ask that OLAF be given direct access to this computerised system."
"As has been said, the Committee of Inquiry concentrated on the problem of cigarettes."
"Cigarettes were transported across the territory from one border point to another, but very often those goods, those cigarettes, ended up on the black market."
"In addition, those goods were very often smuggled back into the Union."
"This led to immense problems, even sometimes to violence."
"In Italy, for example, two agents from the financial police were even murdered."
"The overall investigation also revealed that some tobacco companies were in league with the smugglers, and on the basis of that information the Commission, together with a number of Member States, brought an action against Philip Morris before a court in New York."
"It gradually became clear that Philip Morris would find it particularly difficult to win the action, and in 2004 a deal was struck with the company."
"In exchange for USD 1.25 billion, to be spread over a 12-year period, the Commission and the Member States refrained from proceeding with the action before the New York court."
"In fact, the second part of the agreement with Philip Morris was perhaps even more important."
"It comprised provisions on cooperation between Philip Morris and the European Union in tracking and tracing cigarettes."
"If the customs services found cargoes of cigarettes, and the provisions of this agreement had not been followed, Philip Morris was bound to pay the evaded customs duties immediately - and the figure in question can be up to EUR 1.5 million per container of cigarettes."
"To reiterate, this is a success story: it demonstrates how Parliament and the Commission can work together."
"I do have a few criticisms, however."
"When the USD 1.25 billion was distributed among the Commission and Member States, only 9.7% went to the Commission, and the lion's share to the Member States."
"I do not think this fair, particularly as OLAF and the Commission do the lion's share of the work."
"A second criticism is that, according to the spirit of the agreement, this money was to be used in the fight against fraud."
"The Commission has done its work."
"It has spent a proportion of that money on the Hercules II programme."
"The Member States, on the other hand, have simply let the money flow into their treasuries, when they should really have been using it better to equip their investigative services, for example their customs services, and to step up the fight against this kind of fraud."
"To recap, Mr President, this is indeed a success story, one that it may well be possible to apply to other products, such as alcohol and certain agricultural products."
"I also hope that this report has added a positive note to the important work being carried out by the Mr Kallas and the Commission and also our Parliament in the fight against fraud."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, I must thank Mr Staes for this own-initiative report and the European Parliament for its support of these issues and finding solutions to these difficult issues."
"In my statement I will speak first about the Community transit system, for which my colleague Lázló Kovács has responsibility."
"The European Parliament applauds the successful introduction of the new computerised transit system."
"It is indeed an enormous change compared to the archaic paper-based procedure."
"Full implementation of the upgraded system will take place by 1 July 2009."
"Risk management is a modern control tool."
"The Commission is actively implementing the customs risk management framework to better target the checks."
"We are currently establishing criteria, priorities and the IT platform with the Member States."
"The new system will also provide for the possibility of regular monitoring of the effectiveness of the risk analysis made."
"The planned development of the anti-fraud transit information system will strengthen the capacity to analyse and counter risks in transit fraud, first with regard to sensitive goods and later for all kinds of goods in transit."
"This is conditional on Member States granting wider access for the Commission to the NCTS movement data."
"However, freezing further financing for the NCTS, as proposed in the report, would be counterproductive to the necessary further development of more effective transit control."
"A few words on value added tax fraud."
"In its report, the United Kingdom's House of Lords pointed to many factors behind the phenomenon of missing trader fraud."
"However, we do not see any proof that weaknesses of the transit system led to carousel fraud."
"I would like to clarify that, even though transit was not a priority during traditional own-resources inspections between 2001 and 2006 when change was ongoing, nevertheless it was not being ignored."
"As a result of many inspections, payments of own resources and interest were demanded."
"This approach represents efficient use of the Commission's inspection resources and avoids falling back on ex ante audits."
"I would like to turn now to the anti-fraud agreement with Philip Morris International, which comes under my portfolio."
"I must thank the Parliament for its continued strong support."
"The Commission has consistently stated that it hopes that the agreement can serve as a model for similar agreements with other companies."
"With regard to the funds coming from this agreement, the new Hercule Programme has received in Greece funding devoted to combating cigarette smuggling and counterfeiting, which are newly added objectives."
"We are considering whether the programme could be used to fund the establishment of a laboratory which would verify the authenticity of cigarettes."
"But I must also say - and Mr Staes knows this very well - that the distribution of money was a real nightmare and it will be a nightmare in the next financial periods as well."
"Of course I am very happy about the support and the constant interest expressed by Parliament in the use of this money because I am also interested in having this money used for the purpose of fighting cigarette smuggling and other kinds of fraud."
"With regard to seizure statistics, most Member States inform the Commission of the amounts on a quarterly basis."
"However, not all Member States indicate the brands they have seized and there is therefore no complete data available."
"Moreover, the notifications of seizures by the Member States do not always differentiate between genuine and counterfeit cigarettes, partly because it is not necessary for the purposes of the prosecution of offenders and the collection of duties and taxes and partly because it is sometimes extremely difficult to distinguish between counterfeit and genuine cigarettes."
"We continue to encourage the Member States to provide more complete figures."
"Finally, the Commission is willing to prepare an OLAF report on this topic, as suggested by Parliament, but I consider that it would more beneficial to wait until 2010 for a comprehensive overview."
"This is due to the fact that many significant changes are in the pipeline in the customs area and a report in 2008 could only be an interim one, reflecting the state of play at that point in time."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my first words will be to congratulate the rapporteur, Bart Staes, who has managed to produce an excellent report on the difficult subject of the flaws in our Community Transit System."
"I am also most grateful to the European Court of Auditors which, in its report in December 2006, highlighted the scale of the problem very clearly."
"I am disappointed, in this regard, that we are confusing the repercussions of the Philip Morris agreement, which we must remember is an agreement to drop legal proceedings and not a partnership agreement, with the serious problems of Community Transit."
"That is the reason for the amendment I tabled on behalf of the PPE Group, which aims to prevent the confusion."
"On the subject of the industry, I propose that the European Union and the whole of the tobacco industry jointly finance a programme to combat cigarette smuggling and counterfeiting."
"However, I want to focus my comments on the flaws in our Community Transit System."
"The European Commission tells us that it has strengthened the customs transit system by introducing a modern, robust computer system."
"It is forgetting that, though a computer system is necessary, it is never sufficient, and the reality is that it is the system itself that is flawed."
"It is flawed because it is conducted under the authority of the Member States, which means - as our rapporteur and the European Court of Auditors quite rightly pointed out - that the Member States are applying the new Community Transit rules with serious weaknesses."
"In 1997 Parliament set up a Committee of Inquiry, which clearly stated that the EU should set up a framework to enable the customs services to function as one."
"We are a long way from this."
"In 2005 our fellow Member Herbert Bösch highlighted in his excellent report the scale of the problems and the need to fight fraud and errors."
"The reality is, ladies and gentlemen, that this report invites us to think much more widely about the quality of our customs system, our financial circuits and, more generally, about the protection of the financial interests of the European Union."
"In this, Commissioner, you have the full support of MEPs."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, we expressly welcome this report, which is excellent."
"The term 'own-initiative report' is not quite accurate."
"What we are doing here is persevering with the subject of Parliament's first Committee of Inquiry - and we shall continue to do so."
"I do not want to complain, but it is a shame that we have to do this at such a late hour."
"I note with interest on the list of speakers the groups that have asked to speak on this subject today."
"It seems it is always somewhat easier to complain about the scandals in the EU than to work on specific, positive solutions."
"The road there is sometimes long - we are talking about cigarettes - but it is a good one to take."
"We are making progress, and the Staes report shows this very clearly."
"Of course, we have the incompleteness of European integration to contend with in this field."
"Various Ministers for Finance still cannot resist simply raising the tax on tobacco a little when the treasury is starting to look a little empty, wrongly earning praise from some health politician or other in the process."
"I say 'wrongly' because consumers of cigarettes simply switch to smuggled cigarettes or, increasingly, to counterfeit cigarettes."
"The profit from this kind of fraud goes directly to organised crime."
"The fact that there is cause for us all to celebrate progress this evening makes me even more inclined to remind the House of an episode that does less credit to Europe, and particularly the Commission."
"There is evidence that, in the period 1992-2001, approximately 10 000 lorry-loads of cigarettes were smuggled into the EU via Montenegro, particularly heading for Italy."
"This is probably the biggest fraud against the EU budget of all time."
"The public prosecutor's office in Augsburg, Germany, has made 60 requests for legal assistance in this connection."
"There have been confessions, convictions and all such things in Switzerland."
"Yet the European Union has not submitted any claims for recovery of own resources against the Republic of Montenegro."
"Commissioner, I should like us to be able to stand before our taxpayers and say, 'We have looked into this matter, too'."
"There are petty customs officials in Germany, Austria and Central Europe who have done great work in this field, but who it seems have been rather let down by the European Commission."
"We must deal with this mammoth affair, for which the limitation period is not yet at an end."
"That would be my wish in connection with what is by and large a very pleasing occasion for today's debate."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the House much prefers dealing with expenditure to revenue - and so it is to Mr Staes' great credit that we are today turning to the trifle of revenue for once."
"All the same, this is a matter of EUR 17 billion in VAT and own resources and EUR 14 billion in customs duties - which is almost 30%."
"In my opinion, it is good that we are addressing this issue today."
"Evidently, there are only winners here, and the Commissioner, too, deserves our congratulations for this."
"We are pleased that we have managed to find a way -in cooperation with the Member States."
"It is essential to shore up the future of OLAF, the European Anti-Fraud Office, to enable it to play its role within the EU even better and more efficiently."
"Congratulations are due for what OLAF has shown us so far and what we are seeing before us now."
"We are all very proud of these successes, as it was these experts, of course, who made them possible."
"It was not a foregone conclusion, particularly given the subject, that we would make real progress with the counterfeit tobacco products dossier or that the Member States, too, would cooperate."
"We should like this scenario to be replicated in the case of other dossiers concerning the protection of the financial interests of the Union, for example the fight against VAT fraud."
"Then we would have true winners: the European taxpayers who sent us here and have certain expectations."
"I believe that continuing the fight against cigarette smuggling is an important task, that there is an urgent need to call in an investigator from OLAF in Beijing, and that we need to strengthen the anti-fraud presence worldwide."
"The question to the Commission now would be how to step up the pressure on other cigarette manufacturers to induce them to subscribe to the agreement between Philip Morris and the Community in the Member States."
"In my opinion, we must consider very specifically how to follow this up and how to continue working on this issue, as failure to do so would endanger our own credibility."
"(PT) Our rapporteur, and in this case also the European Commission, deserve all our congratulations."
"This was the biggest success I can remember the European Union achieving to date against smuggling and tax fraud."
"The message already announced by our rapporteur and supported now by all speakers is, however, that we must also take this fight to other fields."
"It is fundamentally a case of ensuring that the movement of any kind of substance throughout the whole customs system should manage effectively to protect the financial interests of the European Union and of all the Member States and, from that point of view, I think there is still a lot to be done."
"I should therefore like, above all, to invite the European Commission to pursue the matter more assiduously."
"(RO) The agreement between the European Commission and the Philip Morris company is a very good example of a Community financial instrument that simultaneously aims at several objectives."
"First of all, the free access of the manufacturing industry to the market is not restricted, while the tax evasion of those who import counterfeit products is combated with a programme amounting to 1.25 billion dollars, entirely financed by the European company."
"Nevertheless, a much bigger number of Member States should participate in the agreement signed."
"The agreement was concluded in 2004, and, in the meantime, Romania and Bulgaria, both situated at the European Union border, have become Member States."
"Following the entry onto the market of products that are not licensed in all the Member States of the Union, the European budget has recorded substantial losses from excises, and national budgets from unpaid profit taxes."
"The fact that those who try to introduce counterfeit goods into the Community choose the European ports that are not equipped with advanced technologies, such as scanning and registering the pallets of merchandise, is a reality."
"Since this situation affects the European Union's tariff revenues, I consider it normal for the modernization of port facilities to be performed with Community financial assistance."
"Due to the counterfeit products placed on the market at low prices, increasingly more young people have started to smoke, which, of course, in time, will cost the social insurance and health systems of the Member States considerable amounts of money."
"The reports issued by the World Health Organization show that, in most cases, counterfeit cigarettes contain 75% more tar, 28% more nicotine and 63% more carbon monoxide."
"Since we examine the disastrous effects of smoking, in general, irrespective of the legitimate or illegal source of the cigarettes, we should also meditate on another subject: while the European Union promotes policies for combating smoking, on the other hand, it grants substantial subsidies to tobacco crops, which, in my opinion, is a contradiction in the European health policy."
"(HU) Thank you for the floor, Mr President."
"Most esteemed Commissioner Kallas, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Staes is right, and I would hereby like to congratulate him on his work, which is solid yet willing to make sacrifices, and on this present report."
"The European Union and its institutions - including the Commission, the Court of Auditors, OLAF, the European Parliament and not least the Budget Control Committee - regard the agreement signed with Philip Morris in 2004 and its subsequent life and follow-up as a real success story, and rightly so."
"In the fight against smuggling and fraud, we have managed to achieve a serious result here, not only for the traders and consumers at the end of the process but also for a large international manufacturer at the beginning of the process."
"This agreement not only compensates financially for past losses but also covers their future prevention."
"We have managed to make Philip Morris understand that it also has an interest in preparing a joint strategy against smuggling and fraud and in ensuring the financial instruments necessary to bring it to fruition."
"It is particularly pleasing and, for us newly acceded countries, very significant that the cooperation will cover not only the ten Member States in the agreement but also the new countries that are particularly threatened by smuggling and fraud, and thus also ensuring the financial and technical conditions for the fight against smuggling and fraud, albeit with varying degrees of success."
"Thank you."
"(PL) Mr President, Mr Commissioner, I accept and approve of Mr Staes's report, which will first and foremost lead to contraband being limited as far as possible."
"This is the strong point of this report."
"Secondly, it provides important advice on how to collect duty with maximum efficiency."
"As someone who comes from a country which has a very long eastern border, that is to say Poland, however, I would like to draw attention to external borders."
"Herbert Bösch is entirely correct when he talks of using experienced customs people."
"These people will actually be much more crucial than equipment and systems, and so, Commissioner, I would earnestly request you to have a reasonably thorough look at the proposals and recommendations and take them to heart."
"Efficiency and effectiveness in combating contraband will be the indicative factor where the reputation of our Community is concerned."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, thank you for your constant support for these issues raised."
"I must say the biggest problem is that all the competence in customs and value added tax is in the hands of the Member States."
"I do not really understand why some Member States are so reluctant to give more possibilities to use the facilities which exist within the European Union institutions."
"For instance, OLAF has been extremely operational in several cases, in the Philip Morris operation and in the Diabolo fight against counterfeit operations, and this cannot happen without cooperation at European level and cannot happen without support from specific Commission services."
"But legally, this is fully in the hands of the Member States, as is the strengthening of customs providing necessary resources."
"The Commission is doing whatever is possible to facilitate this cooperation."
"I must say that, without cooperation between Member States, an efficient, effective fight against cigarette smuggling, and especially value added tax fraud, is impossible."
"I think that we have common interests here, and we should raise this issue constantly to increase cooperation."
"Also - and perhaps I understood incorrectly from the interpretation - the Philip Morris agreement was between 10 Member States and the European Commission on the one side and Philip Morris on the other side, which is quite unique."
"It was the Commission, its legal service and OLAF which achieved this agreement, and, with Ms Gräßle, this is continuing."
"So I think that we can tell something in the future."
"But the main issue is really the reluctance of some Member States to accept the mutual administrative assistance proposal which has been put forward, which can serve as a platform."
"We are offering a platform for cooperation, and there are still some Member States, some of the bigger Member States (I myself have tried to convince certain ministers of the biggest Member State to be more open to this proposal.)"
"Somehow, there is a lot of suspicion; but, at the same time, being a former finance minister, I know that to fight value added tax fraud and customs is possible only with cooperation between Member States."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday 11 October 2007."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (IT) As rapporteur on combating fraud in the EU, I welcome the important agreement with Philip Morris on combating cigarette smuggling at customs."
"Customs fraud is one of the main sources of damage to the financial interests of the Community, and fraud relating to cigarettes is one of the most vulnerable sectors."
"OLAF's recent operations - such as Operation Diabolo (135 million cigarettes seized, estimated loss of EUR 220 million) - have demonstrated that customs fraud can and must be combated: it is important to strengthen the operational capabilities of the European authorities."
"The agreement with Philip Morris may serve as an example not only in the field of tobacco, but also in other fields of combating counterfeiting."
"The proceeds of the compensation owed by Philip Morris, amounting to approximately EUR 1 billion, ought to be used to step up the fight against counterfeiting in the EU."

"EC-USA air transport agreement (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr El Khadraoui, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a decision of the Council and the representatives of the governments of the Member States of the European Union, meeting with the Council, on the conclusion of the Air Transport Agreement between the European Community and its Member States, on the one hand, and the United States of America, on the other hand [8044/3/07 - - C6-0210/2007 -."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr El Khadraoui, Parliament played a major political role in helping us sign the first EU-US air transport agreement on 30 April in Washington."
"By backing the agreement on 14 March, even before the Committee on Transport and Tourism had made its announcement, Parliament played an extremely decisive role in modernising the arrangements regulating transatlantic aviation and offering new possibilities to European citizens."
"The agreement will enter into force in March next year, and European and US businesses are on their starting blocks for new transatlantic connections."
"The Joint Committee which is to operate the agreement has already met in June."
"It is due to meet again in November to ensure smooth application and start work on important issues such as competition or security."
"You make a number of key points in your formal discussions on the agreement today, which I share."
"You emphasise the importance of a second stage agreement to move forward access to the US market, especially as a means of taking European investment to the United States."
"You emphasise the importance of converging our regulations, particularly with regard to security, in a bid to obtain 'one-stop security'."
"You emphasise the importance of the environmental aspect, and CO2 emissions trading in particular."
"Lastly, you also emphasise the importance of informing and consulting Parliament."
"I also share your political priorities."
"I welcome the agreement between our two institutions on items so politically sensitive in both Europe and the United States."
"I am also extremely pleased that Parliament is conveying Europe's voice to the United States through continuous dialogue with the US Congress and Government."
"We must work relentlessly together on items posing a problem with Washington."
"The International Civil Aviation Organisation's Assembly in Montreal in September was a disappointment."
"As you are aware, the EU and its European neighbours, 42 countries, were compelled to voice their reserves concerning the resolution on CO2 emissions trading, for we are in opposition with respect to the US and the rest of the world."
"The House of Representatives also adopted an amendment to restrict the possibility of US businesses coming under foreign control."
"Although the amendment has not yet been voted by the Senate, this casts a shadow over negotiations towards a second stage agreement, due to commence in the spring."
"The European Parliament has made Congress and the US Government aware of this matter, as I have, and we must continue to deploy our energies to prevent any movements that are at odds with normalisation of the aviation sector."
"However, if these events point to the difficulties to be overcome, we must not forget the most important part."
"We now have a solid work base between Europe and the US to treat each other as equals."
"This was not the case six months ago."
"We must, therefore, build on this achievement, which is the result of four years' work."
"Obviously, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr El Khadraoui, I wish to let you know I am ready and willing to meet the political objectives of both Parliament and the Council, and that I am extremely pleased with European unity on this issue, with the union of Europeans."
"Madam President, Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, when this afternoon we finally give the green light to the air transport agreement between the EU and the United States, that will not only mark the end of a procedure that has lasted for many years and that progressed with great difficulty, it will also mark the beginning of a new chapter in the history of air transport and the consequences - while not entirely predictable - could be immense."
"At the same time we know that this is only an interim phase and that there is still a lot of work ahead of us to get to the more or less integrated transatlantic aviation market for which we are aiming."
"Some members believe that we have already made too many concessions to the Americans in this first phase."
"They believe that the mind to negotiate will melt away, especially as airlines from the US already have de facto stand alone cabotage to fly from one Member State to another, which we cannot do on US territory."
"Both parties get what we call the fifth freedom of the air, which offers American airlines the opportunity to fly on to Africa or Asia via Europe."
"The other way round is also possible but is less important on account of the geographical location of the US."
"What is more, from March of next year the restrictions that still exist on access to certain airports will be lifted: just think of Heathrow, which only two American airlines are allowed to use at present."
"In some senses, therefore, there is no real balance but, on the other hand, Commissioner, the agreement is obviously a step forward and an improvement over the present situation."
"First, the agreement puts an end to the legal uncertainty created since the judgments of the Court of Justice in 2002, which pronounced that the existing bilateral open skies agreement contains elements which are unlawful and which must be amended."
"Second, consumers will feel the difference."
"Whereas up to now only national carriers and American airlines have been able to fly from the Member States to the United States, in future all European carriers will be able to fly from any point in Europe to any point in the United States, with the possibility of then flying on to, for instance, Mexico or South America."
"Now, this will undoubtedly mean more choice for the consumer and probably lower prices too."
"Third, with the setting up of the Joint Committee - to which you also referred, Commissioner - with representatives from both sides, we are creating an institution which will discuss issues relating to the agreement, as well as issues concerning social, environmental and safety regulations, and so on. This is an instrument, therefore, that could boost confidence and understanding on both sides."
"That is very important because, parallel with this opening of the transatlantic market, it is, of course, essential that the regulations are gradually harmonised and aligned with one another at a high level."
"As the authorities come to be on better terms and as the benefits of close cooperation become clearer, the Americans may also become more willing to make new concessions on access to the internal US market."
"After all, there are still many unresolved issues: you have already referred to them."
"I am talking about cabotage, right of establishment for European airlines, rules relating to control and ownership, and all manner of other restrictions that are still in place."
"Knowing, therefore, that the negotiations for stage two will start very soon - next summer, in fact - it is necessary for the Commission to think about a good negotiating strategy now."
"What in fact do we want to achieve?"
"What are our priorities?"
"How can we persuade the Americans to take new steps?"
"Where can concessions still be made without disadvantage to us?"
"I do not need to tell you, Commissioner, that the context is highly problematic."
"There are presidential elections next year."
"There is a general mistrust in the United States, which goes right up to Congress, about allowing third parties control over strategic industries such as aviation."
"The American trade unions also fear losing their grip on the sector through foreign interference, chiefly because it is felt that they could be successful and because there is an assumption that the European airlines are better organised and will easily be able to grab chunks of that market."
"Then, of course, we also have the European elections."
"Then there are the problems that already exist today."
"You refer to the attempt of our US counterpart, Congressman Oberstar, to put a different interpretation on a number of elements of the agreement."
"However, having said this, as rapporteur and as Parliament we are going to give it the green light this afternoon."
"We are going to vote 'yes' wholeheartedly."
"Of course, we will follow the preparations very closely indeed."
"We hope to be very closely involved, as we have been in the past."
"We are counting on that."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Madam President, this Parliament and in particular my group, the PPE-DE, will vote for this agreement today with a large majority, because we ultimately achieved a good interim result."
"It is, however, only an interim result; as both Vice-President Barrot and our rapporteur, Mr El Khadraoui, have said, we still have important questions to resolve in connection with the Open Skies Agreement: issues such as cabotage, the right of establishment, ownership, State aid and various other matters as well."
"Apart from the fact that we have managed to produce a reasonably good interim result, the agreement reveals a number of weaknesses in our system."
"These, too, have already been pointed out."
"For the future, we must make efforts to ensure that our Parliament - like our counterparts in the US Congress who, one could argue, have arrogated various rights to themselves over recent centuries - has more opportunities to exert influence on the substance of this agreement."
"This time, we have managed to make progress, to some extent, by tricking the system - by intervening before the Council spoke out - but in the long term, we need better rules for shaping the content."
"At this juncture, I would like to draw attention - yet again - to an important issue in air transport, especially between Europe and the US."
"Safety provisions and security checks are important so that passengers have peace of mind when using this important mode of transport."
"However, security measures should not be misinterpreted as tokenism that causes nothing but inconvenience for passengers without actually increasing their safety."
"For that reason, for the umpteenth time, the rules on the carrying of liquids on board need to be changed!"
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, first of all I would like to make an apology to you, to the Vice-President of the Commission and to honourable Members, because after I have made my speech I will have to leave the Chamber to do an interview."
"It is not my habit to do so, and I apologise for not staying for the rest of the debate."
"I would like to thank my colleague, Mr El Khadraoui, for his report and warn him that he perhaps may beat my record of being the longest-serving rapporteur in parliamentary history if he continues with this particular dossier!"
"Let us be honest."
"The marriage entered into between the European Union and the US in the form of the initial civil aviation Air Transport Agreement is a marriage of convenience, with the EU being the eager bridegroom and the US the very reluctant bride."
"Now, when we come to consummate the marriage, we find that the US bride finds that her EU bridegroom is not very fanciable, and, seeing as she has got all the best bits out of him on their wedding day, the US bride now cannot be bothered to consummate the marriage, because Representative Oberstar is standing over the couple, shotgun in hand."
"Great differences exist between the EU and US on aviation policy, and I for one would not be surprised to hear, in the weeks and months to come, that negotiations on the second stage agreement have broken down because the US would not move on key issues."
"My fear is that the EU bridegroom is so desperate to consummate this marriage of convenience that we yet again give in to the reluctant bride."
"What about ETS and security, where the EU and US are worlds apart?"
"What about foreign ownership of US airlines, or fifth freedom reciprocals?"
"What about passenger lists and Chapter 11 protection?"
"These are all issues that divide us, and, whilst I accept that there is a willingness to sit down and negotiate, it is always, it would appear to us, on the terms dictated to us by the Americans."
"I wish everybody well in their efforts, and the PSE Group will vote in favour."
"However, I sincerely hope the negotiations are successful, and that a more balanced, reciprocal, fair agreement is forthcoming at the end of the road."
"But I question whether that will happen, because of US attitudes, and I ask whether the road that we are actually on will lead to this marriage of convenience ending in a Las Vegas-type divorce."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, I am substituting for my colleague, Ms in 't Veld."
"I bow to the knowledge of other people on the technicalities of this agreement."
"As an MEP representing London, which includes the major airport of Heathrow, I am certainly encouraged by the fact that this agreement will grant more benefits of competition to passengers and, to that extent, it is good that it has been concluded."
"I want to address the security aspects of the agreement, understanding from the report that this is largely left to regulation by the Joint Committee."
"I agree with the report's welcoming of cooperation between the EU and US authorities responsible for aviation security."
"However, as the report says, security measures should be based on a proper risk assessment and should not be excessive or uncoordinated, and the privacy of European and US citizens should be respected when personal passenger data are exchanged between the EU and the US."
"Members will be aware of the considerable controversy surrounding the Passenger Name Records (PNR) Agreement."
"The European Parliament has expressed itself very forcefully on the fact that it has not played the major role that it would have wanted in that agreement."
"Certainly, the opinion of the European Data Protection Supervisors is that safeguards under the new agreement have been considerably weakened in comparison to previous agreements and that the new agreement leaves open serious questions and shortcomings."
"While Commissioner Barrot welcomed the major role Parliament has played in modernising the regulatory framework for other aspects of the aviation business, I am afraid we have to express disappointment that we have not succeeded in having the input we wanted on privacy and the enforcement of personal data safeguards."
"The data under the PNR Agreement will be retained for 15 years, which, I put to you, is excessive and which this report says we do not want."
"The US will be able to have access to sensitive data and even to use it in cases of petty crime, which is not fighting terrorism."
"All in all, while welcoming this agreement overall, I am afraid to say that the aspirations of this report that security measures should be properly assessed for their contribution to combating risk, should not be excessive and should protect privacy have not been secured in the area of the exchange of passenger name records."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, this was not the first time that you faced a negotiating partner who is very difficult, to put it mildly, because based on experience, he assumes from the outset that Europe will always give in, in every instance."
"As before, if you read through this document, it is clearly to the advantage of the US."
"Whether there is anything in it for the European Union remains to be seen, for a joint committee is no more than an opportunity; it is not yet a success, especially given that the US is already calling the outcomes into question."
"I see no balance yet, and very little concern for our demands."
"The comparison drawn by the previous speaker about the rather bizarre marriage of convenience is very apt."
"The issues of aviation security, environmental protection and ownership rights are still unresolved."
"On the question of security, we have still not achieved what we need to achieve."
"On the issue of data protection in particular - the protection of European citizens from overzealous measures - we have still not achieved the result that we need and that we must achieve."
"In addition to that, the contribution of aviation to our failure to achieve the Kyoto target is still massive."
"With the present rates of growth, Europe will face major difficulties unless we have a common agreement with the US, and I see no sign of that at all at the moment."
"At most, I see initial faltering steps, but Europe must be much more self-confident and speak with one voice in this negotiating process, for what has happened so far gives us opportunities."
"We have not yet reaped the benefits, however, and I can say with confidence that the European Parliament and the Committee on Transport and Tourism will be scrutinising the outcomes produced by this joint negotiating committee very carefully."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, at the heart of the EU's foreign policy on air transport lies the establishment of an open aviation area between the European Union and the United States of America."
"This policy is wholly in the interests of capital."
"It is being used to create through pressure and threats two or three monopolistic aviation business groups within the EU."
"They will also have the pick of international air transport, while the remaining aviation companies - those that are left - will be regional in nature and their activities will be restricted to within the Member States."
"The strong pressure and threats experienced by staff at Alitalia, Olympic Airlines and other aviation companies in the Member States are typical of what is now happening."
"Conflicts were evident in the negotiations with the United States."
"The resulting agreement and signs of friction can be inferred from the state subsidies to Airbus and Boeing, the prevention of sabotage on internal US flights and the US Government's refusal to permit the participation in or even the buying out of US aviation companies by European air carriers."
"The agreement shows the level of compromise between the EU and the United States."
"This is far from meeting the needs of the people; it will contribute to the increased rate of concentration through buy-outs and mergers of aviation companies."
"In all these areas, severe problems remain with regard to the protection of personal data as well as that of the environment."
"For these reasons, we will vote against the proposal for an Air Transport Agreement between the United States and the European Union."
"on behalf of the ITS Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, reciprocity is an important value in interpersonal relations and all the more so in relations between states, even commercial ones."
"I did in fact attempt to introduce a few amendments to the El Khadraoui report, in a fruitless effort to make our Commission colleagues aware of this point and others."
"In an age when communications are crucial, and when communications by air afford previously unimagined travel opportunities, air transport agreements between nations are clearly necessary and desirable."
"What is not clear, however, is why in this report - as in all other acts adopted by the European Union - we seem incapable of demanding reciprocity, which also means equivalent conditions of competition."
"We ought to reason like citizens, especially we Members, given that ours is the only EU institution effectively endowed with a direct popular mandate."
"Therefore, if Parliament wished to demonstrate an independent capacity to guide the other institutions' policies, it would have to demonstrate in its acts and its (albeit limited) codecisions that it is not easily swayed by non-European interests."
"This is the case of Mr El Khadraoui's report today, which is otherwise excellent in many respects, and I should like to take this opportunity to thank him for his work."
"As on so many other occasions, however, the report lacks the capacity to state clearly that, if there is to be free competition, there absolutely must be equal conditions for cabotage and compliance with social and environmental standards."
"Nor does reciprocity apply with respect to safety or passengers' rights."
"Moreover, the report recognises that the aviation sector has many negative effects which contribute to climate change."
"I therefore fail to understand why my fellow Members did not support the amendment I tabled on the adverse impact of the compounds contained in aircraft vapour trails and the likelihood that these effects will increase with the growth of aviation, and hence calling for aviation to be included in the European emissions trading system."
"Finally, as concerns the application of international social legislation, European and US carriers do not seem to me to be on an equal footing, and so there are no bilateral rights here either."
"All of this, I believe, is sufficient to justify voting against the report."
"(DE) Madam President, Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to reject the points made by Mrs Lichtenberger and Mr Romagnoli in their statements."
"Of course, there is no total reciprocity of rights, but compared with the previous situation, this is a balanced agreement, which is why we will be voting for it."
"If you take the view that this is not a balanced agreement, then by all means vote against it, but we agree with the rapporteur that this is a balanced first step and we also agree that a second step must follow."
"I of course support the rapporteur in his demand - as my colleague Mr Rack has said - that we should proceed to this second stage quickly."
"We should, quite simply, make use of what has now been agreed."
"I therefore urge the European airlines to utilise the new opportunities afforded to them by this agreement as regards their ownership and control rights, and to set up licensing operations and engage in branding policy and in part to participate in the US Government's programme."
"They should not be waiting for the second stage; they should be using the first stage now, so that when we enter the second stage of the negotiations we can benefit from initial experience and identify the areas where there are still deficits as regards our European companies' rights in the US market."
"We must also call on the Administration and our own Commission to capitalise on the opportunities afforded by this agreement and, for example, agree one-stop security on a more permanent basis."
"This can be achieved through the Joint Committee and in cooperation with the Administration, and we can show citizens that this agreement is beneficial for them, especially if they do not have to undergo a second security check at airports."
"My colleagues and I would like to thank the Commission for its good cooperation in this instance, but we must insist on similarly good cooperation in the second stage of the process."
"I warn the Americans to adopt Mr Oberstar's motion, for if they want to undermine this agreement with all their unilateral amendments, we will react sharply."
"Therefore, let us say to the Americans that we will gladly continue the talks between Congress and the European Parliament, but that they must not undermine the agreement with their biased interpretation."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his clear depiction of the situation and the position taken."
"First, the positives, which have also been mentioned by the previous speaker."
"With the open skies agreement between the US and Europe, we now finally have the opportunity to establish airline routes from the European Union via the United States to third countries such as Mexico and South America."
"It also offers the opportunity for any carrier based in the European Union to fly from anywhere in the EU to anywhere in the US without any restrictions on capacity or prices, and I agree with the previous speaker: these opportunities must be utilised."
"In the area of investment in US airline companies, too, progress has been achieved with this agreement."
"The Open Skies Agreement thus takes the first important step towards an Open Aviation Area without any restrictions on either side."
"It can thus create useful new air routes and a large number of new jobs."
"On the other hand - as has already been said - it must be made clear that this is only the first step and cannot be regarded as a final agreement."
"We expect the Commission, in a second stage, to negotiate unresolved issues such as cabotage, right of establishment, ownership and State aid with the US."
"The potential for conflict has already been made very clear by the Commissioner, but I hope that the work in the transatlantic committee will make progress so that we ultimately have reciprocal rights which can be implemented and an Open Skies Agreement which is worthy of the name."
"In parallel to this, the committee should push for the inclusion of flights from the US in emissions trading, for we know that we did not achieve very much at the ICAO meeting, as you have mentioned."
"Of course, it should also give emphasis to our demand for one-stop security."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to welcome and give the floor to Mr Georgiou, who is a new Member of the European Parliament."
"- (EL) Madam President, during recent years I have observed a desperate attempt by Europeans to sign an air transport agreement with the United States."
"Despite a great willingness on our part, I have also noted the reluctance of the Americans."
"If they want to achieve a major agreement, we should alert Europeans to the fact that they should be ready to hand over a blank cheque."
"These agreements, Madam President, do not, however, merely concern machines, interests and companies."
"These agreements concern people - people who travel from Europe to the United States."
"Some are Greeks, who are treated differently from other Europeans."
"They have much to say about the hardships they undergo in order to obtain a US visa and about what they also put up with when they arrive, and they are subject to checks and searches as if they were potential terrorists."
"You will obviously understand that this is stressful, at least for Greeks, who, in any case, are part of Europe."
"Madam President, if these agreements signed between governments or parliaments do not touch the hearts and souls of the peoples and citizens of Europe, they will be exceptionally short-lived and completely unsuccessful."
"I should like this to be included in our instructions when we again attempt to negotiate."
"The agreements ought to be founded upon equality, probity and reciprocity."
"Madam President, first of all I welcome the principle of the agreement."
"The agreement between the United States and the EU will be, when it is finally negotiated, a major and historic development."
"For EU airlines it means more transatlantic flights to the United States."
"It is also good from the point of view of airline passengers, with more airlines, more competition and lower air fares."
"We have already seen within Europe the positive impact that low fares airlines have on the aviation sector in terms of the huge increase in passenger numbers."
"I pay tribute to the EU negotiators for successfully pursuing what are very difficult negotiations."
"These are not yet concluded and are taking a lot of patience and diplomacy, but when this eventually happens the net outcome will hopefully have been worth waiting for."
"I sincerely hope that the outstanding problems with the agreement can be overcome."
"I agree with all the previous speakers with regard to the problems."
"We have to dig in to ensure that this is a 50:50 agreement and that, at the end of the day, we fly the flag for Europe in terms of insisting that, whatever they look for, we look for too."
"I believe that the restrictions by the United States authorities in relation to demanding personal details for security reasons are most unreasonable."
"We have got to ensure in fact that this is not a deterrent to EU passengers going to the United States, because if we do not solve this particular problem it will be a major deterrent."
"I am now going to be very parochial and provincial."
"I have another problem, which is that the first international transatlantic airport in Ireland was Shannon airport."
"It was the gateway to Europe for many a long day, but the mandatory stopover in Shannon will now go, under this agreement."
"That will effectively undermine the viability of Shannon airport and have major consequences for the Mid-West region, which is a very disadvantaged region."
"However, that is not a matter for Europe but for the Irish Government."
"Again, at the end of the day, the EU badly needs an agreement and passengers need an agreement - but not at any price."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Madam President, I wish to thank all the Members who have spoken."
"First and foremost, in reply to your rapporteur, Mr El Khadraoui, it can nevertheless be said that the first stage produced a balanced agreement."
"A commitment was also obtained from the United States to negotiate the second stage."
"There is even an obligation to commence negotiations within 60 days of provisional application."
"The European side approved retaliatory measures."
"It is possible to go back on certain concessions if the second stage does not meet European interests."
"This is certainly quite an important point."
"The Commission has already begun a debate with the Member States in relation to the special negotiation committee to define negotiation strategy for the second stage."
"You insisted, as did Mr Jarzembowski, on the need to define a good negotiation strategy."
"I obviously intend to involve you and Parliament to allow us to truly negotiate as effectively as possible."
"What is true, as Mr Jarzembowski said, is that there are now opportunities for European businesses which must be snapped up."
"This agreement provides a wider range of services and lower prices, it creates jobs, and has allowed us to establish coordination for measures that could affect passengers: problems relating to safety and security, and 'one stop security' in the long run, in addition to environmental issues, obviously."
"I wish to answer Mrs Ludford by saying that the PNR is not part of the aviation agreement."
"Any decisions or measures in relation to PNR must be compatible with the terms of the agreement."
"The PNR issue, however, must be reviewed in context, and Mr Frattini is aware of your concerns on that score."
"It is true you have placed much emphasis on the problem of security and it is true that this dialogue must genuinely form a part of the agreement's Joint Committee in order to produce solutions in a positive manner."
"Both parties are working to obtain a high level of security that will not penalise air services or passengers."
"Obviously in relation to this agreement the Transportation Security and Coordination Group must be able to produce specific responses to your concerns, and evidently I take due note."
"I would also like to say that we do seem to have two problems here, which ought to produce some improvements and solutions: a security problem and an environmental problem."
"In relation to the environmental problem, it is obvious we are keen to see an integrated global approach in order to take up the challenge of climate change."
"Also, as I said before and say again, at the ICAO Assembly in Montreal we all defended the emissions quotas exchange system together, a method that uses market instruments and would appear to be the most effective solution."
"For the moment we have come up against a refusal by the United States and certain Asian nations."
"Nevertheless, we feel that this does not prevent cooperation."
"You know that in the CleanSky project, cooperation with the US is also making progress."
"The Atlantic Interoperability Initiative to Reduce Emissions is a most interesting idea."
"This involves new landing procedures that may help us improve the consequences of CO2 emissions."
"I wish to say, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, that obviously we must succeed during the second stage."
"Substantial pressure and unwavering commitment are required from Europe to bring off this second stage, which is obviously much more important since it would certainly produce the open skies agreement."
"Rest assured that Parliament will be closely involved in the negotiations, which will certainly be difficult but, as I said before, will commence in due course as we only signed the first part of the agreement because it had this second stage."
"In any case, I wish to express my thanks to Parliament for what would appear to be wide-ranging solid support: we will need its support again to complete the agreement and succeed during the second stage."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 11 a.m."
"Airport capacity and ground handling (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the report by Mrs Jensen, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on Airport capacity and ground handling: towards a more efficient policy."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the strain on Europe's airports is currently so great that even the smallest delay at one airport can mean considerable delays at others."
"In addition, the continuing increase in air traffic will increase the problems at airports, and this will have adverse effects on effectiveness, competitiveness and the environment."
"The capacity problems at Europe's airports are not only a national problem but also a European one, and consequently I welcome the Commission's action plan and 14-point plan as an initial step towards improving capacity at Europe's airports."
"The Commission's proposals are insufficient, however, and so my report proposes that the Commission draw up, by 2009, a master plan for enhanced airport capacity in Europe."
"Of course, it is ultimately the responsibility of Member States to build and expand airports."
"The master plan is to be an instrument, or method, to ensure that Member States coordinate their initiatives to promote and expand airport capacity."
"The problem needs to be examined from a cross-border angle."
"Airports have different characteristics, different strengths, but interaction is important."
"This goes not only for interaction between airports, but also for interaction with other modes of transport and infrastructures surrounding airports ('co-modality')."
"I should like to thank both the Commission and the spokespeople of the other political groups - Mr El Khadraoui, Mr Jarzembowski, Mr López-Istúriz White and Mrs Lichtenberger - for their extremely constructive cooperation on this report, and I am pleased that Parliament is able to present a clear message showing widespread support in the matters of both capacity and liberalisation of the 'ground handling' Directive."
"Of course, airports are both loved and loathed."
"They create growth and prosperity, and provide a link between regions, but they also generate noise and pollution and take up space."
"It is important, then, that problems be handled in a way appropriate to all parties concerned."
"Firstly, we propose promoting environmentally friendly capacity expansion."
"Airport congestion itself can have a negative impact on the environment if aeroplanes are left in a holding pattern, resulting in unnecessary CO2 emissions."
"Consequently, I also welcome the Commission initiative to incorporate aviation into the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme."
"I should like to emphasise, however, that it is important for us to have things implemented at global level, too."
"Secondly, it is important for the Commission to follow up on countries' implementation of the common rules for the allocation of slots."
"In this context, the report also requests that the Commission lay down a timeframe and deadlines in order to enhance cooperation between neighbouring Member States as regards the building of functional airspace blocks (FABs)."
"There must be substantial improvements in this area by 2008 - this is a high priority for Parliament."
"Thirdly, it is a pipe dream to imagine there can be any expansion of an airport's capacity without thorough involvement of and cooperation with regional and local administrations."
"It is important, therefore, to establish a dialogue among those European regions with an airport on coordination of capacity expansion."
"The regions can exchange experiences and learn from one another (What environmental impact does the airport have on the neighbouring population?"
"What are the spatial development plans? What significance does an airport have in general for growth and employment in the area?) and perhaps develop good practice from this."
"I hope the Council will support the basic ideas in this report, namely that the Commission's action plan is insufficient, that guidelines must be developed for optimising and developing airport capacity, that additional capacity is nevertheless required, and that words must be accompanied by action."
"The second part of my report concerns ground handling - that is, all the handling surrounding the aeroplane and in the airport, from fuelling and baggage handling to the check-in procedure."
"Here, the Commission is preparing for a revision of the existing Directive on access to the groundhandling market at Community airports, which, as we know, is a thorny issue."
"I should like to reiterate my thanks to the spokespeople for the constructive cooperation we enjoyed."
"We agree that the Commission should carry out an updated analysis of the implementation and impact of the current 'ground handling' Directive before we put any new liberalisation on the agenda."
"We must have a full overview of the impact on users, passengers and staff, and a future directive must ensure quality in ground handling and decent working conditions for staff."
"We must ensure that there are no monopolistic conditions and that there are clear rules for calls for tender in order to involve users. I hope that this report will inspire the Commission to proceed with both the 'ground handling' Directive and the 14-point plan."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you, Mrs Jensen, and the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"Thank you for supporting the Commission's action plan and for your commitment to Community air transport policy."
"One of the challenges of aviation policy is to prevent congestion at European airports."
"Our action plan focuses on developing a coherent global airport policy."
"It involves optimising the output of existing airport capacities, and improving the planning of new infrastructure by avoiding juxtaposition of purely local solutions and the formation of bottlenecks."
"As the EP understands only too well, optimum functioning of the European airport network can only be guaranteed if local actions form part of a coherent global policy."
"The course of action proposed by the Commission is meant to be realistic, since it considers the economic and environmental constraints that must be taken into account."
"That is why, Mrs Jensen, priority is initially given to better use of existing airport capacities, thanks to development and harmonised implementation of new technology."
"It is patently obvious, if we obtain a Single Sky with functional air traffic control blocks, that we will be able to use the existing infrastructure much better."
"It is true that building new infrastructure will cause even more problems, especially in large urban areas with a heavy demand for air transport."
"Our action plan, however, deals with the problem of creating new infrastructure, which is frequently essential, and we wish to plan the new infrastructure for a better appreciation of its utility and location in order to make it more environmentally-friendly."
"On 2 October the Committee on Transport and Tourism adopted conclusions, Madam President, that are less ambitious than the conclusions of Parliament."
"A large number of the Member States, perhaps too prone to listen to those in charge of their own airports, are loath to take up Community coordination and prefer to continue giving priority to local solutions implemented at each airport."
"This kind of reluctance makes it more difficult to implement the action plan, but EP support will allow the Commission to work specifically towards initiatives on the basis of Mrs Jensen's contributions here."
"I thank her, and I also wish to thank the Committee on Transport and Tourism for the quality of its work and for helping us move forward on this issue, which is so important in terms of the harmonious sustainable development of the entire air transport sector."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. - Madam President, advances in the aviation industry have contributed massively to economic progress and general well-being, and they can continue to do so."
"This industry does not deserve the environmentalist hostility which is often heaped upon it."
"This attitude is also politically unwise, as all our constituents benefit enormously in both their work and their leisure."
"Aviation has done much to meet its environmental obligations by developing and adopting new technology and improving operational efficiencies."
"It rests with the political authorities and the administrative and regulatory authorities to play their part in permitting and enthusiastically encouraging continuing improvement."
"Ms Jensen's excellent report incorporates much of what my committee proposed."
"But there are three matters which the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs put forward in its opinion and which did not find their way into the final report."
"Firstly, with the advent of quieter aircraft, it should be possible to relax limitations on airport opening times and move towards 24-hour operation almost everywhere."
"This would greatly enhance capital and capacity utilisation of airport infrastructures and of the aircraft themselves, facilitating better productivity and cheaper services with less than proportionate environmental impact."
"Secondly, the selection of efficient ground handlers can also enhance productivity by improving utilisation of airport infrastructure, notably where they speed up aircraft turnarounds and contribute to good timekeeping and passenger satisfaction."
"Thirdly, we advocated applying market forces by the open auctioning of airport slots, moving away from grandfather rights while retaining a defined proportion of slots at hub airports for those vital regional feeder services."
"Those bodies responsible for providing the environment in which airlines operate must facilitate greater productivity by providing adequate and efficient infrastructure and imposing only appropriate regulatory conditions."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, many of you will have flown here to Brussels via my home airport, Frankfurt am Main."
"Rapid handling is a key factor in the quality of ground services, which are responsible for loading and unloading, cleaning and refuelling of aircraft, and easing passengers through the system."
"However, these work processes must fit together seamlessly."
"In order for good professional standards to be maintained at all Europe's airports, the European Parliament adopted a decision back in 1996 to the effect that besides the airport operators, only those service providers which could operate efficiently on a lasting basis would be licensed to work in airports."
"However, the number of these service providers is limited."
"Then, as now, I was the draftsman for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and was able to prevent unlimited liberalisation of these services."
"While fully appreciating the need for competition, this can only be accepted if it is fair and is not to the detriment of the workers or security."
"Not every supplier can guarantee the requisite high level of training, appropriate wage levels or good service."
"Tough competition on prices means that more and more permanent jobs are being replaced by poor-quality temporary and agency contracts."
"I would like to express my thanks to Anne Jensen."
"My Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and your Committee on Transport and Tourism have joined forces and called on the Commission to ensure that, first and foremost, the 1996 Directive is implemented properly in all EU Member States."
"The data we have been given are out of date."
"They only report on experience in 15 Member States."
"We want a careful analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of liberalisation, both for workers and for passengers."
"Ground handling services make a key contribution to aviation safety and security."
"Sensitive infrastructures like the European hub in Frankfurt am Main and elsewhere are completely unsuitable as a playground for those individuals who compulsively champion the cause of harmonisation in Europe."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development. - (PL) Madam President, Commissioner, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, I should like to congratulate Mrs Jensen on her excellent work."
"Technical and organisational issues are very important in relation to airport capacity."
"A holistic approach to the issue should be adopted, however, with reference also to the local and regional environment of airports."
"Air transport has helped to improve territorial, economic and social cohesion, especially in the case of areas far from the centres."
"The existence of such links is often decisive when it comes to placing investments and receiving tourists."
"In a nutshell, these links are vital to a region's development."
"Airports are also important in terms of job creation."
"The Member States, regional and local authorities must ensure that airports, regardless of their governing bodies, are included in regional spatial planning plans and national development strategies."
"There should also be coordination at European network level."
"Airport location should be determined not so much by the ambitions of the authorities involved as by the logic of each situation."
"There are cases within the Union where fairly large conurbations located less than 100 kilometres apart each have separate airports."
"It would be sensible for a single airport to serve both towns."
"The location of airports should be chosen to enable them to serve neighbouring and border regions."
"Where possible, intermodal solutions should be put in place, because fast rail connections between airports significantly increase their capacity."
"It is of course also essential to provide good transport links between airports and city centres in their hinterland."
"The maintenance and extension of existing airports and the construction of new ones must be subject to the relevant territorial impact assessment."
"This is particularly necessary in connection with the natural environment, in terms of noise, emission of pollutants, road traffic density in the vicinity of the airport, the proximity of fuel tanks, and also in relation to meteorological factors."
"Finally, I should like to say on the basis of my own experience and my constituents' statements, that issues relating to airport capacity involve much more than technical matters, air traffic control systems and coordinating take-offs and landings."
"The organisation of the tasks concerned is also relevant, and all too often it is very poor indeed."
"Personal checks on passengers are one example."
"Mr Mann referred to Frankfurt airport, where passengers are checked twice, whereas once might be sufficient."
"A good deal of time is wasted at baggage collection too."
"Even in the case of reputable airlines, delays are constantly being experienced supposedly for technical reasons."
"Perhaps the real reason is plain incompetence?"
"It is not unusual for passengers at an airport to feel they are unwelcome and a nuisance."
"They are given the impression that they are simply getting in the way of the staff and upsetting working arrangements by their presence."
"People need and want to fly, however, the disabled included."
"Air transport services offered by carriers and airports should be provided safely and punctually."
"Passengers should be treated with respect at all times."
"Both sides would then be happy."
"The Commissioner's statement gives me reason to hope that this will one day be the case."
"Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. - Madam President, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, I have only one point to make in this debate, and that is in regard to the Commission proposal on radio identification tagging."
"The original proposal to tag both passengers' baggage and the boarding pass of each passenger to me poses a significant breach, or potential breach, of civil liberties."
"I can see little benefit in being able to tag passengers' movement around airport terminals and would also call into question how much it would cost for airports to implement such measures."
"There are clear benefits in being able to quickly identify where certain pieces of baggage or luggage are at any point in time with radio frequency identifiers, and this is where I draw the line."
"My amendment to restrict the tagging of baggage, which was adopted in both the Civil Liberties Committee and the Committee on Transport, to me strikes the right balance between being able to reduce delays to flights and to respect the personal freedoms of passengers as they circulate through airports and terminal buildings."
"With this in mind, I can therefore fully support the text before us today."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Mr President, I believe that we should be pleased with the agreement reached in this report."
"It is clearly a balanced report, which is the result of consensus and an in-depth examination of the matter."
"I want to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Anne Jensen, in particular on her willingness to engage in dialogue and consensus when drawing up this report."
"Later today the European Parliament is going to vote on a report that clearly demonstrates its support for the Commission with a view to alleviating the problem of airport capacity crunch."
"As the Commission itself warns - and Vice-President Jacques Barrot has said the same - this poses a threat to the efficiency, security and competitiveness of all those involved in the air transport sector."
"According to the statistics, by the year 2025 there could be nearly 4 million extra flights per year and, as a result, more than 60 European airports will be at full capacity."
"From the first contacts in relation to the preparation of this report, it was important to bear in mind that, as we know, the European Commission is not responsible for competition in relation to airports and unfortunately it cannot, therefore, require the Member States to take a series of measures on airport capacity."
"However, the members of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, together with the Commission, understand that it is vital to implement a master plan for air traffic management and to propose to the Member State measures that are needed to optimise the capacity of European airports, thereby minimising the problems created by a capacity crunch."
"The report proposes measures including: improving the use of ground handling services; promoting 'co-modality'; improving operational planning; optimising departure sequences; and above all, in relation to the famous slots, ensuring coherence between slots and flight plans."
"With that in mind, we have supported the creation of the European Air Capacity Observatory under the auspices of the Commission."
"I sincerely hope that this proposal moves forward."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by congratulating Mrs Jensen."
"I am not doing this just as a matter of form but in all sincerity."
"She has produced an excellent and extremely balanced report."
"It is clear that both of the topics it had to tackle are extremely important and will demand a great deal of follow-up work on the part of the Commission."
"With regard to airport capacity, it is clear that we need a global outlook."
"The spectacular growth will create problems, which is obvious now already, and they cannot be solved simply by building new airports here and there."
"In the areas where they are most needed, that will be very difficult or even impossible because of population density and opposition from local residents."
"The first thing, therefore, is to make optimum use of the capacity we have now."
"There are many ways to do that but an integrated approach is absolutely essential."
"A multi-track policy is needed in which we join forces at all levels."
"It concerns infrastructure, such as connections to high speed rail lines, good links between cities and airports."
"It concerns technology."
"You have already referred to CESAR, to functional airspace blocks, to the unified air space, as well as to quieter aircraft that will enable local residents to tolerate more flights."
"It is not simple."
"However, taking all these measures together they are extremely significant Meanwhile an important step forward is the idea of mapping everything out and producing a master plan for airport capacity by 2009."
"We are counting on the Commission to do this."
"With regard to ground handling, the evaluation of the first steps toward liberalisation, which have been underway for many years now, is not entirely positive."
"It is clear that prices have fallen and that airlines have benefited from that."
"On the other hand, the effects on the employees have clearly been problematic."
"Trade unions throughout Europe complain about lower wages, poorer working conditions and reduced job security."
"You know that there is a public call for tenders every seven years: the ground handling companies can be replaced by others, but the personnel have no guarantees that they will be taken on."
"The number of accidents at work is also reported to have increased."
"These are matters that we really do need to examine more closely."
"Consequently, it seems to me that we need a new study, not only to give us more recent figures to work with, but also to look at the number and quality of jobs."
"In short, Commissioner, these are two fascinating issues that we will certainly want to return to many times in the near future and I think that this report is a good basis for future subsequent."
"Firstly, I would like to thank the speaker for his cooperation and for keeping his ears open to various proposals."
"In my speech I would like to present my thoughts on the 'ground handling' Directive."
"I am concerned because interested states blocked the reconsideration of the Directive a few years ago when the Commission even had a new draft proposal drawn up."
"The concern raised by market participants and the content of the improvements proposed today demonstrate the need to revise the Directive as soon as possible."
"Moreover, we cannot forget that after 2004 the EU aviation market was supplemented by the particularities of the new Member States which, unfortunately, have not been evaluated in the Commission's document this time."
"I would like to concentrate on some specific remarks."
"The aim of the Directive now in force is to regulate the competitive conditions for third-party handlers and self-handling companies."
"However, it is necessary to consider that a state monopoly of all ground handling services existed in the post-Soviet states until recent times."
"Therefore, independent service providers inevitably appear when market conditions start functioning."
"Airports controlling and using the infrastructure belonging to them at the same time continue their activities, providing the same services for airlines, and thus compete with their tenants."
"Mostly, such competition infringes on the principles of equality of rights and transparency owing to objectively emerging conflicts of interest."
"Conflicts also deepen because the Airport Users Committee does not establish areas for ground handling service providers."
"To protect the principle of impartiality it is necessary to expand the rights of airport users: an airport should choose a provider that would meet not the expectations of the airport administration but those of the users, i.e., the airlines."
"The increasing cost of equipment that meets safety requirements increases the amount of investment that is necessary."
"However, the seven-year period for choosing providers has forced service providers to recoup the increasing investment sooner, often economising on staff working conditions and payments."
"Therefore, I think it is necessary to extend the period for choosing ground handling service providers."
"I encourage the Commission to present a draft revised directive, considering the European Parliament's proposals, as soon as possible (during this term of office) and thus save time on repeated improvements in the future."
"Mr President, the Jensen report is a sound and thorough overview of the issues related to airport capacity and ground handling."
"The dramatic increase in air traffic in Member States of the European Union necessitates the construction of new airports and the extension and modernisation of existing ones."
"Mrs Jensen rightly points out that the choice of location for the construction of an airport involves difficult decisions in view of the area required and the need to comply with a range of technical, organisational and social conditions - such as the consent of local authorities and populations - as well as requirements regarding safety and environmental protection."
"That is why the construction of large and medium-sized airports should be planned well in advance and included in the overall plan for the development of air transport within the Union."
"The construction of airports of this nature is a very expensive investment."
"Union support will be required in many cases."
"It would appear that the accepted estimates for passenger air transport have not taken account of high-speed rail links."
"For journeys of up to 500 kilometres, the latter are a very attractive option for passengers in terms of both fares and journey times."
"The Brussels-Paris link is a good example."
"It provides a direct connection between the city centres, enabling passengers to avoid additional journeys and all the checks related to air travel."
"Taxes and aviation fuel surcharges resulting in price increases are also likely to have a bearing on the estimates."
"It is important for the sector and for passengers to fully exploit the latent possibilities involving better and more efficient flight management and ground handling."
"As we know from our own experience, the quality of airport services and carriers varies a great deal."
"Certain minimum standards should be guaranteed and regulated for under Union provisions."
"A good way to improve the quality of services would be for the Union's institutions to take the initiative and facilitate the exchange of best practice between airports."
"The report and opinions constitute a very necessary document."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report draws attention to some of the problems, notably congestion, which we, as people who have to fly fairly frequently, very often experience but which naturally affect aviation as a whole, not just business flights but holiday flights as well."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur particularly for attempting to reconcile two positions which emerged in the committee on this issue."
"On the one hand, there was unfettered euphoria about the prospect of growth, which appeared to rely solely on building new airports to relieve the old ones; on the other hand, there was the concern about organisational aspects and, of course, the issue of responsibility for the protection of both the environment and local residents."
"We face a situation in which the quality of life of people living around major airports or, indeed, poorly situated regional airports is severely impaired."
"Here, too, we have a responsibility."
"We cannot simply deal with this issue in terms of new growth prospects."
"It is a question of organisation."
"The system of hubs and slots which currently exists in European aviation is not as good as it could be."
"We have such large hubs in some areas that the ensuing complexity of connecting flights means that one small mistake can potentially have massive consequences, not just for one airport but for the airspace as a whole."
"That problem needs to be solved and the report makes some important suggestions here."
"However, these solutions must not be implemented at the expense of passengers and especially not at the expense of the workers providing airport services, because they too have a right to quality of life."
"Mr President, the aviation sector has been in the spotlight in the last few months."
"The proposals to include the sector in the greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme, the agreement with the United States and the reform of landing rights are a few examples."
"Mrs Jensen's report adds a new dimension to that list: the organisation of aviation on the ground."
"It addresses the services being provided, but also noise and available capacity."
"As far as ground handling services are concerned, we will indeed have to wait for a new evaluation by the Commission in which all Member States are included."
"I concur with the suggestions to the Commission for points which need looking at in the future."
"I am a bit more critical about the sections dealing with capacity."
"The text urges the Commission to take major action."
"The master plan is intended to be the key to tackling the aviation capacity problem on the ground."
"A master plan does indeed offer a good overview of the current situation and can indicate problem areas."
"However, it does not seem to me desirable that the Commission, with such a plan in hand, should force the Member States to take certain steps or indeed stand in their way."
"The main purpose of a master plan is to promote international cooperation between all parties concerned, so that integrated solutions can be found for specific problem areas through good consultations and with respect for existing authorities."
"I am pleased that some sections contain sensible comments on this."
"My conclusion, Mr President, is therefore that I am able to support Mrs Jensen's report."
"I very much enjoyed working with her."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, when it comes to the issue of airport capacity, we have to distinguish between two issues."
"We want to mitigate the negative effects of aviation, which is why we agree on emissions trading for the aviation industry."
"We may not agree about the methodology or timescales involved, Mrs Lichtenberger, but in principle, we agree that the aviation sector should make its contribution to mitigating environmental impacts."
"However, we must also have the courage, Mrs Lichtenberger, to say that for economic reasons we need growth in the aviation sector, both internally and in respect of third countries."
"When it comes to the economy, jobs and citizens' mobility, adequate airport capacity is essential, and it is essential for environmental reasons as well, by the way."
"If the aircraft did not have to spend so long on the ground waiting for takeoff and did not have to spend so long stacking overhead before landing, just imagine what this would do to help the environment!"
"We have to recognise the fact that we need to develop our airports."
"Mr Blokland is quite right: we do not want to take responsibility away from the Member States or regions, but in our experience there have been difficulties with airport expansion in many parts of Europe."
"That is why our approach is right: we are requesting the Commission to put forward a coherent proposal on how we can have a European master plan and how we can introduce best practice so that we can all learn from each other and pursue this expansion effectively."
"My second point relates to ground handling services."
"I think we should wait for the new impact analysis."
"I think that the basic Directive was very successful as the efficiency of ground handling services has been improved in recent years and the costs for passengers have been reduced."
"As to whether we need further changes, that is an open question."
"I would not wish to decide conclusively today."
"I think we should wait for the outcome of the Commission's analysis, which is expected this winter, and only then should we decide whether or not there is a need for revision."
"We should not rush into any decisions today."
"(ES) Mr President, I would to begin by congratulating Mrs Jensen on her excellent report."
"I believe that it will be very useful in terms of improving the Commission's proposals and improving airports, where European citizens are increasingly obliged to 'camp out'; of course airports are almost like a second home to Members of the European Parliament."
"I would also like to congratulate, in particular, Mr Barrot and his services for this procedure to push forward the preparation of the legislation."
"Normally, and increasingly because of its complexity, this legislation gives rise to conflict and can raise suspicions, and has come to be known as the 'vague method'."
"In other words, it is good to hold very rigorous broad consultations to identify the strong points and the obstacles to be removed while making the most of all the good ideas available."
"Mrs Jensen's report is full of such good ideas."
"In particular, I welcome the strong cooperation of, and mandate given to, Eurocontrol in the preparation of the new measures."
"It is important to do away with any hint of confrontation between the few bodies responsible for the organisation of air transport."
"I also believe that it is extremely important to strengthen all the intelligence systems in this area, starting with the CESAR traffic management system, that are going to help us not only to improve traffic but also, as far as possible, to reduce its environmental impact."
"I am very hopeful, too, that this future action plan will help to give a considerable boost to the Galileo system."
"In addition, I am very interested in the role that territorial cohesion is playing through regional airports, although I understand - and share - the reservations concerning the large-scale creation of local airports that are not sufficiently efficient or feasible."
"It is thus necessary, too, to ensure that we manage future conflicts with neighbours over noise, pollution, even spatial use, and I think that in this regard it would be very interesting to be able to assess the new demands: the types of shuttles, private jets, open-air leisure aspects, etc."
"Moreover, I support the proposals to strengthen social standards in the area of ground handling services, because subcontracting, which is increasingly used in this sector, does not always ensure sufficient protection of this social standards."
"I also welcome Mrs Jensen's proposal to ensure that users are consulted so that competition in the area of ground handling is truly effective."
"Of course, we support, too, the creation of the Airport Capacity Observatory because we believe that with the Commission's support it will be a positive tool for the future."
"In conclusion, I would simply like the Commission to include in its future work the logistical aspect and relations with cargo aviation, which is becoming increasingly popular and is a possible alternative in terms of the 'co-modality' suggested by the revision of the White Paper."
"Mr President, this report makes good sense in saying that there should be an overall EU approach as regards the need for extra airport capacity."
"This might mean that there would be seen to be less justification for all airports which see themselves as major hubs to expand."
"If you look at Paris Charles De Gaulle, Schiphol, Frankfurt and London Heathrow all together, the conclusion might be, for instance, that there was no justification for a third runway at Heathrow."
"I would not, though, want the report's call for a master plan for enhanced airport capacity to be misunderstood as Brussels muscling in and telling national, regional and local authorities where to build new airports; obviously, it just means pooling information and objectives."
"Subsidiarity rules on any decisions whether or not to expand airports."
"But there is a second danger of misunderstanding."
"The report cites forecasts of demand increasing by around 5% a year and says that, in 2025, the demand for flights would be two and a half times higher than 2003."
"This, I am sure, should not be taken as succumbing to the discredited 'predict and provide' policy."
"I am not sure that the call in the report to accompany the growth of air transport by measures limiting its external cost is quite enough, because we know there is a lot we can and must do to at least moderate aviation growth to a sustainable level - whether through emissions trading, proper and fair taxation, building high-speed rail alternatives and so on - in order to combat global warming and safeguard against the dangers of air pollution and noise nuisance."
"I was surprised to see that there was no opinion from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, so I am sure - and I hope - that the risk of lack of consistency between this report and the resolution last year on reducing the climate change impact of aviation will be avoided."
"This report must be seen in the light of that resolution, and not in any way - and I am sure it is not the intention, at least of the rapporteur - giving comfort to this idea that you simply build airports based on predictions, many of them from airlines, about increased demand, without all the other measures that we know we need to take to have sustainable aviation."
"(SV) The report on airport capacity and ground handling is an own-initiative report with high-flying plans as regards central planning on the part of the EU."
"We therefore have to ask what kind of society we want: a market economy or a planned economy?"
"According to the report, Europe is facing a substantial increase in airport use and there is a need to optimise existing resources."
"The European Parliament considers, however, that the Commission has not yet fully investigated the possibility of a global approach as regards the need for extra capacity."
"There is mention of planning future investments and setting strategic axes."
"It is thought that it is possible to anticipate the risks of a capacity crunch."
"The European Parliament urges the Commission to take a top-down approach."
"If no significant progress has been made by Member States on this issue by 2008, measures must be taken and so on."
"I do not believe in this global approach in principle."
"I think that such centrally planned projects are doomed to failure."
"In the vast majority of cases there is national competition between countries to meet air transport demand."
"Some countries will fare well, other countries will do badly."
"The countries that are successful will attract tourism and business."
"Let the countries stand up to one another."
"I also know from my own experience that in many countries private investors are building airport capacity and they are guided by investment decisions that are completely different from those taken by state bodies."
"In some cases decisions are also taken regionally."
"It is impossible to coordinate these three types of decision, private, public and regional."
"We should therefore allow developments to take their course and only regulate what it absolutely necessary, namely the air transport management needed in order to achieve organised air transport systems in the EU."
"My experience is that the costs of expanded airport capacity almost never tally."
"Costs are often three to four times higher than estimated and projects take twice as long as originally envisaged."
"Technical developments are also a factor of uncertainty."
"Demand is shifting quickly."
"Suddenly entirely new regions want transport."
"Suddenly we want new technology with high-speed railways which perhaps make air transport connections less interesting."
"So let us not believe in a global approach."
"I do not think that we should return to the kind of central planning that existed in the former socialist countries."
"I will not therefore be supporting this motion."
"(RO) I also want to congratulate Mrs. Jenzan for this report."
"Europe needs economic development and, obviously, air transport development."
"This is why I believe that the European programmes, such as Caesar and Clear Sky, will bring important contributions to the development of the European air sector."
"In the first eleven months of last year alone, 225 new routes were developed, which actually means 1800 new flights every week."
"Therefore, air transport has developed and the development of new airport capacities is required."
"Unfortunately, big airports are crowded, there are very many flight delays, there is waiting time either on ground or in the air, which, on the one hand, contributes to pollution and, on the other hand, has certain social effects."
"Nevertheless, we should not forget that the development of airport infrastructures requires a lot of time, between 5 and 10 years, and substantial investments."
"This is why I believe it is important for the Member States - and I also refer to the new Member States - to be assisted in using the structural funds, the regional development funds for developing new airports."
"Also, a framework plan for new airport capacities in Europe should be approached, at least simultaneously with or, if not, after the development of an action plan regarding the appropriate and efficient management of the existing airport capacities."
"The approach of the need for additional airport capacities in Europe should be part of a strategy for the development of the passenger and goods air transport, not only in a European and continental context, but also an a larger scale."
"Also, directives and regulations regarding airports should remain within the standards established and accepted by Annex No. 14 of the Chicago Convention."
"If the Commission has proposals to improve such standards, it should present and support them in ICAO as well."
"(HU) Thank you, Mr President, and I would like to congratulate you on your award."
"Air transport is developing spectacularly, and traffic has trebled over the last 20 years."
"This trend can be expected to continue, and this makes it urgent to optimise the capacity of European airports."
"The strategy for the capacity, efficiency and security of European airports prioritises the optimised use and development of current capacity, aid for combined transport and reducing the environmental burden."
"The recommendation is a complex one that requires a pragmatic attitude and dialogue by the relevant professional parties and authorities."
"It may be a milestone in the formulation of a standardised European regulatory framework."
"In harmony with the Lisbon Strategy, European airports play an important role in maintaining the economic and social competitiveness of the Community, in regional development, and now, in contrast with previous experience, they will be able to apply standardised rules in Europe."
"When optimising capacity, it is important to pay attention to airport facilities, vehicles that transport passengers and ensuring that disabled people can approach aircraft, since this is the only way to ensure equality in air transport."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Thank you, Mr President."
"Obviously I have listened very carefully to everything that has been said."
"I would first like to thank Mrs Jensen sincerely for her report;"
"I see that it has earned a great deal of support from the House."
"Mrs Jensen, we will use your observations, which I found extremely interesting, to best advantage."
"I wish to add that, as a number of speakers said, air transport is developing at a rapid pace, and even though in certain cases high-speed rail transport may take up part of the market share, air transport is a means of travel that will continue to evolve in years to come: I think that this is certainly the case."
"We must, then, go along with this development in air transport, and actually increasingly adapt it to the needs and wishes of users."
"I would also say that in the main the entire problem of better adaptation of airport infrastructures to our needs depends on three issues."
"The first issue is obviously the infrastructure."
"Evidently, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I cannot let it be said that the solution is to centralise."
"It is not a matter of centralising, but rather of coordinating and exchanging good practices."
"I think all this is essential for all our citizens, and so we must make an attempt to optimise use of existing infrastructures before we can think of new investment."
"What we need is better coordination and, Mr President, I wish to thank the various committees that delivered an opinion on this matter: the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, the Committee on Regional Development, and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs."
"I feel that all of their contributions shed some much-needed light on the report."
"The first issue, then, is infrastructure."
"The second, as Mrs Ayala rightly stressed, is the use of satellite navigation technology, the modernisation of air traffic control, and this is essential."
"If we have functional groups for air traffic control, we will actually have a chance of reducing delays and planes going round and round in the sky unable to land."
"This second issue is extremely important."
"The third concerns ground handling services, which must be effective and productive."
"On the basis of these three issues, we must try to optimise the facilities connected with air transport, which is a rapidly developing sector."
"I intend to answer a few questions, Mr President, and I do apologise for not answering them all."
"I wish to reply to Mr Bradbourn's question on data."
"Concerning the tags: use of these is restricted to the terminal area, there is no recording of data and, most importantly, the tags are used in full compliance with the common rules governing the protection of personal information."
"There is no question of creating an exception to these rules."
"In relation to your Committee on Regional Development, Mr Janowski, obviously major hubs cannot grow infinitely."
"What is required is better use of existing capacities."
"The role of regional airports will be enhanced."
"You also insisted, and rightly so, on airport connections in their own region, their 'interland', through a number of rapid means of transport, especially rail transport."
"Some of you asked me about ground handling."
"Obviously today, as Mr Jarzembowski said, we cannot commit a new directive to cover ground handling services, since we have not yet received the impact analysis, and we prefer to focus on applying the existing Directive."
"We are therefore focusing on monitoring proper application of the existing Directive."
"In relation to the new Member States, we have requested precise information on an airport-by-airport basis in relation to the number of providers, their dependence on the airport and the conditions for the award of contracts, and if we are not satisfied with the replies we can always invoke the infringement proceedings that apply in such cases."
"I must also say that, if we were in fact compelled to change this directive on ground handling services, we would pay close attention to the social effects of changes to the rules."
"Some mention has also been made - by your Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs - of the need for better use of infrastructures at night with quieter planes."
"I would be tempted to say yes, but in the medium and long term."
"We have not come that far yet."
"I wish to finish by mentioned the environmental problems: as air traffic develops we must evidently do all we can to ensure that it does not impede our fight against global warming."
"This is why Europe has adopted quite an avant-garde approach by supporting the idea of making air transport join the emissions trading system."
"As far as airport infrastructures are concerned, we are also worried about all the problems that may be caused here, particularly the nuisance value for local residents and noise levels."
"Mr President, such a productive debate has not enabled me to find answers for everything but, as a number of speakers said, obviously Mrs Jensen's report forms an excellent basis on which to build."
"I will follow Parliament's requests with great interest in an attempt to provide an appropriate response."
"I might also say that in any case I am glad to have worked in close cooperation with the EP for the benefit of our citizens."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at voting time, to be held in a few minutes."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (HU) It is common knowledge that the environmental damage that goes with flying, excluding the emission of greenhouse gases, largely originates in take-off, landing and taxiing."
"This primarily hits the area around airports and those who live there."
"Their demands for reducing airport traffic are justified."
"On the other hand, flying is part of our everyday life, and our way of life has changed with its having become accessible to those on low incomes, pensioners and students."
"Even the European Union could not work if we could not get from Budapest, Athens or Helsinki to Brussels in a matter of hours."
"The solution is therefore to reorganise airport traffic in an environmentally conscious way."
"Unnecessarily long taxiing of aircraft on the ground and circling for a long time over airports must be stopped."
"Pollution of the area around airports would be greatly reduced if millions of passengers used the train or metro system to reach the airport instead of cars."
"Railway and metro lines to airports must therefore be built in parallel with airport development, and no new international airport should be built without suitable rail links."
"in writing. - (RO) The tremendous increase in air traffic intensifies problems related to congestion in airports and overloads the traffic control systems."
"There are big problems caused by the fragmentation of the European airspace, which causes delays and inefficiency."
"The big airports are ever closer to the maximum limit of their capacities, some of them have already reached it and, under the present conditions, it is hard to believe that new airlines could enter the market."
"Nevertheless, through efficient management and integrated development, we could ensure equitable and undiscriminating access of all existent and potential operators to airport infrastructures."
"Solving these problems requires a long-term strategic approach, especially for building new capacities or extending the existent ones."
"For this reason, it is very important to coordinate national and cross-border initiatives in order to optimize the existent capacities, improve the framework for building new airport infrastructures, develop new technical solutions, promote co-modalities by interconnecting various modes of transport and ensure safe transport by complying with all the legal provisions regarding security and environmental protection."
"The extension of airport capacities is inevitable and should mandatorily be correlated with solid regulations on noise reduction, as well as on reduction of aircraft emissions."

"rapporteur. - Madam President, I would just like to make a clarification, because several different terms are used in the report and in the amendments, and I would like everybody to know what we are going to vote on."
"There are a number of amendments by Mr Tajani and others which, when speaking about 'citizens', have in mind national citizens and not European citizens."
"When voting one way or the other on those amendments, please bear in mind that they are not talking about European citizens, but national citizens."
"I am sure everybody understands that this is an important difference."
"Thank you for your clarification."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like some clarification from the rapporteurs and Parliamentary officials."
"I wish to know whether, if Amendment 1, first signatory Mr Mayor Oreja, were to be adopted, Amendment 51 would fall."
"I think this is a mistake, and that if Amendment 1 by Mr Mayor Oreja were to be adopted, Amendment 51 would not fall, but it would change the voting intention of the Italian delegation."
"Mr Tajani, one of the co-rapporteurs will speak on that matter when we get to that point."
"I think you are right but, for the moment, let us proceed."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to point out that, ever since Maastricht, European citizenship has coincided with national citizenship in all of the Treaties."
"They are the very same, identical thing."
"Is that fact clear to my colleague Mr Severin?"

"(The vote was suspended again for a few moments)"
"(FR) Madam President, we have no roll-call vote for the other reports."
"Perhaps we could begin by voting on the reports that do not require a roll-call vote, if you do not mind, so that we can keep the sitting moving?"

"- Before the vote on Amendment 1:"
"rapporteur. - (FR) Madam President, I do apologise to everyone for the question due to my inexperience: this is only my third term in the House."
"If I have understood correctly, if Amendment 1 were adopted this would retain the text in the paragraph of the amendment and remove the figures corresponding to the number of seats in the report."
"Is this how I should take it?"
"I am asking the authors of the amendment: is that the way everyone understands it?"
"This means I have made a mistake, and therefore I apologise to those involved."
"I recommended a positive vote when drawing up the PPE-DE voting list, because I thought that the amendment concerned only the text."
"However, where figures are concerned, for the PPE-DE Group the instruction changes to a free vote, and along with my co-rapporteur I invite all those who wish to support the proposals of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the rapporteurs to vote against Amendment 1."
"(Applause)"
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is still not clear whether Amendment 1 is compatible with Amendment 51."
"If Amendment 1 is compatible with Amendment 51, as I believe it is, the Italian delegation will vote in favour of Amendment 1, but we do need this clarification."
"This amendment will dispose of all the others."

"Explanations of vote"
"in writing. - (PT) The harmonisation and reliability of data and information collected on marine activities is of critical importance for the fisheries sector and all efforts undertaken to improve their quality should be supported."
"Given the sector's current needs and ecosystem concerns, the European Commission has proposed that Council Regulation (EC) No 1543/2000 be amended while the European Parliament assesses a proposal for a Council regulation on a new Community framework for the collection, management and use of data in the fisheries sector."
"It is therefore necessary to amend the existing Council Regulation (EC) No 1543/2000 in order to prevent an overlap between the old and the new regulations."
"The current Commission proposal makes these necessary and logical changes and was unanimously approved by the Committee on Fisheries."
"It also now merits my vote in favour in plenary."
"in writing. - I voted for this report, which approves a Commission proposal amending (and preparing for the repeal of) Regulation 1543/2000 (a Community framework for the collection and management of the data needed to conduct the common fisheries policy)."
"The Commission aims to bring in a new, more comprehensive data collection regulation in 2008; this amendment allows for a better transition by removing current requirements to submit six-year national programmes for the collection and management of data from 2007 to 2012."
"Instead, transitional programmes covering the years 2007 and 2008 are to be drawn up."
"in writing. - UKIP wish to see the common agricultural policy abolished."
"Therefore, under no circumstances can we vote for a report that gives even more power to a Commission whose legitimacy we do not recognise."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted for the Chatzimarkakis report, which seeks to improve the CAP's budgetary execution and transparency, in other words to identify the beneficiaries of aid for agriculture."
"I feel the legitimacy of the CAP, one of the largest items of EU expenditure, is all too often called into question by the opacity with which agricultural aid is managed."
"The merit of this report is that it clarifies the situation."
"I am most satisfied by the Internet postings of all the national lists of direct beneficiaries of EU aid, and the links to be set up between the web pages of the Commission and the Member State payment bodies."
"Monitoring of CAP financing, however, must be carried out in strict compliance with the regulations governing data protection."
"That is why I voted against the amendments requiring the registration or recording of users consulting the data, since transparency must be guaranteed on both sides."
"I also believe that the data on the payments of the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development ought to be broken down in order to identify the major beneficiaries."
"in writing. - (PT) We regard as essential the need expressed in the Commission proposal, and highlighted in the parliamentary report, to increase transparency, both in the financing of the common agricultural policy and in the provision of accounts in respect of the expenditure practices of the EU institutions."
"It is also essential to improve budgetary control."
"However, we are disappointed at the proposal's limited scope and the fact that the European Parliament has not been ambitious enough in either its report or its amendments."
"In our opinion, there are still some proposals of no practical use which in fact limit the freedoms and guarantees of citizens, such as the requirement for 'those using, or looking at, the data [on the Internet to] sign on or register'."
"In addition, there is some ambiguity, both in the Commission's proposal and in the EP's report, with regard to the continued publication of information."
"It is proposed, from the start, to carry out 'an assessment of the advantages or otherwise of the publication of this data' in the future."
"Another debatable issue is the reinforcement of the Commission's power of control over the Member States."
"Finally, we consider that the best way of enhancing 'transparency and public understanding of the common agricultural policy' - an objective expressed in the proposal - is through its complete overhaul."
"in writing. - (PT) The Commission's proposal to make certain amendments to Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy (CAP) is necessary in order to make this process more transparent."
"I believe that improved transparency, together with better use of the agricultural funds, would help to eliminate the European population's distrust of the CAP and the European institutions."
"I am therefore voting in favour of Mr Chatzimarkakis's report, which reiterates the Commission's position and adds certain amendments that I regard as important."
"in writing. - I voted for this report, which proposes a range of improvements to the transparency of the CAP."
"It calls on national lists of recipients of EU direct farm aid to be published on the internet."
"The UK already does this, and I would like to see other states doing the same."
"The report also calls for better procedures to take when publication requirements are not followed, and for data protection to be included in the Commission regulation itself."
"in writing. - (DE) Across the board, our small farmers, who are the salt of the earth, are being submerged in a sea of irrelevant bureaucracy and subjected to satellite surveillance, and woe betide them if their fence is standing a little too far to the right or the left."
"It is time for some humanity again, instead of beating our hardworking small farmers senseless with bureaucratic cudgels."
"The black sheep who fabricate entire fields and business activities and who cause BSE and other scandals should be named and shamed."
"It is a mockery, however, to say that prices are rising so this could justify cutting subsidies."
"Austrian organic farmers were getting around seven schillings - equivalent to around 95 cent - per litre of milk before accession."
"Today, they get just 30 cent, which means that they are losing thousands of euros, and at the same time they are having to contend with ever-changing bureaucratic regulations that make their lives even more difficult!"
"The 'health check' envisaged must therefore serve only one purpose: to create a better, more reliable and longer-lasting framework, not to bring about reform by brute force and cause our last remaining farmers to throw in the towel."
"In view of the massive exodus from farming in Europe, the idea that unspent agricultural funding could be used for prestige projects such as Galileo must be vigorously rejected."
"We must retain our self-sufficiency capacity at all costs, and should not offer ourselves as hostages to fortune to the genetic engineering companies."
"in writing. - (SV) Jorgo Chatzimarkaki's report further reinforces the Commission's initiative to increase the legitimacy of EU policies through disclosure of full details of expenditure practices and improved accounting and budgetary control in the agricultural sector, among other things as a result of a number of changes."
"I supported the parts of the report that sought to enhance public transparency regarding the use of Community funds and the publication of information on beneficiaries."
"I likewise supported the need for Member States to ensure annual ex-post publication, via the Internet, of the beneficiaries of the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and the amounts received per beneficiary under each of these Funds."
"However, I opposed the provisions under which those using or looking at information are required to sign on or register because this runs counter to the Swedish principle of the right to anonymity in connection with the use of such public information."
"My intentions to vote against Amendment 20 in view of the strong Swedish principle of public access to official documents have been entered in the minutes, after a vote on my behalf was cast incorrectly."
"in writing. - UKIP abstained on this report as we do not recognise the legitimacy of Parliament."
"This in no way reflects our views on the content of the report."
"UKIP wish to see the common agricultural policy abolished."
"Therefore, under no circumstances can we vote for a report that gives even more power to a Commission whose legitimacy we do not recognise."
"in writing. - (PT) The negotiations conducted by the European Commission under a mandate received from the Council have the central objective of establishing an Open Aviation Area (OAA) between the EU and the US, going beyond the bilateral agreements that currently exist between individual Member States and the US."
"The aim is to create a single liberalised market for air transport between the EU and the US, 'in which investment could flow freely and in which European and US airlines would be able to provide air services without any restriction, including in the domestic markets of both parties'."
"The EU's aim is to ensure reciprocity by the US in the liberalisation of air transport, in particular with regard to removing 'the existing legal restrictions on foreign ownership and control of US airlines and on cabotage' and also with regard to the 'right of establishment' and 'State aid'."
"This is why we reiterate that it should be the Member States and not the Community concluding this type of agreement, all the more so as this issue is of such strategic importance and 'could serve as a model for further liberalisation and regulatory convergence worldwide'."
"We therefore restate our opposition to the pursuit of the liberalisation of this important public service in each country."
"in writing. - (PL) I voted in favour of the report on the proposal for a decision of the Council and the representatives of the governments of the Member States of the European Union, meeting within the Council, on the conclusion and temporary implementation of the Air Transport Agreement between the European Community and its Member States, on the one hand, and the United States of America, on the other hand (8044/3/2007 - - C6-0210/2007 -."
"Mr El Khadraoui rightly pointed out the importance of creating an Open Aviation Area between the EU and the US, thus allowing the emergence of a single market for air transport between the EU and the US."
"I support the view that this would enable investment to flow freely and EU and US airlines to provide air services without any restriction, including in the domestic markets of both parties."
"That represents a mayor step forward."
"It was entirely appropriate to raise the issue of environmental protection in this context."
"The aviation sector has several negative environmental effects, in particular as a source of noise and as a contributor to climate change."
"I therefore agree with the provision calling on both the EU and the US to take effective measures to reduce the negative environmental impact of aviation."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this report, which endorses plans to liberalise air transport arrangements between the EU and the United States of America."
"This levels the playing field for European airlines flying to the US, and should allow more rational construction of routes, leading to better services and more efficient routing of flights."
"In increasing the number of possible transatlantic routes it may even lead to lower fares for passengers."
"in writing. - (PT) The conclusion of this agreement is intended to meet long-standing needs on both sides of the Atlantic, with obvious benefits for consumers resulting from further liberalisation and regulatory convergence worldwide."
"For the EU, it will also serve to guarantee compliance with Community legislation."
"The work carried out to conclude this agreement must therefore be applauded as the new legal framework ensures wide-ranging agreement on the creation of an integrated transatlantic aviation market that will be to the benefit of both consumers and companies."
"However, on reading this agreement, it is apparent that the removal of restrictions on foreign control of US airlines is somewhat disproportionate and, in addition, cabotage has not been included."
"The European Parliament's suggestion to include subsequent stages, deadlines for conclusion and consequences of any non-compliance in this phased approach to the agreement is therefore crucial and should be applauded."
"Furthermore, conditions have been laid down for re-establishing full reciprocity in the EU-US aviation market if the negotiations do not achieve the balance desired by both parties."
"To sum up, this is a good start towards objectives not yet achieved."
"in writing. - I am convinced that there is a need for such an agreement but it has to be one which can be delivered on both sides."
"Airports in south-east England have had to open 'aircraft slots' for USA partner airlines and potentially many others."
"The reverse is not true in the USA."
"'Freedom rights' are not granted to EU airlines for intra-USA flights."
"This means that flights emanating from Gatwick to New York cannot fly to Los Angeles, but USA flights to Gatwick can fly to anywhere they want in the EU."
"Similarly, there is no relaxation of the foreign ownership rules of USA airlines."
"There is a clear lack of balance in the first stage agreement; this lack of balance against the EU has to be addressed urgently in the second stage negotiations."
"I will be looking to reinforce this effort within the Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue."
"(NL) Madam President, I am not going to go over yesterday's debate again."
"I explained then that for us the Lamassoure report is tantamount to putting the cart before the horse, as we still do not have a valid transitional treaty, we still do not have a new treaty."
"The problem with this report it that it lets loose the typical Loch Ness monster of the Eurofederalists again, that is the spectre of transnational lists, on the basis of which some Members of the European Parliament would be elected."
"Well then, I still proceed from the assumption that we here are representatives of our electorates in the Member States, of our populations in the Member States, and not just abstract citizens of the European Union."
"(PL) Madam President, I believe a house should be built upwards from its foundations, not the other way round, which is effectively what the report by Mr Lamassoure and Mr Severin is doing."
"The Treaty on European Union constitutes the foundations."
"The Treaty must first be ratified, and I believe ratification is to take place within the next few weeks."
"That is one reason why I voted against this report, even though it contains many good points."
"Another reason why I voted against it is that I do not agree with my country being represented by as many as three fewer Members than it currently is."
"The number of Polish Members would be reduced from 54 to 51."
"These are my reasons for voting against the report."
"(ES) Actually, yesterday I submitted my explanation of vote in writing and I received a response to the effect that it was still being dealt with, and so on."
"That is one thing."
"However, my name is Irujo Amezaga."
"'Amenaza' means something completely different in Spanish: it means 'threat' and I am do not think I am that just yet."
"In any case, my explanation of vote was on the Lamassoure report."
"I voted against this report and I acknowledge that the composition of the European Parliament is a difficult issue."
"My amendment on supra-state constituencies that recognised political and cultural realities and went beyond the borders of the current Member States was rejected in committee."
"If we really want a Union of the European people, as stated in the EC Treaty, this Parliament should be open to other types of realities."
"I am sorry for my pronunciation - my Spanish lessons are continuing."
"in writing. - In regard to the future composition of the European Parliament, I voted against the unwarranted attempt (Amendment 26) to inflate the representation of the Republic of Ireland to 13 MEPs."
"Northern Ireland has a population of 1.7 million and three MEPs; the Republic of Ireland's population is 4.3 million, yet under Amendment 26 it would have 13 MEPs, meaning a representative for every 330 000 citizens, whereas in Northern Ireland the ratio is one MEP to every 630 000 citizens."
"Clearly, the Republic of Ireland already is very generously provided for and should count itself lucky to hold 12 seats."
"in writing. - (SV) We Swedish Social Democrats voted in favour of the report."
"We believe that the principle of degressive proportionality is reasonable and has good chances of being supported by the EU's Heads of State and Government."
"The other proposals that have been put forward have no realistic chance of being accepted at the summit."
"The report gives Sweden 20 seats rather than the 18 we would get if the Treaty of Nice were to apply."
"It is therefore important for the treaty to be adopted."
"Otherwise the Treaty of Nice will apply, which would mean that all the Member States except Germany would lose seats."
"The questions of how to define the concept of citizen and how to work out the population base governing the distribution of seats must be investigated."
"We are very doubtful about trans-national lists for European Parliament elections."
"If the matter is investigated, however, we may accept it."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted for the report by my colleagues Alain Lamassoure and Adrian Severin on the composition of the European Parliament."
"They both knew that the current EP composition, established by the 2005 Act of Accession of Bulgaria and Romania, was to be modified, even if that meant going back to the provisions of the Treaty of Nice."
"I applaud Alain Lamassoure's bid to rally his political family and regret that a number of national attitudes in disagreement with the Council decisions required some awkward debate, and eventually arbitration in plenary."
"This debate has highlighted the extent of national selfishness in some cases."
"Although I have my reservations about the idea of examining the possibility of electing some Members on transnational lists, I am happy with Annex 2 of the resolution, which requires the IGC to ask Parliament for a draft providing for the election of its Members by direct universal suffrage that provides a more accurate definition of the notion of 'citizens' in Article 9(a)(2) of the Treaty on the EU."
"The concept of a European citizen must certainly be defined."
"in writing. - I voted against Amendment 25 because, while the UK is still a member of the EU, the number of MEPs representing the UK should not be reduced at all."
"Therefore, to vote in favour of 74 MEPs would have been to vote for a reduction of four."
"Under the proposed principle of 'degressive proportionality', which is yet to be defined, small countries and microstates would be disproportionately represented while larger states, such as the UK, would be under-represented."
"Considering that large numbers of the population of Eastern Europe have migrated to the UK since 2004, and that they are currently entitled to vote in European Parliament elections, the number of UK MEPs should at least remain at its current 78, if not be increased."
"in writing. - During the vote on the Lamassoure report we have voted consistently for a fair distribution of seats between the Member States and in particular for 13 seats for Ireland."
"We campaigned throughout this process for 13 seats for our country."
"The arguments in favour are well known."
"We have a rapidly growing population in Ireland - it is the fastest-growing population in Europe, both in terms of natural increase in population as well as overall growth."
"We were also one of the biggest losers proportionally under the Nice Treaty in terms of seats in the European Parliament."
"Unfortunately the Irish Government did little to support the campaign to retain our current allocation of 13 seats."
"Our vote today will at least ensure that Ireland's allocation of seats will not fall below 12 for the next mandate, with provision for a full review before 2014 including on the vexed question of the use of a 'population vs. citizen' statistical basis for assessing the MEP allocation in Member States."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted for the Lamassoure report on the distribution of EP seats after the legislative elections in 2009."
"The new distribution balances out the number of seats in accordance with population trends in the Member States."
"I am glad that France has two more MEPs than those envisaged by the revised Treaty of Nice."
"I also support the idea that the new distribution ought to be reviewed well in advance of the 2014-2019 parliamentary term in order to ensure a fair and objective system for the distribution of seats in Parliament, taking account of population changes, which would prevent the usual log-rolling between Member States."
"in writing. - (PT) The Members elected by the Social Democratic Party (SDP), although they consider that this is not a perfect solution and that it fails to impose a requirement for further negotiations in the context of future enlargements, support Mr Lamassoure's report on the composition of the European Parliament for three reasons:"
"1."
"Some Member States do not agree with simply defining the general principles and require, as a condition of approval, the strict definition of the EP's composition before they will accept the Reform Treaty."
"This could compromise the main priority of the Portuguese Presidency of the Council."
"2."
"Mr Lamassoure has proposed a balanced compromise solution, which provides for a minimum limit guaranteeing the plurality of the representation of the smaller states and which takes account of the demographic size of the other states through a principle of degressive proportionality, ensuring a fair relationship between the states."
"3."
"It therefore blocks the unacceptable attempts of the German, Polish, Spanish and Italian Members to reinforce the weight of the more populous states by reducing the representation of the medium-sized states such as Portugal."
"in writing. - I have to express my disquiet about the principle embodied in the very notion of presenting this report to plenary."
"Having a Parliament determine the basis of its own composition seems to me to be fundamentally flawed."
"As one of my Irish colleagues said in the debate, 'Turkeys don't vote for Christmas'."
"I have been a Member of this House since 1984, when we had 434 Members, and now we have 785 Members."
"With each successive growth in numbers of parliamentarians, working groups, committees and plenaries have become unwieldy and increasingly ineffective."
"This is to be institutionalised here with a supposed 'reduction' to 750 Members, a size 30-40% too large to be effective, unless we want to model ourselves on China's largely ornamental 3 000-strong National People's Congress."
"The other anomaly that strikes me is that, while we are allowed to select our composition, a vitally important institutional decision for the whole of the European institutions and the Union itself, we are not allowed to choose our own meeting place because of the recalcitrance of one Member State and instead are 'sold a pup' by the City of Strasbourg that is riddled with asbestos."
"in writing. - (PL) I am sorry it has not proved possible to find a new and permanent solution for the distribution of seats in the European Parliament between the various Member States of the Union."
"The current method of distribution is temporary, and only applies to the next parliamentary term."
"The method applied for distribution of seats is not clear and comprehensible to EU citizens."
"In addition to application of the principle of degressive proportionality, political criteria also had a significant bearing on the distribution of seats in Parliament."
"This was detrimental to representation of the citizens, which should actually be the governing principle."
"Furthermore, the proposed distribution of seats is based on the number of inhabitants of a given Member State, rather than on the number of citizens of the state concerned."
"My country, Poland, for example, would therefore lose out due to the temporary economic migration of some two million of its citizens who are currently employed in other Member States of the Union."
"Incidentally, it should also be pointed out that this is illogical, since the EU encourages worker mobility."
"We would like to reiterate our warning that the principles by which the Union is governed appear overly complicated to its citizens."
"The latter are therefore feeling more and more misgivings about the Union's institutions."
"in writing. - (SV) We are firmly opposed to the idea of one constituency across the entire EU with perhaps 10% of the European Parliament's seats."
"Creating a separate EU constituency is an artificial way to try to create a European demos."
"There is no common political arena in Europe with media or debate covering all the Member States."
"Each country has its own political agenda."
"An attempt to break barriers of language and tradition by creating EU parties, entirely dependent on EU contributions, is doomed to failure."
"We recall that 54.4% of voters stayed at home in the 2004 European Parliament elections."
"The 'stay-at-home party' is the biggest party in the European Parliament elections."
"There is no enthusiasm for European Parliament elections in the new Member States either."
"In Slovakia the turn-out was 16.96% in 2004."
"With any enlargement of the EU to countries such as Ukraine and Turkey the present Member States will have their delegations cut back."
"This affects the smaller groups and reduces political diversity."
"There will be no place for regional parties or minority parties in the European Parliament."
"Both the Christian Democrats/Conservatives (PPE-DE) and the Socialists (PSE) would seem to have a hidden agenda of trying to create a two-party system in the European Parliament."
"We are voting in favour of the report, not because it is excellent, but because it represents an improvement."
"in writing. - (PT) We must be clear on this as there are many numbers:"
"1."
"This proposal means that, since 1999, Portugal has firstly gone from 25 to 24 Members and will now be reduced to 22, whereas Germany kept its 99 Members, which will now be reduced to 96."
"In other words, Portugal has lost 12% and Germany has lost 3%."
"2."
"The six most populous countries currently hold around 56% of the seats in the European Parliament."
"With this proposal their control is fully maintained at 56%."
"In other words, they have given nothing."
"Therefore, through the current reform of the Treaties, the major powers are reasserting their control over the Council, by applying the demographic criterion without any weighting, and are maintaining their full control over the EP."
"Portugal is losing out!"
"If some are in control, others must be..."
"In order to conceal their connivance with such an unacceptable situation, some are saying that it could be worse."
"Others think that it is natural that only some countries should be able to defend their interests..., at the expense of the interests of others."
"Finally, but without forgetting other important aspects - such as the rejection of the creation of a supranational electoral body or the fact that the fewer Members Portugal has, the less they will represent the political plurality existing in our country - we reiterate that a fair solution at institutional level must without question respect the principle of cooperation between sovereign states with equal rights."
"in writing. - I am voting for Amendment 26, which argues that Ireland should retain the 13 seats it currently has."
"Under the Nice Treaty, Ireland was allocated 12 seats; however, since the Nice Treaty, Ireland's population has increased by 12%."
"It is the fastest-growing population in the EU, in terms of national increase and overall growth."
"This report gives Ireland an allocation of 12 seats - three less than the 15 that Ireland had for the 1999-2004 term, which means we will lose 20% of our quota from 2004."
"in writing. - British Conservatives are opposed to the EU Constitution and to the draft EU Reform Treaty."
"We do not agree with the terms of the draft IGC mandate delivered by the European Council or the text of the draft Treaty published on 5 October."
"In the context of the request by the Council for an opinion by the European Parliament on the future composition of the European Parliament, British Conservatives have abstained on the Lamassoure-Severin Report."
"We have done so because we disagree with the model and methodology proposed by the co-rapporteurs, which we believe is unsustainable in the long term."
"We also disagree with the call for the election of MEPs on transnational lists."
"We also deeply regret the fact that the important historical parity on this issue that existed between the UK, France and Italy has been abandoned."
"We are nonetheless determined to pursue the best interests of the people of the United Kingdom who we believe are currently numerically under-represented in the European Parliament."
"These factors have determined our position in voting on this report."
"in writing. - (FR) How can a report be submitted to the representatives of Member States using legal and institutional notions that are simultaneously hazy, new, dangerous and utopian?"
"Degressive proportionality, the main feature of the report, means nothing beyond the fact that larger states will again lose seats to smaller states."
"It is true that at the European Council meeting in Nice Mr Chirac originally initiated the process by agreeing for the first time to uncouple France with respect to Germany, contrary to the spirit of the Treaties."
"As for electing Members from transnational lists, it is obvious what the aim is here: to get rid of politically incorrect parties that do not accept the languid social-democrat consensus, and to remove any reference to anything that is still the regal domain of the nation states."
"We obviously cannot accept this."
"The notion of European citizen put forward by the rapporteurs is both dangerous and utopian, and in fact it is totalitarian."
"It implies that nationality is a thing of the past and that the brave new world consists of a new 'denationalised' man, bereft of his roots, his history and his culture."
"For all these reasons, we feel that the Lamassoure report is an unacceptable legal, political and institutional regression."
"The distribution of seats in Parliament between the Member States is not based on objective population figures but on promises made in the past and on negotiations that have been won or lost."
"That is why the large countries - France, Italy and the United Kingdom - always have the same number of seats despite having different populations, as do Spain and Poland."
"The same applies to Greece, Portugal, Belgium, the Czech Republic and Hungary."
"Some countries are underrepresented, such as the Netherlands, which was foolish enough in 2000 to settle for fewer seats in Parliament in exchange for more votes in the Council."
"We support the rapporteurs' proposal because it is closer to a fair distribution than previous proposals."
"We reject all the amendments that want a less fair distribution, no matter who they favour, or that make a distinction between 'citizens' and other inhabitants when calculating the population of each country."
"We support the amendments that automatically couple the future distribution of seats to the populations of the Member States."
"We reject future reductions in the number of seats per Member State if they do not result from population decrease, but from the maximum of 750 seats or from the search for scope to elect a proportion of Members from transnational lists."
"With that proviso we vote in favour."
"in writing. - I voted for and welcome the Lamassoure-Severin Report on the composition of the European Parliament."
"However, I find it rather strange that Parliament has the right to decide on the distribution of its seats but not on where it sits."
"It is clear that the Council is incapable of sorting out the mess of Parliament having three locations and I call on it to follow the logic of giving Parliament the right to allocate its seats by giving it the right to decide where it meets."
"This report recommends a new, fairer composition for the European Parliament to apply to the 2009-2014 Parliament."
"The report's operating principle of degressive proportionality, which calls for bigger Member States to accept fewer MEPs than a strict proportional distribution would allow, is one I agree with."
"It will ensure that smaller Member States have viable parliamentary delegations, and that Parliament can return to a slightly more reasonable size of 750."
"in writing. - (PT) Given the need to alter the composition of the European Parliament due to past and future enlargements, I believe that the solution adopted in this report has the virtues of being consistent with what has already been agreed (Nice), of not increasing the control of the most populous states over the others, by maintaining a model of balance between states which is quite understandable, and of helping to reduce the difficulties associated with the adoption of the Reform Treaty."
"Therefore, despite having preferred, as apparent from the voting, a model based on the concept of citizenship and not residence - given that the link between citizens and the European Union must be one of citizenship and not residence - I voted in favour of this report."
"in writing. - Today's vote was crucial for the future working of the EP."
"It was necessary to have, on such a sensitive issue, a firm political indication from the EP towards the European Council, showing that national interests can be overcome to agree on a better system than the one laid down by the Nice Treaty."
"Even if the proposal made today is far from being perfect, it is fairer than the distribution of seats laid down by the Nice Treaty."
"After the EP unanimously called on the Council to define the term 'citizens' as provided in Article 9a(2) in good time before the next elections in 2014, I decided, in the interest of my country and the working of the EP, to vote in favour of the report, as this shows some progress in relation to what had been agreed upon before."
"in writing. - (SV) The importance of the issue should not be overestimated."
"A new distribution of Members among the Member States will not change the current developments in the EU."
"The majority will continue to remain with the economic liberals and federalists in Parliament."
"However, the report clearly expresses principles governing a distribution that by its nature will be approximate in the final analysis."
"The distribution will be even better than the current situation, as the biggest country gets fewer members whilst the smallest ones get more."
"I therefore voted in favour of the report, even though there are individual paragraphs that I do not support, in particular the provisions on trans-national lists and European parties."
"The Greek Communist Party in the European Parliament voted against the Lamassoure-Severin report because it further strengthens the confrontational nature of the European Parliament."
"in writing. - I voted against Amendment 25 because, while the UK is still a member of the EU, the number of MEPs representing the UK should not be reduced at all."
"Therefore, to vote in favour of 74 MEPs would have been to vote for a reduction of four."
"Under the proposed principle of 'degressive proportionality', which is yet to be defined, small countries and microstates would be disproportionately represented while larger states, such as the UK, would be under-represented."
"Considering that large numbers of the population of Eastern Europe have migrated to the UK since 2004, and that they are currently entitled to vote in European Parliamentary elections, the number of UK MEPs should at least remain at its current 78, if not be increased."
"in writing. - (SV) Sweden should hold a referendum on the new constitution in order to obtain exceptions and an 'opt-in' clause (like the United Kingdom)."
"With such an opt-in clause, for example, Sweden gets the right to decide itself whether, and if so when, to introduce the euro and to sign up to the Social Charter."
"However, this does not mean that I do not want a clear document as the basis for the EU which plainly defines the EU's field of competence."
"Such a document must contain, among other things, rules on the distribution of seats in Parliament."
"I am therefore prepared to support this part of the proposal for a new EU constitution specifically relating to the distribution of seats."
"The fact is that unless the proposal on the distribution of seats comes into being in accordance with the proposal for a new EU constitution, there is a great risk that we will have to go back to the Treaty of Nice."
"The consequence of the Treaty of Nice is that Sweden gets only 18 seats, two fewer than Sweden gets under the proposal for a new EU constitution, and two fewer than Sweden is entitled to given the relative sizes of the EU Member States."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted for the resolution on the humanitarian situation in Gaza."
"I am concerned by the deterioration of health indicators in Palestine and aware of the difficulties posed by closure of border control posts, thereby curtailing economic activity and free circulation of goods, and I request that emergency and humanitarian aid be allowed to continue unhindered."
"I condemn the increasingly difficult living conditions that are rife in Gaza: the blockade preventing the movement of people and goods, partial privatisation of access to water, food and electricity, destruction of agricultural land, and basic services such as refuse collection that no longer operate properly and are on the point of collapse."
"I feel it is urgent for human rights to be fully respected in Gaza, and I wish to call for an international peace conference to be organised to usher in a fair and lasting peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians; a peace based on the relevant UN Security Council Resolutions concerning the Israelis' right to live within secure recognised borders and the Palestinians' right to a viable state."
"in writing. - I support this resolution."
"The current humanitarian situation in Gaza can only cause deep concern."
"The Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip must be lifted and electricity and fuel must be supplied."
"Also, Israel must guarantee the flow of financial assets to the Gaza Strip suspended since September 2007, the lack of which has seriously impacted the economic, social and daily life of the Palestinian people."
"The Council and the Commission must use all the pressure they can exert to persuade the Israeli Government to move and to guarantee future essential humanitarian aid for the Palestinian people."
"in writing. - (PT) Given the terrible situation in which the Palestinian people have been put, the European Parliament has adopted a resolution which, while recognising the extremely serious situation not only in the Gaza Strip but also in the other Palestinian occupied territories, does not hold Israel liable or condemn it for its deep-rooted responsibility, particularly for the destruction of the Palestinian National Authority and its supporting institutions and infrastructures, including those meeting the most basic needs of the population, and for seeking to prevent the creation of a sovereign, independent and viable Palestinian State."
"Israel has imposed a brutal blockade on the Gaza Strip, thus creating, as denounced a long time ago by UN officials, a gigantic prison for the Palestinian people, depriving them of the most fundamental human rights and preventing the provision of humanitarian aid by UN organisations."
"It is imperative that this inhumane blockade be lifted, with Israel being ordered to end its aggression towards the Palestinian people and to fully respect and comply with international law and UN resolutions."
"It is also vital for urgent humanitarian aid to be provided to the Palestinian people."
"A fair and lasting solution for the Middle East will only be achievable through respect for the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to their own independent and sovereign state, respecting the 1967 borders and with East Jerusalem as its capital."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this resolution, which draws attention to the plight of people in the Gaza Strip."
"It calls on Israel to fulfil its international obligations under the Geneva Conventions to guarantee the flow of humanitarian aid, humanitarian assistance and essential services, such as electricity and fuel, to the Gaza Strip."
"In calling for an international peace conference, an end to the blockade, and in asking for the Commission and the Council to work towards this, I join most other MEPs in advancing ideas that can make the situation on the ground better for those suffering the consequences of the status quo."
"in writing. - (FR) I welcome the EP resolution on the Gaza Strip."
"The measure taken by the Israeli Government to declare the Gaza Strip a 'hostile entity' paves the way for economic sanctions."
"This measure comes at a time when the Gaza Strip is plunged into a humanitarian crisis, aggravated by the suspension of direct international aid to the Palestinian Authority and Israel's failure to pay back taxes outstanding to the Palestinian Authority since March 2006."
"Even if the Israeli authorities have allowed food trucks into Gaza, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East reports shortages of basic foodstuffs caused by frequent closures of the Karni border crossing."
"We would not be faced with a humanitarian crisis of such proportions if we had not cut off our aid to the Palestinian people in the first place."
"Many other organisations maintained their cooperation with Palestine, particularly a large number of European local authorities."
"Is it not time we reviewed our policy of sanctions against Palestine so that this does not hinder supplies of the most essential humanitarian aid to the local population?"
"in writing. - I wish to stress the importance of the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip."
"Whilst I accept that the political situation is one that is dictating the plight of the people of Gaza, nevertheless it is the people - men, women and children - who are suffering, and heaven knows what long-term effects this will have."
"I agree that Israel must feel secure in its own borders, but there are also obligations on Israel to ensure that humanitarian aid and assistance are given to the Gaza Strip."
"In Gaza there is a responsibility to end attacks on Israel, and we all have a responsibility to support a viable state for Palestinians, so that the Palestinian people can live securely in peace."
"I support this report because it is absolutely essential at this time that we in the EU make our voice heard on behalf of the people of Gaza."
"They need help and we should deliver."
"in writing. - I wish to support the endeavours of those in this House who have brought to our attention the crucial problems particularly facing those in the Gaza Strip and in the State of Israel and Palestinian areas."
"The only way ahead is to move within the United Nations Security Council resolutions and to convene an international peace conference along these lines."
"(FR) Madam President, they are killed because they are women."
"These murders known as feminicides are caused by a social context influenced by a patriarch mindset that prevents women from becoming socially independent."
"The extremely well balanced report by Mr Romeva, although it refers more specifically to feminicides in Latin America and Mexico, forms part of a global strategy to eradicate and prevent violent deaths of women all over the world."
"That is why I voted in favour: the EU must promote and defend the values of gender equality."
"My amendments, which were in fact taken over by the rapporteur, had focused on support for the victims' families, who are often completely helpless and, to make matters worse, they endure the pain of seeing these murders go unpunished."
"I therefore wish to call for awareness and training programmes dealing with gender problems and for measures to promote the creation of effective protection systems for witnesses, victims and their families, psychological support, and free legal aid."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted for the report by our Spanish colleague Raül Romeva i Rueda on the murder of women, or feminicides, in Central America and Mexico and the role of the EU."
"I am sorry we are focusing here on Central America and Mexico, for there are many places all over the world where the matter of female murders has not been solved."
"I support any global strategy striving to bring about the worldwide eradication of violence against women."
"The suffering of women cannot be treated with indifference, and we must support them because their revolt will be at the root of many geopolitical trends in favour of the ideals promoted by the European Union, notably gender equality."
"in writing. - UKIP abstained on this report because we do not recognise the legitimacy of Parliament."
"This in no way reflects our views on the content of the report."
"in writing. - (PT) We voted in favour of this report, which expresses the European Parliament's solidarity with women suffering violence throughout the world, including in our own countries of the European Union, but with particular emphasis on the serious situation in Mexico and certain Central American countries, where there is a real culture of feminicide, with thousands of violent deaths of women in recent years, which cannot simply be attributed to a widespread climate of violence."
"This situation stems from cultural causes and socioeconomic contexts that are unfavourable to women and is worse in the case of indigenous women who suffer from high levels of economic dependency."
"However, it is also aggravated by the actions of criminal gangs."
"We hope that this report will turn the spotlight on this serious situation and therefore help to ensure that, in the various countries concerned, the necessary steps are taken to end feminicide and violence against women."
"in writing. - (SV) The June List believes that human rights must be upheld in all societies throughout the world, both in the EU Member States and in other countries."
"The report is a motion for a resolution which calls on the Member States and the states concerned to work to uphold women's rights."
"This is a deserving cause, but this is not the right forum in which to discuss the matter."
"As usual, paragraphs are included where the EU seeks to act with a single voice in foreign policy."
"With the report's proposals for new budget headings, campaigns and increased responsibilities the EU is seeking to appropriate more power and to use issues like these as means in that quest."
"Crimes against women are unacceptable and a dialogue between sovereign states to put an end to this is to be welcomed because it is important to improve the vulnerable position of women in much of the world."
"However, the EU must not pursue a single foreign policy and for that reason we chose to vote against this report."
"in writing. - I fully support the report."
"Sustainable development is impossible without taking account of gender equality and the right to dignity and peaceful existence."
"Such crimes should not be viewed as simply an expression of culture; nor should they be dismissed if they are committed against women who may earn their living as sex workers."
"If no serious and consistent efforts are made to investigate, prosecute and punish the perpetrators, this indicates that violence is acceptable and then no one is safe."
"The proposals outlined in the report deserve our support and I trust that Parliament will monitor their progress."
"The human rights dimension of our external policies is extremely important: we have to work for the rights of people to live safely and securely in order to exercise their democratic rights and freedoms at all levels of society and whatever their occupation and status."
"in writing. - The report by Mr Raül Romeva i Rueda on the murder of women in Central America and Mexico and the European Union's role in preventing this is a well balanced report."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work and his engagement."
"He led the negotiations in a very sensitive and positive political style."
"I would also like to thank him for the attention he devoted to this topic."
"Human rights enjoy a high-ranking importance in the European Union."
"Luckily, between the EU and Mexico, human rights topics play an important role; as part of the Free Trade Agreement they even have a kind of formal character and they also play a crucial role in our Joint Parliamentary Delegation, which I have the pleasure to chair and which is now chaired on the Mexican side by Senator José Guadarrama Márquez."
"in writing. - I voted for this report, which I strongly support, and which is part of a global strategy for the eradication and prevention of feminicide and proposes EU actions in the framework of partnership agreements."
"I hope to see this issue taken up by the national governments in the framework of their bilateral relations with the countries of Latin America, and European institutions within their strategic partnership, to support the prevention and protection policies relating to violence."
"in writing. - (DE) I have supported the report by Mr Raül Romeva i Rueda because he clearly identifies, in a few points, the main causes of the murders of women in Mexico and Central America: the murders are occurring unhindered in a social and economic context which is geared solely towards economic interests."
"A high percentage of them have happened in the so-called free trade zones with their maquiladora industry (sub-contractor companies which produce for the export market), in which the absence of a social infrastructure and high poverty rates are accompanied by impunity for semi-legal security forces."
"These structures are reinforced, too, by the EU's relations with Mexico and Central America, with their focus on trade facilitation."
"The EU's Association Agreement with Central America, which is due to be concluded before the end of this year, already shows, in its present form, that the EU is mainly interested in market liberalisation and deregulation."
"However, the 'creation of a climate favourable to trade and investment', as championed by the Commission, leads to precisely the structures which the report rightly identifies as constituting the unfavourable social and economic context that is conducive to the high rate of murders of women."
"The report also sends out an important signal that the human rights clause agreed in the so-called 'Global Agreement' between the EU and Mexico must finally be acted upon."
"The work of the relatives' and victims' associations must also be strengthened."
"in writing. - I voted for this report recommending that, in order to prevent fraud, transit movements be computerised, the legal framework be revised and the Commission and the Member States improve physical checks based on common risk analysis."
"The UK is affected by this issue: up to 4% of potential VAT revenue is being lost to fraud in this area."
"in writing. - (DE) The removal of borders very quickly and demonstrably makes itself felt in a massive decrease in turnover from cigarettes, not only in the border region but in the interior as well."
"Desolate labour market conditions tempt numerous private individuals to smuggle small quantities of tobacco products across the border on foot as a way of boosting their incomes."
"Fantastic profit margins, despite the high transport costs, have also contributed to the massive increase in tobacco smuggling in recent years."
"A practice which is written off as a minor crime in some quarters is providing a livelihood for criminal gangs, and a very good one at that: after all, it is easy to bring these black market products to smokers in the EU."
"The traffickers know that information campaigns are hardly likely to change the situation, for studies have shown that most buyers are well aware of the higher concentration of harmful substances in these products and the risk of penalties being imposed."
"Montenegro's role is especially inglorious, for it has become Europe's main hub for tobacco smuggling, with the State taking a generous cut."
"More pressure will have to be brought to bear here through the talks currently under way, and of course the penalties need to be much stiffer and a uniform labelling system introduced to put an end to a state of affairs in which the tobacco producers' lucrative export business ends in illegal re-imports."
"in writing. - The EPLP supports the aims of the Philip Morris agreement to combat fraud and illicit cigarette trade in the EU."
"However, the UK Government has not signed up to the agreement since it could conflict with existing UK legislation on tobacco smuggling."
"Existing legislation applies to all tobacco manufacturers, which is important in ensuring that smuggling activity is not simply displaced into products manufactured by companies that have chosen not to sign an agreement, or who might at some point choose to withdraw from one."
"This legislation also contains no significant exclusions, which better allows the UK to address the particular types of tobacco smuggling problems that it encounters."
"(CS) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the enterprising report by the rapporteur, Mrs Jensen, because the decreasing quality of ground handling services has, over the last while, become an increasingly urgent issue and the true Achilles' heel of the aviation industry."
"There are many causes of this."
"I would like to address those related to the increased security measures practised in some airports throughout the EU."
"Such measures often border on degrading human dignity and increase the risk of spreading infectious diseases, without any tangible impact on security."
"I am referring, for example, to the requirement for female passengers to remove publicly any jacket-type items clothing, even when worn over undergarments only."
"Similarly, standing barefoot on freezing floors often follows the removal of footwear before going through the security detector."
"In addition, when going through passengers' personal items staff often have no respect for basic hygienic rules."
"It is evident that if we do not take notice of these issues and demand a better travelling culture as well as respect and politeness during security controls from ground handling personnel, civil aviation will become, as far as ground handling is concerned, a sometimes appalling and unpleasant experience."
"in writing. - (PT) Pointing to a rapid rise in goods and passenger air transport, the Commission has decided to produce an 'action plan for airport capacity, efficiency and safety in Europe' in which it puts forward a series of measures."
"This European Parliament resolution, despite containing aspects with which we agree - for example, its references to the need for respect for social laws and collective agreements, training or the needs of the most remote regions - subscribes to a concept of liberalisation of the sector and creation of the so-called 'Single European Sky'."
"Although it highlights that responsibility for planning airport infrastructures must lie with the Member States, it advocates a 'global EU approach as regards the need for extra capacity, the constraints on future investments in additional capacity and the strategic axes'."
"The resolution confirms the primacy of the 'Community competition rules', particularly with regard to the provision of ground handling services whose further liberalisation is not excluded."
"It therefore advocates increasing the minimum number of service providers admitted at airports, not setting an artificial limit on the number of third-party handlers and removing constraints preventing ground handling service providers from entering the market."
"This is our critical position."
"in writing. - (PL) Mr President, I voted in favour of the report by Mrs Jensen on 'Airport capacity and ground handling: towards a more efficient policy'."
"The report gives appropriate consideration to the issue of ensuring that airports have the required capacity."
"Air transport movements are increasing by 5.2% annually."
"It has been calculated that by 2025 more than 60 airports will be unable to cope with the demand for flights."
"The report provides for the growth in air transport to be accompanied by technical and regulatory programmes to limit its external impact."
"The rapporteur rightly points out that the European Union can only meet its requirements in this area by providing different types of airports and responding to the specific needs of each country."
"in writing. - I voted for this report, which calls on the Commission to present before 2009 a master plan for enhanced airport capacity in Europe, in order to promote and better coordinate European initiatives for building new airport capacities dedicated to international traffic and to make better use of existing capacities."
"Only the cohabitation of various airport models according to national specificities will enable the EU to fulfil its need in this field."
"in writing. - (SK) I voted in favour of the Jensen report on 'Airport capacity and ground handling: towards a more efficient policy' because I regard it as fundamental for ensuring sustainable regional development."
"Transport infrastructure is often the decisive factor for the location of regional investment, tourism development and rapid transportation of goods."
"Air transport offers important value added, especially for less developed, peripheral and island regions."
"Globalisation and rapid economic development are giving rise a rise in the demand for flights in the EU."
"The current and future development of air transport in Europe urgently require the foresight to anticipate the necessary steps to be adopted at EU level for the benefit of EU citizens and its economy as a whole."
"In my opinion, the image of all European regions can be improved by the construction of new airports, the modernisation of existing ones and the conversion of former military airfields into civil airports."
"Building and expanding airport and logistical infrastructure requires appropriate assistance from national and regional authorities."
"Airports must be included in regional spatial development plans; they must also be part of regional development strategies and be subject to territorial impact assessment with a rigorous environmental impact assessment."
"I regard as paramount the financing of airport infrastructure from national and regional funds with the inevitable financial support of the trans-European transport network, the Cohesion Fund and the European Regional Development Fund."
"in writing. - (PT) By identifying 'the construction of relief airports in the vicinity of their congested counterparts' as one of the solutions to situations of airport congestion, as seen in Lisbon, and by noting that 'traditional airlines, low-cost airlines, charter companies, freight companies and business aircraft have different requirements in terms of airport services and slot allocation', the European Parliament is promoting those options presented as being less costly and, at the same time, able to respond to the growth in air traffic, bearing in mind the particular characteristics of that growth."
"I therefore voted in favour of this report as I consider that its ratio is contrary to the position defended by the Democratic and Social Centre/People's Party (CDS-PP) for Lisbon which involves the 'Portela +1' option."
"in writing. - (SV) Anne Jenssen's report deals with a problem that is trans-national to the highest possible degree."
"In other words it was not the lack of EU relevance that made me finally vote against most of the amendments and, in the end, abstain on the report as a whole."
"The biggest problem with the report was that in its final version it became too detailed."
"I find it hard to see the need for a master plan at EU level governing the way ground-handling services at airports are organised, less still why Brussels should create extra rules and charges in connection with employee training or the location of airports."
"Without getting into the issue of the location of Bromma airport, for example, I conclude that it must reasonably be a decision for Stockholm and Sweden, and not for the European Parliament."
"in writing. - (SV) The own-initiative report on airport capacity contains high-flying plans for what can be achieved through central planning on the part of the EU."
"According to the report, Europe is facing a substantial increase in airport use and there is a need to 'optimise' existing resources."
"It is claimed that future developments highlight the need to intervene at EU level 'for the benefit of Union citizens and of the EU economy as a whole'."
"It even goes into the infrastructure for connections to airports."
"In the vast majority of cases there is national competition, between countries and airports, and strategic decisions must be taken at national level."
"In some countries airports are private, and investment decisions are guided by profitability assessments, whilst other countries have public ownership."
"The idea of EU planning in this area is therefore entirely unrealistic."
"We do not know future demand; and it is changing all the time and shifting between different areas and countries all the time."
"Nor can we prophesy how technical developments may affect growth."
"We do not know the costs entailed either."
"In addition, normally all cost forecasts for infrastructure tend to be two to three times higher than estimated."
"Likewise the question of ground-handling services should be a matter for each specific airport and not be regulated at EU level."
"The report is inspired by planned-economy thinking."
"I cannot support this report, which most recalls the systems to be found in the old socialist countries, and I have therefore voted against it."

"Statement by the President"
"Ladies and gentlemen, last Thursday and Friday we had a very successful summit meeting of the Heads of State or Government of the countries of the European Union with the President of the Commission, the President of the European Parliament and our three Intergovernmental Conference representatives."
"Whilst I have no wish to anticipate the content of tomorrow's debate with the President-in-Office of the European Council, José Socrates, I would like to stress that, in the eyes of the European Parliament, the summit was a truly resounding success because the entry into force of the Treaty, which is scheduled for the start of 2009, will give our Parliament equal rights in almost all areas of legislation."
"We in the European Parliament have not wavered from the course we adopted for the Convention and followed in spite of the setbacks in the referendums in France and the Netherlands, and if this Treaty now materialises we shall have played a key part in its creation."
"We hope that the ratification process will be successfully concluded in all 27 countries of the European Union."
"The signing of the Treaty will take place in Lisbon on 13 December, and on the previous day - the twelfth of December, as agreed with the Presidents of the European Council and the Commission - we shall proclaim the Charter of Fundamental Rights at a formal sitting here in Strasbourg."
"That will be a significant event."
"I would like to express my sincere gratitude for the work of our three representatives at the Intergovernmental Conference - Elmar Brok, Enrique Barón Crespo and Andrew Duff."
"(Applause)"
"I am pleased to see that Enrique Barón Crespo is with us, but I cannot see the other representatives."
"In that case we shall defer the approval of the Minutes."
"(DE) Mr President, I have a question for Mr Pöttering: will you still have the right to vote in this Parliament?"
"I am well aware that Mr Cohn-Bendit's thirst for knowledge knows no bounds."
"Let me say to you that there was not one second in the entire process when this was in any doubt."
"Nor was the matter raised at all during the open session at the summit meeting."
"But this rumour was being spread in other circles."
"Wherever I could, I acted immediately to quash it."
"There can never be a situation where the European Council or any other body could withdraw the voting rights of the President of the European Parliament."
"This is not about me personally but about the office of the President of Parliament."
"I would vigorously oppose any such move, and the House is united on that stance."
"(Applause)"
"(DE) Mr President, I just wanted to say, on behalf of my group, that we fully endorse your position."
"It goes without saying that every Member of Parliament elected by the people has full voting rights, including the President."
"We entirely agree with that."
"Excellent!"
"I am deeply grateful that we are in complete agreement on that point too."

"The final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Wednesday, 17 October, pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed."
"The following amendments to this draft have been tabled:"
"Wednesday:"
"The Green Group has moved that the tabling of motions for resolutions be permitted at the end of the debate on the Council and Commission statements concerning the EU-Russia summit."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, we spoke about this at the Conference of Presidents and said that, in view of the EU summit with Russia, Mr Putin's trip to Iran and the very real nature of the disputes that are taking place there, it would surely be absurd for this Parliament to debate these matters and not adopt a resolution in which the position of Parliament is set out."
"Who are we, in point of fact?"
"We always want to have powers of codecision, yet now, when we have the opportunity to take a decision, we choose not to."
"We are in favour of a resolution prior to the EU-Russia summit and, if need be, another resolution after the summit."
"It is the duty of Parliament to scrutinise the Commission and formulate political guidelines and not simply to behave like a debating society."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, it has indeed been the practice of this House in the past, on matters of major importance such as the EU-Russia Summit, to have a debate followed by a resolution."
"There are many things that need to be said and many messages that this Parliament needs to send to those who will represent the Union at that summit."
"We should indeed send a firm message to the Russians and a firm message to the people who will represent us at the summit, with the beliefs of this House behind it."
"My Group would therefore support that move."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, if nobody else is speaking against, I will speak against."
"Those who are putting forward this motion for a resolution seem to believe that the debates of this House only matter if we adopt a resolution at the end of the debate."
"They are actually devaluing the debate itself, because all of them are outside negotiating the text of a resolution instead of being inside the House debating it."
"The points they and others wish to make ahead of this summit can be made in this House by a very vigorous debate, by people making articulate and intelligent points, instead of going out and working all night in a drafting committee to add to the huge book that we write at the end of each part-session, with pages and pages of resolutions."
"It is about time we changed our priorities and revalued the debates on the floor of this House."
"I plead for Members to have vigorous debates in this Parliament."
"(Parliament adopted the motion.)"
"(DE) Mr President, I am not noted for intervening to any great extent on points of order, but we hold this debate every Monday at five in the afternoon."
"I have started to wonder why we have another debate on matters of political importance on Thursday afternoons."
"Maybe this very question could be discussed again by the parliamentary powers that be, because we have this same discussion every time about whether some item, such as a summit that some people are holding somewhere or other, should or should not be added to the agenda."
"I would very much welcome a question of this nature being placed on one of the agendas of the House."
"Mr Bosch, all of you, all Members of this House, are the 'powers that be'."
"As you will have seen, those who sometimes regard themselves as such are subsequently outvoted here in plenary. That is just the way of our democracy."
"Thank you for your comments."
"Thursday:"
"Regarding the debates on cases of breaches of human rights, the EPP-ED Group has moved that the item entitled 'Uzbekistan' be replaced by an item entitled 'Pakistan'."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, I will speak on behalf of my Group."
"As you will realise, a few days ago there was the most monumental suicide bomb attack against the party with the returning Ms Benazir Bhutto, with over a hundred civilians killed."
"There has been the recent deportation by the Government of Pakistan of another returning civilian politician, Nawaz Sharif."
"All sorts of things have been happening in that very key strategic South Asian country which need to be urgently debated by this Parliament."
"I am not aware of any recent changes in the situation in Uzbekistan, other than the fact that the Council is deliberating on whether or not to remove the travel bans on Uzbek leaders."
"That pales into insignificance compared to what is going on in Pakistan, so I would urge this House to support the need to debate the Pakistani situation on Thursday."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, it is always so difficult to decide between the pros and cons."
"We were in favour of this motion, and we could subscribe to it if we had an undertaking from the EPP-ED Group and other groups that Uzbekistan really would be put on the agenda and discussed at the next opportunity."
"In other words, changing the agenda should not mean losing sight of Uzbekistan and the developments that are taking place there."
"Given such an undertaking, we could support the motion."
"That is surely a splendid compromise."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, there can be no doubt that Pakistan is a very important issue."
"It is too important, however, to deal with it as an item in Thursday afternoon's debate on breaches of human rights."
"Discussing Pakistan is clearly not just a matter of examining human-rights violations but a real opportunity to debate aspects of EU foreign policy in that entire region."
"I believe we would do better to put Pakistan on our next agenda as a proper debate with the Council and the Commission, because that, in my view, is what we need most."
"The subject of Uzbekistan is of more immediate concern, because the Council intends to lift certain sanctions today."
"In the present situation, I believe we should adopt the position that what is happening in Uzbekistan is a human-rights issue which dictates that sanctions should not be lifted."
"That can be quickly decided on Thursday afternoon."
"Pakistan is a very difficult and crucial foreign-policy issue and should be placed on our next agenda."
"(Parliament adopted the motion.)"
"(The order of business was thus adopted.)"
"One-minute speeches on matters of political importance"
"The next item is one-minute speeches on matters of political importance."
"(BG) Bulgaria's Abandoned Children, the documentary screened on BBC 4, describing the conditions in and attitudes to the inmates of the social care home for physically and mentally disabled children in the village of Mogilino, has evoked tempestuous response in the Bulgarian and international community."
"This makes me tell what steps have been undertaken."
"First of all, we sent inquiries to the Minister of Labour and Social Policy and to the Chairperson of the State Agency for Child Protection."
"We demanded that the home be closed down and the de-institutionalisation process be accelerated."
"The Ministry sent an answer to our inquiry."
"Secondly, we appealed to international non-governmental organisations providing social services to disabled people."
"Among them is Betel, the largest charity organisation in Europe with 150-year-long experience in providing care to mentally disabled people."
"Its experts responded to my request to visit the home in Mogilino together and seek specific solutions to the problems."
"The government is primarily responsible for the provision of the necessary material and technical conditions at these homes amd for the support of the children."
"What we need, however, is a changed concept of social services to children with severe mental disabilities and changed attitude to them on part of society and institutions."
"The isolation of these children in hardly accessible villages and small towns is a practice long abandoned in Europe."
"Problems will not be resolved by hiding the truth but by the concerted efforts of all of us."
"(ES) Mr President, this Parliament is internationally recognised as an institution of freedom and human rights which respects international law and the United Nations system."
"In view of this, many of us would like to hear Parliament's own assessment, and that of its President, of the outcry produced by the public disclosure of conversations between Presidents Bush and Aznar in 2003 at Crawford Ranch shortly before the invasion of Iraq."
"Aspects of that conversation are extremely serious because they demonstrate a total lack of respect for the United Nations, disdain for trans-Atlantic relations and disregard for international law."
"We all had suspicions that something had occurred along these lines but never before has the evidence been so clear; so clear that it requires Parliament to take a stance if only to state that such a shameful thing must never occur again."
"- (LT) The fact that reports by European politicians on global warming, energy saving and similar issues are received with indifference in most European countries is cause for concern."
"Similarly, regions, provinces and other administrative units do not give these problems the consideration they are due."
"Cases where energy is wasted and the consequences of global warming are neglected can easily be seen everywhere."
"For example, almost every day on my way from Brussels to Luxembourg I see street lights stretching over tens of kilometres, but no-one, neither Wallonia nor Belgium or the provinces, admits responsibility."
"On the other hand, very often, even within the European Parliament, our words do not match our deeds."
"It is beyond my comprehension why, at every sitting at Strasbourg, each Member is handed around 200-300 pages of stenographs and protocols."
"In my opinion, we should have this material only on the Internet and put a stop to printing it out."
"(PL) Mr President, on 10 October two activists from the Polish Association in Belarus, Angelika Borys and Igor Bancer, were arrested again in Grodno."
"They were charged under the pretext of hooliganism and Bancer was sentenced to ten days' imprisonment, whilst Borys was fined the equivalent of about fifteen times the average monthly salary in Belarus."
"It is well known, however, that the real reason for their arrest was the planned demonstration by the opposition against the authoritarian regime of Alexander Lukashenko."
"The Belarus authorities have again demonstrated that organisational independence and freedom will not be tolerated in that country."
"Fear, arrests under any pretext, and maligning western countries are the methods that Lukashenko has used for a long time to maintain his tyrannous rule."
"Mr President, we cannot allow such widespread breaches of the human rights of personal dignity and freedom to take place right next to the European Union."
"Europe cannot be democratic if Belarus is not a free country."
"Let us increase our spending to help Belarus society to escape from the tyranny of dictatorship."
"Let us demand that the rights of ethnic minorities be respected, that arrests without just cause be stopped and that political prisoners be freed."
"This is the only way to change the one tyranny and dictatorship in Europe."
"(SV) Thank you Mr President."
"I would like to speak about the Turkish Parliament's decision to authorise the Turkish military to go into the only relatively calm region in Iraq."
"It now looks as though we will be able to include these events in our discussion on the general report on Wednesday."
"I hope that everyone will have the opportunity to be involved in the process and to table amendments, as this is a big threat to peace in the region."
"It highlights the problem of the military exerting pressure and pushing through decisions."
"We must now ensure that the government resists, that there are no troops and that no one is provoked into going into Iraq with military forces."
"If there is anything they have too much of, it is the military."
"If there is anything they have too little of, it is normal discussion between people and that is what we must support. Thank you."
"(ES) Mr President, it is almost as if the European Union were subject to a news and activity blackout with regard to the systematic violations of human rights perpetrated by the Kingdom of Morocco in relation to the occupied territories of the Western Sahara."
"They have us well trained."
"None the less, Parliament deserves an explanation from the Kingdom of Morocco concerning the delegation, which was not able to visit those occupied territories."
"Two further pieces of information should be added to those already given: first, Morocco refused to allow the Human Rights Association - the association is called 'CODESA' - to hold its Congress in the occupied territories and, secondly, the United Nations has still not published the report by the High Commissioner for Human Rights who was visiting the occupied territories to compile a full report on the situation there."
"That report has not been published to date."
"I urge the European institutions - this Parliament, the European Commission and the Council, to bring this situation to an end."
"Mr President, Gordon Brown said today that there will be no need for another EU Treaty for at least 10 years."
"He knows full well that there will never be a need for another Treaty."
"The proposed Reform Treaty is a self-amending Treaty."
"What little will be left of sovereign power can be transferred to the EU by decisions of the European Council without recourse to Parliament, let alone the people."
"The Reform Treaty formally states the legitimacy and supremacy of EU law over national law."
"If the British Houses of Parliament accept and practise the provisions of the Reform Treaty as superior and at the expense of existing English and Scottish law, then it is an act of treason under the existing treason laws."
"Any member of the House of Commons or House of Lords that votes for ratification of the Reform Treaty is therefore, literally, a traitor to their country."
"(Laughter)"
"Go and look at the treason laws if you do not believe me!"
"We should exercise caution in the use of such terms, Mr Batten."
"(EL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a year before the start of the Beijing Olympic Games, worrying messages are being daily given out to the public at large."
"This time it is not a case of human rights or environmental pollution, but the decision by the Organising Committee and the authorities of the People's Republic of China to ban any type or form of religious worship by participants in the Olympic Games."
"In contravention of the agreements adhered to since the beginning of the Olympic Games and signed by the Chinese authorities and the International Olympic Committee, and religious symbols such as the Bible, the New and the Old Testaments, places of prayer and even the crucifix on a chain round the neck of a male or female athlete will be banned."
"As a Christian I am deeply saddened."
"I hope that the international community and the EU will duly prevent the Organising Authority of the 2008 Olympic Games from implementing these unprecedented measures."
"(Applause)"
"(FR) Mr President, colleagues, on 3 October the Michelin group announced that it is to cease tyre production at its Toul plant."
"More than 800 jobs are likely go by 2009, although neither the company's industrial performance nor its financial results indicate any crisis behind these redundancies."
"Shareholders are selling off equity at a profit, on the back of the restructuring announcement, while ordinary men and women come to terms with the fact that they alone will bear the brunt of the situation."
"I should like to put on record before the House how much I respect the trade union representatives and workers who, despite the deeply gloomy prospect they face, have shown a tremendous sense of responsibility from the outset."
"The issue now is not about finding a humane way of closing a factory; it is about finding ways of retaining jobs in areas such as this, which can be extremely hard hit."
"The workforce in Toul expects the EU to create systems of protection and organisation that will be capable of securing workers' social rights, helping people to get back into employment, and putting compensation funds to good use in relaunching industrial projects."
"What they need is the flexisecurity that we, as European Socialists, have been urging; but it is also essential to encourage adaptation to industrial competitiveness and explore ways of promoting an integrated industrial policy for the benefit of all the areas in Europe currently affected by restructuring."
"Mr President, I would like to draw your attention to the deteriorating situation on the border between Iraq and Turkey."
"On Sunday morning, 12 Turkish soldiers and 32 Kurds were killed in a Kurdish ambush."
"As we already know, the Turkish Parliament has approved the invasion of Kurdish-populated areas in northern Iraq."
"At the same time, the Prime Minister of Turkey, Tayyip Erdogan, has said that his Government is ready to give orders to the army to attack the bases of the Kurdistan Workers Party in northern Iraq."
"Hence, there is a strong probability of an escalation into a serious military conflict in northern Iraq."
"Since Turkey is officially an EU candidate country, is it not time for us to act to try to stop a military conflict between Kurdish fighters and the invading Turkish troops?"
"Otherwise the situation might really destabilise in this fragile region and bring about frightening and unforeseeable consequences."
"(PL) Mr President, last week the European Parliament welcomed to a group of people with multiple sclerosis."
"There was an exhibition, concert and conference dedicated to the issue of people who suffer this terrible condition."
"They were looking for assistance with their difficulties from Parliament, but, in Brussels, they were met with extreme discrimination."
"The chairperson of the association, who has severe impairment of sight and hearing, and who is in a wheelchair, has a guide dog to help her."
"The airline Wizzair refused to allow the dog on board, even though their regulations state that it is possible to transport guide dogs belonging to blind or deaf persons, and the online purchase of the ticket also included the dog."
"It was only after an hour of discussions that it was finally decided to treat the situation as exceptional and the passenger and the dog were taken on board. This situation undoubtedly had a negative impact on her health."
"(BG) My country Bulgaria is on the eve of the first local elections to be held after the accession to the European Union."
"Therefore they are different and charged with lots of expectations derived from the new European realities."
"Capable and active people should be elected to local authorities to work skilfully with EU funds."
"Bulgaria stands a good chance to absorb almost seven billion Euro over the period 2007 - 2013 as a full EU member."
"However, it is much more important for these resources to reach the people who need them most rather than to sink into the coffers of companies or political parties."
"Since Europe is Europe of the regions and decentralisation is an irreversible process, the role of the people involved in local government is growing."
"Bulgaria has repeatedly and justifiably been criticized for its insufficient administrative capacity and for the shortcomings in the work of institutions."
"Having received the trust and confidence of our European partners and having become part and parcel of the big European family, we should make the next important step, too, i.e. to elect mayors and municipal councillors capable of working not only at the regional and national level but at the European level, as well."
"As a representative of Bulgaria in the European Parliament, I find it very important for highly qualified and competent people to be elected to local authorities."
"Entering the common European home, we have to make our personal efforts to gain our well deserved place rather than receive it as a gift."
"(HU) Mr President, tomorrow Hungary celebrates the anniversary of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution and fight for freedom."
"The past few years, and the debates that have taken place on the nature of Hitlerism and Stalinism and the damage they caused, including debates in this House, have demonstrated that Europe's more fortunate western half experienced history very differently from the ten newly acceded central European Member States."
"Likewise, 9 May has a different meaning for us."
"For us it was not just the date of liberation, but also the start of occupation."
"Three central European events, acts of opposition to the Soviet Union and Soviet-style Communist dictatorships - the Hungarian Revolution of '56, the Prague Spring of '68, and the Polish Solidarity (Solidarność) movement - have nevertheless become part of our common European history."
"The uniqueness of 1956 lies in the fact that no other uprising involved a people taking up arms against the world's largest army, the Soviet army, and no other case involved a country declaring its neutrality."
"All the goals for which the heroes of 1956 were fighting - democracy, the rule of law, and liberty - were realised with the regime change."
"If we Hungarians can be proud of anything in the 20th century, we should be proud of the 1956 Revolution and the role we played in Germany's reunification. Thank you for your attention."
"(RO) The use of cyanides is one of the current gold and silver mining methods."
"I would like to emphasize that the effects of such a mining process may lead to the irreversible destruction of ecosystems and seriously harm the human body, since cyanide is one of the substances that pass unchanged into underground waters, the main existent source of drinkable water."
"In the context of global warming, cyanide has the role of changing the temperature and precipitations pattern, generating floods and landslides."
"The accident that happened in Romania, in Baia Mare, in the year 2000, when, following the crack of a tailing pond, approximately 100,000 m3 of water contaminated with cyanide and heavy metals was spilled, caused the biggest catastrophe in Eastern Europe since Chernobyl."
"This triggered a mining law reform in Romania by introducing an amendment to the Parliament, which prohibited the use of cyanide in mining."
"Mr. President, I express my wish to see Romania's example followed by the other European Union countries, as well, so that the prohibition of cyanide shall become an European rule eventually."
"Mr President, on Thursday this week, this House will vote on the 2008 budget."
"Bearing in mind that the Court of Auditors is due to report back next month, I want to draw your attention to the Interinstitutional Agreement signed between the three Institutions in 2006."
"Under Article 44 of that agreement, all Member States are obliged to give certification for financial transactions involving EU monies."
"I am advised that under the current programme the Commission will not receive relevant information from the Member States until 15 February 2008."
"Only at that point can the common standards in accountancy and internal controls be identified."
"This means that it is unlikely the Court of Auditors will receive the required information for a further two years."
"That is not acceptable."
"Not only does it contravene the spirit of the Interinstitutional Agreement, but the ongoing failure to achieve a satisfactory audit report seriously undermines the credibility of this House."
"I urge you, Mr President, to take every opportunity to insist that Member States attach far greater urgency to this matter in the future."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the United Nations has set 10 December next as the deadline for determining the future status of Kosovo."
"However, with the Kosovan authorities threatening to declare independence unilaterally, Serbia arguing for a system of broad autonomy and Russia vetoing the UN special envoy's proposal for supervised independence, the situation is critical."
"My concern is to highlight the key role that the European Union will have to play in resolving the crisis."
"It is our collective wish that the Union should have a High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"But what credibility can that appointment carry if we are incapable of playing our part in finding a specific solution to the Kosovo situation, which is still officially classed under foreign affairs although it is in fact a matter of internal concern to the Union?"
"The EU therefore needs to demonstrate a sense of direction and a clear vision that reflects compromise between the Serbian and Kosovan demands, while taking care not to open the Pandora's Box of partition; and it needs to speak out on the future of Kosovo and make its voice heard in the concert of nations."
"(HU) Thank you for the opportunity to speak, Mr President."
"The European Parliament delegation to Chile met not only with Chilean MPs, but also with environmental organisations earlier this month in Santiago."
"In their view, the behaviour of European Union companies locating in Chile is very far removed from the environmental principles they espouse in Europe."
"The legal and ethical positions on this are clear, but unfortunately the two are diametrically opposed."
"What these companies are doing may be legally above-board, but ethically it is damaging."
"A lack of environmental legislation often entices European capital abroad."
"Relocation of this kind is detrimental to our interests in many ways."
"We must therefore push for environmental rigour not only within the European Union, but also outside it."
"The European Union must be the initiator, because a failure to take responsibility towards the next generation on the global scale is now inflicting material and non-material damage on Europe's citizens."
"(SK) Allow me to praise the fifth edition of the European Week of Regions and Cities that took place in Brussels from 8 to 11 October 2007."
"This event provided a unique platform for regions and cities of the entire European Union."
"They exchanged practical experience and gained knowledge about innovative initiatives in the field of regional development."
"We, the Members of the European Parliament, also had the opportunity to meet regional politicians in the course of interesting events."
"I would like to thank the Committee of the Regions, the European Commission's Directorate-General for Regional Policy and the European Parliament's Committee on Regional Development for organising this event."
"I want to thank our President, Mr Hans-Gert Pöttering, for his speech that conferred dignity on this event."
"Only dynamic European regions with a strong human potential, with brave and enthusiastic regional politicians and well-prepared projects focusing on innovation and the creation of new jobs and cooperating in regional groupings, will be able to cope with the challenges of a globalised world."
"(ET) Friday will see the opening of the second European Union-Russia summit this year."
"We do not meet any other country so frequently, yet problems persist."
"Friday's summit is not Mr Putin's farewell visit: he will still be holding Russia's reins in the future."
"Instead of singing his praises we should be debating how to bring substance to the strategic partnership between Russia and the European Union."
"For Europe's security it would be very important to launch the cooperation on crisis management agreed at the meeting of November 2003, especially in respect of frozen conflicts."
"In Portugal Russia should be asked to treat Transnistrian separatists declared personae non gratae by the European Union as a genuine partner would, by prohibiting the Transnistrian elite from travelling across Russia's borders."
"Currently a gang which is sowing instability among Europe's neighbours can travel freely through Russian airports."
"This step would not be difficult for Russia, and at the same time would be a sign that Russia will listen to Europe and that we are genuinely partners."
"Mr President, following the unifying outcome of the Lisbon Summit last week, it is sad to be reminded that Nicosia is still a Berlin-like divided city in Europe."
"Since 1963, a so-called Green Line has divided the city and its people into a Greek Cypriot and a Turkish Cypriot sector."
"This line is closely guarded by Turkish troops on one side and Republic of Cyprus troops on the other."
"The division is most absurd at Ledra Street, a busy shopping road in the centre of Nicosia, which is cut in half by a glass wall running across it, separating Greek Cypriots from Turkish Cypriots."
"Mr President, I beg of you to make an urgent personal plea to the governments of Turkey and Cyprus to take the historic step, without any complicated preconditions and seemingly cheap political excuses, of opening Ledra Street and allowing Greek and Turkish Cypriots to move freely across their capital city."
"Let the opening of Ledra Street in Nicosia become another symbol of peace and unity for the people of Europe and the catalyst for the solution of the Cyprus problem."
"(EL) Mr President, the EU's internet site is today publishing the news that OLAF, in collaboration with the Austrian authorities, has broken up a cycle of illegal Chinese clothing and footwear imports."
"Damage to the Community budget amounts to EUR 200 million."
"In view of this breaking story, which is not an isolated event but happening all over Europe, I call on you, ladies and gentlemen, to petition the Commission."
"Customs checks need to be increased and import restrictions extended beyond the current year."
"Commercial protection measures for footwear imports need to be made more effective."
"(DE) Mr President, I am very pleased that Commissioner Stavros Dimas is here."
"On this occasion I would like to offer a word of praise for the action taken by the Commission last week on the illegal spring hunting of wild birds in Malta."
"We have devoted a great deal of attention to this matter, not only in the Chamber but in our Committee on Petitions too."
"Serving a final warning to the Maltese authorities is, I believe, an important step."
"I hope that we shall see the fruits of this valuable and judicious political measure next spring and that European laws will be put into practice in the form of an enforced ban on illegal spring hunting."
"(PL) Mr President, last year 25 countries in the European Union signed a joint stabilisation and association agreement between Albania and the European Union."
"Today, 16 months after that agreement was signed, only 10 countries have ratified the document."
"It is telling that, of this ten, six are new EU Member States: Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Slovenia, Lithuania and Latvia, and there are four countries from the old EU: Spain, Ireland, Sweden and Luxembourg."
"I would therefore like to call on the 17 remaining EU countries to ratify this agreement as soon as possible, unless we want the concept of European solidarity to be seen as empty platitudes or slogans."
"(SK) Italian authorities have informed the Member States of the European Union, through the European Early Warning and Response System, about an outbreak of tropical fever spread by the chikungunya virus in the Emilia-Romagna region."
"They have reported 197 cases of the tropical virus."
"Laboratory tests have confirmed that 14% of the total number of ill people have contracted the virus and it has claimed one victim."
"Although there is no reason to panic yet, the European Commission must once more take steps to prepare for the possibility of a large epidemic."
"The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, monitoring communicable diseases, notes that favourable climatic conditions allow the virus to spread, in particular in the Mediterranean region."
"The risk of the virus being transmitted to other European countries is also high."
"Infected people can initiate new transmission cycles in other regions of the Union."
"(EL) Mr President, last week Arat Dink, son of Hrant Dink, the murdered Turkish journalist , was found guilty by a Turkish court because of a series of articles he had written on the Armenian genocide."
"Mr Dink, the editor of 'Agos' newspaper, was found guilty according to Article 301 of Turkish Penal Code."
"This was the article which had been used to condemn his father."
"Hrant Dink has been given a one-year suspended prison sentence."
"It is therefore justifiable to ask ourselves what the European Commission is doing to urge Turkey to remove this article from its penal code."
"Further, ladies and gentlemen, in the face of Turkey's continuing intransigence, how much more time do we believe Turkey needs before it finally understands that it has European commitments and should therefore behave like a democratic state?"
"Mr President, there is disturbing news from Slovakia."
"The Director of the Danube Museum in Komárno, Csaba Fehér, has been threatened with dismissal."
"Among the charges is that he was co-organiser of an exhibition in the European Parliament last year."
"That exhibition documented the sufferings of the Hungarian minority under the Czechoslovak Government after 1945 on the basis of collective guilt."
"The concept of collective guilt is wholly irreconcilable with the civic norms and human rights that are at the heart of the European Union's democratic underpinnings."
"Slovakia, as a Member State of the European Union, has accepted those principles in full."
"So, what the Slovak authorities are doing not only flies in the face of human rights normativity, but implicitly criticises the European Parliament."
"Slovakia must resolve these contradictions as rapidly as possible."
"(RO) Statistics show that the European Union population is aging."
"Only 35% of the European Union citizens are over 50 years old and only 16% of the European Union population is under 14 years old."
"The European Union's demographic policy is a policy that Europe's future depends on."
"The demographic policy should refer to accessible health services and decent pensions for pensioners, measures to increase the birth-rate in all Member States, as well as to decent, stable and well paid jobs."
"For this reason, I ask the European Commission to develop, together with the Member States, a Community policy and national strategies as regards the demographic policy."
"The result of such measures will be seen in the next 20-30 years."
"Social Europe needs all its citizens and, especially, it needs each citizen to be integrated into society and have a decent living."
"This is why we have to correlate the population protection and development policies with the demographic policies."
"(SK) The Hungarian Guard was once again one of the main topics in Slovakia and Hungary this weekend."
"All people of good will strive for peace and conciliation between all nations."
"The present governments in Hungary and the Slovak Republic being what they are, there is the need for a strong Christian-Democratic opposition in the interest of democracy."
"However, we will not win if we succumb to sentiments and emotions."
"I am asking the Hungarian Government to respect the Treaty of Peace signed with Hungary in Paris on 10 February 1947."
"In this Treaty Hungary pledged never to suffer in the future on its territory the existence and activities of fascist-like political, military and semi-military organisations, spinning revisionist propaganda."
"I can see nothing better that could be done in the name of peace and mutual understanding between our nations."
"Mr President, I would like to comment on a letter that was printed in an Irish national newspaper last week and was signed by, among others, several Members of this Parliament."
"The context is that Ireland will probably be the only country to have a referendum on what will now surely be called the 'Treaty of Lisbon'."
"In this letter three demands were made."
"One of the demands is that the Treaty must be submitted to the citizens in a referendum in each Member State."
"The second demand goes so far as to demand that the EU national parliaments make appropriate legal and constitutional provisions to allow for referenda."
"I have to say that I find these demands astonishing."
"What about the principle of subsidiarity, where decisions are taken at the most appropriate level, in this case, at the level of the Member States?"
"I suspect that, in some convoluted way, those who want less interference from Europe are in fact themselves promoting the ultimate interference in the business of Member States by demanding that national parliaments change their constitutions and legal provisions to suit the wishes of the letter-writers."
"That would surely be a democratic deficit!"
"(EL) Mr President, every year 650 000 people die from smoking-related causes in the EU."
"It is like a small-scale war."
"Of these, 80 000 deaths are due to passive smoking."
"Smoke has been found to contain 4 000 substances, of which 50 are carcinogens."
"Decades ago the medical community documented the adverse and possibly fatal consequences of smoking."
"It is our duty to try and reduce smoking and especially to prevent young people from starting."
"If we are to succeed, strong legislation is needed."
"Smoking in public places must be banned."
"Industrial additives in tobacco have to be monitored, researched and restricted."
"We need monitoring and rigour at sales points."
"We owe this to the 70% of EU citizens who do not smoke and to the overwhelming majority of smokers who want to give up."
"Mr President, along with many Members of this House - perhaps most Members, in fact, given our resolutions - I am dismayed that the European Union intends to allow the Zimbabwean tyrant, Mugabe, to be invited to the EU-Africa Summit in Lisbon in December."
"Commissioner Michel tells me that the reasons for this - and I would suggest rather perversely - are that we should try not to isolate Mugabe, as this just reinforces his image, and that the EU wants to be seen as a global strategic player."
"To invite Mugabe to Lisbon is an affront to our principles and is a direct contradiction of the EU's own stated positions."
"It is a failure of our Africa diplomacy that any African government still has any regard for Mugabe."
"Mr President, I know you share our concerns about the appalling situation in Zimbabwe."
"Can I ask you to do two things: first of all, to convey yet again the strong feelings of this House that Mugabe should not be invited to Lisbon in December, and secondly, to respect the wishes of this House and not attend any EU summit to which Mugabe or any other banned Zimbabwean politicians are invited?"
"(PL) Mr President, during today's discussions in the European Parliament we shall be considering the report by Richard Corbett on the amendment of Rule 173 of the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament concerning verbatim reports."
"In my view, the committee is not going in the direction that it should."
"I feel I can say this because of Article 96, which states that 'Parliament shall ensure the utmost transparency of its activities', thus any attempts to restrict the provision of information to European Union States, as well as access to it, undermines this fundamental right and is contrary to the idea of the Union, to the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament, to existing agreements and breaches fundamental human rights in the European Union."
"Surely we are not constructing a European Union in order to have discrimination against smaller nations with less resilient cultures, or, if we are, this should have been stated prior to accession."
"It is no argument, either, to talk about costs, about financial resources."
"We spend so much on unnecessary facilities and on administration that we should be able to afford at least to communicate with society."
"(PT) Mr President, the largest demonstration in Lisbon in the last 20 years took place on 18 October last, when more than 200 000 people called out by the General Confederation of Portuguese Workers condemned the European Union's neoliberal policies, said 'no' to flexicurity, protested against unemployment, social exclusion and the poverty in which over 20% of the Portuguese people live, and demanded a social Europe."
"European leaders cannot ignore this important demonstration."
"We therefore salute the General Confederation of Portuguese Workers and its members and express our commitment to the struggle to protect the dignity of working people."
"Mr President, Howard Stern - sorry, the Stern weekly showed the 'private parts' of the German society by publishing in its latest issue that every fourth German still believes that National Socialism had good sides."
"Well, if this is true, it may mean that either every fourth German in this hemicycle finds good sides of National Socialism - which would be scandalous in itself - or this German delegation to the European Parliament is not the voice of its whole nation."
"Recently, Germany was allocated 96 seats."
"Having taken into consideration the statistics in Stern, it would be wiser, perhaps, to allocate only three seats to that country so that there would be no chance for the fourth one!"
"However, I agree with Mr Schulz with regard to one thing: in a united Europe, there is no place for the doctrine of nationalism in any dimensions."
"However, Mr Schulz should take a closer look at the backyard of German hooliganism."
"As for me, being from Poland, I wish all German Members would speak against nationalism as much as Mr Schulz."
"(PL) Mr President, within the psychological framework, feelings such as responsible love for another person, family or one's country - which is given the name of patriotism - are evidence, together with other higher emotions, of a high level of personal development."
"In contrast with primitive emotions that we share with animals, higher emotions even have a separate area in the brain."
"Patriotism expresses itself as love for and a desire to nurture national traditions, culture and language, attitudes of respect and devotion to one's own country."
"These are completely opposed to nationalism and chauvinism, which are characterised by hatred of other people."
"Patriotism does not permit offence to nations or countries."
"It is characterised primarily by openness to other countries and respect for their right to sovereignty and independence."
"I would like to remind you of the nature of patriotism, particularly after the speeches made by certain left-wing MEPs who have insulted national governments and patriotic attitudes, perhaps because they do not understand the difference between love for one's country and the hatred that characterises such attitudes as chauvinism."
"In a situation of European integration it is particularly important to differentiate between these completely different concepts that are confused by many people."
"Mr President, addressing concerns about energy supply is one of the major and most important issues facing the European Union, linked as it is with concerns about climate change."
"Security of supply and rising cost, with prices up 100% in the last five years, are major worries."
"Well, for Ireland the challenges are particularly great."
"We face growing demand for energy and yet a high dependency on imported fossil fuels."
"We are 90% dependent."
"We need to invest heavily in our infrastructure, work towards liberalising the market and reduce our carbon emissions."
"Parliament is looking at an action plan on implementing energy policy for Europe."
"Within Ireland we are establishing an all-Ireland energy market with the merging of electricity markets north and south."
"That is positive, but it is not enough."
"The scale of the market is too small."
"To achieve a harmonised energy market, inter-connection with the rest of the European Union is vital for Ireland - but that will cost money, and I would urge the Irish Government to look at the use of cohesion funding to make that investment, because it is necessary for the continuation of Irish economic growth."
"That concludes the item."
"Framework directive on the sustainable use of pesticides - Thematic strategy on the sustainable use of pesticides - The placing of plant protection products on the market (debate)"
"The next item is the joint debate on"
"the report by Christa Klaß, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a framework for Community action to achieve a sustainable use of pesticides - C6-0246/2006 -,"
"the report by Irena Belohorská, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on a Thematic Strategy on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides, and"
"the report by Hiltrud Breyer, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market - C6-0245/2006 -."
"Member of the Commission. - (EL) Mr President, first let me thank the European Parliament and especially the rapporteurs, Mrs Belohorská and Mrs Klaß, for their exceptionally thorough work."
"Thanks are also due to the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety Committee, to Mr Ebner and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and to Mrs Corbey and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, for the reports and view they expressed at first reading."
"Over the last thirty years the EU's policies and laws on the protection of public health and the environment have enabled us to make significant progress, considerably reducing the risks of pesticides."
"Current legislation, however, focuses on the one hand on approving and placing products on the market, and on the other hand on monitoring product residues in food and animal feed."
"Between these two points of focus no law covers the period when pesticides are used."
"This, however, is the crucial stage; during it human health and the environment are at risk."
"The monitoring programmes implemented in Member States have exposed traces of pesticides not only in food and animal feed but also in the environment itself, in concentrations exceeding the limits values set by European legislation."
"Additionally, it has become clear that pesticides are an issue of serious concern to European citizens."
"We ought therefore try harder to increase the protection of European citizens and our environment."
"The thematic strategy on the sustainable use of pesticides and the framework directive accompanying it are covered under the general heading of tackling the human health and environmental due to pesticides."
"The main elements of the Commission's proposal for a framework directive are as follows."
"Firstly, each Member State will draw up national action plans establishing targets, measures and timetables to reduce risks and dependence on pesticides."
"Secondly, professional pesticide users, who are mainly farmers, distributors and advisers, will need to have access to appropriate training."
"This will teach them enough about the risks of pesticides and about using alternative means."
"Public awareness-raising about the risks of using pesticides will also need to be increased."
"Thirdly, professional equipment for pesticide spraying will have to undergo regular checks and be correctly maintained."
"Fourthly, aerial spraying will be prohibited, but Member States will retain the option to make exceptions in limited cases where aerial spraying is the only feasible solution."
"Fifthly, special measures will be taken to protect the general public and vulnerable sectors of the population, as well as water systems and geographical areas, such as those of the Natura 2000 network."
"Such measures may include, among others, creating buffer zones, or prohibiting or restricting the use of pesticides."
"Sixthly and finally, but just as importantly, we must support agricultural techniques which have recourse to low pesticide doses. This is to enable the implementation of integrated pest control, which ought to become compulsory from 2014."
"Other measures envisaged by the thematic strategy have been incorporated or will be incorporated shortly in other legislative acts."
"These include a proposal to regulate the placing of plant protection products on the market."
"The regulation will bring about an ever greater restriction of harmful active substances circulating in the market, particularly through comparative assessment and adherence to the principle of substitution."
"This is my colleague Mr Kyprianou's proposal, which we are also discussing this evening on the basis of the report drafted by Mrs Breyer."
"There is also a proposal to regulate the collection of statistical data on plant protection products."
"This proposal is of crucial importance; it establishes indicators to measure progress on risk reduction."
"The proposal is now being discussed by the relevant Parliamentary Committee."
"There is also a proposed new directive laying down basic specifications for spraying equipment to be placed on the market."
"The proposal will add to the existing provisions on the maintenance and regular inspection of spraying equipment."
"In conclusion, Mr President, let me stress how important an aspect of the proposed directive on the sustainable use of pesticides integrated pest management is."
"This is a fundamental measure of the Commission's proposal; it has been debated by the other parliamentary sub-committees."
"Nobody doubts that we must reduce dependency on pesticides and turn to more environmentally friendly alternative means of protecting plants and controlling pests."
"Integrated management and pest control are the most effective way to achieve this goal."
"It is thus particularly important that this element should be maintained in our proposal and should become compulsory in all Member States from 2014."
"Member of the Commission. - (EL) Mr President, we shall be debating a really difficult but important issue today."
"let me first of all thank all those who have worked to make this debate possible today, and especially the rapporteur, Mrs Breyer."
"The subject has always been difficult."
"A balance needs to be struck."
"Protection of health and the environment need to be increased, while procedures are simplified and administrative costs are reduced to allow for greater competitiveness and innovation."
"I am convinced that the Commission's proposal will help achieve these two goals, for it supplements the internal market. It does this by setting up a system of flexible mutual recognition of zones, and allowing Member States to take measures and to adopt restrictions, in cases of special health or environmental hazards, whether in throughout a Member State or in parts of it."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a fact that plant protection products play an important role in agriculture, crop growing, silviculture and market gardening."
"I wish we did not need them, because they certainly affect human and animal health, and the environment."
"We must therefore ensure that the relevant rules are effective and balanced."
"The legislation in force dates from 1991."
"On the basis of a 2001 report by the Commission on the legislation's function and where it can be improved, both the European Parliament and the Council asked the Commission to put forward proposals for the amendment to the directive."
"I daresay nobody doubts the need for the existing legislation to be updated."
"Allow me to thank the interested bodies in all sectors and mention the vital contribution they have made in the framework of this proposal's preliminary draft ."
"The Commission has also carried out a comprehensive impact assessment."
"The first priority is indisputably to achieve the highest possible level of protection for human and animal health, as well as for the environment."
"This will be achieved through a number of provisions: establishing clear, strict criteria for the approval of active substances; giving a central role to the European Food Safety Authority in the assessment of active substances; and obliging farmers to maintain files on the use of plant protection products, to be made available on request to their neighbours and the water industry."
"The Member States' authorities will also have to intensify checks on the commercial exploitation and use of plant protection products, and the Commission will examine and verify how effectively Member States are carrying out these checks."
"Further experiments on animals will be banned outright."
"So as to promote sustainable agriculture, the safest alternative solutions will replace the most hazardous products."
"The proposal will thus create a safer framework for the use of plant protection products in the EU and will reinforce measures to protect the environment."
"The proposal does the same as the Lisbon Strategy because it will also reduce administrative costs."
"The procedure will be shorter and more efficient, while, more importantly I believe, preserving levels of safety and protecting the health of the environment."
"The Member States will no longer be working in isolation because mutually recognising approvals will now be the rule, rather the exception."
"This will avoid dividing the internal market over plant protection products and stop splitting the market over agricultural products."
"The changes to data protection rules will lead to greater transparency and fairer competition without hindering research and innovation."
"The proposed regulation is one of the keys to the Commission's overall strategy in the pesticides sector."
"It complements the proposal for a directive on the sustainable use of pesticides, which has already been analysed by my colleague, Mr Dimas."
"Finally, let me to mention the large number of amendments which have been tabled."
"This is hardly surprising for such a complex subject and perhaps we have not yet reached complete agreement in our views."
"I am optimistic that we will shortly be able to do so the next stages of the procedure."
"Meanwhile, the Commission can accept certain amendments while rejecting others."
"The complete list, with the Commission's view on each amendment and the relevant explanation, is available to Parliament and MEPs."
"It is not for me to analyse every amendment separately here because there is certainly not enough time."
"I ask for this list to be included in the Minutes of the sitting."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I look forward to a constructive and interesting debate."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioners Dimas and Kyprianos, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the Commission's proposal for a framework for Community action to achieve sustainable use of pesticides, and my remarks here today will be confined to that part of the overall package."
"This is a vast field, in which a great deal of adjustment is still needed throughout Europe for the sake of consumers and users and particularly for the sake of the environment."
"Differing rules in the European Union not only create divergent safety standards but are also confusing and distort competition."
"The possibility of pests destroying a whole year's harvests is, thankfully, a thing of the past in Europe."
"Today, however, we face new major challenges, to which we must respond with a sound policy on plant protection."
"The global population is growing, and food is becoming scarcer worldwide."
"Climate change has altered the conditions in which farming takes place: new pests are appearing, and natural disasters decimate harvests."
"It is still essential today, therefore, to safeguard harvests, and the use of plant protection agents helps to do that."
"With plant protection, as with many other things in life, it is the dose that makes the poison."
"Whilst a sleeping tablet is a boon, many sleeping tablets can be fatal."
"Care must be taken to ensure that plant protection products are used properly and professionally, because improper use is dangerous."
"That is true not only on farmland but also in public spaces such as parks, playgrounds, sports fields, pathways and railway tracks."
"Information, education and knowledge of the implications of pesticide use, of its benefits but also of its risks, are at the heart of this directive."
"Sellers and users of plant protection agents must be trained and informed."
"By means of national action plans, the Member States must ensure that plant protection products are used sustainably."
"In so doing, they must strive for consistency with other Community provisions."
"Well-tested and safe application machinery will ensure targeted plant protection, the aim being to minimise any risk."
"An arbitrary percentage reduction across the entire range of plant protection agents runs counter to the aims of good agricultural practice and integrated pest management."
"We need both these factors, Commissioner Dimas, and we shall continue to need good farming practice and integrated pest management, because we need dynamism."
"The stringent regulation on authorisation, moreover, has been reduced to absurdity."
"Products with harmful effects must not be authorised at all; it is not enough to cut their use by half."
"If, however, plant protection agents have come through a stringent approval process, reducing their use by a certain percentage across the board would be illogical."
"Moreover, no one has yet been able to explain to me precisely how such a reduction is supposed to be managed and quantified."
"The same applies to protection of the aquatic environment."
"The arbitrary establishment of standard buffer strips next to water bodies serves no purpose."
"A differentiated approach remains necessary here."
"Buffer strips must be right for the geographical situation, the soil properties and the plants that require protection."
"This kind of approach has already been adopted in the instructions for use that come with the various plant protection products."
"You mentioned crop spraying from the air, Commissioner."
"For the steeply sloping vineyards along the banks beside the Moselle in my home area or indeed for the rice plantations in southern Europe, there is no alternative."
"In those places crop spraying from the air is indispensable."
"The use of crop spraying helicopters, however, must be regulated."
"Particular care is needed in sensitive areas, such as parks and public or school playgrounds."
"The use of pesticides there must be kept to an absolute minimum, and non-chemical alternatives should take precedence."
"In my opinion, that could even mean sending out an entire school class to weed the school grounds."
"Banning plant protection altogether in areas that are home to particular species of flora and fauna would be inconsistent with the aims of habitat conservation."
"Pesticides are actually essential if these habitats are to be preserved."
"Plant protection products are expensive, and no farmer will apply more than is absolutely necessary."
"Additional taxes distort competition in the world market."
"They would result in the purchase of cheaper products from outside the EU, which would ill serve the cause of sustainability."
"We want the same protection and the same standard throughout the EU."
"In many countries the proposed measures have typified good practice for some time."
"For this reason, harmonisation of the rules governing the use of plant protection agents is imperative, which is why the Commission's approach is the right one."
"It is up to all of us now - and we can take this as an invitation - to initiate a directive that keeps red tape to a minimum while matching our aspirations."
"I ask for your support."
"(FR) Mr President, I have asked for the floor because I am not quite sure what is going on."
"I took part in the discussions on these various reports in the Committee on the Environment but it seemed to me that what Mrs Klaß has just presented was not the report that the committee had approved unanimously, but rather a reflection of her personal position."
"I would therefore like to know whether we may hope for a more objective presentation of the Environment Committee's position on this very important report."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, may I say to Mrs Isler Béguin that there was no unanimous vote in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, that we definitely took the opposite view and that most of my group opposed the position to which she refers."
"I have certainly stressed that I support the Commission's proposal."
"rapporteur. - (SK) The Thematic Strategy on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides, being a non-legislative political document that accompanies the directive, responds to the fact that the risks of pesticide use are not decreasing."
"Today's residue levels in food products exceed acceptable values: 44% of fruit is contaminated with pesticides, 5.5% of which contains the maximum residue level."
"Excessive residues were even found in the fruit being sold in the European Parliament premises."
"The aim of my report is to minimise the dangers and risks to health and environment that arise from the use of pesticides."
"Firstly, I would like to stress that the use of pesticides is linked to the development of malignant tumours or immunological and other neurotoxic defects."
"That is why I found it surprising (unfortunately it was a bad surprise) that in its text the Commission mentions only in passing the health risks posed by the use of pesticides, in particular by their cumulative effect."
"Pregnant women, children and foetuses are the group most at risk."
"Although I am in favour of protecting plants, I think that first and foremost we have to protect people's health."
"There is clearly a connection with climate change."
"Global warming will bring more pests: we cannot continue endlessly to increase the amounts of pesticides used."
"The National Action Plans containing the Member States' individual targets in terms of risk reduction are the most important part of the whole process."
"I consider the proposal in which the Commission rejects the quantitative use reduction targets to be insufficient."
"The phrase 'to reduce hazards, risks and dependence on pesticides' is imprecisely defined and will not prompt the Member States to lower the amount of pesticides used."
"The Thematic Strategy is a general text and does not offer a detailed solution for calculating the amounts."
"However, my colleagues and I propose the following for the directive: a 50% reduction in the most dangerous substances that are, if used in certain large quantities, carcinogens and mutagens; the use of biological pesticides and pesticides that present little danger does not have to be reduced at present; the so-called frequency of application index will be used for other pesticides."
"The individual characteristics of, and conditions in, each Member State will be taken into account."
"It must be emphasised that quantitative indicators in the National Action Plans do not impose equal reduction of pesticide use on all countries."
"They will take into consideration the specific geographical conditions and arable farming systems of the given country."
"It is true that an automatic reduction in quantity does not necessarily lead to risk reduction; however, it does so in many cases."
"The Thematic Strategy and the directive must deal with both crop protection measures and biocides."
"Protection of the aquatic environment from contamination by pesticides must be strengthened through the establishment of buffer zones along watercourses."
"Although I support the ban on aerial spraying, I accept that it will be possible to grant an exception under certain circumstances, in the absence of a more viable alternative."
"When aerial sprayings take place, the general public will be informed, by suitable means, about the time of spraying, the place and the substance used."
"The Strategy is not directed against farmers."
"I believe that all these measures can be taken without radical cuts in farmers' budgets."
"This was proved by the Danish experience."
"All of us have to realise how important it is for farmers to be competitive, and we have to make sure that their products will not be replaced by products of farmers from developing countries."
"To conclude, allow me to express my opinion on the amendments."
"I cannot agree with Amendment 4, which seeks to change the name of the entire Thematic Strategy."
"Although I want pesticides to be used with care, I think that we should leave the official name of the entire document as it is: after all it is an official name in the Official Journal and I think that it is suitable."
"I also want to mention Amendments 3 and 5, which deal with residential zones."
"Amendment 3 proposes to add the term 'urban': to me this means 'suburban zone' and thus excludes those who live in rural areas."
"The term 'residential zones' is both vague and imprecise."
"I also propose to amend paragraph 8 linguistically because the term 'practitioner' is a bad translation; in French it is even 'médecin'."
"I am going to finish, Mr President, and to conclude I would like to thank sincerely all those who worked on this report."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have the privilege of introducing a report that will offer Parliament the opportunity tomorrow to vote for a breakthrough towards greater health, and environmental and consumer protection."
"According to the Eurobarometer, the use of pesticides is the foremost concern among European consumers, and the Committee has taken that into account."
"More than 220 000 tonnes of pesticide are applied in Europe every year."
"This represents 25% of global pesticide use on only 4% of the world's farmland."
"In our view, the eradication of high-risk pesticides should be the core of this regulation."
"These are pesticides which have carcinogenic, mutagenic or reproductively toxic properties as well as those with neurotoxic, immunotoxic or hormonal effects."
"This regulation would be a huge contribution to making pesticides safer, but we must also incorporate rules for less dangerous pesticides."
"The active substances that are most frequently discovered in concentrations exceeding the EU residue limits should not be marketed any more, because they have thereby proved, I am afraid to say, that they are uncontrollable."
"We are also pleased that the substitution principle, which already represented a crucial step towards better health protection when it was incorporated into the EC Chemicals Regulation, is to be enshrined in the proposed regulation too, because substitution is a particularly powerful stimulant of competition in the pesticides industry."
"It is scandalous and nothing short of scaremongering to sound warnings that up to half of all pesticides could disappear from the market."
"May I thank the Commission for establishing such stringent substitution criteria, for pesticides need to be improved tenfold."
"They should - and this is a proposal made by Parliament's Environment Committee - be authorised for a period not exceeding five years."
"The Commission's proposal, however, also regulates how we should deal with cases of resistance."
"Another key feature of the proposed regulation is better protection of sensitive groups."
"As we know, foetuses, babies and children are particularly vulnerable to the toxic effects of hazardous chemicals."
"For this reason I am pleased that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has proposed that decisions on the authorisation of active substances and the assessment of the risks they entail be made by reference to the more vulnerable groups in society."
"I am particularly pleased to be able to tell you that we have also introduced rules on labelling, because food products that are not compliant with Directive 2006/215 must carry an indication to that effect."
"That is a giant step towards greater transparency, for studies, and in particular a study conducted by environmental NGOs in the parliamentary supermarket, have shown just how risky products, notably everyday products, can be."
"Measured values were up to 200 times higher than the levels normally prescribed for infant and baby food."
"Greater transparency for the sake of these vulnerable groups, but also for consumers and people living near farmland, means greater support for Europe as a whole too, because there must be no more prodding about in the dark when it comes to traceability."
"Reports, lists of licensed pesticides, residue readings and, above all, toxicological and ecotoxicological data must be made accessible to everyone almost in real time, and local residents must be informed of imminent crop-spraying through a central information system."
"The pesticide passport will make it possible to trace, through wholesale and retail outlets, which pesticide was used when."
"That will create competition, and consumers, of course, will be the main beneficiaries of competition between manufacturers producing only safe products."
"Another of our aims is that this regulation should ensure high environmental standards."
"This is why the Environment Committee came out against the idea of dividing Europe arbitrarily into three zones that are not based on any environmental or climatic criteria or on landscape types."
"Moreover, Commissioner, the idea did not win majority support in the Council."
"Like the Council, we advocate better voluntary cooperation in Europe on product licensing."
"Let me also reiterate that there are strong legal reservations, because no intergovernmental agreements exist within these zones to enforce mandatory mutual recognition of pesticide licences."
"Such provisions exist in the EU context on the basis of the European treaties, but there is no legal framework for mutual recognition within the defined zones."
"People in Europe do not want poison on their plates."
"I hope that this regulation will also improve Europe's standing as a business location, because it will make Europe a better place for consumers to live, and it will be universally beneficial - not only to the environment and consumers and in terms of animal welfare, but above all to manufacturers and farmers, since they will receive more incentives to innovate and become more competitive."
"In conclusion, I would like to express my warmest thanks to the shadow rapporteurs, who have collaborated on this report in a truly cooperative manner."
"I hope that this new pesticides regulation will enable us to raise health and environmental protection to new heights in Europe."
"Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. - Mr President, we have to face up to the very practical idea that we need to produce food in Europe - last month we reduced set-aside to zero to bring 10% of land back into production - and we need the necessary tools to do that job."
"We are all quite happy to want safe food and safe chemicals, but - and the Commission is dealing with this in the right way - this has to be done on a risk-based system similar to that used for REACH: if a chemical is safe to use then it can be used, but if it is not safe to use then it should be taken off the market."
"That is how we should deal with this the whole way through."
"Climatic conditions make a great deal of difference to when you should spray, so you need flexibility in when and how you spray."
"There are now satellite systems which can introduce the spray at the right time, and you can actually reduce the amount of spray and chemical you use."
"Take for instance this year, which was an extremely wet year in many parts of Europe."
"In my own country, Britain, you cannot buy organic potatoes because you could not spray them and could not keep the blight away from them."
"There are, therefore, very few organic potatoes to be had."
"We need the necessary tools, and that is why we cannot go for a percentage-based reduction each year."
"We have got to go for a sensible, risk-based system."
"Also, when it comes to the 10-metre strips, there are - believe it or not - chemicals that you can use in water courses."
"There is a chemical called Roundup which can actually be sprayed on the banks of a river or a stream."
"Are we going to ban its use on a 10-metre strip next to a stream when it can actually be used on the banks of a stream?"
"Let us be sensible about this."
"We need food security, we need food production and we need safe food in Europe."
"Let us all work together to achieve that."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - (NL) Mr President, I think that one minute for two opinions is very short, but all right, I shall try and keep it as brief as possible."
"Pesticides are useful and necessary and without these products it is becoming difficult to feed 6 billion people."
"Certainly there is still a great deal to be done to combat the harmful environmental and health effects of pesticides."
"Bringing new products onto the market is a long and always expensive process."
"It is good for the industry that approvals can be dealt with more quickly, but Parliament is rightly asking that Member States should have the right to refuse products in their territory."
"The industry is focusing increasingly on the major crops, the 'big five', rice, corn, maize, soya beans and cotton, because with those they can recover a lot of the cost."
"But it is of course important for the minor crops to be properly protected and the Committee on Industry has made a number of good suggestions for that."
"The Committee is also making a number of good suggestions to introduce incentives to switch to more sustainable products."
"That is also very important."
"I have another comment to make on the use of pesticides."
"The compulsory buffer zone of 10 metres from surface water is not a good idea for some Member States."
"I therefore welcome the amendment tabled by the PSE Group on that point."
"Surface water is now one of the assessment criteria for approval and on that basis Member States have the right to establish a buffer zone for products themselves."
"All in all, I think that this is a balanced and workable position for Parliament."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs. - (ES) Mr President, the Commission proposal on this report had a dual legal basis, namely Article 37(2) on agricultural policy, and Article 152(4)(b) on health protection."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs has studied these proposals."
"For example, a proposal was made by the Committee responsible to remove Article 37(2) and incorporate Article 175(1), by removing Article 37(2), retaining Article 152(4)(b) and adding Article 175(1)."
"The key aspect as far as the legal basis is concerned, is for the debate to be geared to the aim and content, and the Committee on Legal Affairs is of the unanimous opinion that the applicable article is Article 152(4)(b), there being no need to refer to Article 175(1)."
"In our view, this is perfectly clear and there is no need either for the twofold legal basis proposed by the Commission or for the twofold legal basis proposed by the Committee responsible; all that is required is a reference to Article 152(4)(b), because the purpose of this proposal for a directive is the protection of human health."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. - (DE) Mr President, as draftswoman of my Committee's opinion for the Breyer report concerning the Regulation on the placing of plant protection products on the market, I should like to comment on the proposal."
"In this proposal for a regulation, it is important that we should strike a balance between the following interests: on the one hand, there are the interests of consumers in healthy food without residues, in other words in safe plant protection products that do not endanger public health and the environment, and in clean drinking water; on the other hand, consumers also have an interest in a reliable supply of fresh and affordable products, and they want home-grown fruit and vegetables rather than those from countries outside the EU, given that there are scarcely any checks on the pesticides that have been used those countries."
"Our farmers need certain plant protection products if they are to combat resistance."
"That cannot be done, however, without a certain number of protection products."
"At the same time they want safe, risk-free protection products."
"This is why we also believe that demonstrably carcinogenic substances must be banned."
"As regards the other licensing criteria, however, we intend to rely on scientific evidence and base our approach on maximum values."
"That is a balanced midway position that protects our consumers while guaranteeing that home-grown fruit and vegetables are affordable as well as being subject to adequate testing."
"As far as informing neighbours is concerned, if we have stringent licensing criteria and if we test plant protection products properly, I cannot see why we have to go through bureaucratic procedures to alert neighbours and local residents to the use of plant protection products when they have not even asked for information."
"What are consumers supposed to make of such information?"
"How, in practice, are farmers supposed to inform all their neighbours and all residents of the local area before they apply plant protection products?"
"It is for these reasons that I argue passionately against the proposal made by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, which would impose this very requirement, and I also advocate rejection of the Commission's proposed public information clause at this point, for if we have safe plant protection products we have no need for these bureaucratic procedures."
"Let me make a very brief comment on the zonal approach."
"We are seeking greater harmonisation."
"That is the main point for the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection too."
"The provisions proposed in the Breyer report would result in 27 national licensing zones."
"Our aim, after all, is harmonisation with due regard to the opinions of the Member States, which could adapt this authorisation to their own conditions of use."
"I therefore urge the House to support this harmonisation effort and to back the Commission's zoning proposal."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. - (FI) Mr President, the subject being discussed, the use and placing on the market of sustainable pesticides, is a very important one."
"It embraces both the practice of sustainable agriculture and matters of public health."
"It is therefore regrettable that the Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development should not be taking part in this debate right now."
"Over the millennia mankind has had to contend with pests, vermin, weeds and plant and crop disease."
"They have reduced harvests and rendered them unfit for human consumption."
"In recent decades the struggle has been overcome to some extent, mainly on account of new plant protection products."
"At the same time, however, there has been a threat to health."
"The proposals for a directive now before us are very rigid."
"Generally speaking, the purpose of the new regulations is to improve the situation regarding public health."
"However, no clear analytical illustration of the dangers of plant diseases and weeds which pesticides are used to try and prevent has been put forward."
"This is a huge drawback because in this case what is best may not be what is right."
"The sustainable practice of agriculture could be set back years."
"Not using pesticides is not necessarily a good option, even as far as public health is concerned."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Mr President, this is an important, complex and tricky subject that we are debating today."
"Combating the pests that devour and damage crops is a necessary challenge in terms of both food security and the protection and improvement of our environment."
"Sensible recourse to pesticides is therefore unavoidable."
"It is essential, however, that the associated risks should be assessed in a balanced way, particularly with regard to human health, and that measures to scale down pesticide use should be properly planned."
"The motion for a resolution on a Thematic Strategy is, in my view, a helpful response to the crucial questions that we face, and I should like to pay tribute to our rapporteur, Irena Belohorská, and to record my appreciation of the close cooperation that went into the drafting of the text."
"Certain comments are called for: the core problem of risk management is inseparable from the question of how much pesticide is used."
"The elimination of the use of toxic or extremely dangerous substances needs to be established as a firm principle."
"In respect of other pesticides, we have to apply subsidiarity."
"Working within a common European framework, it will be the responsibility of the Member States to set their own national targets, timetables and criteria for reducing the quantities used."
"National action plans will also facilitate adaptation to particular circumstances in each country."
"It is extremely important, too, to protect the aquatic environment and we must be rigorous here by establishing buffer zones fixed in accordance with local conditions."
"Finally, I would point out that the system we wish to implement is a logical follow-on to the REACH directive."
"With regard to pesticide quantities, the thrust of our argument should be 'as little as possible and as much as necessary'."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DA) Mr President, my British fellow Members sometimes use the expression 'An apple a day keeps the doctor away'."
"This is the way it should be!"
"Fruit and vegetables are normally healthy types of food, but unfortunately this is not always the case."
"In far too many cases there are pesticide residues on fruit and vegetables and naturally this has direct negative consequences for human health."
"The subject that we are concerned with here is therefore very important."
"Consequently, it is very important that we use these substances in a sustainable manner, so that we can reduce their usage in those cases where we use too many pesticides."
"Our nature, environment and health are being damaged, and groundwater sources may also be contaminated."
"Therefore, I also believe there is reason to criticise the Commission, particularly because you, Mr Kyprianou, are known (in my country, too) as a man who is very concerned with consumer interests and have done a considerable amount to safeguard the environment and health."
"I do not understand how you can stand here today and defend a proposal from the Commission concerning zone division that will force European countries to lower their environmental protection levels and will also force European countries to reduce their levels of consumer protection."
"Allow me simply to give a couple of examples of what this will mean if we accept the proposal that you have put forward. In Denmark around 100 types of pesticide are permitted."
"We have reduced the use of pesticides by around 50% since the beginning of the 1980s."
"I am sure you will agree that this is a very sensible thing to do."
"If your proposal is implemented, we will be forced to double the number of pesticides permitted in Denmark."
"Double the number of pesticides!"
"This will probably mean that we will find it very difficult to continue drinking our groundwater untreated as we do today."
"I do not view this issue purely as a national one."
"I speak on behalf of the entire Socialist Group in the European Parliament and fortunately also on behalf of the vast majority who made their views clear through the vote in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety."
"There are many examples."
"In every single zone, it is of course the case that every country apart from one will be forced to approve pesticides that they do not currently approve."
"Let me give an example of one crop: maize."
"In Hungary 57 active substances are used, while in Poland 37 are used. However, if the Commission's proposals are implemented every country will therefore approve pesticides that could contain up to 57 active substances."
"This means that in the UK the level will be quadrupled."
"It should not be the EU's task to force countries to use more pesticides."
"It will affect the environment, it will affect health and it will affect groundwater."
"Surely this cannot be the intention."
"I hope that you will back up what we have proposed in the Committee on the Environment; this will also make life easier for the industry."
"It is in the compromise that we have adopted in the Committee on the Environment: we will say no to the mutual obligatory approval of pesticides, but yes to the mutual obligatory approval of data."
"Moreover, we are talking not only about zones, but also about data throughout Europe."
"This will make life much easier for the industry."
"At the same time, we are actually giving countries the right to say no if they have climatic conditions that require them to do so."
"Finally, with regard to the reduction targets, I would like to say to Mr Dimas that it is unbelievably positive that we are getting rid of the most dangerous substances - substances that cause cancer, substances that affect child development, etc. Naturally we would like to remove these substances from the market."
"They are also completely unnecessary."
"In addition, I think that we should go a step further and also establish a general reduction target for all substances."
"Of course this should be something that is determined individually in each country, but if we simultaneously link this with the European reduction targets of around 20%, I think we are being ambitious."
"However, in spite of everything I still believe we are at a stage where it is possible."
"It will be of great significance for health and the environment in Europe."
"With regard to the justification that has been used by the Commission for not introducing these reduction targets, we have introduced a treatment frequency index that takes account of the points that you have otherwise emphasised."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Members of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, it is true that a number of Member States have already initiated measures to reduce pesticide-related risks, but trends in pesticide use differ from one country to another."
"For example, certain substances, the use of which is banned in some Member States, are none the less on sale in those states because their use is permitted in other states."
"There is a clear need to harmonise the rules here in order to ensure that the same conditions apply throughout the Union."
"The ALDE Group advocates strict control of pesticides, whilst recognising that their use is both a necessity and a reality."
"We have a number of amendments that are intended to make the text more easily applicable, while sticking to the principle that safer or non-chemical alternatives should be encouraged."
"My group is keen to focus the volume-reduction targets on dangerous substances."
"We co-signed an amendment to Article 4 on national action plans, setting as the EU-wide target a 20% reduction in frequency of application within 10 years and 50% rates of reduction for dangerous substances by 2013."
"Some may think it paradoxical that my group has tabled a further amendment, also to Article 4, offering Member States the option of an approach based on risk reduction."
"This is, in fact, a more realistic approach but the calculations are more difficult than they are with volume reduction."
"We thought it was important to put forward this amendment because the question is one that we would wish to see addressed in the interinstitutional discussions after the vote at first reading."
"I should now like to consider a few specific points."
"For the protection of watercourses it would seem more logical to take measures tailored to the geological environment, rather than fixing a minimum buffer-zone area."
"It is legitimate to seek to protect specific living spaces such as parks, children's playgrounds and school areas because the use of pesticides in proximity to such areas should be restricted to the minimum necessary, or indeed be prohibited, and non-chemical methods should be prioritised."
"On the fraught question of aerial spraying, the European Commission's proposal - for a ban in principal with exceptions that must be justified - made a lot of sense."
"The text from the Committee on the Environment is, however, acceptable."
"Whilst I understand the need to notify the public of pesticide spraying, I think it has to be left to the Member States to determine the nature and extent of the notification and the means of giving it."
"We are dealing here with so many different types of terrain and so many different approaches that any attempt to standardise seems unrealistic."
"The ALDE Group is thus seeking to achieve a balance, the essence of which is that no single party, whether user or manufacturer, should be penalised but rather that rigorous and consistent legislation should be introduced: allowing pesticide users to protect their crops; allowing manufacturers to sell products that will gradually become less harmful; and allowing consumers not only to eat safe food but also to live in a safe environment."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, the three reports that have been presented are inextricably linked."
"The European Union is trying to do as much as possible to reduce the negative impact of pesticides on the environment and to prevent their accumulation in the soil, in water and in plants."
"A great deal has been done in the last few years to minimise these effects."
"A particularly important role in this work has been played by research organisations that have created modern preparations that work more selectively."
"However, we should remember that in past years the quality of pesticides was much worse, they were used in much higher doses, many times higher, and, as a result, the pollution in our environment is a consequence of activities in years past."
"For this reason, in addition to the new directives, we must supplement existing legislation with a directive on the deactivation and disposal of outdated pesticides."
"I would ask for your active participation in this matter since, despite the passage of some years, problems are still increasing instead of decreasing, and the risks are increasing instead of decreasing, as was shown at the last NGO forum in Kishinev."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioners, whilst I should like to congratulate Ms Breyer on the excellent outcome she has achieved, I cannot support those who defend the use of pesticides, because it is absolutely vital that we rid our environment and our bodies of these dangerous substances."
"I hope that the European Parliament may in future support the most forward-looking positions on this question, instead of yielding to the latest siren calls from manufacturers representing a deadly industry."
"Eliminating carcinogenic, mutagenic and reprotoxic pesticides, and substances that weaken our nervous and endocrine systems and damage our immune systems, is an entirely healthy aim."
"We should also welcome our fellow Members' efforts to ensure transparency in the provision of information for consumers, who are the 'innocent victims' of these dangerous substances."
"Surely, Commissioners, it is high time that action was taken?"
"Never before have insecticides, fungicides and herbicides of various types been used as systematically as they are used today."
"To look no further than France, a situation that can only be described as 'joint management' of public policy on pesticides by the state and the chemical industry has succeeded thus far in marginalising ordinary people's expectations about public and environmental health, regardless of research findings on environmental toxicity and at the expense of statistical studies if they establish links between chemical substances and pathological conditions: all this despite recent warnings from the medical profession, via the Paris Appeal for example, and the Grenelle Forum on Environment in France."
"The industry is doing its utmost to play down the impact of pesticides."
"Thus, after the pollution of water courses by the herbicide Atrazine, which everyone has heard about, and the decimation of bee populations, the chemical industry is trying to draw a veil over the fact that France remains the European Union's number one pesticide user."
"Every year, between 70 000 and 80 000 tonnes of pesticides are poured into our environment in France."
"So, in relation to the 'pesticides package' - unlike the REACH directive - the Members of this House will not allow themselves to be discredited."
"Ordinary people expect no less of us: that is clear from the mass of correspondence we receive, calling for swift and strong action."
"We hear, for example, from people highlighting the dangers of inhaling pesticides that are sprayed by vegetable growers in the south of France, and from others concerned about heavy use of herbicides in public parks and gardens, prompting some to call for pesticide-free zones."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to commend the rapporteur, Mrs Belohorská, on her report on a Thematic Strategy on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides."
"I believe that the rapporteur succeeded in preparing a document that makes provision for, and strikes the right balance between, the need for sustainable competitive agricultural production in Europe, and promoting the use of pesticides only where there is minimum adverse effect on human health and the environment."
"I welcome the fact that the report incorporates the amendment on the precautionary principle regarding human health and safeguarding of the land and water ecosystem, which I co-authored."
"Like the rapporteur, Mrs Belohorská, I, too, regret that whilst the most important result to be expected from the thematic strategy is the reduction of adverse effects on human health deriving from pesticide use, the strategy deals with this heath impact only marginally."
"I believe that it will be up to the Commission to complete the work in this regard in the future."
"From the point of view of occupational health and safety, I welcome the points in the report that highlight the need not only for adequate information but also for appropriate protective means and regular checks of application equipment."
"I believe that we have here an instrument with many concrete effective mechanisms to reduce, and improve the safety of, pesticide use."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Madam President, in the pesticides debate I have always tried to adopt a realistic and balanced position between environmental concerns on the one hand and the interests of producers and consumers on the other hand."
"I should like to talk about several aspects of these reports in more detail."
"One of the proposals is that the policy should be based on reducing use."
"I am very sceptical about this."
"You can certainly reduce the total quantity of pesticides, but often it is the most used pesticides that are the least dangerous."
"In that case the risks are still more or less equal."
"I am much more in favour of a policy based on reducing the risk."
"The Netherlands has been operating such a policy since 2000 and it has been found to reduce the environmental risk by 86%."
"Another disadvantage of reducing use is that fewer different pesticides are available and resistance builds up more quickly."
"Another point is the introduction of buffer zones around watercourses."
"An amendment to create a 10-metre buffer zone has been approved in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. For a country with a lot of water like the Netherlands, that 10 metres is a problem."
"It means in effect that 35% of agricultural land cannot be sprayed."
"Finally I would like to point out that it is not only a standard that is important; enforcement is undoubtedly important."
"At the moment that is lacking, as can be seen from the products intended for consumption we regularly come across that do not meet the standard, even in the European Parliament."
"on behalf of the ITS Group. - (DE) Madam President, as we all know, it has long been presumed that a connection exists between pesticides used in agriculture or genetically modified foodstuffs on the one hand and various diseases on the other."
"When pesticides are even being found here and there in drinking water, it is undoubtedly high time to make the slow-grinding wheels of EU bureaucracy turn faster."
"It remains to be seen how far we can actually go towards achieving the present aim of reducing the application of plant protection agents."
"We are all familiar, of course, with ambitious aims that are not achieved in the end."
"I do believe, however, that the intended replacement of carcinogenic substances is far from the great achievement it is volubly proclaimed to be; on the contrary, it is, in my view, an immediate imperative."
"In actual fact, the replacement of these substances is long overdue."
"If we consider that the EU accounts for one quarter of all global pesticide use even though it possesses only 4% of the world's arable land, the problem becomes immediately clear."
"These statistics also show that our EU support schemes have patently been steering conventional agriculture in the wrong direction."
"There is, of course, a general suspicion among consumers - and it is not entirely unfounded - that resourceful farmers are trying to circumvent the prescribed ceilings with combinations of authorised plant protection products."
"Given the lack of research into interaction between products, it is high time for intervention to curb such practices."
"Moreover, the continual increases in maximum concentrations in recent years must be reversed in view of the greater danger posed to high-risk groups such as children."
"Importing organic products from the opposite ends of the earth is not only inconsistent with various environmental objectives but is also one of the causes of increased traffic volumes and a perennial indictment of the Union's misguided support policy."
"Our support schemes should therefore be rethought, particularly with a view to providing more support for those European farmers who refrain using pesticides."
"If we choose instead to go on harassing farmers with bureaucratic obstacles, no one should be surprised if they ultimately throw in the towel in frustration while Brussels is bewildered by the chronic dwindling of the farming community."
"Madam President, I am tempted to say that a political pesticide to deal with the rampant weed that is EU regulation would do us all a favour."
"When I look at some of these amendments and proposals, a proposal like the 10-metre rule, I detect within it a gross degree of overkill."
"I think we have to face some facts."
"Without controlled use of pesticides in our agriculture, we will drive more food production to less regulated regions of the world, jeopardising quality and food safety."
"Perhaps of even more interest to some, without fungicides and herbicides to protect and cure disease in fine turf, many golf and bowling surfaces would become weed-infested and unplayable."
"Yes, pesticides must be controlled, but our measures must be based on sound science and be practical at farm and street level."
"The strident codes of practice governing the use in my country are, I believe, adequate, and therefore I will vote against those dogma-driven changes which some would wish to impose."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, it is a pity that representatives of the agricultural sector have not been involved in this debate, as it would have been extremely interesting, in the light of the recent CAP reform, to hear the farmers' voice as well."
"The task we face is not only to safeguard the future of farming in Europe and the quality and quantity of food production but also to promote research and to ensure that data are protected."
"The greatest challenge, of course, is to protect human health and to prevent toxic products from accumulating in our water and our environment."
"We must also be concerned, however, with the health of farmers and their families, who need better protection as it is they who come into direct contact with these products and the advice they receive is often the advice of the companies marketing the pesticides."
"The companies are hardly likely to tell them that researchers have started asking questions about the link between exposure to pesticides and the steadily increasing incidence of certain conditions such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's, prostate cancer, brain tumours and congenital deformities."
"It will therefore be absolutely essential to establish strict rules for the placing of products on the market."
"We should also encourage research through proper provision for data protection, and promote research programmes on biological means of pest control - a useful example of innovation."
"At the end of the day these products should also be affordable for farmers."
"My final point, Commissioner, concerns the protection of bees: the long-term evaluations provided for in Directive 91/414 have not been carried out."
"Simply having rules and regulations is not good enough: they must be applied and systems are needed to ensure that they are applied."
"I agree that the most important thing is to regulate the placing of these products on the market but I would also make the comment, Madam President, that in the course of this impassioned debate the intrusions of lobbying by the chemical industry - although infrequent - have been disgraceful."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, all the health and environmental data now available, which I do not propose to list this evening, must necessarily prompt this House to take decisive action on pesticides and their conditions of use."
"It is essential that such action is based on measurable targets."
"It became clear in the discussions prior to the vote in plenary that there are major differences between the Member States in both their practice and their policy approach, so we ended up compromising on certain issues and relying on subsidiarity."
"I hope we shall not be deceived here by subsidiarity, for it will entail flexibility that could easily become a pretext for watering down our policies to a very minimal expression of the political and public will being voiced here today, particularly on the issues of exposure to risks and the extent of the buffer zones beside watercourses."
"If subsidiarity is to be meaningful in relation to pesticides, it must encourage more comprehensive thinking about the agricultural and environmental issues in each European region."
"That will mean stepping up research and the transfer of technologies; involving all the stakeholders, including farmers, researchers, NGOs, health professionals and representatives of the food industry; and carrying out thorough research in each geographical area, jointly identifying best practices and non-chemical alternatives that are suited to the soil, the climate and the crops."
"There are a few regions in which this work is already being done."
"I therefore propose that the Commission should encourage the introduction of such an approach and should facilitate inter-regional exchanges of experience, whilst at the same time ensuring that European laws are properly applied."
"(DE) Madam President, many of my fellow Members believe we need strict rules for dealing with plant protection agents, and they are right, but at the same time we must not ignore the impact of the legislation we adopt."
"The fact is that plant protection products are an important element of modern-day agriculture."
"Take the example of the regulation on authorisation."
"We are in the process of banning entire clusters of active substances on the basis of exclusion criteria, simply because of an abstract notion of hazardousness."
"This approach ignores the actual risk involved in applying these agents down on the farm."
"It leads us to ban active substances which do not pose any problem at all in practice."
"As a result, not enough active substances will be available in future to combat pests properly."
"If only a few active substances are used, resistance to pesticides will develop more quickly."
"There will be no reliable means left to deal with many pest problems."
"And these are probably the new heights to which Mrs Breyer just referred."
"When that stage is reached, the security of Europe's food supply will plumb new depths."
"Instead of imposing blanket bans we should be providing for a reliable licensing procedure that examines the actual risk involved in the use of each substance."
"The next example relates to the strategic approach to this issue, in which we argue for an across-the-board Europe-wide reduction target for the use of plant protection products."
"That, however, has nothing at all to do with the risks involved in their use."
"The Commission had set targets for reducing the actual risk."
"That is a good idea, and we should retain it."
"When all is said and done, we should focus on what is feasible, namely efficient pest control coupled with proper risk management."
"After all, it is also a matter of establishing how the growing need for raw vegetable materials is to be met in future."
"In the past innovative plant protection products have helped to make production grow faster than demand for arable land."
"Our aim for the future should not be to reverse this situation."
"- (LT) I do not think you could find a single person in this House, in this Parliament, who would claim that ecology, a healthy environment and human health was not important."
"I do not believe that any European citizen would ever say that."
"However, ladies and gentlemen, while making decisions, talking about legislation and making and implementing rules that hundreds of thousands of people would have to adhere to and that would no doubt have an impact on the lives of millions of people, we cannot base our decisions on emotions and good intentions."
"We need to achieve this objective in a balanced and sensible way."
"One of the key objectives set out for the EU agricultural sector is to supply good quality food at affordable prices."
"The EU is known for the high standards of food production and strict farming regulations it lays down for its Member States."
"On the other hand, there is constant pressure on EU agriculture to be competitive as well as to produce good quality food."
"We are in no position to ignore these factors when discussing plant protection regulations."
"The opinion expressed by the Commission and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has satisfied the expectations of all interested parties."
"Nevertheless, the amendments proposed, or those introduced at the time of the discussion in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, have raised serious concerns."
"If these amendments are accepted, the consequences could be unpredictable."
"They pose risks not only for agriculture and the food industry, but also for nature itself."
"Does it mean that genetically modified organisms will enter the EU market?"
"The impact on traditional crops would be huge if 90% of plant protection products were excluded from the market."
"Ladies and gentlemen, once again I urge you to base your decision on sound scientific evidence and good practice, not on rumours and emotions."
"I hope that your vote will reflect the opinion of all interested parties and that the outcome will be balanced and correct, so that agriculture is not destroyed, EU citizens are not left without European food and millions of people do not end up unemployed in the name of environmental protection."
"(DA) Madam President, early tomorrow morning I am going to the grocer's to buy bottled drinking water."
"In many countries people do this because the groundwater sources have been contaminated by pollution."
"The water is subject to chemical treatment as if it were a dirty coat."
"Then it is chlorinated and tastes as bad as it is expensive."
"In Denmark we have a rich vein of gold underground: clean groundwater."
"We drink it directly as drinking water without first sending it to a water treatment works."
"It is healthier than bottled water, it tastes better and it is much, much cheaper."
"However, this also means that we must watch over it and prohibit pesticide sprays in cases where the pesticide could enter the groundwater."
"Therefore, Denmark prohibits 13 types of pesticide sprays, 12 of which are found in drinking water."
"This is something that we would like to continue with and I therefore request that my fellow Members vote in favour of an amendment to permit protection zones."
"We have already had the proposal adopted in previous regulations; these must now be repeated in order to prevent them from being annulled."
"Finally, we have received support from a large majority here in Parliament and subsequently from the President of the Commission, José Manuel Barroso."
"Thank you!"
"We have received no support from the Danish Commissioner for Agriculture, who, together with the Danish Minister for Food, Agriculture and Fisheries (also from the Danish Liberal Party (Venstre)), would rather support the farmers' opportunity to ruin our drinking water."
"It is sad that the Danish Agricultural Council would rather support Venstre."
"It is very short-sighted to pursue slightly higher corn yields and then have to pay billions of kroner in order to purify the groundwater."
"The Treaty states that polluters themselves will pay."
"I have proposed this in an amendment and I request that my fellow Members support the requirements of the Treaty."
"No-one has the right to poison our common earth and drinking water."
"(ES) Madam President, Commissioners, the proposal for a regulation drawn up by the European Commission to replace Directive 91/414/CE achieves greater harmonisation of authorisation procedures while at the same time providing for consumer protection."
"However, the result obtained in the Environment Committee not only fails to have regard to the objective of greater harmonisation but unjustifiably overhauls measures aimed at protecting the consumer and the environment."
"The report is based on a total lack of faith in the existing methods of agricultural production in the European Union."
"Farmers, however, are not the only ones who will suffer: consumers are likely to suffer as well, because many crops will become unviable, making imports necessary, with a knock-on effect for food security."
"Insufficient consideration has been given to the fact that the approval and use of plant protection products is already subject to strict controls, both by the European Food Safety Authority and by the competent authorities of the Member States."
"Moreover, this proposal changes the number of active substances from 1 100 as authorised in 1991, to 148, which are listed in Annex I to this proposal."
"Of those 148 substances, only 34 are insecticides, nematocides or acaricides, which are the substances most needed for cultivation in Mediterranean Europe where the level of attack by insects is the highest in the entire Union."
"Insects are not only a menace to plants, but are also transmitters of very serious human illnesses."
"The Commission proposal to divide the European Union into three zones for the mutual recognition of plant protection products should be reinstated."
"Criteria for precluding pesticides must be based on proper risk analyses."
"Without a risk analysis it is impossible to determine the effect of these substances on health or the environment."
"Finally, I would like to point out that the dose makes the poison."
"(FR) Madam President, I have been stressing the importance of this evening's debate because what we have at stake here today is nothing less than our vision of Europe's farming future and the need to move away from intensive agriculture that clearly causes too much pollution, towards sustainable agriculture that will respect biodiversity."
"This is a challenge to which Europe must rise for three reasons: firstly, as more scandals and more health risks are uncovered, public opinion is now set against the use of pesticides; secondly the majority of farmers themselves want the European Union to help them change their practices so that they no longer have to choose between keeping their health and boosting their profitability; and thirdly, bee-keepers all over Europe are calling for strict legislation to stop the sale of pesticides that have not been evaluated for their impact on bees."
"It is therefore vital that the ambitious stance taken by the Committee on the Environment should be confirmed in tomorrow's vote on the three reports by Hiltrud Breyer, Christa Klaß and Irena Belohorská."
"We must confirm that health and the environment are foremost; that specific measures are needed to protect those most vulnerable to harm; that the most dangerous substances will be covered by the precautionary principle; that the use of non-chemical alternatives will indeed be encouraged; and that aerial spraying will henceforth be banned in principle."
"In short, we must translate into practical action the concerns voiced by the very many men and women in Europe who - as Mrs Isler-Béguin has mentioned - have written to us urging that farming should not in future be dependent on chemicals."
"(PL) Madam President, the use of plant protection products - pesticides - is essential in certain circumstances."
"In Poland there is a preponderance of small agricultural holdings, where the owners, due to insufficient finance, economise on expensive pesticides and this sometimes results in losses as a result of pests."
"I am in favour of all actions to encourage the rational use of plant protection products, including advice, training, research, subsidies for modern plant protection equipment, the introduction of substitute products that help to protect the environment and health and that are compatible with farmers' interests, instead of the use of pesticides."
"Where there is a risk that the harvest might be lost, ignorance and the lack of proper assistance to farmers can lead to the uncontrolled use of pesticides."
"A problem that has been with us for a long time, but which has not yet been fully resolved, is the issue of the disposal of dumps of highly toxic pesticides that exist or existed in the countries of the former Soviet bloc, as well as the recultivation of soil."
"They are poisoning both the water and the soil."
"This baggage could reduce the effectiveness of the measures prepared in these documents."
"(PL) Madam President, producers who are being forced to create food that looks perfect are introducing pesticides that are harmful not just to the environment and to the economy, but also to human health."
"I hope that the documents under discussion will lead to an improvement in the quality of food consumed and will encourage more organic production methods, with greater use of natural fertilisers to nurture the soil."
"In addition, as regards the unscrupulous and unethical practice of exporting substances known to be harmful to third world countries, I would quote a popular proverb from Poland: 'Do as you would be done by'."
"This is even more important because the dangerous pesticides come back to us in the form of foodstuffs that are purchased cheaply by wealthy countries and destroy people's health."
"In addition to the general guidelines, strategies for the sustainable use of pesticides should be developed at national level, where appropriate action can be taken."
"Reductions in the quantity of plant protection products should be greater in areas where more pesticides are used."
"(SK) I highly value the fact that all three reports require the personnel involved in all phases of pesticide handling to be highly qualified."
"Action plans, integrated management and strict import measures: these are also examples of what is positive in all the reports."
"However, both the bans on aerial application and, alternatively, the situations where aerial application would be possible must be articulated precisely, using clear wording."
"Similarly, the notion of a quantitative use reduction is not clearly defined and opens the door to many risks because of its non-selective application."
"For example, the Slovak Republic applies on average less than 1 kg of pesticides per hectare while other countries apply as much as 8 kg."
"This means that there are countries where pesticide use must be genuinely reduced and countries where pesticide use should even be increased."
"This is why I suggest that when voting we should take into account the recommendations of the European Crop Protection Association or alternatively, at first reading, not adopt reports and and keep the balanced recommendations of the Commission."
"(NL) Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, it is time for us to give shape to the thematic strategy for sustainable use of pesticides and it is also a good idea for us to put some of it into effect immediately."
"In view of the considerable impact on food quality, public health, the environment and the sustainability of our farming - all matters of concern - our whole group, as well as our rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs, have devoted a great deal of time to this package."
"I should like to mention four points in particular."
"Firstly, a further reduction in pesticide use is sensible."
"This must then actually create less of an impact on the environment and for that reason we are against merely reducing the quantity used."
"We want a reduction in the actual impact, based on a scientific risk evaluation."
"Secondly, we take a similar view on non-spray zones around watercourses."
"Here again we are in favour of a risk-based approach and we feel that the Member States are better able than we are to make responsible choices, based partly on the criteria laid down in the water framework directive."
"Thirdly, I wonder why this Parliament, which is after all an advocate of an internal market with a high degree of protection for the consumer, health and the environment, would oppose a first step towards harmonisation in this area."
"We are in favour of the idea of zones with internal mutual recognition proposed by the Commission and would also like to see voluntary mutual recognition between zones."
"Finally, we are opposed to the general provision of information to neighbours advocated by Mrs Breyer in her report."
"Not only is that information unnecessary for a strictly regulated activity, it also causes unnecessary anxiety and frustration."
"Surely the aim cannot be to move towards a sort of private enforcement."
"That is a society we do not want and do not support."
"(PL) Madam President, today's debate is of enormous significance for European agriculture and for environmental protection."
"There are many people in favour of the use of pesticides and many who are opposed."
"However, I believe that the farmers' guiding principle should be: 'as few pesticides as possible, just those that are essential', and the guiding principle of producers and distributors should be the precautionary principle, which should be the supreme principle as regards the lives and the health of consumers in every case where the introduction of new pesticides raises concerns, either because there is some ambivalence in the results of scientific research, or if there has been insufficient time to be able to say categorically that a given product or substance is harmless to humans and animals."
"In the context of sustainable use of pesticides, I believe that the following steps should be taken: first of all, the Commission as well as Member States should provide periodic training, and advisory and educational programmes that are financed at least in part by companies that manufacture pesticides."
"There should be coordinated monitoring and data collection with regard to the harmful effects of pesticides on human health and the environment, and this should include long-term research programmes and the imposition of sanctions on polluters."
"A coordinated system should be set up to collect data on the production, import, export, sales, distribution and use of pesticides, and this should be accessible to the public."
"Agricultural practices that promote the use of low doses of pesticides should be encouraged, which will help change the overall usage of these preparations."
"Appropriate checks should be introduced and the import into the EU of agricultural food products produced with the aid of chemicals should be banned."
"(NL) Madam President, plant protection products are still essential for agricultural production and food supplies in Europe."
"The big question when we in Europe take particular measures is what kind of influence this has on competitive relations with the rest of the world."
"If we are too strict in Europe and cannot impose the same rules on the rest of the world, that means that we in Europe can consume products that we are unable to produce here, which seems wrong to me."
"Of course it is always essential for us to continue evaluating the harmful effects, but we cannot overdo it."
"I agree with everyone who says that we should concentrate on the risk and not on reducing the quantity."
"The 10-metre buffer zones will also be disastrous for the Netherlands and others and should be left out of the regulation."
"Finally, information to neighbours."
"If something is approved, why should the neighbours also be informed?"
"That is completely unnecessary regulation."
"Madam President, UK pesticides were tightly controlled in 1985."
"Firms like Syngenta say that farmers should not be denied the tools they need."
"These regulations move us away from the principle of good, science-based regulation."
"For example, pavement weed control is 400 times more expensive without chemicals."
"The golf and field sports industry says that without pesticides it is not possible to maintain the turf."
"The Crop Protection Agency says that banning pesticides means between 65% and 200% more land under cultivation, reducing productivity."
"Corbett Farms say that this year has shown the value of spraying to prevent potato blight."
"Pesticides are expensive and the lowest amount is used to protect our crop."
"Decisions on how and when to spray must be taken on an individual field basis."
"An arbitrary reduction in use cannot be scientifically based."
"Madam President, please eradicate the EU's pestilent regulations."
"UKIP will vote against."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by expressing my thanks to the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs."
"It goes without saying that all of us care deeply about health and consumer protection, and the strength of feeling among the various Members of our House can be gauged from this highly charged debate."
"It is nevertheless important that we really do decide on the basis of the facts and do not fly in the face of reality by creating scapegoats, as it were."
"It would be very easy, especially with this legislative package, to pick on a particular occupational group and look no further."
"That would be completely wrong."
"It must be established from the outset that all of us in Europe need a functioning agricultural sector, which necessarily entails the use of a certain quantity of plant protection agents."
"On specific aspects of the Klaß report, let me say that it is indeed a sound principle to envisage certain reduction targets, but I believe the quantitative approach adopted here is simply too rigid."
"Every Member State should truly consider what it can do itself, because merely reducing the overall volume and believing this will clean up the environment is downright unscientific."
"As far as the buffer strips are concerned, there is nothing wrong with the Commission's chosen strategy of treating subsidiarity as the key element."
"Every Member State should consider how it wants these buffer strips regulated."
"Blindly imposing a Community-wide ten-metre border would be wrong."
"Trying to find non-chemical alternatives in sensitive areas, such as habitats of rare flora and fauna, is also an approach that should be supported unreservedly."
"As regards the Breyer report, it is important that we support the three-zone concept."
"Restricting the scope of licences to single Member States would be an excessively narrow approach."
"Special care is needed with regard to the exclusion criteria."
"An unequivocal ban for CMR1-rated substances may be taken as read, but in the case of CMR2 substances I am also in favour of taking scientific data as a basis for licensing decisions."
"(EL) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the legislative proposal which we will be asked to vote on aims to achieve a high level of protection of human health and the environment by establishing Community models for the sustainable use of pesticides and rules for placing them on the European market."
"I believe that by supporting the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety's proposal to reduce pesticide use by 20% in Europe, we are sending out a strong message."
"We must strengthen checks on the rational use of pesticides, and, most importantly, promote research into safer alternative methods of plant protection."
"At the same time, the proposal for abolition of the system of zones and mandatory mutual licensing is a balanced position."
"In view of the concerns of farmers and industry, it seeks to enable Member States who so wish to implement higher levels of environmental protection in line with their local conditions."
"Finally, let me mention the special need to protect secondary use."
"I call on you, ladies and gentlemen, to support the proposal to create a European fund for the promotion of research."
"We will thus guarantee the prosperity of farmers and maintain our special national products, which are part of European agricultural tradition and significantly boost the European agricultural economy."
"Madam President, thank you for the opportunity to say a few words on these three reports."
"Firstly, I believe that we in Europe need to be in a position whereby we can produce European crops and European fruit and vegetables that are safe for human consumption."
"However, we need to achieve that objective in a balanced way and in a common-sense way, so that we protect human health without penalising agriculture."
"What we do not want is to put restrictions in place that impact negatively on European agriculture and to end up having to import huge quantities of food with all the implications for food miles, and, of course, with little control over the quantities of pesticides used in the production of that imported food."
"Secondly, I support the proposal for a risk-based assessment, which is based on science and will prove workable for Member States."
"Finally, I believe a 10-metre buffer zone is a 'one size fits all' solution and needs to be modified to allow Member States to take local conditions into consideration."
"As I said earlier, not even the European Parliament can legislate for climatic conditions and soil conditions throughout the entire continent."
"(FI) Madam President, the Thematic Strategy and Framework Directive on plant protection products are challenging legislative projects and are a reflection of the fundamental challenge that EU environmental policy faces, which is how to combine the protection of the environment with that of health effectively in a policy which takes account of social realities"
"We need to recognise that the use of plant protection products and pesticides has major economic benefits."
"The expert use of these substances is, to be honest, a crucial prerequisite for food production in the modern age."
"At the same time, however, the adverse impact of plant production products on the environment, and on watercourses in particular, is a very real one."
"How, then, can we use these substances in a way which still allows us to benefit from pesticides but which at the same time reduces the adverse effects?"
"I come from a country where farming is a respected occupation and where domestic agriculture is regarded as important."
"On the other hand, the environment is particularly fragile."
"For example, Finland has almost 200 000 lakes, hundreds of thousands of other watercourses, and one of the world's most polluted seas."
"Diffuse water pollution is an immense environmental problem, and plant protection products are part of that problem."
"It is a challenging equation and so it is only right that the directive should take the differences between Member States into consideration."
"Obviously, we need certain EU-wide standards, but the remedies applied in Finland cannot be the same as those in Luxembourg, say."
"Therefore, reason and environmental concerns dictate that we should concentrate on the targets and leave the means to the Member States themselves."
"A good example of this is the 'buffer zones', which undoubtedly have an important part to play in the protection of watercourses."
"I am confident that buffer zones suited to each situation and consistent with the Commission's proposals are the right way forward."
"If we now decide upon precisely measured limits, applying the 'one size fits all' principle, there is a real danger that in many countries they will be jumping out of the frying pan into the fire."
"Perhaps I should say, rather, that they would not be addressing the problem flexibly or satisfactorily."
"(DA) Madam President, there are some misunderstandings in some of the statements from our fellow members here today."
"Therefore, I am glad to be able to speak for a second time."
"There are three misunderstandings."
"The first concerns a reduction target: some fellow members are saying that this is simply not possible."
"There are differences between the countries and it is not possible to create a common European reduction target."
"No, this cannot be done!"
"Nor is this what we are doing."
"What we are doing is saying that the common European reduction target should be 20%. However, this may of course mean 30% in some countries and 10% in others."
"The national reduction target will be established on the basis of national action plans."
"Therefore, it is a misunderstanding to fear this item."
"A key element is that we are taking account of the fact that a gram of one pesticide can sometimes be more dangerous than an entire kilogram of another pesticide."
"Therefore, we have introduced a treatment frequency index as part of this reduction obligation."
"I can well imagine that the Commission will also have something to say about this when you, Mr Dimas, are able to speak again in a little while."
"The second misunderstanding concerns the zones."
"There is a belief that if we do not have the zones it will almost be an insult to the internal market."
"No, on the contrary!"
"By ending this foolish idea about zones and saying that we will gradually introduce mutual data sharing we are saying that the entire EU is a zone within which we share data."
"However, it is clear that we cannot talk about mutual obligatory recognition of pesticides simply because there are different geographical, climatic and environmental circumstances in each individual country."
"I think that almost everyone in this House who has spoken today will be in agreement on this point."
"The third fundamental misunderstanding is that it will destroy the competitiveness of agriculture."
"No!"
"In Denmark we have reduced the use of pesticides by 50% since the 1980s without any effect on agricultural competitiveness."
"Pesticides are expensive to use and therefore, provided they are used correctly, the less they are used the better it is for competitiveness."
"(SV) Madam President, time is short and I am speaking primarily to express my support for the co-rapporteur of the Breyer report in the PPE-DE Group, Erna Hennicot-Schoepges."
"I think it is very unfortunate that the majority of my group chose to ignore Mrs Hennicot-Schoepges' advice on several important points, and not to support important proposals contained in the report."
"Of course, I agree that the requirement to provide information 48 hours before spraying is impractical and would not work, but it is not reasonable to conclude that we do not need any information requirement at all."
"Mrs Hennicot-Schoepges' proposal here, as a compromise, is well-balanced."
"Another important issue is the cut-off criteria for particularly sensitive substances."
"Above all, in our decision we must of course be consistent with the decisions taken by Parliament in relation to the new REACH chemicals legislation."
"One of the fundamental principles there was to phase out substances where it is difficult to establish thresholds for risks in the case of high-level concern substances."
"Obviously we must also follow that line here, particularly as we are dealing with substances that come into contact or are liable to come into contact with things we eat."
"Another issue on which I support the rapporteur, Mrs Breyer, is the proposal on zoning."
"When I saw the Commission's proposal, I immediately found it interesting to try to divide Europe into zones that are relatively similar in terms of vegetation conditions, climate and so on. However, the proposed zoning is unfortunately too arbitrary."
"I cannot support this approach and believe that the Member States must be allowed to retain a right to refuse different preparations even if countries nearby have given them the green light."
"I would like to address other issues, but my time is over."
"(NL) Mr President, when I walk out of my village I am in the middle of a unique agricultural area, the green heart between big cities like Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Utrecht."
"It is still green farming land at the moment, but the 10-metre buffer zone proposed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety would make it virtually impossible to farm in the area, when it is specifically farming that keeps the area green."
"Last week I put it to the test, but I was hardly able to find any pieces of land between the many ditches that were 20 metres wide."
"Anyone who knows a bit about the Netherlands knows that it is not only in the green heart that this is true."
"It is a characteristic of Dutch farming that there are many ditches between pastureland."
"That means that, with 10-metre buffer zones, the Netherlands would lose 800 000 hectares of its farmland, 35% of agricultural area."
"I am therefore asking Members not to support this proposal, also in view of the agricultural production that is necessary in Europe and the world, as the chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has said."
"That does not actually mean that I do not agree with the aim of protecting nature and public health."
"We all share that ambition."
"I just think it can be better achieved with an approach based on risk analysis and risk reduction."
"The alternative, reducing use, certainly sounds nice and simple - a 20% reduction overall - but it does not provide the best protection for the consumer because it can be looked at only in terms of quantities and not the final effect, the final risk."
"In that context, I actually find it difficult to understand the painful contortions of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, which is in favour of a 20% overall reduction as well as a risk approach."
"I have two final points."
"All I will say about the licensing system is that three climate zones are preferable to 27 Member States, obviously taking national circumstances into account."
"Finally, I would ask the Commission not to overlook minor crops in all these major areas of dispute."
"(FR) Madam President, pesticide residues are now everywhere: in food, in water, in the air, in our body tissue and breast milk and - most frighteningly of all - in the bodies of our unborn children."
"We are only just beginning to glimpse the long-term consequences of this omnipresence of pesticide residues: they include various forms of cancer, endocrine disorders, reduced male fertility, damage to our immune systems, and degenerative diseases of the nervous system."
"So, yes and yes again: let us reduce pesticide use and let us reduce it quickly."
"I believe that a section of our group is being unreasonable in recommending that no such notification is required, on the pretext that if the substances to be applied have prior approval it means they are not harmful."
"Aerial spraying is commonplace, particularly in forests and vineyards."
"It entails a risk of substances being carried into inhabited or sensitive areas, so it must be strictly regulated."
"It is essential that growers should issue advance warning of pesticide spraying to people who live close by and are thus potentially exposed."
"People suffering from respiratory conditions such as asthma could be severely affected if they have no advance notice of such spraying."
"Conveying and presenting the information need not imply any additional administrative burden on farmers, as some of my fellow Members have suggested."
"Simple notices, stating the intended dates of the spraying, placed close to human habitation in the areas at risk, may be all that is needed."
"I would like to conclude by urging that it is time to move on to a new generation of agricultural practices that respect the environment and thus play a part in modernising the farming sector."
"(PL) Madam President, the key to the sustainable use of pesticides is rational risk reduction."
"We should achieve this objective by implementing the guidelines in the directive on the sustainable use of pesticides."
"Each country will be obliged to prepare its own plan in accordance with the guidelines given in the directive."
"Each country should be able to do this, taking into account local conditions and differences."
"We differ, primarily, in the level of agricultural development, I repeat: the level of agricultural development."
"Those countries that are new members of the European Union often have enormous work to do to catch up as regards the level of development."
"A reduction in the use of pesticides in these countries, as compared with the present level of their use, will, in the final analysis, work against us as consumers, unless, in reducing their use, we take into account the present level of use of these products, which is relatively low."
"Our landscape is different, too."
"In Poland enormous areas of woodland can be protected against pests only by spraying from the air."
"It is a duty to the natural environment to protect these forests, and it is Parliament's responsibility to set out guidelines for the safe use of products that protect the natural environment."
"The directive speaks a great deal about the farmer's level of knowledge being the most important factor for the implementation of sustainable use of pesticides."
"It is the responsibility of us all to support education and to create the conditions so that this information can reach every farmer."
"In tabling an amendment concerning temporary national allowances for pesticides I am speaking in favour of the mechanism for exchanging older preparations for modern and safer ones as quickly as is possible."
"I would ask for your support."
"The guidelines in the directive should encourage rational measures and they should not discourage Member States and farmers."
"Member of the Commission. - (EL) Madam President, I thank the speakers in tonight's sitting for their positive remarks."
"Permit me to set out briefly the Commission's views on certain important issues that have been raised."
"Let me begin with the thematic strategy and, in particular, with the points not covered by the directive."
"First of all, I am pleased that the report supports the thematic strategy for the sustainable use of pesticides."
"The proposal to bring in new legislation to deal with the risky of pesticide use is particularly good."
"I agree with how important more research is into the impact of the combined and cumulative use of pesticides on health."
"In my opinion, the principle of substitution is vital; it removes the most hazardous substances from the market and replaces them with safer alternative solutions, some of which are non-chemical."
"Finally, the Belohorská report adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety puts forward certain additional measures which are especially positive."
"Let me now turn specifically to the framework directive."
"Many of the amendments adopted by the European Parliament make useful clarifications and can be accepted."
"Other amendments, however, are liable to bring about undesired results."
"I should like first of all to comment on the basic amendments which the Commission can fully accept in principle or in part."
"The Commission partially accepts the proposal that Member States set up individual targets in their own national action plans for the restriction of the use of the most hazardous pesticides."
"Indeed, setting up such targets is consistent with the directive's general aim to reduce the risk of using pesticides."
"Laying down an overall, permanent target for the reduction of pesticide use at EU level, however, in addition to national targets, is not necessary and is therefore not endorsed by the Commission."
"In fact, the overall reduction of the quantity of pesticides does not necessarily entail a corresponding reduction in risk: the level of risk varies from one substance to another."
"Thus action to limit risk must focus, in the main, on the most harmful substances."
"The Commission can in principle accept the laying down of a minimum width for the buffer zones to be created in fields located next to water courses, because this will bring additional environmental gains."
"Imposing a limit of 10 metres, however, indiscriminately and in all cases, does not seem appropriate."
"The Commission would prefer Member States to have a margin of flexibility and set the appropriate width for buffer zones in line with their own geographical features."
"The Commission can also accept certain useful clarifications on other issues, such as technical training and certification."
"There are, however, amendments which the Commission cannot endorse."
"Firstly, the Commission is convinced that mandatory adherence to common general rules on integrated pest management by professional pesticide users is a fundamental measure to reduce dependence on pesticides."
"It is of important environmental benefit throughout the EU and will contribute to the development of a sustainable and competitive agriculture sector."
"I cannot, therefore, accept the elimination under Amendment 86 of this exceptionally important measure contained in the European Commission's proposal."
"Secondly, the European Commission agrees to take measures to protect populations living close to fields where aerial spraying is carried out."
"Nevertheless, it considers that a complete ban on the use of pesticides in so-called 'sensitive' areas is disproportionate."
"We must leave some discretion to Member States and local authorities."
"If this it ever necessary, and in exceptional, rare cases, when only the use of pesticides are effective, they must be allowed to deal with risks to human health or biodiversity."
"Thirdly, although the Commission has committed itself to looking into extending the directive's scope of application to biocides, such a decision requires careful study, as well as the implementation of certain aspects of the directive on pesticides."
"When more data is made available to us through the revision programme envisaged in the directive on biocides, we will be able better to deal with the use of biocides."
"Fourthly, the Commission cannot support the addition of a reference to Article 152(4) of the Treaty, since the proposed directive is clearly focused on environmental protection, which already includes public health issues."
"Fifthly, although the imposition of taxes and contributions complies with the 'polluter pays' principle, there is no effective system at the moment for differentiating tax rates according to the risk posed by each pesticide."
"For this reason the Commission prefers that taxes and contributions should be imposed at Community level not at the present stage but until such a time as a study has been carried out into the issue."
"Madam President, the Commission can accept 121 amendments of the 166 that were tabled; of these it can accept 25 fully and 96 in principle or in part."
"I am lodging with Parliament's secretariat a full list of the Commission's positions on the amendments."
"Let me once again to thank all those who have contributed to this evening's debate and in particular the rapporteurs for their work."
"Thank you for your attention."
"Member of the Commission. - (EL) Madam President, let me begin by reminding Members of the EU's current fundamental policy to promote and support healthy eating."
"Fruit and vegetables are certainly a very important in a healthy diet."
"It is very important to take this on board."
"We have thus two aims today."
"We need to guarantee fruit and vegetable production and this is a golden opportunity for production and to support of agriculture."
"Secondly, we must ensure that fruit and vegetables are safe for consumption."
"We believe that the Commission's proposal succeeds in tackling this dual challenge in a balanced fashion."
"I have followed the debate by all the MEPs with considerable interest."
"The arguments put forward are serious and we will take them properly into account."
"Owing to the pressure of time, I do not want to enlarge on all the issues."
"Let me just touch on two or three which I believe are very important and have been raised today."
"Firstly, on the subject of protecting vulnerable groups, I agree that we need to protect them, and this has been taken into account in the proposed regulation."
"We are also willing to accept the amendment to the included definition of vulnerable groups, simply because it guarantees their even greater protection."
"One comment I should like to make, although not directly connected with the subject under discussion, is on imported products: I stress that they are also monitored for pesticide residues thanks to another regulation on the maximum permissible levels of pesticide residues."
"We have inspection rules guaranteeing consumer protection for imports too."
"More generally, approval criteria are a very important part of the legislation."
"Indeed, the proposal's main aim is to protect the health of citizens and the environment."
"This is of great importance and we should not forget it."
"The proposed approval criteria are necessary to achieve this aim, so the Commission cannot accept any deviation from them."
"It is obvious from the debate and from some of the amendments that the European Parliament also shares these aims."
"Certain amendments would even strengthen these criteria."
"The Commission is of the view that the proposed criteria ought to ensure a high level of protection without making plant protection unworkable or dysfunctional."
"Consequently, the Commission will not be able to accept amendments which could undermine these criteria."
"I come finally to the controversial subject of mutual recognition, which is brought about by dovetailing the different zones in this sector."
"I believe that our proposal has been somewhat misconstrued."
"First of all, let me remind you that the new proposal will introduce stricter criteria, to be implemented on a zonal basis."
"We should bear this in mind, for it will ensure higher levels of protection for health and the environment. let us at the same time strive towards a single, market, internal market, thus avoiding the anomaly of a single market for agricultural products on the one hand, and a divided market for plant protection products on the other."
"If we bear in mind particular features relating to climate and soil, division into separate zones is inevitable."
"The issue is not, however, so simple and clear cut, hence I have predicted a possible misunderstanding."
"Whereas Member States might act to protect themselves and on the other hand, during the decision-making procedure which needs the approval of the first Member State of the zone, experts from other Member States will be able to play an active part in the licensing procedure and by doing so will be able to assess the circumstances for the entire zone."
"In other words, the decision will not be taken in isolation and unilaterally by a Member State belonging to the zone, but representatives of the other Member States in that zone will participate through this procedure."
"They will be able to present their views and to persuade others of the particular conditions prevailing in their countries."
"Let me single out water protection."
"This is also a sensitive point which has been raised by a number of MEPs."
"The proposal accounts for the need to protect water resources and especially the Framework Directive on Water Policy."
"If it is clear from the risk assessment that under the proposed terms of use the permissible limits be exceeded in vulnerable areas, the Member State involved can and must reject the use of pesticides in that particular area."
"Furthermore, if the Member State can prove that all its soil is a vulnerable area, it has the option not to approve the product in question at all."
"Therefore, the special features and the need to protect water resources are taken clearly into account in the new regulation's proposed procedure."
"For this reason, the Commission, while appreciating the comments made, would not be able to accept amendments relating to the system of approval on a zonal basis."
"As I have said, there are over 250 amendments, and there is no time to analyse them in detail."
"I see that we still have a difference of opinions, but I anticipate that the procedure and debate will enable us to find common ground."

"in writing. - Pesticides are among the most dangerous chemicals, as they are designed to kill and they are released deliberately into the environment and onto food."
"Only about 1% of a pesticide actually reaches its target."
"Therefore, when we prepare legislation on the use and on the permitting of pesticides, we have to keep in mind what is in the interests of the different stakeholders."
"It is in the interests of farmers to have a high harvest and good quality products with low costs."
"If they can attain this goal with less pesticide, they can save on costs and provide healthier products."
"It is in the interests of citizens to have safe, cheap products and pesticide-free drinking water."
"Therefore, using less and safer pesticides is in the interests of almost everyone."
"If we want to achieve tangible pesticide use reduction in Europe, we need effective national plans for reduction, focusing on the local circumstances and using local opportunities."
"in writing. - (HU) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have now been debating the details of this legislative package on plant protection products for a good many months."
"In this time we have examined numerous viewpoints and incorporated them into the text."
"As a result of this process, I think the draft we now have before us is one that is based on compromise in many respects and that meets as many demands as it possibly could."
"There are some issues, however, that should not be subject to compromise."
"When people's health is at stake, economic interests cannot be allowed to take precedence."
"This piece of legislation is not about the competitiveness of Europe's agricultural sector, but about protecting the health of European citizens."
"We have also seen that current rules in individual Member States differ widely."
"In my country they are among the strictest."
"While here in Strasbourg we have been debating whether a buffer zone of 5 or 10 metres should be established beside watercourses, Hungary has had buffer zones of 50 metres, and in some places even 500 metres, in place for decades. Moreover, although use of plant protection products by our farmers is 15 times lower than in the Netherlands, Europe's intervention stores, when they still existed, were bursting at the seams with Hungarian maize."
"In view of all these things, I ask my fellow Members to use their vote tomorrow to support the introduction of strict cut-off criteria."
"On the basis of the compromise draft text, this would apply to a mere 29 substances out of more than 600."
"This is not too high a price to pay for ensuring that proven carcinogenic and toxic compounds stay off the menu."
"Even if there are differences as a result of specific national situations when it comes to voting, we are agreed in this regard."
"Let us use our vote, then, to enable us to sit down to eat with a good conscience."
"in writing. - (SK) Just like we have medicines for people, we also have medicines for plants: pesticides can justifiably be called that since they are medicines in the fight against diseases, pests and weeds."
"Of course they must be used in accordance with set rules."
"Incorrect application results in organism failures that manifest themselves as cancer."
"Ladies and gentlemen, our approach to this issue must be based on scientific analysis."
"We must not succumb to pesticide hysteria unleashed in the European Parliament."
"Food self-sufficiency in Europe is falling and this is increasing the dependence of the agri-food industry on world market supplies."
"We must remember that a shortage of foodstuffs would lead to an increase in their prices."
"Following a consultation with experts, I consider some amendments of EU Directive 91/414/EEC and the Framework Directive on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety to be unworkable."
"These new components stray from the principle of focused and proportionate legislation based on a scientific approach."
"I realise that we need harmonised European pesticide legislation to ensure that foodstuffs are safe."
"That said, we must not prevent farmers from using the tools they need to produce safe, nutritious and accessible food."
"I cannot support the reports by Mrs Christa Klaß and Mrs Hiltrud Breyer as adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety."
"I will vote for them only if the amendments by my political group, the PPE-DE, are adopted."
"Verbatim Reports (amendment of Rule 173) (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Richard Corbett, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the amendment of Rule 173 of the Rules of Procedure, which deals with verbatim reports."
"rapporteur. - Madam President, I rise to propose, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, that we change the way in which we in this Parliament keep a record of our debates."
"We are all familiar with the verbatim report that we get the day after the debates, with each speaker's speech rendered in their own language."
"That will continue as now."
"There will be no change to the record, in the original language, of what everybody has said."
"What the Committee on Constitutional Affairs is proposing is to change the way in which we preserve the multilingual record of our debates."
"Instead of gradually translating the debates and then, some months later, having a full written translated record in every language, we propose a switch to a system whereby the debates are electronically preserved and where any citizen can access them through the internet the very next day and see a visual record of the debate, with the soundtracks for every single language, preserved from the interpretation booths."
"This will provide a more lively form of access to the debates than just a dry text."
"It will be available immediately, rather than several months later."
"I must confess that I was myself initially rather sceptical of this idea."
"I always thought that keeping a full paper record of what everyone said, which was archived and which people could look at for many years to come, was an inherent part of being a parliament."
"However, on reflection, and having listened to the arguments, I am now convinced that we can keep that multilingual access, albeit in a new form."
"The problem with the old system is that the translations not only cost a substantial amount of money but also, more importantly, are only available several months later."
"At the moment, they are placed on the web, where they are available electronically."
"They are no longer printed in the Official Journal."
"Very few people access them, look them up or use them, because of the time lag."
"With this new system of preserving the debates, on 'web television' if you like, they will be available the very next day, when they still have political immediacy and when people are still interested in them."
"We were also worried that historians, who, for all kinds of research reasons, tend to look back at parliamentary debates long after we have forgotten them, might be upset that we would no longer have a printed written version but only a visual multilingual version."
"We wrote to various associations of historians and others, and to my surprise they replied that they, too, thought it would be much more interesting to have a more lively record than just the printed text in translation."
"Viewing a debate on a monitor gives you the flavour of that debate."
"You can see the body language of the speakers, and you get much more than by just reading a dry text."
"Nonetheless, our report proposes a number of safeguards."
"Firstly, the plurilingual verbatim report that we already get the next day will continue."
"It will be there in all the original languages, as before."
"Secondly, any Member of this Parliament will have the guaranteed right to request a translation, if he or she needs it for his or her political work."
"The translation of any speech must be made rapidly available to the requesting Member."
"Thirdly, we provide that the Bureau may decide to ask for a written translation of a particularly important debate, which will then still be published in written form in every language."
"Fourthly, when extra language versions are available anyway, because they happen to have been translated - for instance, for a formal sitting at which a head of state is speaking, and courtesy translations have been provided - they too will be placed on Parliament's website."
"Therefore, when translations are available in other languages, we will make use of them."
"Finally, we ask the Bureau to look at technological developments to see if, for instance, in the future, computer translations can provide an extra tool, giving at least a rough idea of what was said in debates."
"In conclusion, this is a fair proposal whose advantages outweigh the disadvantages."
"It is not just a matter of costs; it is also about being a modern parliament and making our debates accessible much more rapidly, in a form which is much more useful."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Madam President, we have a free vote in our group, so I have no authority to speak for all my colleagues."
"We are again discussing the basic question whether a parliamentary service is worth the money or whether we must tighten our belt in response to the imperative of cutting costs."
"Let me say at the outset that I also regard the new concept of video presentation as a good idea which should not be jettisoned."
"Those people who want to have an immediate impression of our parliamentary proceedings can do so, and that is right and proper."
"In my opinion, however, that is not enough, because the archiving of written records is quite simply an essential service."
"Let me give you four reasons."
"Firstly, all of the world's parliaments make their plenary debates available in written form and archive them so that people can consult the records to find out what has been discussed in Parliament."
"Secondly, the video recording conveys a vivid and very interesting impression, but we also know that the hectic nature of proceedings often results in oral translations falling short of the quality we need."
"We know this internally from our dealings with the tabling office."
"We set up a tabling office ourselves to ensure that the formulation of motions and official documentation was absolutely correct."
"Because we operate so multilingually, we must exercise particular care."
"We want to continue taking the same care with our records of proceedings."
"Thirdly, the researchers who expressed their views on this subject may not have been fully aware of the implications, for although they might obtain a lively record, there is an underlying lack of rigour in the proposed approach."
"Besides, it is far easier to analyse a plenary debate if the researcher can enter a term, be it 'pesticides' or 'CO2', and be directed immediately to a debate on the matter in question."
"It would seem that this cannot be done with video recordings."
"In short, I believe that keeping written records represents value for money, and I am in favour of written archives in addition to video recordings."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (EL) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that from a political viewpoint the subject we are debating today is about two objectives of equal importance, as the rapporteur, Mr Corbett, has said."
"On the one hand there are the technical issues: how we can better implement translation in technical terms and economise on resources?"
"On the other, there is the issue of ensuring the greatest possible diversity of opinion, multilingualism and transparency in Parliament's work."
"Here I have to say that in a political assembly such as ours, which is of course multi-ethnic and political, language is of very great importance."
"Language is not just a means of communication; it is, as it were, a vehicle of culture, an expression of ideas, and long may this be so."
"The technical issue must not be allowed to obscure the debate on equality and the coverage of all subjects by all the languages, and in full equality."
"Let me point out that here we have another practical issue: how are we to achieve coverage in an economic way?"
"Various problems arise."
"The first is the relegation of the written word, a matter already referred to as important."
"I think that in politics we ought to preserve the written word."
"The second problem to be taken into consideration is the lasting record of our Parliament's business."
"Finally, if you will allow me to finish, Madam President: how can we make the work of our Parliament immediately available to the public, which I believe does not always have access to the internet?"
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, Mr Friedrich and I have tabled some amendments, which are not seeking to substitute new technology for old but to supplement the old with the new."
"It seems extremely unfair to stop the practice of 50 years of publishing a written script as soon as new Member States join Parliament, and it is, I think, essential for historians, for research purposes, that we carry on with our past practice."
"The printed word is the primary source and must be kept for reasons of consistency, transparency and simplicity of research at a time when we are seeking to promote the study of the European Parliament."
"We should show some self-respect as an institution and maintain forever the present practice."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, the Commission's initiative to amend Rule 173 of the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament makes me think again about the European Union."
"Who is the Union for?"
"Is it for ideologues or for the people?"
"If it is supposed to help people, then why is something being proposed that is against their interest?"
"What is it that we want to hide from people?"
"Yes, hide."
"I say that because the intention to limit access to information in one's own language will mean that."
"Why are citizen's fundamental rights being breached and why are people being discriminated against on the basis of the date they acceded to the European Union or the number of people in their country?"
"What is there in common between the principles of mutual respect and democracy and an attempt forcibly to bring about a situation where the inhabitants of the old EU Member States get materials, including written materials, in their own languages from the European Parliament, whilst the inhabitants of the new Member States are directed to websites to listen to recordings of debates."
"At the same time no attention is being paid to the fact that, in the new Member States, there are many people who cannot afford to have the internet at home."
"This affects millions of people; millions of people would be deprived of information."
"Justifying the proposed decision on grounds of costs sounds like a joke."
"Does this mean that we can afford to spend hundreds of millions of euros on unnecessary administration, on maintaining two or even three buildings for the Parliament, but we cannot afford to inform the people, the taxpayers, how the Union is spending their money and what are its plans."
"Ladies and gentlemen, if we have any respect for ourselves and for other people, there can be only one solution, with no machinations."
"We fulfil the instructions in Rule 96, which states: 'Parliament shall ensure the utmost transparency of its activities'."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, time and again this Parliament has had to struggle with a very lax attitude to democracy on the part of the European Council."
"This can lead to the number of seats in Parliament being increased by one without consultation, whereupon they simply speak of 750 plus one and think this keeps them on the right side of the law."
"What fills me with apprehension, however, is the thought that this attitude is taking root in such a way here in Parliament that some Members are seeking to put the most trivial pragmatic considerations before the most basic of principles."
"It seems so simple at first sight."
"The Rules of Procedure commit us to the utmost transparency in our activities - not to any old interpretation of transparency, nor to a form of transparency tempered by pragmatism or cost-benefit calculations, but to the utmost transparency."
"The audiovisual presentation does not match that description."
"An audiovisual presentation can be used for propaganda purposes or provide a quick source of information, but it does not offer a serious analysis of the words spoken in this House, of the discussions and debates that take place here."
"Of that there can be no doubt."
"Multilingualism is a guiding principle of this Parliament, and parliamentary debates form the core of our activity."
"Being in touch with the people is our foremost duty."
"If we give this matter even a moment's serious thought, we cannot deny that a parliament which sets itself apart from all other parliaments in the world by no longer archiving transcriptions of its debates is thereby sacrificing much of its parliamentary identity."
"With regard to the cost factor, it would be very simple to cut costs by transcribing the interpretation of proceedings rather than translating them here."
"That would also reflect the liveliness of the debate and reproduce it in the way in which it was actually understood and conducted."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Madam President, this Parliament is like the Tower of Babel, an allegory of the Habsburg Empire, which was full of sycophants."
"It is the European Union's attempt to build an international empire based on a unified creed, with federalists, liberals, cosmopolitans and sycophant humanist thinkers."
"The Tower was an idea of lunatics, however."
"Its ultimate failure is attributed to linguistic differences, or what is called 'multilingualism' in the European Union."
"The Corbett report seems to deny the nations of Europe to communicate effectively."
"Mr Corbett's idea to draw up Europe as a multilingual document is like waiting for Godot, which is a communicative stagnation."
"The report is a way to create a diversion from a real problem."
"To communicate and understand one another, we need a dialogue, not a monologue."
"The only instrument for this purpose is, therefore, translation into all 22 official languages."
"Otherwise we are heading towards communicative chaos."
"However, as the translation of my speeches into Polish sometimes does not even render 50% of what I have actually said, my Amendment 2 should therefore be included in the report."
"I would urge all Members to vote for amendments that aim to preserve translation into all 22 languages and reject Mr Corbett's Amendment 1, which has been tabled as the committee amendment on the voting list."
"rapporteur. - Madam President, Mr Podkański seems to be implying that the Committee on Constitutional Affairs was acting in violation of the Rules of Procedure."
"The Rules of Procedure require every language to be treated equally, and what the committee is proposing is simply that, instead of a written verbatim translation in every language, we have an audiovisual translation in every language."
"There is no discrimination between languages in this proposal."
"It is simply a question of whether we have a written record or an audiovisual record."
"In both cases, all the languages must be treated equally."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday, 24 October."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - We all know that Mr Corbett's report on the Rules of Procedure concerning verbatim reports is a sensitive issue."
"Do we want all speeches translated into all languages or is an audiovisual record in all languages accessible immediately through the internet enough?"
"I will not repeat the arguments put forward by Mr Corbett, who I support in this issue."
"I would just like to emphasise that we are in the heart of multilingualism."
"The question is how we best endorse this core principle of the Union."
"The options are spending at least EUR 10 million a year on translations that practically nobody reads, or spending that same amount on more important and urgent translations pending."
"Needless to say, I opt for the latter."
"Therefore I support Mr Corbett's approach."
"Community Strategy to reduce CO2 emissions from passenger cars and light-commercial vehicles (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Chris Davies, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the Community strategy to reduce CO2 emissions from passenger cars and light commercial vehicles."
"rapporteur. - Madam President, let me start with an accusatory question to the Commissioner."
"Some of us have pointed out repeatedly over the years that the car makers were failing to comply with the terms of the voluntary agreement to reduce emissions."
"So, why is it that, some five years after this first became evident, we still do not have legislation before us requiring the manufacturers to meet the agreed targets, because with each month of delay it becomes harder to achieve the ambitions which were originally possible?"
"This sets the framework for today's debate."
"Average emissions from new cars stand now at a little less than 160 g of CO2 per kilometre - a long way adrift from the target of 140 g by 2008."
"Therefore, it is not surprising that Members here want car makers to be punished for breaking their commitment."
"Yet the fact is that the manufacturers have broken no laws and, however much we may wish it were otherwise, the level of emissions is where it is."
"The Commission has announced that it wants to stick to the medium-term target setting that voluntary agreement of 120 g by 2012, but says that 10 g of this will now be achieved by complementary measures."
"I call this a political fudge: it has reduced the clarity of the target and encouraged some manufacturers to think that they can use biofuels as a means of avoiding significant design changes."
"But, given where we are, are the target and the timetable set by the Commission still appropriate, because, of late, the reduction in average emissions has been hardly more than 1 g a year?"
"The Commission suggests that this should instantly be transformed into 5 g a year."
"Well, that can be achieved - and the technology exists to do it - but at what cost?"
"Emission reductions must be made a priority for car makers, but they have to be achieved at the lowest possible expense."
"That means giving industry specific targets and sufficient time to make the changes."
"These improvements may increase the price of new cars but, then, reduced emissions mean improved fuel economy, so those who buy the cars will save money as they drive them."
"Get it right and we can take action which will be good for the environment, good for the consumer and good for the future of car making."
"There is a debate in this Parliament about whether, in a pre-legislative report of this kind, environmentalists should be pressing to send a strong signal to the Commission to be tough, or whether we should try to be realistic in framing measures which might actually be those that end up close to the final form at the end of the day."
"That is why I am asking Parliament to break from the Commission position and recommend that the target for average emissions from new cars should be set not for 2012 but for 2015 and should be 125 g to be achieved by technical means alone."
"By all means let us encourage the use of complementary measures to reduce emissions, but as an addition, not as a substitute, for these technical improvements."
"For those Members who say this is not sufficient, let me just say that next month we will be voting on the CARS 21 report and, in that, the recommendation is 135 g by 2015."
"We can end up voting for one thing this month and something else next month."
"If I can help bring together the different positions of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and of the Committee on Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, then I believe it will strengthen Parliament's position and influence."
"I believe that manufacturers should be set absolutely clear targets with no room for wriggling."
"This report insists that failure to comply should result in the application of tough financial penalties."
"I propose an internal trading mechanism to give manufacturers maximum flexibility and give incentives to the makers of low-emission vehicles."
"But, ultimately, it is the penalty regime that matters and that, I suspect, will test the Commission's resolve."
"Equally important is the need to set long-term targets to reduce emissions to below 100 g by 2020."
"Given sufficient time, and an absolute requirement, I have no doubt that manufactures can achieve reductions of nearly 40% over the next 13 years."
"Finally, let me just touch upon the way in which cars are promoted."
"The manufacturers always claim that they respond to consumer demand, but I do not believe this."
"I believe they shape consumer demand."
"Studies have shown that a very high proportion of advertising expenditure goes towards the promotion of cars on the basis of power and size and speed."
"The car industry is supposed to be drawing up a voluntary code of advertising conduct but we have had our fingers burnt through voluntary codes and any such measure should be regarded with suspicion."
"It is time that advertisements give consumers more details of the fuel economy and emission performance of the vehicles on sale."
"This information should be upfront and not buried away in the small print."
"We need to encourage car makers to compete on the basis that their cars are safe and stylish and environmentally-friendly."
"Let me finish with these remarks. Europe's car makers produce fine vehicles."
"The technical expertise of the companies themselves is much to be admired, but for too long they have ignored the contribution their products are making to the threat posed by climate change."
"For the sake of the planet, for the good of an industry that needs to stay at the cutting edge of world-class technology, it is time now for law-makers to steer them firmly in a greener direction."
"Member of the Commission. - (EL) Madam President, road transport, along with the other sectors of the economy, must contribute to efforts to reduce CO2 emissions in a bid to achieve the Kyoto Protocol targets and our future commitments for 2020 and beyond."
"Road transport is the second highest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the EU."
"Passenger cars alone are responsible for 12% of the EU's total emissions."
"It is worth noting that while total emissions in the EU of the 27 Member States fell by nearly 8% in the period between 1990 and 2005, emissions from road transport increased over the same time period by 25%."
"Here I should remind you that from 1995 the Commission set the target of 120 grammes, and the car industry was aware of it."
"Let me also remind you that there was a voluntary agreement on achieving a reduction of CO2 emissions to 140 gr per km by 2008."
"The Commission realised that this target would not be met by the car industry and the industry itself admitted this."
"As a natural consequence, the European Commission carried out a re-examination last February of the Community strategy for the reduction of CO2 emissions by new cars, with mandatory legislation based on an integrated approach through which the European aim of reducing emissions by new cars to 120 gr. by 2012 would be met."
"Dealing with the problem of CO2 emissions from cars is also expected to contribute to the hoped-for reinforced EU energy protection, by reducing our dependence on imported fossil fuels."
"This, of course, will lead to a reduction in consumer expenditure on fuel."
"Madam President, I am pleased to note that your report approves of our initiative in putting forward a legislative framework to reduce CO2 emissions by cars, and I thank the rapporteur, Mr Davies, for his efforts, as well as Mrs Harms and Mr Bulfon from the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, and the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection respectively, for their suggestions on the subject."
"The report sets out ambitious targets for the reduction of CO2 and stresses that greater and more long-term progress will be needed."
"The challenge is now to transform this political support into practical action."
"The draft report proposes various important areas of work are, two of which I should like to comment on."
"Firstly, your report points to the legitimate need of the car industry to have a time limit to be able to adjust smoothly to the new legislative arrangements."
"Of course, as I have said before, this reduction strategy dates back to 1995."
"Last month at the Frankfurt Motor Show, it was clear that the European car industry had made a significant response to the challenge of our new proposal."
"Within a short period of time car manufacturers have managed to put forward economically affordable technical solutions, which are significantly fuel-efficient."
"I am absolutely convinced that with our revised strategy and the imminent legislative framework we will offer car manufacturers equal terms of competition."
"Environmental performance will be the motivation, not competition based merely on car size or engine capacity."
"We can already see the first results."
"Now that petrol prices are reaching record highs, we must waste no opportunity in setting ambitious targets for the reduction of CO2 emissions in the European car industry."
"That will act as a strong incentive for innovation and renewal; it will also allow for major exports to emerging countries, where there is a great demand for fuel-efficient cars."
"Secondly, your report points to the need for certain important parameters to take into account in future legislation, such as those determined by social impact and affordable prices for consumers."
"Of course, fair treatment for all sides is very important."
"I want to stress that we firmly intend to propose legislation to assess the situation of all car manufacturers and avoid any unjustifiable distortion of competition."
"The overall target will be apportioned between car manufacturers in a sustainable and socially just manner."
"The integrated approach that we are proposing will help the sector to prepare for the challenges ahead and will avoid an unfair burden on specific enterprises or on the sector as a whole."
"These preliminary comments conclude what I have to say. Thank you for your attention."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, may I say to Mr Davies that we should recall clearly why we have to discuss stringent binding emission limits."
"The reason is that, following a voluntary agreement concluded between the Commission and the car industry more than ten years ago, the latter has knowingly and wilfully failed to meet its targets."
"The present situation, as we know, is not down to bad luck or an unforeseeable turn of events but to decisions taken by the senior management of manufacturing groups."
"For that reason, Mr Davies, I am somewhat stunned at the clear message you have now sent through your amendments - which I saw for the first time today, although they may have existed for longer - that, in spite of what was decided in the Environment Committee, you no longer have any interest in exerting pressure on the innovative potential and innovative power of the car industry in Europe"
"My opinion is that we can only achieve Europe's climate targets through the strict limits that were originally proposed by the Commission."
"It is also my opinion - and you rightly addressed this point, Mr Dimas - that we shall not be able to obtain security of energy supply for our transport needs unless we ensure without delay that cars become more efficient, because we cannot stand by and watch as oil that is valuable and hard to come by continues to be squandered on our roads."
"The third point, to which the Committee on Industry, whose opinion I drafted, attaches such great importance is the need to ensure at long last that the knowledge and ability of engineers and developers in the car industry are brought into play, and that these good engineers are not further stifled by misguided management policies."
"I am firmly convinced that nothing but efficient, climate-friendly and affordable but stylish cars would be on the market within a very short time and that those who are easing the pressure for innovation today by setting what are truly very soft time limits for achieving reduction targets, Mr Davies, will bear responsibility if the European car industry proves uncompetitive in the long run and if jobs are lost in car manufacturing in Europe."
"It goes without saying that the global car market will change out of all recognition - assuming we accept the underlying premises of our climate policy and our UN climate policy - and that those who are now applying the brakes to the process of reducing emission limits will then bear responsibility for the car industry in Europe going to the dogs and for a situation in which we ourselves no longer take our own climate policy seriously."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. - (DE) Madam President, I acknowledge the car as a universal means of transport, and I acknowledge the contribution of the car industry to the prosperity of Europeans."
"I do not, however, believe in the car as a fetish."
"For that reason it is incomprehensible to me that manufacturers should design cars to travel at speeds in excess of 125 miles per hour."
"Building efficient, environment-friendly cars is a necessity, given all the evidence of climate change."
"In addition, Europe is duty-bound to set a good example to the booming emerging markets."
"It is ultimately the consumer's choice that will determine which cars are driven in the years to come."
"This is why I argued in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection for transparent and more easily understandable information on the emission ratings of vehicles."
"I call on the Commission to take this report as the starting point for the presentation of an ambitious legislative proposal and to act quickly."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, can I first of all thank Mr Davies very much indeed for all the work that he has put into this report, and for his extremely constructive cooperation."
"I am happy, on behalf of my Group, to endorse the target of 125 g by 2015 that Mr Davies has outlined."
"It is a target which, I think, is extremely environmentally ambitious, but it is also achievable by what is a very successful European industry employing hundreds of thousands of people, and we must ensure that it remains a successful European industry."
"I am convinced that those European car manufacturers will continue to produce some of the most environmentally friendly cars in the world, and these new targets - which, we should never forget, are the tightest in the world - will help them to achieve even cleaner cars in the future."
"But the missing link in this debate is, of course, that of consumer demand."
"We must make sure that consumers are demanding cleaner, more environmentally friendly cars, and, there, the Member States themselves have a very important role to play through their tax systems, which is, rightly, a matter for them."
"They can, however, considerably affect consumer demand by introducing the correct environmentally friendly taxation schemes."
"We also, in my view, need contributions to CO2 reduction from all of the related sectors: from the oil companies, from the biofuel producers, from the tyre manufacturers etc., all of whom have a contribution to make and can help us to achieve our ambitious targets."
"I have also tabled some amendments to water down what I think are some very prescriptive requirements on advertisers, which Mr Davies has included in his report."
"I think they are grossly disproportionate to the problem, and I am sure that, given sufficient opportunity, the manufacturers and the advertisers can come up with a binding voluntary code which would be equally effective."
"I have also tabled - jointly with Mr Davies - an amendment to recognise the contribution of small-volume manufacturers who do not have a huge product range with which to average out the emissions requirements."
"I hope the Commission will take those into account when formulating the legislation."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Ladies and gentlemen, Madam President, Commissioner, this is a matter of urgency, as we all know."
"Al Gore, who rang the alarm bell, has been awarded the Nobel Prize, and it is time for the European Union to stop talking and to act, because this is not a new issue."
"There was a voluntary agreement entered into by car manufacturers to achieve average emissions of 140g of CO2 per kilometre by 2008, and that agreement was not kept."
"I would remind you that the European Parliament itself fixed the target of 120g by 2005 or 2010 at the latest."
"There is no justification today for backing away from those targets."
"So what we need is an ambitious, unambiguous and binding directive and it needs to set targets in two stages."
"First, in the short term, we need a target of 120g of CO2 for new cars and a 10g reduction to be achieved through complementary measures."
"We need to move swiftly, however, and we therefore support the vote in the Committee on the Environment for the target to be achieved in 2012, with binding steps from 2009 onwards so that by 2012 the target will be met in full for all vehicles."
"As the second stage, we believe it is essential to set targets of 95g for 2020 and 70g for 2025, with an intermediary deadline in 2016 to ensure that we are on track."
"We therefore support the ambitious roadmap prepared by the Committee on the Environment because we think it succeeds in setting clearly visible standards, while at the same time confronting us with the technology gap that we need to overcome in order to meet our Kyoto Protocol commitments."
"Yes, of course, it is going to be expensive and there will have to be negotiation about the price of new vehicles."
"The first thing to note is that not all cars and not all manufacturers achieved the same effectiveness under the voluntary agreement."
"Yes, we do need to favour small cars over large cars and we need to come up with tax measures, new practices and even bans in some cases, particularly in built-up areas, to prevent large vehicles, including 4x4s, from polluting our towns and cities all day long and producing huge quantities of CO2."
"This question is particularly important because the bigger the vehicles that manufacturers produce, the bigger their profit margins."
"We therefore need to guide the market in such a way that manufacturers producing smaller, less polluting vehicles can be more profitable than those producing big high-polluting cars and, as well as setting standards, we expect the Commission to propose strategies for moving in that direction."
"The last point I should like to stress is the importance of proper information for vehicle purchasers to help them pick their way through this minefield, and specifically we need to get rid of misleading advertising."
"That is why my group has tabled an amendment requiring a labelling system for all cars, based on an A-G format for energy efficiency, so that all consumers can make an active choice in favour of the environment."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Madam President, when it comes to discussing CO2 emissions, we are very quick to talk about cars, simply because the way to a person's guilty conscience is through their car."
"That is why Mrs Harms, the Greens and many environmental organisations are particularly keen to talk about cars."
"We are faced with a broken voluntary pledge - no doubt about that - and we therefore need regulation."
"We have no alternative."
"What you came here and told us, Mrs Harms, about the voluntary commitment being deliberately and strategically torpedoed by the car industry seems rather far-fetched to me."
"Let me just remind you that a market comprises not only suppliers of products but also those who demand them."
"We ourselves help to create demand too, and shortly, when we are driven home by the car service, we shall be using those very cars that do not meet the targets to which the car makers committed themselves."
"I should like to see an initiative from the Greens."
"If your intentions are honourable, please now make sure that the small cars which meet next year's voluntary target are ordered for Parliament."
"In future legislation, it is imperative for us to ensure that the desired reductions stand up to cost-benefit analysis."
"The Stern report which you and the Greens like to quote, Mrs Harms, calculates that, of 13 potential CO2-reduction measures, those targeting cars at the very top of the price range are actually the least effective."
"Anyone making political demands for stringent emission limits and more efficient cars must recognise that the development and production cycle in the car industry takes five to seven years."
"It is by failing to recognise that, Mrs Harms, that we put jobs at risk, not by recognising it."
"I am therefore pleased that our rapporteur has done just this by saying that it is unrealistic to set any deadline before 2015."
"Tomorrow Parliament will vote in favour of one of the options on the table, and it must be said that, whatever it is, whatever year is designated and whatever average value is set, it will still be more stringent and ambitious than any other regime in the world."
"We should not lose sight of that."
"There is an extremely fine line between carrot and stick for our car industry, and at the end of the day we must take great care to ensure that we really do export the best products and not perhaps our industry."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, I think this is the right moment to inform the outside world about what this Callanan-Davies deal is."
"So, what is it?"
"It is delaying action from 2012 to 2015."
"We have calculated the CO2 impact: 125 g in 2015 is worse than 130 g in 2012."
"And the second part of the deal is exemptions for small-volume producers."
"That is 300 000 cars a year, so that is not 'small volumes'."
"I think that what we are voting on this week, Mr Davies' initiatives, are from a Green Liberal climate hero who has become a climate Judas."
"It is really incredible: instead of using the possible centre-left majority in this House for 120 g in 2012, siding with reactionary Tories to help the car industry in Europe to win time - that is really not the way forward."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (NL) Mr President, in the past few months my fellow Members and I have met a great many representatives of the motor industry."
"I do not think there has ever been so much lobbying over a report."
"The industry has used every possible argument to prevent measures limiting CO2 emissions or at any rate to delay them."
"It seems that they have won over many of my fellow Members, including the rapporteur, although fortunately the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety was fully aware of its task."
"Let me be clear: the motor industry is entirely responsible for this Commission proposal."
"Attempts to agree on voluntary regulation were a miserable failure."
"It seems that only compulsory standards are effective."
"I find complaints that it all has to be done so quickly quite hypocritical, because the industry has known for years that these measures had to come."
"The environment has to be cared for now, with drastic measures."
"We have to do that, for ourselves and for future generations."
"I am therefore urging a vote against Amendment 42, tabled by Mr Callanan and Mr Davies."
"The amendment increases the maximum amount of CO2 and postpones the agreed date of 2012 to 2015."
"That gives commercial interests priority over the environment and we absolutely cannot allow that."
"What is Mr Davies trying to do to us?"
"Madam President, on behalf of my colleagues in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, I would like to thank Mr Davies for the way he has approached this, particularly his willingness to listen, and for a number of innovative approaches that we see in his report."
"I also want to thank our rapporteur, Mr Bulfon, and to thank Mr Davies for adopting a number of our proposals in his report."
"We have heard a lot of debate and discussion this evening about the car industry missing targets and about how we are going to move forward."
"But I would like to echo what the Commissioner said and use the word 'incentive'."
"This programme, and to meet the programme that Mr Davies has set out, is going to need billions and billions of euros of investment in new products and is going to tie up immense resources in engineering and product development."
"(Objections)"
"I see my Green colleagues already shaking their heads; they seem to think that the technology is there, that overnight we can change a fundamental industry in that direction."
"This is entirely unrealistic - where is the investment going to come from?"
"It is going to come from the profits of the car companies."
"We need to sustain those profits so that they can reinvest them."
"This demand here will be the biggest change and turnaround we have ever seen in a major industry."
"Let us just remember that."
"Let us not just sit here and make unrealistic demands."
"This is a practical approach."
"But, colleagues, let me remind you - and I refuse to accept this sort of crowing - I am absolutely not a lobbyist for the car industry."
"I have argued for a long time that we need to set demanding targets."
"We are moving towards a legislative approach for the first time."
"But you should be listening as well."
"And let me just make this other point."
"Ideas about complementary measures and other things: what we are talking about here is a complete change in the way that people approach transport and motoring."
"These new vehicles will come on the market over a long period of time."
"But actually the complementary measures we are talking about - the consumer measures, the consumer information - those are the real incentives that we need to bring in."
"I am sorry to overrun, Madam President, but you will admit I was interrupted by some colleagues in an entirely unnecessary way."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, this report, which Chris Davies has drawn up on the initiative of the Environment Committee, should signal to the Commission that the European Parliament is serious about reducing CO2 emissions."
"When I see the amendments on the table, I start to wonder about that."
"There are three points we should bear in mind."
"Firstly, from 1 January 2012, new cars in Europe must not emit more than 120g of CO2 per kilometre."
"We should not tamper with that date or the emission limit."
"In 1998 the car industry made a voluntary commitment to reduce CO2-emission levels in its new vehicles."
"In the light of news reports about the continuing advance of climate change, I see no reason at all for us to interfere with the deadline or the ceiling."
"Secondly, future legislation must spell out clearly that the CO2 emissions of all cars must be reduced."
"Large cars must make a greater contribution, but smaller cars must contribute too, so that we can achieve 120 grams by 2012."
"My third point is that cars must remain affordable for people."
"I agree with the previous speaker on that."
"I come from a predominantly rural area, where people are dependent on cars to get them to their places of work."
"For this reason, future legislation must perform a balancing act to reconcile the needs of the environment with those of the economy."
"What good are strict emission limits if people can no longer afford new cars and drive about in their ageing vehicles?"
"It takes more than eight and a half years to renew the entire fleet of passenger cars on Europe's roads, and this must be in the back of our minds when we adopt new legislation."
"Future legislation on CO2 emissions from passenger cars should be guided by the need to guarantee better protection of the climate as well as affordable driving."
"(HU) Thank you, Mr President."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I could begin like one of those old jokes: I have some good news and some bad news; which do you want to hear first?"
"I will start with the good news: the European Union is leading the battle to combat climate change; the 27 EU countries are now doing more than anywhere else in the world to halt climate change."
"Now for the bad news: if the thousands of scientists around the world are right, then even this is much too little."
"What then are we to do?"
"The answer leaves no room for doubt: we need a paradigm shift."
"It is to be commended that Mr Davies' report highlights a number of important elements."
"However, anyone who thinks that we will have solved anything by reducing carbon dioxide emissions from the ever-increasing number of vehicles we use to 120g or 95g is gravely mistaken."
"In my opinion, we can and must vote in favour of this report, and at the same time we must compel vehicle manufacturers to produce smaller and more efficient engines."
"We must not stop there, however."
"The European Union must commit itself unequivocally to technological change in the transport sector too."
"Every means available must be used to promote research and development and innovation in this field, and we must stop providing any kind of support for conventional technologies."
"Member States must borrow the best solutions from each other as soon as possible to provide manufacturers and consumers with legal, economic and other incentives."
"Furthermore, while we are on the subject, I do not believe, for example, that biofuels are going provide the ultimate solution to our problems, especially not the current, first-generation biofuels."
"They do seem, however, to be a necessary step on the way towards alternative fuels, as are hydrogen and electric propulsion systems and many other systems that are not yet widely used or have yet to be devised."
"Let us help to foster these with the present vote and future legislation. Thank you very much."
"Mr President, I will not comment on this new cosying up between the British Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives, as has been displayed by Mr Callanan and Mr Davies here tonight."
"Maybe it is the new leadership battle for the Lib-Dems that has been going on, since some of their new leaders even have lookalikes!"
"What I want to talk about is the importance of sticking with ambitious targets."
"I do not think industry can have been very surprised that the Commission talked about 2012 as a date for the targets or about the level of the target, because, of course, we know these have been mooted for many years."
"Back in March, the EU leaders signed up to cut overall CO2 emissions by 20% by 2020."
"If we are going to get there, we need to bring forward legislation which helps us to get there."
"So, here we are at the very first hurdle towards that, and I do not think it is time now to fail in this European Parliament."
"People out there are watching."
"They want to know we are serious about tackling climate change."
"Of course we have to work with industry, and Mr Davies talks about punishing industry."
"Nobody wants to punish industry because the car industry, as Mr Harbour has just said, is a major European industry; it is a major employer and we have to work with them because only they can deliver these changes that we need to see."
"So we need to work with them and we need to listen and I think what we need beyond everything else is a long-term project which everybody has signed up to so that everybody knows where we are going and everybody can try to get there."
"Finally, on labelling and advertising. We need a clear system, a green car labelling system, that every consumer can understand, just as they understand, when they buy white goods, how those white goods work."
"The white goods manufacturers of inefficient goods have actually seen their products fall off the market."
"We need to see the same for cars and I hope we can work together with industry to get a green labelling system that everybody understands."
"(ET) So far our climate policy has focused principally on the energy sector."
"Aviation is the next sector which will be incorporated into the European Union's emissions trading system."
"Land transport, however, has a major influence on climate change and the Davies report is a thoroughly welcome initiative."
"The car industry needs clear, long-term targets for reducing the level of CO2 emissions in exhaust gases and I support Mr Davies' approach whereby long-term limits will be established for CO2 emissions, for example for 2020 or 2025."
"The car industry has had plenty of time to reduce the level of CO2 emissions."
"We should not accept continued procrastination: the technological solutions already exist."
"Similarly, I hope that Parliament will support the amendment I tabled to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Security, under which the car industry would have to reduce CO2 in exhaust emissions to 120g/km by 2012."
"(PL) Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on the report."
"When discussing the whole issue of the Community's strategy to reduce CO2 emissions, it should be remembered that, in Europe alone, two million people are employed in the automotive industry, and another 10 million jobs are linked to this sector."
"This industry represents 3.5% of European GDP."
"The export value is EUR 33.5 billion and, what is no less significant, each year motor taxes generate EUR 365 billion for Member States."
"The Community's strategy to reduce CO2 emissions will be successful only if it is thought through properly and provides sufficient time for producers to develop appropriate technological solutions."
"I am in favour of introducing an appropriate transition period because the production cycle in the automotive industry is complex and needs a long time to adapt."
"It would seem therefore that the best date for the introduction of the regulations would be 2015, also because the Euro 6 Regulation will come into force in that year."
"I also think that there should be an integrated approach to CO2 emissions."
"Research studies have indicated that to achieve the objective of 120g/km just through improvements in automotive technology will result in an increase of around EUR 3 600 in the average price of a car, which may result in many brands of cars becoming less accessible to the average EU citizen."
"For this reason, basing CO2 emissions exclusively on engine technology is the most expensive solution."
"One could achieve the 120g level by introducing additional solutions, such as introducing biofuels to a greater degree than at present, as well as by introducing additional solutions in vehicles, such as signals to change gears or low resistance tyres."
"(NL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, private cars are responsible for 12% of all CO2 emissions."
"We all know that."
"It is clear that that sector has to make a major effort to achieve the agreed standards for 2020."
"It is also clear that we have to be ambitious and set the bar high."
"It is clear, too, that car manufacturers will not be able to do that alone."
"An integrated approach is needed; they should not have to take sole responsibility."
"Flanking measures therefore have to be taken."
"Better air conditioning, better roads and a change in driver behaviour - in other words, all of us."
"The sector deserves support from the government because the motor industry employs a large number of people, directly or indirectly."
"First of all, I am therefore appealing to national governments to modify their motor taxes as a matter of urgency, so that consumers switch to environmentally friendly cars of their own accord."
"Secondly, I appeal to the Commissioner, the Commission and Europe to conduct an assessment of the 2009 multiannual budget in order to invest even more research funding in new research technologies for low CO2 cars."
"I know you recently announced an ambitious programme to invest EUR 500 million in hydrogen technology."
"Of course that is fantastic, but it is medium-term."
"Obviously solutions have to be found for the new engine technology in the short term as well."
"I am sure that, whether it is by 2012 or a little later, smart car manufacturers will reach the goal of 120g much more quickly than planned. Simply because - and I do not want to be naïve - the market demands it."
"In that sense the context has changed completely in the past couple of years."
"It is therefore important that we approve the compromise proposals by Mr Callanan on marketing and advertising, because they are transparent."
"It is a question of giving consumers clear information."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to start by expressing my appreciation for the quality of this evening's debate."
"I would like to comment, time permitting, on three of the issues you have addressed."
"Regarding the ambitious level of the strategy, the Commission has proposed its strategy on the basis of a thorough impact assessment."
"We have analysed the various options of a level to reduce CO2 emissions from cars, taking into account measurability, monitorability and accountability."
"On this basis we have proposed to deliver the 120 g of CO2 per kilometre objective through an integrated approach."
"One hundred and thirty grams will be delivered through passenger car technology and ten additional grams will be provided through complementary measures, including fuel efficiency targets for light commercial vehicles and an increased use of biofuels."
"This approach towards achieving the 120 g target is, in our view, the most cost-effective combination of options, and we will thus propose legislation accordingly."
"Secondly, the legislative framework implementing the integrated approach will be the central pillar of our revised strategy, but it is not the only one."
"As underlined in your report, finding ways to encourage consumer demand for fuel-efficient cars will enable us significantly to reduce their environmental impact, along with the fuel bill of drivers in the European Union."
"In the context of the review in the Car Labelling Directive, we will take into account the recommendations made by Parliament in the field of consumer information."
"Thirdly, the Commission agrees that a longer-term strategy should be considered, in order to provide predictability to car makers."
"We will thus consider the potential for progress beyond 2012, and the 120 g objective, on the basis of an impact assessment."
"In this context, the Commission will take into account the recommendations made by Parliament concerning future emission targets."
"I believe I have addressed some of the main concerns that have been voiced, and I hope that Plenary will adopt a resolution which strongly supports the approach proposed by the Commission."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday, 24 October."
"Conventional energy sources and energy technology (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Reul on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy on conventional energy sources and energy technology [http://www.europarl.eu.int/oeil/FindByProcnum.do?lang=2&procnum=INI/2007/2091"" ]."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since I have a few extra minutes, let me begin by thanking the Commission, the Secretariat of our Committee and the other rapporteurs."
"It was not such an easy task, and I am grateful that we managed to cooperate in an objective manner and to seek out the widest possible common ground on what is not an entirely straightforward issue."
"Our work was based on three communications from the Commission, and our aim in this report was to provide answers in the three areas covered by those communications, which we managed to do by a large majority in the responsible committee."
"The starting point was a generally accepted principle that is restated in every debate on energy policy, namely the view shared by the Commission and Parliament that energy policy has three major goals - competitiveness, in other words affordable prices, protection of the environment and security of supply."
"The conclusion that the solution lay in the continuing development of new and existing energy technology was certainly the easiest part of the report to deal with."
"Technology is the key to the pursuit of these three goals."
"In a world in which demand for energy is constantly growing while the supply of fossil fuels is steadily dwindling, it is therefore crucial that we invest in research and innovation and try to make progress in these areas."
"We need only look at the potential for increasing the generation efficiency of coal-fired power stations, which averages 34% at the present time but could be raised to 55% through the use of state-of-the-art technology."
"If a third of old plants were replaced by cutting-edge facilities, fuel consumption could be reduced by 30%."
"That is just a small example of the opportunities offered by new technology."
"We also spoke about two energy sources which are very different from each other but which share the distinction of provoking the greatest political controversy."
"No one doubts that the share of fossil fuels, which accounted for 79% of gross domestic fuel consumption in the European Union in 2004, will remain high in the foreseeable future."
"However long this may continue, the fact is that we will certainly have to operate with fossil fuels for some time to come."
"Coal is a major factor that plays an important role - one reason, of course, being that it is one of the few energy sources, or indeed the main energy source, that we possess in Europe, even if its availability varies between Member States."
"This is a significant advantage, particularly in terms of the security of our energy supplies."
"This means - and this was an important point in our discussions - that when we say coal has a future, which the Commission has thankfully described, we must ensure that the critical aspects of coal use are addressed."
"One of these critical aspects is the emission of carbon dioxide."
"One option is greater efficiency and better technology, and the other option is to try to use new technology to separate CO2 and store it underground - the famous carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology."
"That is easier said than done of course, but there are indications that it works."
"We have acknowledged that in this report and have advocated promoting the development of CCS technology, because it gives us a chance to go on benefiting from coal, which is a very reliable source of energy for us in Europe."
"This is why we have also stressed that we need to tread warily, that carbon capture can reduce generation efficiency and that it is therefore difficult to estimate when CCS technology could come on stream."
"Above all, we must do our homework and formulate the appropriate legal provisions."
"The third and most controversial part of the report relates to the issue of nuclear energy."
"Nuclear plants account for more than 30% of power generation in Europe, and nuclear power has advantages that are undeniable, whatever our political views."
"It is there, it is affordable, and it makes a major contribution to security of supply."
"In terms of reducing CO2 emissions, it is an extremely exciting and interesting option, and I do believe it would be reckless if we simply pushed this form of energy aside and did not even consider it."
"We succeeded - not without difficulty - in finding formulas to which a large majority could subscribe and which conveyed the message that airing these ideas is part and parcel of a full debate but that the decision to adopt or reject them is a matter for the Member States."
"That is quite an important point, but our intention is to contribute to the area for which Europe bears some responsibility, namely security of supply."
"In this respect it is a wise move to establish the High-Level Group on Nuclear Safety and Waste Management and the European Nuclear Energy Forum, and it is undoubtedly right, as postulated in the Illustrative Nuclear Programme for the Community (the PINC paper), to carry this debate forward and, when we discuss investments in new technology, not to turn our backs on any potential solution."
"In short, an energy mix does not mean sifting out particular sources of energy but taking all sources into consideration."
"I hope we shall manage to adopt this resolution tomorrow in the form in which it was approved by a large majority in committee."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate Mr Reul on his report."
"It comes as the last report from the European Parliament in the follow-up of the energy and climate change package from 10 January."
"The other two reports, by Mr Vidal-Quadras and Ms Thomsen, have given the Commission valuable input for further formulation of the proposals."
"The first concerns our preparation of the internal market package, and the second, the continuing work on the Directive on Renewable Energy."
"I am also very grateful for the timely input Mr Reul and this House will provide in the area of energy innovation, clean fossil fuel and nuclear energy."
"On many accounts, the Commission is already in line with the calls of Parliament and is working on a number of outstanding issues identified in the report."
"Europe needs to achieve the important goal of combating climate change."
"For that, and also for security of supply, we need low-carbon, highly efficient energy technologies."
"We also need to use fossil fuels in a more sustainable way."
"And it will be difficult to achieve our climate change goals without the use of nuclear energy."
"Let me start by addressing the issue of energy innovation."
"The Commission intends to present the European Strategic Technology Plan at the end of November."
"Europe has proven to be successful in setting a regulatory framework in support of low-carbon technologies."
"Targets have been agreed for energy savings and for renewable energy."
"We are also building a truly internal market."
"There is no doubt that these are the basis for the third Industrial Revolution."
"However, this is far from enough."
"If we only depend upon imported low-carbon technologies, we will fail our security of supply and competitiveness objectives."
"The analyses currently under way in the Commission show that Europe is falling short in the development of low-carbon technologies."
"In essence, we are not able to convert the high quality, basic research that is done in the EU into world leading technologies."
"Today, we do not focus sufficiently on matching research to business developments, by building pilot and demonstration plants to get up to full commercial scale."
"For Europe to lead the world in innovation for climate change and energy security, it is essential to be more efficient in the management of the resources invested in energy innovation."
"We therefore need better, joint strategic planning at EU level, as well as more effective implementation of energy technology programmes and measures."
"Furthermore, and as was stated in Mr Reul's report, we have to mobilise additional financial and human resources for energy technology research and demonstration."
"We have already increased the budget for energy in the seventh Framework Programme by 50% and for the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme by 100%."
"This could not have been achieved without strong support from the European Parliament."
"Member States are also going down this road, and I am convinced that the private sector will do the same, once the framework conditions are right."
"This applies in particular to industrial-scale demonstration projects and early market deployment, as well as to the fundamental role of small- and medium-sized enterprises."
"I will now turn to the second part of the report: the challenges associated with conventional sources of energy."
"We must recognise that these energy sources will play a substantial role in the energy mix for years to come."
"We share the same view: that we need to make the transition from traditional to sustainable fossil fuels."
"Before the end of the year, the Commission will take further steps to address the use of modern technologies in power generation from fossil fuels."
"In particular, the Commission will address the issue of the legal framework for the capture of carbon dioxide and its geological storage."
"We will table a legislative proposal which aims at establishing the regulatory framework in order to provide legal certainty, and to ensure public confidence in the safety of carbon capture and storage (CCS) deployment."
"I am also currently preparing a communication to set the political framework in support of CCS."
"I agree that CCS will require significant research efforts before it can be commercially viable."
"This is why CCS will be included among the strategic energy technologies in the Strategic Energy Technology Plan."
"This is also why we are singling it out for communication in connection with the legislative proposal."
"In parallel with continuous research and development efforts, the EU needs to move on demonstration plants."
"Such projects will provide invaluable experience."
"They will allow us to optimise existing technologies, and to identify and respond to the remaining challenges."
"The goal is clear: to see several large-scale demonstration plants operational in the EU by 2015, and to bring the technology to the market by 2020."
"This will not happen unless there is strong commitment from the European private sector and strong, supportive government policies."
"The Commission is ready to lead, but it will be necessary to get the full support of Member States and of the European Parliament."
"I will now come to nuclear energy."
"I am pleased to note that your message regarding nuclear energy is fully in line with our conclusions in the communication on a Nuclear Illustrative Programme, as widely supported by the Economic and Social Committee."
"I am also glad that the first meeting of the High Level Group on Nuclear Safety and Waste Management took place on 12 October."
"The group has a mandate to progressively develop common understanding and, eventually, a higher level of nuclear safety."
"I share the report's view that an open dialogue on nuclear energy is essential."
"For this reason, the Commission has set up a nuclear forum, on the lines of the other energy forums."
"The aim of the Nuclear Forum is to enlarge the debate on nuclear energy, and to involve all the relevant players."
"On 26-27 November, the first meeting of that forum, also called the Bratislava/Prague Forum, will take place."
"I trust it will mean more transparency in allowing for consultation with, and between, all stakeholders."
"I am pleased that the European Parliament will also participate."
"I would like, once again, to congratulate the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs for their excellent report."
"I thank the European Parliament for its support and cooperation."
"We will use this report in our further work, and I definitely look forward to the debate."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development. - (DA) Mr President, excuse me, but this report is not good, and neither has the work process in connection with it been good."
"Why has the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy not listened to the statements from other committees?"
"On behalf of the Committee on Development I regret the fact that we have only been asked for a statement on the Commission's carbon emissions."
"Energy efficiency and savings and our most important criticisms are far too weak."
"In addition, they are otherwise entirely decisive for the developing nations."
"There is a huge amount of energy to be obtained through savings, and there are known technologies available, and for the developing nations at least it is much, much more important than CSS."
"In general, this also applies to the industrialised nations."
"In addition, why is oil being forgotten completely?"
"The high oil prices are a major burden for the developing nations, particularly within the transport sector, where oil is dominant."
"In addition to improving efficiency, there is a need for other transport models."
"However, renewable energy is crucial if the developing nations are to develop, and it is grotesque that this is barely mentioned in the report."
"The proposal is blunt, and the views of the Committee on Development are not included in any way. I would therefore like to urge everyone to address this tomorrow."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. - (PL) Mr President, I would agree with the opinion of Herbert Reul as regards diversification in electricity generation, diversification of supply and improvements in energy efficiency and usage."
"The fact that natural resources are continually dwindling is nothing new to scientists working in the area of energy supply."
"For years, leading research centres have been observing the level of usage of natural resources and have published alarming reports."
"The findings of these reports show unequivocally that continued reliance solely on conventional methods of generating energy could, in future, lead the global economy to an energy crisis."
"Dwindling natural resources means that Europe will increasingly have to import from neighbouring countries, which can result in a gradual dependence on suppliers."
"We have already seen the negative consequences of such a policy on a number of occasions in neighbouring countries."
"For this reason one of the principal challenges facing the European Union is diversification of energy sources as well as to work on creating new energy generation technologies."
"Positive policies in this area will be beneficial not just to society and the economy, but also to the natural environment."
"At this point, however, I would like to emphasise that not all countries will be able to pursue this policy in the short term."
"This is linked to historical conditions that resulted in the power sector, for many years, being backward in comparison with the countries of the old EU."
"For this reason, from the perspective of a citizen of such a country, I would like to point out that, as I said, Poland or the other countries in this geographical area will have to cover more ground than the countries of western Europe in modernising the power sector."
"Please consider this particular point."
"Taking climate change into account, the EU should become more involved in work on clean coal technology as the optimal solution for the natural environment, especially in those countries where the power sector in largely dependent on the use of coal."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (HU) Thank you for the opportunity to speak, Mr President."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report before us makes no secret of the fact that there are major arguments against conventional forms of energy."
"The issue most talked about nowadays in this connection is that of climate change."
"Not only do fossil energy sources contribute to global climate change, however; they also make Europe more dependent on external suppliers."
"Allow me to cite one example from Hungary to illustrate my point."
"In a country where raw materials are in short supply, gas comprises 50% of the energy mix, 80% of this deriving from a single external source, namely Russia."
"This results in a degree of dependency that not only has far-reaching social and economic consequences, but can also exert considerable influence on Hungary's international relations."
"At the same time, however, these figures and others like them show that conventional energy sources are inevitably going to play a major role in Europe's energy supply in the decades ahead, even if renewable energies gain ground."
"To state the contrary would be tantamount to sticking our heads in the sand."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the contradiction between the necessity of conventional sources and the risks associated with them must, however, be resolved."
"I believe Mr Reul's report presents the necessary toolkit for doing just this."
"I agree with the rapporteur that the European Union needs to focus on three fundamental objectives when establishing policy on conventional energy sources: increasing efficiency, and, connected to this, exploiting the potential of research and development, and reducing dependency on external sources."
"The best example of this last point is the Nabucco project; construction of this gas pipeline would represent a significant step towards diversification and so it is in the Community's interests to make it happen. Thank you very much, Mr President."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PL) Mr President, Commissioner, energy is a crucial factor as regards market competitiveness as well as quality of life for EU inhabitants."
"For this reason, therefore, the fundamental political and economic goals must be effectiveness in the sustainable generation of energy, efficiency in terms of reductions in overall usage, as well as reliability and safety of energy supplies."
"Achieving these goals will also result in a safe society."
"We cannot forget how much our citizens pay, either directly or indirectly, for every unit of energy."
"The competitiveness of the EU Member State's economies depends, among other factors, on better use of regional resources in the form of fossil fuels."
"This will only happen, however, when the Commission provides guarantees that the emission trading system will not hamper the replacement of existing power stations, e.g. coal-fired power stations, by more modern systems with lower CO2 emissions."
"Poland has already reduced emissions by 32% since 1988 while, over the same period, the countries of the old EU have done considerably less."
"The present figure for emissions per inhabitant in Poland stands at 7 tonnes per annum, while in the old EU countries this is up to two times higher."
"In these circumstances it would not be right for Poland to reduce CO2 emissions drastically by a further 30% from next year."
"This is a Commission decision that would have highly unfavourable social consequences."
"My country cannot be sacrificed to the politics of climate hysteria."
"It is well known that the climate has changed, is changing and will continue to change and that we have to counteract the consequences of these changes, i.e. droughts, floods and shortages of drinking water."
"Justice, however, demands that reductions in CO2 emissions be linked to a per capita figure in EU countries."
"It is important that emission costs should not be decided arbitrarily on the basis of reductions and unclear principles."
"Competitiveness cannot be a function of false market incentives, and the price of energy has to reflect its real cost."
"It would seem sensible to use all possible methods that have been tested to absorb carbon dioxide, including biological methods, and to absorb methane."
"At present, however, priority should definitely be given to methods that improve the efficiency of converting primary energy into other forms based on pilot technological installations for the gasification and liquefaction of coal, as well as for the creation of hydrogen."
"In conclusion, I would like to thank the rapporteur Mr Reul sincerely for the fruitful cooperation in preparing this report, which demonstrates a comprehensive, balanced and long-term approach to the problems of fossil fuels and atomic energy."
"First of all, I would like to congratulate Mr Reul, and my other fellow Members, who have come up with valid amendments, on their well-balanced report and all the hard work they have put into it."
"All the energy sources covered in the report have been given a sufficient amount of attention, while at the same time, the importance of alternative energy sources and new energy technologies was duly pointed out."
"Energy diversification is of great importance in ensuring energy security, which happens to be vital to my country, Lithuania."
"This area is definitely vulnerable, as my country is fully dependant on one supplier, without any other alternative so far."
"A possible solution could be the construction of a safe, modern nuclear power plant."
"It would be the basis for both our political security and economic stability."
"Discussions on this report involved sharing different views on the future of nuclear energy."
"Although we should fully recognise the importance of alternative energy sources and their possible dominating role in the future, we should nevertheless develop a down-to-earth approach to nuclear energy and face the fact that 30% of the energy produced in the EU is produced by nuclear power plants."
"This energy contributes to the implementation of the Kyoto objectives as well as to increasing the security of energy supply."
"I consider the amendments so energetically presented by the 'green' politicians who condemn nuclear power in the name of the security of European citizens to be hypocritical, as it could contribute to the increased insecurity of other European citizens."
"I would like to encourage my fellow Members to be tolerant and to support the provisions enabling each nation to decide whether it is for or against the use of safe nuclear energy."
"Only by sharing our views and listening to different opinions will we be able to come to the right decision."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, speaking on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group in this debate on conventional energy sources and energy technology, I would like to thank Herbert Reul for preparing a comprehensive report on this issue."
"First of all, the author of the report is right to note that the most important issue, also in terms of the future of energy generated from conventional fuels, is for the countries of the European Union to work together in this area."
"Secondly, with regard to the fact that the European Union's dependence on fossil fuel imports will rise to about 70% by 2030, and, in the case of oil imports, to as much as 94%, it is essential to make maximum use of fossil fuel resources within the countries of the European Union."
"Thirdly, coal is just such a resource, with Germany holding as much as 7% of the world's reserves and Poland 2% of these reserves."
"It is important not to call into question the extraction of this fuel and the generation of energy from it, since electricity generated from fossil fuels is still half the price of electricity generated from renewable sources."
"Fourthly, because of the ecological risks associated with the generation of electricity from coal, joint European investment is needed into research in new technologies in this area, financed from funds from the European Union budget."
"Fifthly and finally, support is needed for European Union countries investing in atomic energy."
"In this context I would like to draw your attention to the agreement that has been drawn up for the construction of a modern nuclear power station in Ignalin, which is a joint project between Poland, Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, may I say to Mr Reul that, since it has been more or less announced that the Greens do not approve of this report, I intend to focus on the points that I found most disturbing."
"These are also reflected in the amendments we have tabled."
"During the drafting of this report it was impossible to engage in any critical reflection on nuclear energy."
"All the problems in Europe associated with the demise of the safety culture in our nuclear plants were off-limits, even though the incidents in Germany involving reactors operated by the Vattenfall company had just provided a glaring cautionary example."
"Discussion of the difficulty of funding waste disposal was likewise off-limits, as was the increasing threat of nuclear material being misused to build bombs or possibly for terrorist purposes."
"I must tell you, Mr Reul, that there is one thing which has truly driven me to distraction, and I shall say this before we meet in Bratislava."
"It is the fact that in Slovakia now, in 2007, the Italian ENEL company is planning to complete a nuclear plant that was developed in the Soviet Union before Chernobyl."
"Construction began in Czechoslovakia in the early eighties, and two thirds of the construction work was completed."
"Now ENEL intends to finish building the plant without new planning permission and without having the plans checked for compliance with European standards."
"It is a disgrace."
"People who sing the praises of nuclear energy have no right to go on disregarding that disgrace."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FI) Mr President, Commissioner, crude oil is more expensive than ever."
"This also has an effect on the price of other fossil fuels."
"The cost of all forms of energy is rising, as four fifths of the EU's entire energy consumption is fossil fuel-based."
"People are not prepared to reduce consumption, so there is a need for new technologies, greater energy efficiency, carbon capture and storage (CCS) and new nuclear technology, including research into nuclear fusion."
"After the vote in the Committee's report, the hopes and dreams for the main alternatives are linked to CCS technology and nuclear power."
"There are no guarantees, however, that liquefied carbon dioxide can be stored safely in perpetuity."
"There are no signs that there might be investment in the hydrogen economy within the context of the transport infrastructure, let alone the use of electric cars running on carbon dioxide-free electricity, as is called for in the report."
"It will probably take half a century to tame nuclear fusion."
"All in all, the Commission's proposal that by 2020 20% of the energy consumed in the EU should be produced with renewable fuels is just not credible."
"That will not be possible, at least not with renewable fuels produced in the EU's own territory or in the EU's big Member States."
"The report under discussion presents far too optimistic a view because it suggests that fossil fuels will continue to be used, without any real alternatives and with no restraints at all."
"They will only stop being used if something forces the situation."
"We will be forced into this if natural resources run out before 2020, but it will not happen as a result of any systematic effort on the part of the EU Member States or an EU declaration."
"In fact, it will take not only volition, fine words and pious hopes, but also genuine action which challenges our present lifestyle."
"Furthermore, the pricing system for electricity, where wholesale prices for electric power are determined by the power exchanges, should be rethought."
"The price is always set by electricity produced at the most expensive production costs as well as that produced based on the most expensive allowances."
"This is the price which all the producers get."
"Unfortunately, there are no guarantees that companies will spend the excessive profits they make this way on research into energy, as it is in the spirit of the times we live in that they distribute their profits in the form of dividends to their shareholders."
"Emission allowance trading is also a way to increase the profits of the electricity companies rather than reduce emissions."
"on behalf of the ITS Group. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the rapporteur is right to make the point that conventional sources of energy will remain indispensable for several decades to come."
"He is also right to call for diversification of energy sources and supplies, for safer and more environmentally conscious energy production and for more efficient energy use."
"We are somewhat sceptical, however, about the grounds on which these measures are urged."
"In the first place, the stated reasons are largely a repetition of the myth that climate change is due to carbon dioxide emissions from human activity."
"Yet growing numbers of scientists, while not disputing the fact of climate change, for the climate is constantly changing, are calling into question the notion of global warming, the culpability of CO2 and the idea that the human race is behind it all."
"That being the case, the famous CCS (carbon capture and storage) technology - to which the report devotes much space but the long-term risks of which are unclear - sounds like a dodgy 'quick fix'."
"Secondly, and despite the customary allusions to the Member States having primary responsibility for their energy choices, the rapporteur cannot help trying to steer them in a certain direction."
"Consider the space that his report devotes to the nuclear option - which remains entirely a matter of sovereign choice for each Member State and which cannot be considered solely from the perspective of CO2 emissions."
"Finally, no mention whatever is made of globalisation as contributing to the over-use of fossil fuels."
"The promotion of international exchanges of goods at the expense of shorter, local and national, supply circuits is by no means irrelevant here."
"What the Commission has been doing for years through its ultra-liberal trade policy and the opening of our markets to global competition without a scrap of protection for our economies - whatever its underlying rationale - is very largely responsible for creating the problems that the Commission now claims it wants to resolve."
"Mr President, there is much to commend in this report."
"Of course it makes the ritual genuflection to climate change hysteria, despite the increasing doubts over the supposed link between CO2 and climate."
"However, it also recognises the importance of diversifying energy supplies and of using fossil fuels, including coal, in the energy mix."
"It emphasises the need for energy security, and in this context rightly points to the need for energy efficiency, for continuing use of domestic resources, including coal, and for nuclear energy - both the current use of fission and the vital research on fusion, which is the great hope for the future."
"The most remarkable factor in the energy debate is the way that the Greens and their fellow travellers agonise over carbon emissions but oppose the only mainstream low-carbon-generation technology."
"With oil at USD 90 a barrel, it is time for Ms Harms to recognise that nuclear power is the cheapest, safest, cleanest, most sustainable and most predictable base-load-generating technology available."
"As my colleague Mr Vidal-Quadras has said, nuclear waste disposal is simply a technical problem which has now been solved."
"(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to acknowledge the work of the rapporteur, who prepared a well-balanced and realistic report, which reflects the latest developments."
"I also appreciate this initiative by Parliament, as it is one of the few reports dealing with conventional energy sources."
"I am convinced that in the next few decades fossil fuels will continue to be irreplaceable in the energy mix: they should therefore be given due consideration."
"Renewable energy sources are important, though they cannot replace conventional sources."
"As stated in this report, our efforts should aim at developing new technologies which allow for energy production with less environmental impact, such as clean coal technology."
"Nowadays, when we are experiencing ever-growing energy consumption on the one hand, and a lack of technologies to replace the existing energy sources on the other, an overly unidirectional orientation towards renewable sources could paradoxically accelerate the growth of Member States' dependency on energy imports from other countries."
"Because energy has become the most strategic of commodities, the debates on complete replacing conventional sources may be popular but are very irresponsible."
"I regard as a triumph of common sense the fact that this report devotes sufficient attention to nuclear energy."
"If we are serious about the strategy for reducing the levels of CO2 emissions close to zero, we cannot reject nuclear energy, which is without question one of the cleanest energy sources."
"We should not remain alone in our efforts to reduce CO2 emissions, but strive to convince other superpowers to join us."
"Unless countries such as the US, China and India take similar measures, the measures we take will not have any real impact on a global scale because they can influence roughly only one seventh of global CO2 production."
"In conclusion, I would like to suggest that the rapporteur study more carefully the differences between nuclear reactors."
"There is no comparison between the reactor that exploded in Chernobyl and those installed in the Czech Republic."
"(FI) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Reul's report begs the important question of what direction Europe and the world are going in on the energy question."
"The conflicts continue."
"For how long can we contain them?"
"There is no easy alternative to fossil energy, given current conditions, not even if we did what we could to save far more energy than we do now."
"Oil accounts for around 37% of the energy we use, gas 24% and coal 16%."
"Fossil fuels thus account for 77% of all our energy."
"We know that the International Energy Agency predicts that world energy consumption will grow by more than one and a half times each year."
"Consumption of fossil energy is expected to increase by even more than that because the large developing countries have little faith in wind power stations."
"The developing countries account for 70% of growth in energy consumption, and China alone represents 30% of that growth."
"The reserves of fossil fuels are therefore running out and are concentrated in fewer and fewer hands."
"It will take decades to change the energy system."
"Time is running out; this is actually a race against time."
"Unless we can sort out the environmental and energy problems we cannot guarantee peace."
"If I could mention some areas of action: we need intensive research, product development and new technologies, and we also need to change our behaviour."
"In Europe we do not even conduct intensive research, even though we are heading for greater dependence, higher prices and conflict."
"I just heard that the United States of America spends five times more money on environmental research than the Union."
"How is it that the Lisbon knowledge-based economy works in this way?"
"Finally, it needs to be said that energy has its social dimension. Prices have risen by 50% in just a few years."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Reul's report is a very good and thorough report and I congratulate him on it."
"I am astonished, however, at the space it devotes to coal."
"Coal is undoubtedly an abundant energy source."
"It is also the world's most widespread source of fossil energy."
"I am concerned, however, at its increasingly predominant role in electricity generation."
"The impression is given that carbon capture and storage technology will solve the problem of greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power stations, but I must confess that I am sceptical."
"There are coal-fired power stations all over the world: is it possible to equip them all with carbon capture systems?"
"How will we manage to prevent CO2 emissions from the so-called 'clean' coal-fired plants?"
"Is there not a risk that, having already experienced the eras of wood burning, coal burning and oil burning, we might now be taking a backward step into another coal burning era?"
"To conclude on a more optimistic note, the report's strength lies, in my opinion, in its proposal for the European Strategic Energy Technology Plan."
"The plan needs to address the necessary diversification of energy sources by 2020, 2030 and 2050 and it must also reflect the importance of resource use at regional level."
"(PL) Mr President, of the energy sources listed in the report, it is only coal, whether it be hard coal or brown coal, that is available in large amounts within the European Union."
"By and large, we have to import the other energy fuels."
"Energy requirements will increase in line with growth."
"At present it is not clear how successful we will be in developing production from renewable energy sources or from hydrogen batteries, but these too need energy supplies."
"For this reason, despite enormous efforts, we should not give up on coal too quickly as an accessible source of energy."
"We are not doing enough to develop clean energy from coal."
"More resources should be put into processing coal and into improving the efficiency of boilers and generators."
"We must maintain energy security and one of the elements of this is the coal that is available in nearly all EU countries."
"We cannot afford to dislike our natural riches."
"Finally, I would like to congratulate Herbert Reul and his colleagues for an excellent and balanced report, which I fully support."
"Mr President, Commissioner, it is good to see you burning the midnight oil along with us."
"In Europe, we have a vast renewable energy potential."
"In Scotland, we know that better than most."
"As Ms Harms has said, my Group has a number of difficulties with the pro-nuclear aspects of this report."
"But my own view is that we must also make sure that we do research into other, non-nuclear sources of power and research into ways to make them better."
"In paragraph 47, carbon-capture is experimental but it is promising, and in paragraph 47 we call on the Commission to lay down, as soon as possible, clear political guidelines for the promotion of research into carbon capture and storage."
"Commissioner, I am delighted to hear you are going to do that."
"It is important because, left to their own devices, the Member States will not come up with it."
"In Scotland, we had at Peterhead a world-leading proposal for a demonstrator site."
"Because of political uncertainty entirely caused by the London Government not making it a priority, the project is going ahead - and it is going ahead in California."
"Europe can have a lead in this; we can be globally significant in the research potential that we have, but we must have real action."
"I am glad to hear that this report has some ideas which the Commission is taking forward."
"(CS) I would like to make 10 points regarding the report by Mr Reul."
"It is an excellent and well-balanced report, which, in my opinion, is written in the spirit of Antoine de Saint Exupéry's words about our future: our task is not to foresee it, but to enable it."
"The report lists practically all the conventional energy sources, except perhaps, to please the Green Members here, for ebonite sticks and fox tails."
"Jokes aside, I recognise the exhaustive manner with which the report encompasses the general regulations governing the energy sector."
"As Professor Semjonov's historical findings confirm, since prehistoric and ancient times the same basic laws have applied: on the one hand humans have tried to lower the energy intensity of technologies, while on the other hand they have strived to produce more energy."
"In my opinion, today an effective combination of energy sources and diversification of gas imports is vital."
"The weight of the European single market should be increased as a factor for guaranteeing the stability and reliability of supplies."
"There are of course environmental risks involved, which would need to be carefully assessed."
"The rapporteur, Mr Reul, refers for example to the Arctic shelves, which, according to some estimates, account for up to 25% of new gas and oil sources."
"The Commission will undoubtedly be asked to take measures to reduce the energy intensity per unit of GDP."
"Another essential task is drawing up a reasonable technology transfer policy."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(SK) Allow me to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Reul, on his excellent report."
"This reports captures the status quo in the area of conventional energy sources and technologies, and at the same time draws attention, in a complex way, towards many aspects of their further use in the context of both securing energy supplies and the need to continuously increase emissions."
"Since there is an increasing need for energy on a global scale, the European Union cannot afford to completely eliminate fossil fuels since they play an important part in overall energy production although their reserves keep diminishing."
"In spite of the fact that the European Union is on average relatively effective in producing energies from these conventional sources, some Member States could do still much more in the area of introducing and supporting new, more effective technologies and developing new, more effective cooperation units."
"Nor should the Member States create needless obstacles to new investments in the use of fossil reserves through the most advanced technologies available."
"Another issue I want to concentrate on is nuclear energy."
"As we know, nuclear energy generates practically no CO2 emissions and I am convinced that sooner or later it will find its place even in those Member States that so far have been against it for ideological rather than pragmatic reasons."
"Since new technologies, such as fourth-generation reactors, are constantly developing (even in Russia, Mrs Harms), there are now options in place for further improvements to their operating safety and for safe storage of spent nuclear fuel."
"To conclude, I would like to say that I appreciate that the work of the Commission shows a tangible tilt towards more a open and objective view and evaluation of the benefits of nuclear energy, resulting in initiatives such as the European Nuclear Energy Forum, the inaugural meeting of which will be held in Bratislava in November later this year, as mentioned in this House."
"Europe has long been lacking such a permanent platform for discussion, contributing to the exchange of knowledge, information and opinion."
"Such exchange will be useful both to the experts and the public in general, and I assume that it will be useful to the Greens as well."
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to touch on two points."
"The first is one on which I hope and believe we are firmly united, namely the view that conventional sources and forms of energy and technology will continue to play a major role in the future."
"The idea that we can replace everything with energy from alternative sources is illusory."
"We must, however, make conventional technology environment-friendlier - that is absolutely essential - and we must also ensure that conventional forms of technology become more efficient."
"These are the views we share, and in these respects the report can be strongly endorsed."
"The situation is perhaps somewhat different with regard to nuclear technology."
"It must be absolutely clear, with no ifs or buts, that every country can choose its own forms of technology, in other words it can opt for nuclear technology or choose to get by without recourse to the nuclear option."
"Another principle that must be common to all of us is the primacy of safety - not only safety in the energy production process but also, of course, safe final disposal and, what is very important in today's world, where the significance of the global dimension is constantly growing, the non-proliferation of nuclear technology that can be used for military purposes."
"I would have liked to see the report focus rather more sharply on these issues."
"We have, admittedly, addressed them in other reports, and I believe Europe must set the best of examples in this field."
"Regardless of what might be called the ideological stance - whether we are for or against nuclear technology - safety must be absolutely paramount."
"I hope that we in this Parliament and, of course, the Commission will be increasingly vigilant so as to ensure that all safety issues, including non-proliferation, remain in the foreground, otherwise we shall be failing in our responsibility for mankind and for peace in the world."
"I hope that this message might yet come across more clearly tomorrow in some amendments than it does in Mr Reul's report."
"(BG) Geopolitical interests and the striking of balances, the level of technological development and its impact on the economy create the necessary conditions for a second chance to nuclear energy as an important element of the energy mix."
"This theme is very important and topical against the backdrop of the heated debate on the climate change, the security of energy supplies and the alternative power generation solution."
"In my country Bulgaria, Kozlodui Nuclear Power Plant acounted for 43 % of the total power generation in the country, contributing to the sustainable development of the economy in 2006."
"Of course, these figures pertain to the period before the closing down of units three and four of the nuclear power plant on 31 December 2006."
"Analyses reveal that in the next few decades to come the consumption of electricity will double globally."
"All over the world, 31 reactors are under construction and others are in the planning phase."
"This dynamic process comes to show that active efforts are being made to seek solutions in order to overcome the challenges facing modern economies, to provide inexpensive and clean energy, to cope with the climate change, to observe the greenhouse emission quotas under the Kyoto Protocol, to safeguard the security of supplies and to reduce the dependence on imported gas and oil."
"And if I recall yeat another fact, i.e. currently nuclear power plants generate one-third of the elecrticity in the European Union, then I would conclude that perhaps the time for a nuclear Renaissance has come."
"(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, the report should be commended for including all sectors of the energy mix while looking at conventional sources in particular."
"We certainly need to step up the effectiveness of fossil fuel use."
"I am convinced, however, that there are several reasons why we cannot do without nuclear energy."
"Sustainable development, preservation of competitiveness in the broadest sense, true environmental protection and emission reductions are just some of these reasons."
"We are finally beginning to discuss nuclear energy without letting unhelpful feelings and emotions guide us, although some of the amendments tabled and even some of the contributions still do not bear witness to this."
"I am therefore glad to hear realistic voices from the Commission and other EU institutions saying that we need to incorporate nuclear energy even in the future."
"In many countries nuclear energy already represents a key source, and is a guarantee of the much-discussed notion of energy independence and security."
"It seems at last that by pursuing quotas and percentages we will not end up doing what a Czech proverb describes in a colourful way as 'throwing the baby out with the bath water'."
"(ES) Mr President, the own-initiative report we shall be voting on tomorrow is the third and final such report drafted by this House and concludes Parliament's response to the energy review submitted by the Commission at the beginning of the year."
"Our colleague Herbert Reul has done a magnificent job throughout the debate in committee and has produced a sound, consistent text which fully encompasses the concerns of the majority of MEPs."
"For a long time, fossil fuels and nuclear energy will continue to be the nub of our energy mix and despite the ambitious targets we have set ourselves for renewables, the contribution that they make will not be truly significant for several decades."
"Therefore, we must not temper efforts to research, develop and innovate in conventional sources since fulfilling our commitments in relation to climate change, security of supply and competitiveness involves achieving a more sustainable use of these sources."
"The result of the committee vote was excellent as it highlighted the progress made in controlling the capture of carbon dioxide, in improving energy efficiency in the generation of electricity, in the contribution which synthetic fuels for transport can make, and in the competitiveness of the nuclear sector."
"One Group in this House has tabled almost 40 amendments to the nuclear section seeking to change all objective and realistic references to nuclear fuels to references to renewable sources."
"I would like to remind them that this matter has already been voted on at a previous plenary sitting and, allow me please to tell the Group concerned, that it is free to live in a world divorced from reality, but that we will all suffer the consequences if their obsessions ultimately mean that their arguments prevail."
"The majority of the members of this House prefer to work with facts and to use those facts to draft sensible policies which do not lead our society into collective breakdown."
"(BG) Allow me, first and foremost, to congratulate the rapporteur Mr Reul on his objective and balanced report."
"A major distinctive feature of the report is the clear outline of the role of conventional energy sources, the need for their increasingly efficient use through new technologies to achieve the energy security of the European Union with maximum compliance with the sustainable development goals and the combat against climate changes."
"I would like to support the conclusion that the increased investment in energy technologies at the European and national levels would not only contribute to the attainment of the EU energy goals but it would also enhance its capabilities to export facilities in compliance with the higher efficiency and security standards."
"I would like to single out that section of the report which deals with nuclear energy not only because of its leading place in the generation of power from conventional sources but also because of the vital importance for nuclear energy to observe the highest nuclear safety standards."
"In this sense, the support to the appeal of the Commission to introduce common nuclear safety reference levels in the European Union is a crucial aspect of the report."
"I would like to specially emphasize the fact that Bulgaria, which intends to build a new nuclear power plant, takes great interest in the enhanced role of the European Union in the observance of high nuclear safety standards, as well as in the creation of favourable investment conditions for these large-scale projects that call for big financial, material and intellectual resource input."
"The work of the European Union, including the High-level Group on Nuclear Safety and Waste Management and the existing Nuclear Energy Forum, will contribute to the incorporation of nuclear energy into the EU policies in a more objective manner."
"(DE) Mr President, necessary though it is to enact measures to combat climate change and promote renewables, it is extremely important that Parliament should also deal with the future of conventional energy sources."
"The Reul report emphasises the huge importance of coal and nuclear power to the regional economy."
"We have 300 000 European jobs in coalmining alone."
"Additional economic strength is provided by the power stations and through tax revenue."
"Some 60% of our electricity generation is based on European coal or nuclear power."
"Of course we must increase the efficiency and safety of these energy sources. Of course we must also seek to protect the environment by developing additional legal provisions governing matters such as carbon emissions."
"On the other hand, we must not turn the legislative screw so tight that coal loses its international competitiveness."
"The fact is that renewable energy sources will not be able to grow as quickly as we would wish."
"We face the threat of restrictions on our independence in the field of foreign policy and arbitrary actions on the part of our energy suppliers."
"The only way to avoid that threat in future is with a strategic energy mix which also includes coal and nuclear power."
"(ET) If climate change is to be brought under control it is important to reduce carbon emissions from combustion of fossil fuels to near zero."
"However, in order to prevent and mitigate the unwanted effects of climate change action must be taken now."
"Clean coal technology may prove to be possible, but we cannot pin all our hopes on it at present."
"The European Union must significantly reduce current greenhouse gas emissions and that must remain the cornerstone of our climate policy."
"I am pleased that the European Parliament Temporary Committee on Climate Change has recently approved a strong line for our negotiations at the Bali Climate Conference in December."
"Where clean coal technology is concerned, the funds currently available for the necessary research can of course be increased because the matter must be researched."
"However, we cannot spend decades waiting for research findings without doing anything else and therefore we must now concentrate on measures which must be implemented immediately, namely reducing CO2 emissions, energy-saving measures and a general transition to renewable sources of energy."
"The vote of the ITRE committee has resulted in too great an emphasis on nuclear energy in the Reul report and there has been too little discussion of renewables."
"Therefore I fully support the amendments tabled in the House, as they help to balance the report."
"In particular I call upon you to support the proposed amendments recommending that the European Commission make renewables the central focus of its own European Strategic Energy Technology Plan."
"Mr President, first I must commend Mr Reul for skilfully steering his report through about 200 committee-stage amendments to provide this House with a very balanced, consistent and honest report that is highly relevant to the challenges we face today and in the future."
"Many of those defeated amendments have reappeared at the last minute, and we in plenary must throw them out again."
"These amendments damage not only the report: in the end, they damage the environment that some of the proposals claim to represent."
"I use the word 'honest' most deliberately, because Mr Reul has used real words like 'coal' and 'nuclear', rather than hiding behind the generalities of what might or might not be sustainable or renewable, and it is clear that we will continue to rely on burning fossil fuels for generations to come."
"Of course we support renewables."
"We do so because they provide necessary, clean energy."
"However, in most Member States, renewable energy can meet neither our environmental targets, nor our accelerated energy demands, nor our need to remain competitive in global markets."
"As responsible politicians, we must discard the dogmas of the past and recognise that all clean technologies have their role to play."
"Quite simply, we must retain and advance the nuclear share - and we will still not be doing enough."
"In my country, Bulgaria, we were needlessly required to close 2 000 MW of safe, clean nuclear power."
"(ES) Mr President, despite the ambitious targets we have set ourselves, it would appear that we all agree that conventional sources of energy will continue to be an important part of our energy mix."
"Therefore, nuclear energy will also continue to play an important role as it is still necessary in order to ensure security and stability of supply in many countries."
"To that end it is reasonable for research to be carried out in areas where nuclear energy's weaknesses are more apparent such as safety or treatment of waste, but we should note that the report clearly endorses the idea that the nuclear option falls within the exclusive competence of the Member States, as Mr Reul noted at the outset."
"However, it would appear that some people intend Europe to entrust its future almost exclusively to nuclear energy, making the development of renewables, increased efficiency or research subordinate to it."
"There is one small detail which we should ponder: what are the public's views on this?"
"We have very much taken the reality of the situation into account but, of course, we must have clear priorities and in that regard it should be noted that the importance of the Strategic Energy Technology Plan which the Commission is due to submit to us soon is one very important aspect of this."
"We believe that the main objective should be to reduce the cost of renewables, to improve the energy efficiency of buildings, industry and transport, and to make progress in low carbon technologies."
"Europe and the Member States should make these objectives their political priority and the focus of their efforts to build a future energy policy."
"(RO) The gross energy production in the European Union is achieved based on various energy sources: 31% nuclear energy, 29% coal, 19% gas, 14% sources of renewable energy and 5% oil."
"Romania produces 13.5% of its energy from oil, 15.3% from coal and coke and 5.9% is hydroelectric and nuclear-electrical energy."
"As regards nuclear energy, it is essential to ensure its security and, especially, adequate waste treatment."
"Generation IV nuclear energy systems will allow better nuclear waste management and decrease its quantity."
"Nevertheless, an extremely important element for environmental protection should refer to the treatment of water used to cool reactors."
"For this reason, the investments in the security and treatment of radioactive waste should be a priority for the countries that generate nuclear energy."
"The Black Sea region is extremely important for diversifying the European Union's sources of energy."
"The region has a strategic importance, not only for the transportation of hydrocarbons from the Caspian Sea region to the European Union, but also for the coal resources existing in Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey, Ukraine and Russia."
"It is important for the coal industry to provide work safety and health conditions."
"As long as coal is a source of energy, it is important to have the necessary investments in order to provide workplace safety."
"(HU) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate the rapporteur and all the shadow rapporteurs."
"It is a particular achievement of this report that the European Parliament has realised beyond any shadow of a doubt, and accepted, that ideological concerns cannot override environmental and economic necessity."
"Some of the current Member States have attempted to do just this over the past half-century but, as we know, were unsuccessful."
"It was in 1956 that Hungary abandoned the vain political notion that it could be a country of iron and steel."
"Fortunately the European Union has not had to go to such extremes to realise and acknowledge that we will need all our knowledge and all our resources if we are to meet our energy requirements securely in the 21st century."
"This calls for the maximum possible diversification in terms of both sources and technologies."
"Ideology cannot decide what sort of footing Europe's energy supply will rest on in 10, 20 or 50 years' time; science must decide."
"The politicians' role is to demand safety, coordinate sources, and increase public acceptance."
"For this task I wish all of us - as Hungarian miners would say - 'jó szerencsét', may we come out safely at the end of the day!"
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, as was mentioned, this is the third report on the Commission decision and the later decision of the European Council."
"The Vidal-Quadras report has helped us formulate the internal market package."
"The Thomsen report will have a huge influence on our proposals on renewables."
"I can also promise that we will follow the vote on the Reul report very carefully, because the outcome of that report will influence the approach to CCS - first of all the legal proposal and also the report - and also our Strategic Energy Technology Plan and our future policy, as far as the Euratom Treaty gives us a mandate for nuclear energy."
"That is why this vote will be very carefully followed by the Commission."
"At the same time I would like to emphasise a couple of points."
"It was mentioned that we need to modernise the energy sector."
"If I recall - now, in 2007 - the first debate in 2004, I believe we have achieved a lot."
"Definitely, security of supply and climate change are closely related, with perhaps just one major difference at this stage, which is the cost for carbon sequestration, but I believe oil price developments will help."
"At the same time, weather challenges were mentioned."
"We do not invest in sufficient resources."
"We should really decide on priorities."
"Without massive investment in research and development in the energy sector, we will not succeed."
"I believe the three-year debate was very helpful to prepare the ground."
"But now it is really time to address the issues."
"How can one claim, for example, that some Member States are dependent on third countries when the Structural Funds are not being used for energy at all, or practically not at all!"
"I would say also the part in national budgets for research and development is small."
"So these are the crucial issues to deal with."
"I am afraid that not much time is left until we have some serious perturbation in the market."
"So, we need to act, and to act now, on the basis on which Parliament has worked so far."
"There was also mention of one particular issue: that we need sufficient energy resources."
"Sufficient resources need energy demand management."
"Here again, Parliament has moved and the Commission has moved, and at the same time I needed to start 12 infringement cases for not communicating energy efficiency action plans, the basis for action on energy demand."
"With regard to demand and dependence on third countries, this is also something that we should overcome."
"I think the Saryusz-Wolski report was a courageous attempt to go for it."
"If one Member State is being blackmailed by a supplier, it should speak out."
"Because the basic reason is that we have a common foreign and security policy (CFSP) that could give the necessary grounds for common action, and I believe that any country that has enough courage to blackmail any of the EU countries will think twice, or never again blackmail, if this is spoken of and discussed in the Council."
"The last part of my intervention will be on nuclear energy."
"It is very clear that, under the Reform Treaty, the energy mix comes under national decision-making."
"That means that the decision on nuclear energy is to be made by each and every Member State."
"But it should also be understood that conditions now definitely demand that the legislation in place should guarantee transparency and predictability, because it is a very long-term investment."
"Mr Swoboda also mentioned non-proliferation issues."
"We are looking at these, but in my opinion, it is very clear that the CFSP has priority and Euratom should fill in and help."
"It is definitely the CFSP that should lead our activities on non-proliferation."
"Two very concrete responses."
"First of all, Mochovce."
"Slovenské Elektrárne has indeed notified its intention to construct a nuclear power plant."
"It is for a VVR reactor 440/213 but it is not of the Chernobyl type."
"The Commission, in accordance with Article 41 of the Euratom Treaty, will prepare an opinion, taking full account of all the challenges this decision poses."
"This will take time, but you can be assured that the Commission will perform the correct assessment and will not hesitate if we have any doubts about the safety of this equipment."
"On the issue of coming here to talk about the closure of some of the nuclear units, a debate on this issue would not be productive."
"This issue was agreed by the experts who prepared the ground."
"It was discussed at a political level and it was agreed at government level and sealed by a referendum in all the Member States, including the countries where these reactors are."
"Please do not return to this, because it distracts us from future developments."
"There is no way these reactors will get the green light for prolonging their work time."
"This is a dead end."
"Please understand that there will be no development."
"I know, perhaps, you have personal views on it, but there will definitely not be developed, at least from the European Commission."
"The opinion has been formed."
"It was democratically agreed, and let us keep and honour the commitment."
"I greatly appreciate the report that has been drawn up."
"It is a very difficult report and I believe it has got the accent right."
"I hope that the vote will definitely help us finalise the paper that we are to prepare by the end of the year."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday, 24 October."
"European Statistical Governance Advisory Board - European Statistical Advisory Council (debate)"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"by Sharon Bowles, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the European Statistical Governance Advisory Board - C6-0348/2006 - and"
"by Ieke van den Burg, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council setting up a European Advisory Committee on Community Statistical Information Policy - C6-0379/2006 -."
"Member of the Commission. - (ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in 2005 the Commission, with the support of the Council and Parliament, embarked on a process to reform statistical governance in the European Union with the aim of strengthening the independence, integrity and responsibility of the national statistics institutes of all the Member States of the Union and, of course, of Eurostat, the European Statistical Office."
"The first aspect of this process was the adoption in May 2005 of a European Statistics Code of Practice."
"Implementation of that code resulted in closer cooperation between Eurostat and the national statistics institutes and in improved reliability of statistical data gathered for many purposes; in particular, however, I would like to refer to one objective which has been the subject of debate here over the years, namely the excessive public deficit procedure."
"When it proposed the Code of Practice, the Commission also recommended that the self-regulatory focus should be counter-balanced by the establishment of a reporting system to monitor adherence to the code."
"That gave rise to the idea of establishing an independent external advisory body to play an active role in monitoring implementation of the Code of Practice in the European statistical system as a whole."
"At the same time the Commission noted that it was appropriate to review the operation and composition of the European Advisory Committee on Statistical Information in the Economic and Social Spheres, with the aim of making it more efficient and allowing it to play a more strategic role."
"The ECOFIN Council and, more generally, the national statistics authorities welcomed both recommendations and the Commission implemented them in a dual proposal in October last year; we are debating those proposals today with the prospect that, and I hope we will be able to confirm whether you agree with me here, they will be adopted at first reading."
"To that end I would especially like to congratulate the two rapporteurs, Mrs Bowles and Mrs Van den Burg, on their work and the quality of their reports."
"This process of strengthening European statistical governance is supplemented by a new Commission proposal adopted on 16 October, only a few days ago, to review the Regulation on the production of European statistics."
"That proposal is also subject to Council and Parliamentary approval under the codecision procedure and we will therefore have the opportunity to debate it again here in the coming months."
"This set of initiatives will provide the Union with a modern, reliable, efficient European statistical system capable of improving public confidence in official statistical data."
"I refer once again to the debates we have often had in this House in recent years on the importance of reliable budget data, or reliable data for other national public accounts, GDP etc., or the need to have a price index upon which the public can fully rely."
"As regards the reports we are debating tonight, allow me to point out simply that from our point of view it would have been preferable if there were greater respect for the institutional balance, as envisaged, in our view, in the initial proposal, in relation to the appointment of members of the European Statistical Governance Advisory Board and the drafting and transmission of that Board's reports."
"In any event, the Commission acknowledges that the amendments to the original proposals are unquestionably important, they have the support of the Council and Parliament and they do not alter the substance of our original proposals."
"In view of this, Mr President, before I close I would like to reiterate my thanks to the rapporteurs, and to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for their excellent work and for the continuous support for the Commission's work to modernise our statistical system and make it more reliable and more robust."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, this decision concerns the setting up of the European Statistical Governance Advisory Board."
"Statistics are used by Member States, by the EU, internationally and by many other stakeholders for a variety of purposes."
"They are used, for example, by the European Central Bank, for economic analysis; the Commission, through Eurostat, produces statistics that are compiled from data produced by Member States."
"A few years ago questions arose over the credibility of statistics being provided by some Member States to the EU institutions, and it was clear that some kind of quality control was needed."
"As the Commissioner has said, in response, a Code of Conduct on statistical procedures was compiled."
"In order to provide a check for consistency and adherence to the Code of Practice, each national statistical office is checked by peer review which involves another Member State and Eurostat."
"As a further check, it was also proposed to introduce an independent, high-level advisory board."
"It is that board, now called the European Statistical Governance Advisory Board, which is the subject of this proposal."
"It is fair to say that there is a high degree of sensitivity on all sides about how intrusive the role of the Board can be."
"I am grateful to the current Portuguese Presidency, and, before them, the German Presidency, and also to the Commission for being frank with me about these sensitivities."
"Parliament, of course, was determined that the Board had to be more than a rubber stamp for the Commission's report."
"However, we have achieved agreement around a balanced and workable proposal which includes most of Parliament's amendments in some form or another."
"I am particularly pleased that we have been able to agree with the Council that dialogue should be encouraged, not only between the Board and this Statistical Programme Committee and the European Statistical Advisory Committee, but also with Member States' stakeholder bodies."
"The Board will report to Parliament and the Council and will include in its report an assessment of their implementation of the Code of Practice in the European Statistical System as a whole."
"The Board will also advise the Commission on appropriate measures to facilitate implementation of the Code of Practice as it relates to Eurostat and to the European Statistical System as a whole."
"It will further advise on communicating the Code of Practice to users and data providers and on updating the Code of Practice."
"Measures to ensure the independence of the Board and involving the Parliament in the appointments have also been included."
"So, after consulting the Commission, the Council selects and the European Parliament approves the nomination of the chairperson of the Board."
"Parliament and the Council each appoint three members of the Board."
"The chairperson is not to be a current member of a national statistical office, or of the Commission, or to have held such a post within the last two years."
"We considered similar exclusions on all members but that is not really practical."
"However, we have added a requirement that the Board provide a range of complementary skills and experience."
"Just in case we have not got the balance right, the Board itself should be in a position to know whether it has been frustrated or not, so there is a review clause after three years."
"This will give sufficient time for the Board and others to be able to indicate whether the procedures are working and effective or whether there are changes that are necessary, and this must be a serous review."
"Parliament, the Portuguese Presidency and the Commission have had a very effective dialogue on this dossier, and I thank them."
"I am pleased to be in a position to be able to lead this proposal through in a single reading with the support from shadow rapporteurs, whom I also thank."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, let me first make two preliminary remarks."
"One is that, obviously, this subject of statistics is not a very sexy subject and is always placed at the end of the agenda."
"But what concerns me a bit is that there are politicians, MEPs and others who often like to complain about the provision of statistics."
"But then, if there is an opportunity to really improve something, they are not really actively involved in making the situation better."
"The second remark is that I hope the Commissioner, at least, will appreciate that we are having this debate."
"Ms Bowles and I have said that, for us, it is not really necessary to have the debate."
"But it is important to underline the fact that you have done something on statistics, and that issue deserves some attention."
"So I hope you will not blame us for keeping you here at this hour."
"Let me, then, congratulate you on the very concrete measures that you have taken vis-à-vis these problems with statistics, which have appeared several times in recent history."
"I know that you had to do this in the political room for manoeuvre that is granted to you by the Council, because we are aware that the European Commission cannot oblige Member States to establish independent statistical offices and prescribe to them how to work and how to deal with figures and data."
"Ministers and MEPs who are the loudest and firmest in complaining about the lack of reliability of the figures of others are also the ones who do not want you to mix in their business and infringe on their autonomy and their way of dealing with statistics."
"This is the problem you have to deal with."
"But, in this context, I think it was wise of you, Commissioner, to take a pragmatic, bottom-up approach, to focus on peer reviews and a code of practice, and to reform the governance structure of the statistics system by creating a new high level governance board, which Ms Bowles was speaking about, and by reforming the existing European Advisory Committee on Statistical Information in the Economic and Social Spheres (CEIES), which dealt with economic and social statistics, into a more streamlined and smaller advisory committee with a broader mandate."
"In Ms Bowles' and my report we have tried to improve this even more, and to reinforce and strengthen the approach of the Commission."
"At the same time, we have also made sure - in accordance with your proposal - that these two new bodies in the European family can function properly and with more independence from the Commission and Eurostat."
"This may not have been completely in line with the Commission's intentions; however, I want to express my appreciation to the Director-General of Eurostat for very generously accepting the fact that we took away his voting rights in the system that we designed."
"I also want to express my appreciation to the Portuguese Presidency, and to Ms Cordeiro, for the efficient way she chaired the Council working group and negotiated with us a first reading agreement on this issue."
"This was a very efficient and very time- and bureaucracy-saving procedure."
"So, Mr Hans-Peter Martin, who has also asked for the floor, can see an example of how we can deal in a very efficient way with this type of co-decision procedure."
"Let me very briefly give some of the elements of the statistical board, which I will do in writing."
"If you read the dossier, you can find where we made the changes, so I will not repeat this here but will stick to my wish that these two bodies will really bring some consciousness and some improvement in the way the statistics systems function, and will help us to really have reliable figures and base our economic activities on reliable data."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, improving the European statistical system is part of the wider task of sound economic governance in the Union, particularly with regard to adjustment of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"I share the wish expressed by both the Commission and the Member States to enhance the quality of statistical information."
"As I see it, determining what constitutes an excessive deficit depends on the reliability of the data."
"Unreliable data puts the entire Stability and Growth Pact in jeopardy."
"In return for flexibility in implementation of the pact, which was introduced under the reform adopted by the March 2005 European Council, the necessary figures must be indisputable and verifiable."
"Flexibility is important too in the current context of enlargement of the euro zone."
"We need to learn the lessons of past experience!"
"The European Union has already been obliged to review the statistics relating to a Member State's budget deficit and level of debt; now several Member States want to join the euro zone, so the volume of statistical information to be processed will increase, as will the number of parties involved in the discussions."
"The proposed improvement to the European statistical system aims to address legitimate concerns that have been raised concerning the validity of the data which Member States supply and the system for checking them."
"We need to take care that doubt is not cast over the entire statistical system and over Eurostat's ability to verify the budget data which the Member States provide."
"For these reasons I support the reform, which will result firstly in the establishment of a European Advisory Committee on Community Statistical Information Policy and secondly in the creation of a European Statistical Governance Advisory Board - both bodies capable of actively helping to monitor implementation of the code of conduct throughout the entire European statistical system."
"I have no hesitation in supporting the proposals made by our two excellent rapporteurs."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as you have already pointed out, Commissioner, statistics are vitally important to both the European Union and the Member States in many policy areas."
"If wrong decisions and unwelcome developments are to be avoided, statistics must be meaningful, reliable, open to only one interpretation and therefore comparable too."
"That, unfortunately, has not always been the case."
"I therefore welcome the establishment of the European Statistical Advisory Committee and the European Statistical Governance Advisory Board."
"The amendments tabled by the European Parliament will, I hope, endow both bodies with the authority they will need."
"Let me emphasise first of all that the Statistical Advisory Committee will be independent and that all stakeholder groups will be represented on it."
"The Committee will have far fewer members than its predecessor, the European Advisory Committee on Statistical Information in the Economic and Social Spheres (CEIES), and the reduction from 79 to 24 members will make it considerably more efficient."
"I welcome the fact that the European Data Protection Supervisor is to be a voting member of the Advisory Committee, whereas the Director-General of Eurostat has only been granted non-voting membership."
"This underlines the Committee's independence."
"Secondly, the Statistical Governance Advisory Board is a useful complement to the Advisory Committee."
"The Board will monitor and, I hope, actively encourage the application of the Code of Conduct in all European statistical matters."
"One can only hope that, with the aid of these two bodies, the needs of users will have a greater impact on the statistical work programme and that the Code of Conduct will strike such firm roots that deliberately or mistakenly delivered misinformation or inaccurate data will become a thing of the past."
"Let me conclude by thanking both rapporteurs for their work and for their willingness to discuss contentious points frankly and constructively."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, I would like to express my appreciation to Mrs Bowles and Mrs van den Burg for their reports."
"We should be aware of the role played by the European statistical system, which may be the world's best system."
"We are talking here not just about the clarity of lists of figures, tables or charts."
"The most important issue is the reliability and completeness of statistical data at the level of the European Union, of the Member States, and also, and this I would like to emphasise, of the regions."
"For that purpose it is vital to ensure continuity of information as well as access to it."
"I would add here that only statistical data that have been collected and collated in the same way, in accordance with statistical principles, can be reliable and transparent, and will not be affected by short-term interests or passing priorities."
"My experience in regional policy has shown clearly that such risks exist."
"For this reason we should be pleased that we have an EU statistical programme for 2008-2012."
"To make it work will, however, need appropriate funding and, above all, will require appropriate consultation, monitoring of the code of statistical procedures as well as statistics management."
"This is very important in the light of the different systems used in Member States, the need to coordinate and unify them at the level of the 27 countries and statistical offices as well as Eurostat."
"In this context I would like to support both the reports."
"(DE) Mr President, there is general agreement as to how important statistics are, and not just among the people who have managed to come here at this late hour."
"The question is whether the aim which I presume we are all pursuing will be achieved with the measures that are being initiated here."
"It made me wonder, Commissioner, when you spoke of another new regulation that was to be negotiated with us."
"Perhaps you can tell us whether its provisions will also affect these advisory bodies."
"The second question is this: there is always a great inherent danger with advisory bodies that they will become a law unto themselves and drag everything out."
"Would it not have made more sense at the end of the day to evaluate briefly, concisely and clearly, using external management consultants where necessary, the problems that have occurred with Eurostat and then come to a rapid agreement with Parliament rather than passing the buck again and shelving the issue?"
"When all is said and done, every one of us knows that the crux of the problem is the interface between Eurostat and the national statistical offices."
"The best an advisory body can do is to put the problem back on the agenda, but it is certainly not going to establish real transparency and efficiency."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday, 24 October."
"Agenda for next part session: see Minutes"
"Closure of sitting"
"(The sitting was closed at 11 p.m.)"
"Opening of the sitting"
"(The sitting was opened at 9.05 a.m.)"
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I should like to come back to a decision that was made yesterday afternoon."
"However, I must put on record that neither the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, nor the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, or any of the other groups were informed about the wish for us to adopt a resolution on Russia this time, even though this has been repeatedly rejected in the Conference of Presidents."
"We must, of course, take note of the decision."
"However, I should like to record here - and we shall also inform the groups that have requested this, particularly the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe - that we are not asking for this resolution to be adopted now, but at Parliament's next sitting instead."
"I should simply like to record this here."
"We must, of course, formally abide by the rules."
"However, we do want to say here, out of fairness to the Greens and Liberals, that we are asking for this resolution to be adopted not this week, but at the next plenary session."
"The Socialist Group will be voting on it in any case and I believe the EPP has a similar idea."
"Mr President, actually I totally support Mr Swoboda, since we were not told and therefore have not prepared anything for this resolution this week."
"Our group, like the PSE Group, did not know about this, and we ask you to postpone the vote to the next part-session."
"Thank you, we take note of your request."
"It will be passed on to the other groups as appropriate and we will see how the matter can be resolved."

"Taxation and customs policies and the Lisbon Strategy (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Sahra Wagenknecht, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the contribution of taxation and customs policies to the Lisbon Strategy."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the question as to whether the Member States' taxation policy actually helps to promote growth, employment and innovation at present can unfortunately be answered in very few words: it does not!"
"Growth is simply not promoted by abandoning to free fall the tax rates of highly profitable conglomerates in a Europe-wide dumping race and in return demanding cash increasingly forcefully from average wage earners, the unemployed and pensioners in their capacity as consumers."
"Growth is not promoted by subjecting income from employment to a tax rate that is several times greater than that applied to income from assets, thereby making the gap between them ever wider."
"Employment is not promoted when small investing enterprises are taxed disproportionately more than those tinkering speculatively in shares, bonds and financial derivatives."
"Innovation is certainly not promoted as long as multinationals with gilt-edged balance sheets are able to stash away the best part of research and development funds in their accounts, while those who are actually targeted for this kind of benefit are left out in the rain."
"In brief: a socially balanced perspective and development is certainly not being promoted in the EU, but is virtually being stalled while those rolling in money are being treated to more and more tax breaks and fattened up even more while those who already have little are having to dig ever deeper into their pockets."
"This kind of taxation policy is fatal in terms of economic policy, counterproductive in terms of growth policy and catastrophic in terms of social policy."
"I know that the structure of national taxation systems still lies, of course, within the sovereignty of the Member States on paper, but the reality is somewhat different."
"The lack of EU-wide coordination actually means - even in the direct taxation sector - that national taxation systems are increasingly no longer designed at all on the basis of policy, but are formed and moulded by the ice-cold system of tax competition."
"This system can involve a simple denominator: the more mobile a factor, the greater its potential for extortion against national fiscal services and the more sweeping the tax relief, of course, which it is able to enforce itself."
"If government revenues are not to dry up and run out completely in this process, the sectors not able to escape taxation at all, or only with difficulty, must be taxed even more heavily almost as compensation."
"Taxes are therefore shifted - from corporate profits to private income, and then from investment income to labour income, which is even less mobile, within income from highly paid employment to less well paid employees, who are also correspondingly less mobile, and generally from income and assets to consumption."
"The fact that this process is in force - and has been for years and decades - can be very clearly demonstrated by the data on tax receipts and taxation rates in the EU."
"Not only the legal tax rates but also the actual tax rates on corporate profits in the EU have fallen in the last decade by over 10 percentage points."
"All the studies carried out on this subject confirm this."
"The highest tax rates have been reduced virtually everywhere in the EU Member States."
"In more and more Member States private investment income is given much greater preference over income from employment because of the transfer to dual tax systems."
"Excise duty is increasing ever further - on the one hand because of 'eco-taxes', which often enough have no ecological steering effect at all even in the absence of alternatives, but which quite frankly fleece budgets, and on the other hand because of the fact that value added taxes are constantly increasing and in more and more countries are approaching the top end of the agreed range."
"Such a development is no accident."
"It is the direct result of unchecked tax competition on a uniform internal market."
"It should already be leading us to believe that the upward trend of corporate taxes within the EU is broadly eclipsing those in the whole of the OECD."
"This means that tax rates here have clearly fallen more than in the OECD as a whole."
"This also clearly shows that the many pressures of globalisation much and happily complained about are not taking effect here, but that there are home-made pressures created within the EU and therefore also pressures that could very easily be discreetly overcome if there was a desire to do so."
"Very appropriately my original report included the call not only for a common consolidated corporate tax base, which it does, of course, support, but also for EU-wide minimum tax rates on corporate profits, which should no longer be exceeded by any country thereafter."
"Only minimum tax rates of this kind actually offer the opportunity to stop the upward trend in corporate taxes somewhere along the way."
"My report included the call for stronger EU-wide taxation of assets and financial transactions, the call to relieve labour income explicitly in the lower and middle classes and finally the call to reverse the fatal trend of transferring direct taxes increasingly to indirect taxes and reinstigate the counter-trend."
"Only a fraction of all these calls have unfortunately been retained after the vote in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"Instead, my report bursts into a song of praise for tax competition in complete ignorance of the fatal consequences of this supposedly healthy tax competition for the revenue side of EU budgets and therefore for the situations in which millions of Europeans also find themselves."
"Such changes made to the report unfortunately show very clearly whose interests are in fact close to the heart of the majority of members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and especially those of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, because it is very obvious who profits from the prevailing tax regimes in the EU."
"We have now once again put forward our most important requests as amendments in plenary."
"Should they fail to secure a majority there too, my group will vote against the report."
"Another taxation policy in the EU that minimises the social contrasts instead of constantly reinforcing them - as the present taxation policy does - would indeed be possible and would be demanded as a matter of urgency."
"This would, however, imply that the prevailing policy in the European Commission and also in the individual Member States does in fact consist of considering the interests of the majority of Europeans according to their guiding principle, instead of serving as they have done to date as executors of the interests of the élite of society."
"It will simply give rise to even greater parliamentary and extra-parliamentary pressure."
"We shall continue to strive precisely against this pressure so that eventually the inexpressible rhetoric of socially intolerable relationships - which characterises most reports and which also now characterises this report on taxation - is no longer capable of winning a majority in this House either."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I am really pleased to be able to discuss with you the contribution of taxation and customs policy to the Lisbon Strategy."
"A major priority of the European Union is to improve its competitiveness while preserving its social model."
"Taxation policy has a major role to play in helping to achieve growth and employment objectives."
"I welcome the essential message of your report, which is one of support for the Commission's initiatives in the tax area."
"In particular, it encourages increased efforts concerning the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB), the home state taxation pilot scheme proposal, the strategy ensuring better coordination of Member States' tax systems particularly in the field of exit taxation and cross-border loss relief, the work undertaken by the joint transfer pricing forum, the strategy to combat tax fraud, the VAT package, the reduced VAT rates on labour intensive services and environmental taxation."
"All these files are extremely important."
"They are the core of the Commission's approach to tax policy and many of them have been discussed in several committees of the European Parliament."
"It is clear that European companies deserve a system of corporate taxation adapted to the degree of their actual and potential economic integration at the scale of their cross-border activities in Europe."
"This is one of the keys to their future competitiveness."
"It is also essential that other direct tax obstacles find a solution by coordination and not only through costly litigation."
"There is only one area where I cannot follow you."
"This is in paragraph 17 of the Wagenknecht report, as it stands now, where it asks for the suppression of minimum rates for excise duties and the replacement of current Community legislation in this domain by a code of conduct."
"We discussed these elements in this House when dealing with the proposal on alcohol taxation and, with all due respect, I have got to say that the Commission has not changed its mind."
"Community legislation on excise duties in general has an important role to play in order to reduce distortion in the internal market, to protect public health and to gear consumption patterns towards more environmentally sustainable behaviour."
"The Commission strongly believes that minimum rates are necessary for the proper functioning of the internal market by providing a safety net for Member States which ensures that all Member States actually apply excise duties and that the levels are meaningful."
"I hope that the tabled amendment which aims at changing paragraph 17 will be endorsed by a majority of Members."
"I would like to conclude with three messages."
"Firstly, you all know that my services are working very hard to table a legislative proposal on the CCCTB which I intend to present to you after the summer break in 2008."
"Secondly, in the VAT field, the Commission fully supports the Portuguese Presidency in its efforts to reach agreement on the VAT package and also to advance substantially the broader debate on VAT rates before the end of the year."
"We can also work to ensure adoption of the proposal for prolonging certain derogations in new Member States on reduced VAT rates."
"In addition, we will continue our intense efforts to combat VAT fraud and we will soon come forward with a proposal on the VAT treatment of financial services that will provide the sector with more legal certainty and with modernised rules."
"Thirdly, we remain committed to a system of minimum rates in excise duties in order to reduce distortion and to promote fair competition in the internal market to contribute to the protection of public health and to the environment."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, sometimes, in this Chamber, we cannot really see the political differences between groups, but, on this issue, the difference is very visible, because I could not disagree more with the rapporteur on some of the points she just mentioned."
"I respect the work she has done on this report, but on this issue we have totally different views on what should be done by the Commission."
"First of all, this report is about the Lisbon Strategy and what we should do to restore Europe's global competitiveness."
"This is really the only way to guarantee European welfare and the welfare of our citizens."
"Without taxation, this is impossible."
"Taxation has a crucial role to play in this respect, in bringing competitiveness to Europe."
"We must remember that overall tax levels in Europe are still above the OECD average."
"In order to achieve a lower level of taxation in Europe, we need to create an environment conducive to investment."
"We need more investments, more growth, and more, flourishing businesses in Europe."
"Healthy tax competition has a beneficial role in this respect."
"This is an economic, market-based control mechanism against rampant political decisions."
"If we have fruitful tax competition in Europe, governments cannot put obstacles in the way of the single market."
"That is what we want: a genuine single market without tax-made obstacles."
"On the other hand, there is no evidence that fruitful tax competition would erode tax bases."
"The total tax revenue has remained remarkably stable, thanks to increased economic activity."
"However, the existence of 27 different tax regimes creates problems, particularly for European SMEs, which are so important to this growth."
"According to a 2004 EC taxation survey, compliance for small SMEs costs about 2.6% of their sales and 31% of taxes paid."
"So, one third of all the tax goes to compliance."
"The high proportionate amount of tax compliance for small companies is a big obstacle, and that is why we need to do our best to call for cross-border loss relief, simplified customs procedures, one-stop-shop schemes for VAT, home states taxation pilot projects and so on. We support everything that the Commission has done in this respect."
"Finally, industry wishes to see a well-managed and simple tax administration system."
"We need to resolve the problems of transfer pricing, loss offsetting EU-wide and avoiding double taxation, and to lower our compliance costs."
"We welcome the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB) proposal, and the fact that the Commission is stable and brings us the proposal on CCCTB, because loss-relief is only a temporary thing."
"In the end, we need a consolidated corporate tax base."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (EL) Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Wagenknecht had the initiative to draft a report, which is proof of the political courage it took to highlight the redistributive and social dimension of taxation policy."
"This document is one of the more important pieces of evidence showing that the debate on taxation policy may become Europe-wide."
"The commitment to meet the Lisbon targets, the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact, the obligation to administer and redistribute tax revenue so that it meets cohesion and employment objectives, and the completion of the internal market - all these are proof enough of a political aim."
"The taxation policies of Member States can no longer be based exclusively and solely on national criteria: dialogue on taxation is becoming necessary to promote greater tax coordination throughout Europe."
"Given such a dialogue, which has enabled substantial cooperation between the shadow rapporteurs of all the political groups, we have concentrated on the following fundamental points."
"Firstly, on the issue of tax competition, we do not believe that the object ought to be to curb the principle of tax competition, for this would be tantamount to censuring the policies of certain Member States."
"Owing to the lack of common rules on tax policy issues, tax competition with its offers and counter-offers of low tax rates creates problems."
"As is also the case for the other sectors of the internal market, however, tax competition can ensure competitiveness and improve the productivity of national economies, as well as that of Europe as a whole, provided that the rules curbing the growth of harmful competition obtain."
"The second point we focused on was the relation between direct and indirect taxation."
"A trend has recently been noticed in Member States to increase indirect taxation, in most cases to cover their fiscal deficits."
"This is a burden for consumers, however, and the market remains unmonitored."
"The aim of this report is to find safety measures facilitating a balanced combination of direct and indirect taxes."
"We are in favour of a revision of the system of VAT and special consumption taxes."
"This should not mean that it is replaced by a code of conduct not binding on all the Member States."
"Commissioner, we are aware of the efforts of the Commission and the problems at Ecofin."
"Nonetheless, we as members of the European Parliament must above all closely cooperate with national parliaments to debate this major fiscal policy."
"I would also like to stress the importance of this report as the strategic line we should follow in making reforms in the economies of the European Union."
"Regretfully, the representatives of Portugal are not with us today, when we are discussing this very important issue."
"What are the main points of our report?"
"The main point is that in view of changes in the economic environment we must carry out an overhaul not only of our plants and enterprises, but also of the instruments of our fiscal policy."
"When referring to the Lisbon Strategy, we usually speak about expenditure policy; very rarely do we consider taxation policy."
"Without paying due attention to taxation policy we would not be able to achieve the Lisbon objectives."
"What issues are to be considered?"
"First of all, it is necessary to look into the ways of distributing the tax burden between the producer and the consumer."
"Moreover, we cannot ignore the fact that there is one more group of people - those living on capital income."
"This is known as private equity."
"How do we distribute the tax burden?"
"This is one of the challenges presented by the new economic environment."
"Another very important question is: how do we encourage structural reforms?"
"Structural reforms cannot be implemented without introducing new enterprises, as people are not able to leave their existing jobs for new work places, which could create grounds for social discontent."
"New enterprises can be created only with beneficial taxation conditions."
"This is one of the main points of our document."
"The issue that needs to be considered is: what level of tax policy coordination is needed among the Member States?"
"We are in favour of competitive taxes and we do not support the idea of introducing minimum rates."
"This is because each country has its own specific economic structure and national expenditure policy."
"Taxation policy must be in line with expenditure policy, but we are definitely in favour of the coordination of tax base policy and support the Commission on that matter."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I emphatically agree with Mrs Kauppi."
"The disagreements between the groups here in the European Parliament on the subject of taxation policy are becoming clearer and clearer."
"We must give this debate much more serious attention over the next few months."
"I should like to thank the rapporteur and shadow rapporteur for the significant effort they have made in order to bring this report to a good conclusion."
"A good conclusion - but not for us."
"As a Group we shall not be able to accept this report in its final form."
"It has some pleasant aspects, for example it describes and demands the important step towards a consolidated tax base for corporate taxes."
"This is an important first step."
"However, this must be accompanied by similarly clear declarations as regards harmonising minimum tax rates, because otherwise it will lead to unchecked tax competition, specifically in this area."
"We also see problems under Article 17, where the committee has unfortunately clearly stated that it is against minimum tax rates for excise duty."
"This, too, is unfortunately in line with the votes of recent weeks and we greatly regret this."
"We support the group here."
"We believe that we have to achieve harmonisation in European excise duty and that this harmonisation must be strengthened, if anything, because otherwise we will have unchecked tax competition in excise duty."
"We also think it is a problem that far too little is being said on the subjects of climate change and eco-taxes."
"I, too, wish to disagree with the rapporteur here."
"I believe that eco-taxes are an important instrument for meeting these challenges of climate change."
"We have to do much more in this respect."
"I do, however, think that the approach of focussing on nuclear energy here, or on 'clean' forms of energy, is wrong."
"It is important that we focus clearly on energy saving and energy efficiency."
"These are the important answers."
"When we look at the challenges facing us in the refurbishment of buildings and in the field of transport, it seems that we can genuinely meet the Kyoto aim of energy saving if a great deal more is done here."
"Tax policy can make an important contribution to achieving greater energy savings and, greater energy efficiency and to genuinely meeting the challenges of climate change."
"Unfortunately, this report does not reflect this position."
"As I have already announced, we shall therefore not be voting in favour of this report."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FI) Mr President, Commissioner, our group endorses Mrs Wagenknecht's views in this matter, even if they are in conflict with the opinions of the majority on the Committee."
"The European Union will not be the world's leading knowledge- and technology-based economy in 2010."
"It is not, however, due to tax systems, which have continually been reformed in ways that favour big companies, that the target under the Lisbon Strategy is unrealisable."
"Big companies choose transfer pricing and finding of a home for their capital as options enabling them to avoid tax."
"In this they are aided by the tax havens and offshore financial centres operating in the Member States of the EU, both blots on the EU's moral landscape."
"According to the rapporteur, the Commission in its communication does not consider the effects of taxation on income distribution."
"The system of flat tax which some Member States apply favours those on large incomes, while progressive income tax promotes social equality."
"The Lisbon Strategy cannot be implemented in a manner which would eat away at the financial basis of the welfare society and which would be grossly unfair."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, it says this is a contribution, but it is more like a recipe, a recipe for the harmonisation of yet more taxation, which I quote here and there from the report: '27 different tax systems' are an 'impediment'; 'coordination of Member States' fiscal policy'; 'calls on the Member States to ... ensure greater fairness in the distribution of the tax burden'; 'supports' the Commission in gearing 'fiscal policy towards ... environmental objectives'; 'increase in fuel taxes'; 'establish a pan-European ... corporate tax base'."
"In short, it is back to the failed policies of the 1970s."
"In any case, even the British cannot get it right for all of our country."
"North is not the same as the south, Wales and Scotland are different to the south-east - and that was under Gordon Brown as Chancellor for 10 years."
"Surely you listened to him; after all, you did at Lisbon last week when, as Prime Minister, you let him keep the red lines, did you not?"
"Or did you?"
"Later in the report, it talks about 'EU-wide coordination' of 'direct taxation'."
"In the UK, we thought we had been promised that harmonised taxes, especially income tax, would never come."
"Now, here it is in a report."
"It is a bit like the Reform Treaty."
"Gordon Brown keeps on saying it is not a constitution, when all the EU leaders say it is: Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, Angela Merkel, even our own President of President said so in this Chamber a short while ago."
"So why do you not get Gordon Brown to tell the truth to the British people?"
"Harmonise that message!"
"Now, that is harmonisation I would go along with."
"But you dare not do that to the British people because, when they are told the plain unvarnished truth, they will vote with their feet, right out of the EU, taking their annual EU contributions of EUR 18 billion of their own taxpayers' money with them."
"What price harmonised taxes then?"
"on behalf of the ITS Group. - (RO) The importance of reviewing the contribution that the fiscal and customs policies could bring to the development of the Lisbon Strategy cannot be questioned."
"For this reason, but not only, the objective of the document we examine today, namely the Wagenknecht report, to evaluate the contribution of policies applied to the fields specified for achieving the Lisbon Strategy objectives, is salutary."
"It could not be otherwise, since the Lisbon Strategy proposes generous objectives, such as promoting economic growth and designing policies that would allow European companies to create more and better jobs."
"Nevertheless, reading the report, I was surprised, as a citizen of a recently acceded country, at the impression that it addresses a Union made up only of countries with developed economies, or rather, with equally developed economies, which is not true."
"It is very probable for some of the measures proposed not to have beneficial results for the less developed economies, taking into account that the general laws of the single competitive market favour strong economies, to the disadvantage of the weaker ones."
"Due to lack of time, I will not expand on this subject, but I consider that, in order for the report's objectives to have beneficial results in the economies of all 27 countries, not 25, as specified in the text, it is necessary to perform the comparative review of their economies and, according to the results, to adopt a set of actions that would create equal conditions for developing the effects proposed by the project."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - Mr President, the report on the table today demonstrates, once again, the relentless attack on Member States that operate low and successful corporate tax regimes."
"I do not accept that low corporation tax leads to unfair tax competition."
"I believe that ensuring competitiveness is a vital element in the tax policy mix of a fully functioning single market."
"Where is the Commission's evidence to prove that CCCTB will not hamper EU competitiveness?"
"Where is the proof to say that it will benefit EU competitiveness?"
"Why is it that countries with low tax, low unemployment and high growth are being attacked by the Commission?"
"I do not understand it."
"It is absolutely farcical for the Commission to say that setting a tax base will not eventually set a tax rate, because that is already what the larger Member States are saying."
"It does not stand up to any kind of scrutiny."
"Attempts by large Member States to giftwrap tax harmonisation in the flowery paper of CCCTB will not be accepted by Ireland or other Member States."
"The fact of the matter is that it is not the right of Ireland, or any other Member State, to play a role in setting the tax rate of another Member State."
"The unity of Europe is not compromised by diversity in tax policies; rather, the EU's competitiveness is undermined by the wrong tax policies."
"I firmly believe that the EU is best served by promoting tax competition, not tax harmonisation."
"How is it that a country like Ireland, and other Member States, which changed radically their tax policies and became successful economies, are now under attack?"
"What is the attractiveness of a country like Ireland, Commissioner, if you bring in this system and eventually bring in tax harmonisation?"
"Because that is exactly what it is, and the only way tax will go is up."
"It has already been said, by people within the Commission, that they want to see a tax regime more or less in the middle of what it is at the moment, which is approximately in the low 20%."
"What would be the attractiveness of Ireland or other peripheral countries?"
"There would be not attractiveness, just high unemployment in the long..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, the report we have in front of Parliament today rightly states that tax competition in the EU has led, and continues to lead, to EU-wide economic gains by way of a dynamic corporate environment."
"The CCCTB could just as easily lead to a less competitive EU and should not be supported, in my view."
"The EU needs to be responsive to an ever-changing global economy."
"Modern competitive economies need to be flexible to meet the changing requirements of new products and services."
"The CCCTB will undermine this flexibility for a number of reasons."
"An EU-wide corporation tax base will be inflexible and hinder an individual country's ability to decide its own legal fiscal strategy, based on its particular circumstances."
"The CCCTB's proponents assert that each Member State will retain its autonomy to determine its national tax rate - but will they?"
"Is the CCCTB not the thin end of the wedge?"
"If the CCCTB is optional, it merely increases the number of bases available to companies and makes the system even more complex."
"Domestic tax law offers certainty to business."
"A system that is applied in a number of Member States may lead to differences over how the provisions are interpreted, bringing about uncertainty for business."
"In the remaining time available to me, I can simply make some bullet points."
"First, taxation is a matter of national sovereignty for each Member State."
"The right to choose the level of public spending and the funding of such expenditure is a basic function of national democratic process."
"It is necessary to protect the flexibility of tax policy in rewarding enterprise and the creation of jobs and growth in the economy."
"A single base would do away with flexibility."
"There is no evidence to suggest that a common consolidated corporate tax base will address issues such as competitiveness, compliance costs for companies, transfer pricing and so on. It would not simplify EU tax issues, as the so-called 'optional system' proposed would add another layer, as I have just said."
"The harmonisation of the tax base would lead to pressure on national tax rates."
"Such harmonisation will only increase the attractiveness of non-EU corporate locations."
"The Code of Conduct on business taxation addressed harmful tax competition."
"Different tax rates in EU Member States are not harmful."
"I would ask the Commissioner, when he brings forward these proposals, as he suggests, next year, to please bear this in mind."
"Member States like Ireland have already given..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to thank our rapporteur here, for the quality of the work she has done and her efforts to come up with a text that, unfortunately, she does not seem totally satisfied with."
"Taxation is clearly an essential complement to the construction of a true internal market, if you want the market to be more than just a free-trade area where any form of tax and social dumping is permitted."
"The completion of the internal market therefore requires the harmonisation of certain rules on taxation and in the first place calls for the creation of a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base."
"The report put before us today opens the door to this, and I am pleased about this."
"I note that a number of fellow Members are very actively against this plan, in the name of what they describe as 'fair' competition."
"Personally I believe that free, undistorted competition - and I am not a frenzied advocate of this type of competition - requires a certain amount of transparency as regards the rules."
"I am surprised that countries that have benefited from massive contributions from the European Union, in the name of solidarity, are today rejecting this step, which would be an important step forward in terms of solidarity, competition and transparency."
"Taxation is also a formidable tool that the EU must use if it is to implement its chosen strategies, because it does not have all that many tools."
"It can have a positive impact on the cleanest energies or to achieve..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(SV) Mr President, this is a report that is heavily influenced by the compromise between the PPE-DE and the ALDE."
"I believe it is largely a balanced report."
"The Member States' responsibility for taxation policies is laid down, whilst there are a number of taxes that would benefit from greater EU coordination."
"In the rapporteur's original proposal, there was thorough coordination with a strong emphasis on higher levels of redistribution."
"That cannot be a way to make Europe grow or to create new jobs."
"In the globalised world in which we live, it is not higher taxes that Europe needs."
"Instead, I think that we who live in high-taxation countries should look at other models, such as a flatter tax."
"In general, taxes should be lowered on work and raised on harmful consumption."
"For example, specific environmental taxes should be introduced, as well as reasonable excise duties on alcohol and tobacco, for example, as the Commissioner says."
"Here the EU must be able to act with greater accord."
"This is a politically sensitive issue - we have heard that here and I am well aware of it - but it is nonetheless necessary, in my opinion."
"If we are to resolve the major climate and energy challenges that we are facing, it would be irresponsible of us to rule out controlling fiscal instruments."
"It is possible to achieve high growth, with high environmental and energy taxes, and at the same time reduce the overall tax burden."
"Any doubters can look at the policy of the centre-right government in my home country, Sweden, if I can be allowed to be a little patriotic at the end of this debate."
"(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, in taking the floor in a debate devoted to the impact of taxation and customs policies on the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that some of the suggestions relating to the Member States' tax systems that are contained in Mrs Wagenknecht's report will not have a positive impact on economic growth and employment in EU countries."
"Firstly, moving away from tax competition and attempts to standardise solutions in the area of corporate income tax run counter to the principle of tax sovereignty for EU Member States."
"Secondly, lowering corporate tax rates while simultaneously doing away with any associated tax relief will not just fail to bring about a reduction in budget income from this tax; it will, in fact, increase it substantially."
"This is confirmed by the situation in my country, Poland, where the corporate tax rate has been substantially reduced, yet receipts from this tax are greater with each year that passes."
"Thirdly and finally, in this situation I consider the report's suggestions relating to coordination and tax systems, including direct taxation, to be hazardous steps that will certainly not help to implement the Lisbon Strategy."
"(HU) Thank you Mr President."
"What are we talking about?"
"One of the key issues is whether we are a match - in terms of competitiveness - for the external tax competition, in other words for tax competition from outside the European Union, and we should not be looking for scapegoats within the European Union."
"Otherwise, as several of my colleagues have stated, capital will leave the whole of the EU."
"What do we agree with in this taxation policy?"
"We agree that it should facilitate job creation, in other words promote labour; we agree that we should help small and medium-sized enterprises, since these enable people to remain where they are, they help to reinforce families, and also to create jobs."
"I also agree with its social policy measures, which will help tackle the demographic challenge in the European Union."
"What do we disagree with?"
"We disagree with over-taxing ourselves in areas relating to health, the environment or social policy instead of pursuing an anti-inflationary policy and seeking to respond appropriately to the challenges of competition."
"The other thing that we must bear in mind is that the European Union has expanded and become highly heterogeneous."
"We expect everyone to maintain budgetary discipline in their independent fiscal policy, but at the same time we want to minimise the instruments for doing this."
"If convergence is our primary goal, then in indirect taxation for example, such as excise duties, if we are to get anywhere, we should be obliging not only countries operating at around the minimum rate to achieve convergence, but also countries that apply much higher rates."
"This is why in several instances we have proposed replacing the current approach based exclusively on a minimum rate of excise duty by some kind of 'code of conduct' steering Member States along the same path."
"As regards common capital or the common tax base, I would like to say this: it would be a serious problem if this entailed punishing competitive countries, if the minimum rate were to be introduced."
"I am also apprehensive about what will happen as regards movement of capital when the common tax base is established."
"Will it not mean that profits from subsidiaries in the new Member States, for example, will constantly be reclassified in the accounts as profits of the parent company instead of being invested locally?"
"Combating fraud is also very important, and I wish the Commission good luck with this."
"It is on the right track, since the most important thing is to regularise the black economy and take steps to combat crime. Thank you very much, Mr President."
"(PL) Mr President, the main aim of the Lisbon Strategy is to increase the competitiveness of national economies."
"A high level of competitiveness enables economic growth to be accelerated and new jobs to be created, and makes it possible to fund important social aims."
"Unfortunately the current tax system in EU Member States does not favour implementation of the Lisbon Strategy."
"The burdens placed on employment law and economic activity are too great, tax rates are too differentiated, and the regulations are too complicated."
"At the same time the tax system is burdened with an excessive number of functions and tasks - economic, fiscal, social or environmental."
"For taxes to aid competitiveness, they must above all create incentives to work, to develop economic activities and to innovate."
"To this end taxes, especially direct taxes, should be set at a moderate level, avoiding unnecessary differentiation of rates and excessive progression."
"Since direct taxes exert a stronger, negative impact on production and employment, we must make greater use of indirect taxes when planning budgetary income."
"In relation to the debate, Mr President, I wish to express my concern that there is too much ideology and politics, and too little real economic knowledge."
"The best example is the concepts that are used here, such as fiscal dumping or social dumping."
"There is no objective standard for taxation, and it is therefore not possible to accuse those states that apply low company taxation levels of fiscal dumping."
"(PL) Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by congratulating the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on a difficult and fundamentally successful operation to introduce the necessary amendments to the initial text, which was the original address."
"Initially it was being suggested to us not only that the European Union should get involved in establishing the principles of corporation tax, but also that these taxes should be raised, against world trends."
"It is a good thing that we have avoided this."
"For similar reasons we should take a critical view of the support evinced in the text for tax base harmonisation."
"A Community tax base is a blow to tax competition in the EU, with all the associated negative consequences."
"Its introduction would limit Member States' efforts to optimise corporation taxation against the Lisbon targets."
"In political terms this would burden the EU, which, in its own properly conceived interest, should refrain from trying to influence the shape of tax systems in Europe."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, this debate has been very interesting and most of the contributions have been encouraging."
"Like you, I am persuaded that our efforts to dismantle tax barriers in the internal market are worthwhile sustaining."
"I am particularly grateful for your support concerning the important project of the CCCTB and I look forward to your forthcoming own-initiative report on the common base."
"As far as some of the critical remarks are concerned, I intend to send a personal letter to those honourable Members of Parliament who have expressed their objection, which I appreciate."
"It would be fair to answer them in written form as I do not want to take too much of your time."
"I am pleased that most of you share my view that taxation policy has a major role to play in attaining many of the EU's policy objectives, and in particular growth, employment, competitiveness and sustainability."
"Thank you for your attention and for your support."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank many people for keeping within their time and also thank everyone, I hope, for their understanding, which has enabled us to close the debate five minutes early and therefore to be able to listen to everyone, instead of what happens on other occasions, when before an important debate or a vote we are unable to listen to what our colleagues have to say."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - We all ought to agree that the simultaneous existence of 27 national taxation systems seriously hampers the blooming of the full advantages of our single market."
"Moreover, there is indeed a genuine opportunity to reinvigorate the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy through EU-wide taxation and customs measures that would make the Union a more attractive place to invest and work."
"In extending and deepening more competitive markets, we should use all tools available, including more investment-friendly fiscal and custom policies, in order to boost employment, R&D investments and the development of environmentally friendly technologies."
"In this respect, we warmly welcome the own-initiative report drawn up by Ms Wagenknecht, which aims at setting up the necessary fiscal framework to encourage risk and innovative investments in order to achieve the objectives of growth and employment."
"The advantages of simplifying and harmonising the taxation systems in the Union as a whole are obvious as not only it will help reaching the Lisbon objectives - through greater tax incentives for investments - but, furthermore, it will help achieve EU market integration by lifting remaining obstacles to the completion of the single market."
"(The sitting was suspended at 09.55 a.m. and resumed at 10.10 a.m.)"
"Results of the informal summit of heads of state and government (Lisbon, 18-19 October 2007) (debate)"
"The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the results of the informal summit of heads of state and government in Lisbon."
"May I give a warm welcome to the President of the EU Council and Prime Minister of Portugal, José Sócrates. A very warm welcome this morning to the European Parliament!"
"An equally warm welcome, of course, to the President of the European Commission, José Manuel Durão Barroso, and thank you to him for his work at the European summit."
"Ladies and gentlemen, before we begin the debate I should like - and I do not wish to jump ahead at all - to thank the Portuguese Presidency sincerely for its enormous input and for the success achieved on Thursday night at around 1 a.m. when it approved the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
"This is a great result for the European Union and a great result for us all."
"On behalf of the European Parliament, I should like to add that without the European Parliament, we would not be where we are today."
"This is also a great result for us all because the Treaty was and is the top priority for the European Parliament if we are to come out ahead and be victorious in this Treaty."
"With these congratulations to the Portuguese Presidency, and also to the Commission - and I see Commissioner Wallström here, who has also made a significant contribution, next to the President of the Commission - it gives me great joy now to hand over to the President of the EU Council, José Sócrates."
"A warm welcome to the European Parliament!"
"Mr President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to dedicate my first words today to the memory of a friend of mine."
"In memory of MEP Fausto Correia, who died a few days ago."
"He died young."
"His death is of course a great loss not only to the European Parliament but also to the Portuguese Socialist Party."
"Fausto Correia was a man of fine political and human qualities."
"You all had the opportunity to get to know him."
"He was an intelligent politician, open and always committed to noble European ideals."
"But I would like to lay special emphasis here on his human qualities of generosity, companionship and tolerance."
"Indeed, it is our human qualities that give meaning to our political life."
"His passing is a personal loss to me, the loss of an old friend, with whom I shared many moments of my life, and I will miss him very much."
"Ladies and gentlemen, when I presented the programme of the Portuguese Presidency to this plenary three months ago, I stated very clearly what would be the main challenge - the top priority - of the Portuguese Presidency: to draw up and reach an agreement on the new Treaty, putting an end to the six years of impasse in the institutional debate in which the European Union was immersed."
"Today, therefore, it is with great satisfaction that I address the house to present the agreement reached by the Intergovernmental Conference on 18 October."
"This agreement was the basis for the new Treaty of Lisbon."
"The Treaty will be signed on 13 December in the city whose name it will bear."
"The Portuguese Presidency began with the task of transforming the mandate that we inherited from the German Presidency - which as I have said before was of exemplary clarity and precision - but to transform that mandate into a new Treaty."
"That was our mission."
"The agreement we have reached confirms that the method and timetable we set out at the start of our Presidency were right."
"It was necessary - as I told you here at the start of the Presidency - to make the most of the June Council to endeavour to complete the Treaty not in December, as some advocated, but in October, at the informal Council, and we were right."
"The truth is that we held the fastest Intergovernmental Conference in the history of the European Union on a treaty revision."
"We began on 23 July and completed it on 18 October."
"When the history of this Treaty is written we will understand better the importance of that political decision, of not leaving until the end of the year the task that we were able to complete earlier."
"Europe needed a quick agreement and that is what it got."
"Europe needed a sign of confidence and that is what it got."
"Europe needed to turn towards the future and that is what it has done."
"We worked speedily with all the Member States which, without exception, showed a constructive spirit and a will to overcome the remaining difficulties."
"This enabled us to present a full text of the Treaty on 3 October, and brought us much closer to our goal."
"The issues that remained for the Lisbon Summit were limited, though obviously politically sensitive."
"In this context, our strategy was to try to reach an agreement on the first day of the summit."
"This seemed to us not only possible but also highly desirable as it would send a strong signal to Europe."
"The signal that the EU is capable of taking rapid decisions, even decisions that everyone acknowledges are difficult."
"Moreover, it was very important that we should be able to resolve these institutional issues on the first day of the informal Council and, on the second day, right after that decision, to discuss globalisation and how Europe should tackle global issues."
"In Lisbon it was therefore possible to reach agreement on the following issues, enabling us to finalise the agreement on the Treaty:"
"First the Ioannina clause, and in the agreement a solution was reached at two levels:"
"a declaration relating to the system for decision-making in the Council by a qualified majority that clarifies the actual Ioannina safeguard mechanism;"
"in addition a protocol that determines how this mechanism for consensus in the European Council may be amended or revoked."
"As I have had the opportunity to say before, the Ioannina issue, as I saw it in the agreement at the last Council, required this clause to be mandatory by law, but not to be in the Treaty."
"The solution that we adopted, a declaration plus a protocol guaranteeing that the decision on Ioannina can be amended only by consensus, seemed to us to be the solution that was most true to the spirit of the last agreement."
"Thus we provided guarantees on the Ioannina compromise without undermining the integrity of the process of qualified-majority decision-making."
"There was also a need to resolve a political issue regarding the number of Advocates-General in the Court of Justice."
"A declaration was agreed to the effect that the Council would approve any request from the Court of Justice for the number of Advocates-General to be increased by three (eleven instead of eight)."
"In that case, Poland will have a permanent Advocate-General and no longer take part in the rotation system, while the existing rotation system will involve the rotation of five Advocates-General instead of the current three."
"As for the appointment of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, we agreed on a declaration to the effect that the European Parliament should take part in the appointment process even in the first stage, from January 2009, through appropriate contacts."
"The Conference also approved a declaration clarifying the delimitation of competences between the Union and the Member States as provided for in the Treaties."
"Finally, the issue of the composition of the European Parliament."
"As you know, Article 9a of the Treaty on European Union has been amended to state that the number of MEPs shall not exceed seven hundred and fifty, plus the President, i.e. 751, maintaining degressive proportionality."
"Two declarations were attached to that amendment:"
"one stating that the additional seat in the European Parliament will be attributed to Italy;"
"the other guaranteeing that the European Council will give its political agreement on the composition of the European Parliament, based on the proposal from Parliament itself."
"The Council therefore accepted the criteria put forward by Parliament and went ahead with what it considered an acceptable adjustment, with a view to adapting the current framework during the 2009-2014 period."
"Apart from the issues that I have mentioned, the concern of the Portuguese Presidency was also to build into the Treaty those rules and exception clauses that were in the mandate, naturally respecting the positions of the Member States that wanted to obtain them, but always concerned to avoid detracting from the Community decision-making process and the overall coherence of the Treaty."
"Thus we have a new Treaty."
"It is a new Treaty and a good Treaty."
"A Treaty that resolves the crisis of the past and puts Europe in a position to set its eyes on the future."
"A Treaty with significant advances, some of which I would like to highlight, if I may."
"This Treaty adopts, without alteration, the enlargement of the European Parliament's participation in the legislative process, as well as the innovations in the budgetary process, thereby enhancing the Union's democratic legitimacy;"
"This Treaty improves the decision-making process, specifically by extending qualified-majority voting to the area of freedom, security and justice;"
"Again in the area of freedom, security and justice, this Treaty enshrines the necessary legal bases for the development of more effective immigration and asylum policies, as well as police and judicial cooperation in the fight against terrorism and organised crime that strengthens security for our citizens;"
"This Treaty clearly lists the areas in which the Member States have transferred powers to the EU;"
"This Treaty strengthens the supervisory role of the national parliaments."
"However, among all the advances contained in this Treaty, there is one point that I would like to highlight in particular: this Treaty explicitly gives legally binding force to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, due to be proclaimed by the European Union's three institutions on 12 December."
"In addition is the EU's accession to the European Convention on Human Rights and the fact that a solution has been found to the issue of the legal framework of European citizenship, as requested, moreover, by the representatives of Parliament."
"Regarding external relations, the new institutional framework created by the Treaty - notably the addition of the post of High Representative and Vice-President of the European Commission for Foreign Affairs - is a reflection of Europe's foreign policy ambitions, that will allow Europe to play a more prominent role on the international stage and give it the means to cooperate effectively with our partners."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the negotiations were tough and demanding, but Europe succeeded."
"Europe succeeded and achieved the crucial objective of having a Treaty that asserts European values and strengthens Europe as a global economic player, and of putting in place more effective institutional conditions to enable Europe to play its role."
"Europe therefore emerges stronger from this Summit."
"Stronger to face global issues."
"Stronger to take up its role in the world."
"Stronger because it has sent a signal of confidence to our economy and to European citizens."
"The Lisbon Treaty now demonstrates that Europe is ready, confident and self-assured."
"The Lisbon Treaty has once again made Europe ready for a new era."
"Allow me to thank the European Parliament and its President, Hans-Gert Pöttering and its representatives at the Intergovernmental Conference - Elmar Brok (PPE-DE), Enrique Barón-Crespo (PSE) and Andrew Duff (ALDE)."
"On behalf of the Portuguese Presidency I would like to thank you for your excellent collaboration in our work, your constructive suggestions, but mainly for your constant commitment to Europe reaching an agreement and to its reaching agreement quickly."
"(Loud applause)"
"I would also like to thank the European Commission, especially the President of the Commission, to whom the Presidency is hugely indebted over these months for his valued assistance in bringing the negotiations to a successful conclusion. Thank you very much, Mr President."
"(Applause)"
"However, I must also express my deep gratitude to the General Secretariat of the Council, especially its Legal Services and its Director-General, Jean-Claude Piris."
"On behalf of the Presidency, I would like to thank them for their hard work, skill and dedication."
"They did an absolutely magnificent job."
"I would also like to thank all the representatives of the Member States who took part, at various levels, in the Intergovernmental Conference."
"The Presidency will not forget the spirit of cooperation, commitment and openness that everyone displayed in seeking the best solutions."
"Ladies and gentlemen, allow me now to give very personal thanks."
"I would like to thank the Foreign Affairs Minister, sitting next to me, Luís Amado, the Secretary of State, Lobo Antunes, and all the Portuguese diplomats who gave their best during this period to ensure that it would be remembered, without doubt, as one of the great achievements of the EU Presidency."
"Ladies and gentlemen, having achieved the goal of finalising the Lisbon Treaty, the Heads of State or Government were able to devote the morning of day two to debating the external dimension of the Lisbon Agenda and how Europe should respond to the challenges of globalisation."
"It was an excellent debate, featuring the valued contribution of the President of the European Parliament."
"It was also a debate looking to the future."
"The President of the European Commission presented an important contribution to the discussion, based on the communication on 'The European Interest: succeeding in the age of globalisation'."
"This document was highly praised by the Heads of State or Government."
"The main points covered in the debate were the financial markets in the light of the recent turmoil, and climate change in view of the Bali Conference."
"Among the various conclusions that could be drawn from the debate, I would like to highlight one: the idea that pervaded the debate on that Friday morning, that Europe is now equipped - and even duty-bound in some areas - to lead the globalisation process; be it in the reciprocal opening-up of markets, improving environmental, social, financial and intellectual property standards, or strengthening strategic cooperation with our international partners."
"Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to say one last thing before I finish."
"It is true that 18 October ended with an agreement on the Lisbon Treaty, but that day also began with another important agreement that I would like to tell you about here: the agreement between the European social partners on the new challenges for the labour market."
"This was also an important agreement."
"Through this agreement, the social partners set an example of constructive engagement, responsibility and social dialogue."
"A good example of attention to the need for dialogue, of the need for reform in a globalised and constantly changing world."
"Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to end on a personal note."
"In political life it is rare that we have the opportunity to serve our country and serve Europe at a critical moment."
"I feel honoured to have had that opportunity."
"I would like to thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for the support from all the benches that I have always had in this House."
"However, our work is not finished."
"We have much to do."
"For my part I would like to assure you that the Presidency will continue to work with the same commitment, energy and conviction that we began with and to work for a stronger Europe and a better world."
"(Loud applause)"
"Many thanks, President-in-Office, for your report and for your work."
"Ladies and gentlemen, you have heard about the composition of the European Parliament and the report by the President-in-Office did not discuss the voting rights of the President of the European Parliament."
"I shall therefore emphasise here once again that this was not about the European Council either."
"The President of the European Parliament will, if he agrees, make use of his rights, of course."
"No-one can take that away from him and the European Council has not taken it away from him either."
"I should like to state this here for the record."
"I should now like to ask the President of the European Commission, José Manuel Durão Barroso, to be kind enough to speak to us."
"President of the Commission. - (PT) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the Lisbon Summit was a summit of a united Europe of solidarity."
"The EU has emerged from a period of six years of discussing institutional issues and from the divisions caused by those debates."
"We have reached agreement on the Lisbon Treaty."
"First of all I would like to pay a sincere tribute to the work of the Portuguese Presidency, and especially to the determined leadership of Prime Minister José Sócrates."
"I would also like to extend these compliments to all of his team, whose skill and dedication I witnessed almost on a daily basis."
"It is also right to acknowledge the remarkable work of the German Presidency, especially of Chancellor Angela Merkel when she succeeded in defining a mandate, a clear and precise mandate that was the basis for the Intergovernmental Conference."
"However, it is also true that without the determination and competence of the Portuguese Presidency we would not now be celebrating the fact that we have transformed a mandate into a Treaty."
"Allow me to say that it is of special significance that the Treaty will be signed on 13 December in Lisbon at the Jeronimo Monastery, precisely where the Treaty of Accession of Portugal to the European Community was signed."
"Twenty years after Portugal's accession to the European Community, Portugal seems to be repaying Europe for everything it has done for Portugal by helping Europe to overcome this impasse."
"Prime Minister, Portugal has every reason to feel proud of its work, of the work of the Portuguese Presidency in concluding the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Let me also salute the European Parliament for its commitment during the IGC."
"Throughout this process the European Parliament showed a strong political will to resolve the institutional issue, being determined to reinforce European democracy."
"I wish in particular to pay tribute to the role of President Pöttering and the delegation of the European Parliament - Mr Brok, Mr Barón Crespo and Mr Duff - and to thank them for the constructive relationship they had with the Commission."
"This was, indeed, exemplary cooperation, and I think we both made a contribution to very important advances in the new Treaty, namely the issues of citizenship."
"The Treaty of Lisbon is the first Treaty of the enlarged Union."
"It is the first time in the history of European integration that states which were once divided by a totalitarian curtain together negotiated and reached agreement on a common European Treaty."
"It is appropriate that we all remember today the importance of the Berlin Declaration, which celebrated not only the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome but also the emergence of a free and re-united Europe."
"Let me recall today some of the predictions we have heard during the last two years."
"In 2005, after the two negative referenda, we heard some people saying that the European Union of 25 or 27 would never agree on a Treaty, whatever its content."
"There were far too many different national interests to allow the Union to reach a consensus, some sceptics said."
"In 2007, critics said that Member States would never agree on a mandate."
"Then they said that a mandate from the June European Council would never be respected."
"On my way to Lisbon last week I was still hearing some critics saying that it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to reach an agreement and that delegations had even booked hotels until Sunday morning - maybe expecting to benefit from the very nice weather in Lisbon and Portugal."
"The fact is that 27 Member States reached a consensus, respected the mandate and agreed on a Treaty - and all of this on the Thursday night, after dinner."
"The success of Lisbon tells us that the European Union is, indeed, tougher than it looks, with a strong ability to recover from setbacks."
"I am proud to say that the European Union today is alive and delivering."
"The Commission is happy with the results of the IGC."
"The two non-negotiable conditions set by the Commission were fully respected."
"On the one hand, the Lisbon Treaty has clearly advanced from the current status quo."
"I always said that the Commission could not accept a solution less ambitious than the Nice Treaty."
"In fact we wanted as much progress as possible."
"On the other hand, we fought hard to keep the competence of the Commission intact, and to keep the Community method at the centre of the European Union."
"There were, let us be honest, certain attempts to reduce and to weaken the competence of the Commission."
"Let me be clear, there is no European integration without strong European Institutions, and I believe this treaty will reinforce the European Institutions, not weaken them, because if you want the European Union to have an increased capacity to act, you need strong, effective, democratic and accountable European Institutions."
"The Treaty of Lisbon will reinforce the democratic nature of the European Union."
"First, thanks to the efforts of the European Parliament, there is now a clear definition of what European citizenship means."
"Second, the Reform Treaty also gives legal force to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which will be a central part of the system of checks and balances in our Union of Law."
"Together with President Pöttering and Prime Minister Socrates, we will proclaim the Charter in the European Parliament before the signature of the Reform Treaty."
"The solemn dignity of the Charter will thus be properly recognised here in Strasbourg."
"Third, the European Parliament will have a greater role in the legislative process of the Union."
"The fourth democratic advance introduced by the reformed Treaty regards the rights of national parliaments, which will reinforce the principles of accountability and subsidiarity."
"However, the central feature of the democratic nature of the Union remains the European Parliament."
"One of the things I most enjoy when I am in Strasbourg is to listen to the many political leaders and political figures from all over the world addressing this plenary on their aspirations for democracy, and their strong beliefs in freedom and individual rights."
"That really is one of the vocations of the European Parliament - to be the House for the voices of freedom in this world."
"It is something that should make all Europeans proud."
"When you hear those voices, you also realise what we have achieved in Europe, because once we also had people in European cities, marching for the same democratic rights."
"We should be very proud to live on a continent where, thanks to the European Union, we can enjoy fundamental rights, and we will say that together when we approve the Reform Treaty and the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"The European Union faces many challenges, both internal and external."
"Our citizens want results."
"The Treaty of Lisbon will turn a new page in our ability to deliver, and will reinforce our capacity to act."
"In particular, the Treaty will introduce substantial advances in the area of justice and home affairs."
"The Reform Treaty will also reinforce the European Union's cohesion in external affairs."
"I personally attached the highest importance to one of the most important innovations in this Treaty, which is, precisely, the creation of a High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Policy who will at the same time be Vice-President of the Commission."
"This is a great opportunity for the European Union to act in a coherent and united manner in the world."
"Our internal prosperity, our freedom and our security depend on the capacity of the European Union to act decisively at the global level."
"With the Reform Treaty, Europe will have the conditions and instruments to shape globalisation and not to hide from globalisation."
"We should not miss this opportunity."
"I know that some committed Europeans are not happy with the number of opt-outs."
"The Commission and I would obviously have preferred to avoid those opt-outs and specific arrangements."
"However, diversity is a central feature of the European Union, and sometimes it requires political and institutional compromises."
"I would prefer to have specific opt-outs for specific countries than to be forced to lower the overall level of ambition of our Treaty and our Europe."
"The crucial point is that despite our diversity, we remain united regarding fundamental goals, fundamental values and fundamental principles."
"We have many tasks ahead: economic reform, growth and jobs, the reinforcement of social cohesion, our focus on innovation, our proposals on energy and climate change, and our programme for justice, freedom and security."
"We need to keep proving that we are not engaged in institutional navel-gazing and show that we are dealing with the real issues facing Europe."
"A great signal also came from the social partners on the very day of the beginning of our summit, when the social partners at European level agreed on an analysis of the labour market in Europe, and in general terms welcomed the concept of flexicurity."
"This showed that the social partners also want to work with us in this proactive attitude towards globalisation."
"Regarding Lisbon, we also made progress on the second day of our summit."
"We discussed the great issue for the European Union in the 21st century, which is to promote the European interest in the age of globalisation."
"Our discussion was the natural complement to concluding the Reform Treaty."
"The message was clear: after concluding the negotiations on the Institutions, let us put those discussions behind us and face the real issues that are of most concern to our citizens, where they want to see us delivering concrete results."
"We had a very positive debate."
"The paper presented by the Commission, based on the concept of the European interest, was fully endorsed, and the decision was taken to work on a declaration on globalisation for the December European Council, to show that tackling globalisation is a common thread in much of the European Union's work today."
"The Heads of State and Government welcomed the concept of the fifth freedom: freedom of circulation of researchers and ideas, which is a cornerstone of our response to globalisation."
"That is particularly important, as we are engaged in crucial debates about Galileo and preparing to implement the European Institute of Technology."
"I truly welcome the spirit in which that debate was held."
"It was clear that we now need to reinforce the external dimension of the Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs."
"It was clear that, without further commitment from the Member States on issues regarding education, innovation, research and technology, we would not succeed."
"I think it is also fair to say that all Member States recognise the need for a European-level approach and that we need more action at European level if we really want to succeed in the age of globalisation."
"This Commission has argued all along that institutional reform is important, but that we also need delivery of results, side-by-side."
"As the Commission said in 2005 and 2006, that twin-track approach was the way out of the institutional stalemate."
"In Lisbon we achieved the strategic objective: we agreed on a Reform Treaty."
"Now it is crucially important to achieve a further goal, which is the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty before the European elections in 2009."
"I believe there is, indeed, a new political confidence in Europe."
"The last polls demonstrate the highest support for the European Union since 1994."
"The political climate is right to move ahead."
"The IGC and the Lisbon Informal Council demonstrated that, when European Institutions and Member States cooperate, we are able to solve what seem to be even the most complicated and most challenging problems."
"It is my wish that the spirit of Lisbon which brought us a consensus on the EU Treaty will inspire the European Union in the year to come towards a successful ratification process."
"We need it for a strong European Union that delivers results for its citizens."
"Many thanks, Commission President."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Mr President, President-in-office of the Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, it is primarily my own satisfaction and that of my group that I would like to express."
"Satisfaction at the result obtained last Thursday in Lisbon, and satisfaction at the road Angela Merkel set out on and Mr Sócrates continues to travel."
"By equipping itself with the institutional tools it needs to function, Europe is finally acquiring the means to meet the major challenges of the 21st century."
"That was our wish."
"For this reason, we have supported this text since the start of its preparation, though as you know, most of us would have preferred a still more ambitious text."
"This Treaty is arousing criticism here and there."
"Personally I welcome the agreement reached in Lisbon, as it signals the start of a new European dynamic."
"Simplified Treaty, Reform or Reforming Treaty, Modified or Modifying Treaty, the name matters little."
"What matters is not the box itself but what is in the box."
"This Treaty will be officially signed in Lisbon on 13 December. That is an excellent date."
"The number 13 has always brought me luck. Look at my date of birth;"
"I was born on the 13th, so it is excellent."
"It will then have to be ratified by all the Member States before the 2009 European elections."
"Some have already made it known that the process will begin the day after the signature in Lisbon, and I am delighted about this."
"To the heads of state or government of the European Union I would just like to say that it is important for this Treaty to be the basis of a European project founded on the true membership of its citizens."
"The EU institutions and Member States must try to achieve this by explaining, then by explaining and finally by explaining some more."
"What does this mean?"
"It means giving substance to the provisions of the Treaty that affect the democratic life of the Union."
"The citizens' initiative and the involvement of the national parliaments mean that information will have to be provided about the content of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which enshrines the essential rights of European citizens."
"However, it also means providing better information to our citizens about who the elected representatives in this Parliament are - there will be 751 of them in 2009 - and what they do. It means explaining how qualified majority voting, which will become the rule, will enable Europe to act in new areas such as judicial and police cooperation, environmental protection, economic policy and immigration."
"It also means explaining to our partners on the international stage that a High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, who will also be Vice-President of the European Commission from 1 January 2009, will be the primary contact, along with the President of the Council, who will be elected for two and a half years and will facilitate cohesion and consensus within the European Union so it can finally speak with one voice."
"If the Treaty of Lisbon promises that the European Union will be more democratic, more transparent, more effective and more capable of acting as a single political entity on the international stage, it is to its citizens that this needs to be explained first of all."
"Thanks to this Treaty, Europe will finally be able to move from discussion to action."
"It will be able to begin far-reaching and necessary reforms to effectively combat crime and terrorist threats."
"It will also be able to affirm its role as a world leader in the fight against climate change."
"Ladies and gentlemen, when dealing with our international partners on such important challenges, we cannot allow ourselves to get caught up in unproductive divisions any longer."
"The journey that began in Berlin, that has stopped over in Lisbon and will pass through Ljubljana and Paris, is heading in the right direction because it is finally laying foundations for consistent European policies; policies that should aim primarily for the protection, well-being and prosperity of citizens who are demanding even more of Europe, as our Polish friends who turned out en masse to vote have shown us."
"For them and for all the others, let us live up to expectations."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by thanking Mr Sócrates and Mr Amado."
"They have had a difficult task, a very difficult task."
"On behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, I would say to them that they have completed this task most excellently."
"Congratulations, Prime Minister!"
"(Applause)"
"Europe is facing major challenges - not only from now on, but for many years already."
"For years now we have constantly been debating the same problems."
"The gap between rich and poor is getting bigger and bigger - within the European Union and throughout the world, between our continent and other continents."
"Social justice at home and social justice throughout the world is one of the major challenges for the EU."
"The states that belong to the United Nations and are island states have been crying out for help in the United Nations for years."
"Several of these states know that if climate change continues as it is and sea levels rise, they will be no more within the foreseeable future."
"There is nothing theoretical about climate change, but there is something practical that demands immediate action by the European Union."
"We are facing challenges."
"You have rightly embraced one of these challenges in your Presidency: the challenge on the African continent."
"As super-rich Europeans, we cannot look on as this continent dies, either from civil wars or from Aids."
"The Portuguese Presidency was therefore well advised to focus on Africa."
"We - as Europeans, as states and as Parliament - are being asked to face up to this issue and have been asked to do so, ladies and gentlemen, not just for a few years now, but for a very long time."
"Since 2001, however, the European Union has primarily concerned itself not with these challenges, but with constitutional issues."
"This has taken far too long!"
"It is good that this is now over, that the constitutional framework is finally in place so that we can now take on the political challenges on this basis."
"The great success of the past weekend is that we are now finally able to concentrate on what needs to be done politically and on what the people expect from us."
"Therefore, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there were some encouraging signs last weekend."
"The summit with the social partners is a step in the right direction."
"Capital and labour must be able to speak to one another again on an equal footing."
"For us Socialists, this is one element of this new draft Constitution - it should not be called this, and I must say that it has lagged far behind the Constitution - that social justice is practised here in Europe through greater co-determination on the part of the European Parliament."
"Nothing can be done in terms of a qualified majority without us Socialists, without the Left in Europe."
"I would therefore say that this Treaty will help Europe's legislation to become more social, based on the aims you have agreed with the social partners at this summit."
"With future majority decisions, this finally gives us the opportunity - in agricultural policy as well, by the way - to tackle the reforms that we have long been reminding everyone about."
"These reforms are also necessary because anyone who wants to appear credible at the world trade round - at the Doha Round - and in Bali will at some point have to say: yes, we need a reform of EU policy on subsidies."
"This, too, is becoming possible with this Treaty."
"There are challenges that we must face."
"The President of the United States is talking about a Third World War and we are talking about whether the President of the European Parliament does or does not have voting rights!"
"This is the kind of disproportionality that needs to be brought to an end in Europe."
"The draft Treaty will also be able to stop this."
"I believe we have taken a great step forward with this Treaty."
"Europe is becoming more democratic, Europe is becoming more transparent and the institutions are becoming more effective."
"We in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament have to concede that we have not achieved everything we would have liked, and to those who are now screaming again that this is now in fact the Constitution - I read in some British newspapers that a few of our fellow Members are asserting that this is essentially the Constitution - I must unfortunately say that they have neither read the Constitution, nor have they read this Treaty."
"This Treaty lags far behind the Constitution."
"However, it is clearly more than Nice!"
"Therefore, progress is not always made in the direction we would like."
"Sometimes it takes more time."
"One thing can be said, however: what is now on the table is better suited in terms of democratic policy, social policy and in terms of the institutions to giving us the capability and making us fit to effectively tackle the worldwide social challenges that are facing us."
"The Socialist Group in the European Parliament is able to approve this Treaty, as are all my group's delegations, and this was the result of our debate yesterday."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, it is fitting that the Reform Treaty should be signed in the city which Caesar once named 'Felicitas Julia', because it has overcome years of attack, siege, even last-minute subterfuge, to emerge bloodied and bruised, yet more or less intact, as the blueprint for a more democratic and transparent European Union."
"So Felicitas, Jose."
"May your name, like Caesar's, forever be associated with the historic changes you wrought in Lisbon - changes like normalising codecision, ending the tyranny of Council vetoes, placing energy, and justice and home affairs, under democratic scrutiny: these changes give our Union the capacity to confront the challenges of globalisation."
"(Laughter)"
"It is a pity that the Treaty is not simpler to digest, but - after being butchered by the ballpoint pens of civil servants from 27 Member States - what would you expect?"
"Your famous poet Fernando Pessoa once wrote: 'No intelligent idea can gain general acceptance unless some stupidity is mixed in with it'."
"Well, in this case, the culprit was national interest, which watered down, or rendered indecipherable, policies and practices that are in all of our interests."
"Some of the national horse trading you engaged in made it look like comedy descending into farce: deciding that Austrian universities can break the law for another five years while the policemen look the other way, or creating two classes of European citizen: those with fundamental rights and those without."
"Or suggesting that the President of the European Parliament should forsake his right to vote; or, indeed, that Council has the right to determine Parliament's Rules of Procedure."
"But the real tragedy is this: we saw not a single national leader return home flying the flag for Europe."
"Instead, they crowed about the opt-outs and the derogations and the exclusions which disfigure the text before us today."
"How do you guys expect to convince the people if you sound so unconvinced yourselves?"
"If the poverty of aspiration implicit in a minimalist treaty is reflected in your poverty of enthusiasm?"
"Look, it is your right to act as you choose, but it is also your responsibility."
"The only thing this Parliament need regret amongst the many successes is the process."
"The codes of transparency and democracy which drove the Constitutional Convention were a good deal preferable to secretive summits, and backroom deals in the wee small hours of Thursday morning."
"Issues of such importance should not be decided in such a kamikaze manner."
"(Applause)"
"Nonetheless, again: congratulations."
"I propose a toast, with my glass half full: two cheers for the Lisbon Treaty."
"Let us hope its advances move us forward faster, and convert cynicism into renewed belief."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (GA) Mr President, the Union's leaders are to be congratulated for reaching agreement on the new EU Treaty."
"Decisions will be easier to take within the EU institutions at EU level."
"That is exactly what the new Treaty will do."
"The EU works well when Parliament, the Commission, and the Council are all pulling together in the new spirit."
"Mr President, whilst others may say what happened at the Lisbon Summit was shocking, I am of the firm belief that the elected representatives that are the governments of the peoples of the Member States of the European Union are entitled to defend what they see as the rights of their people within that Union."
"I think that when we look at the overall example that has been given with this Lisbon Summit, we can see positives from it: we can see movement forward being made and, most importantly of all, an opportunity for a new zone and a new area of the development of the European Union to come into play, in particular with those areas where codecision now reigns on issues of environment, globalisation, research, education and the necessity of the response of the European Institutions to an ever-increasing speed of change within the world."
"But there are also difficulties - and some colleagues have referred to them - in the area of justice and home affairs, for instance, where Ireland had to look for a specific opt-in and opt-out with regard to certain areas."
"That does not mean that we are against more cooperation and coordination."
"In fact, our role within Europol and within Eurojust in dealing with drug trafficking and tackling cross-border crime has been ahead of most."
"We are working with eight other countries in the Maritime Organisation Analysis Centre to combat cocaine trafficking."
"But I think the one and most important issue, when we speak about democracy and ratifying this Treaty, is that the ratification process is another step towards informing the people and public of Europe of what we can do."
"Unfortunately, in only one country - my own country, Ireland - will there be a referendum."
"I would appeal to colleagues when we speak about the future development of Europe not to make the same mistake that President Prodi made when he was President of Commission by saying that this is only the first step towards a further treaty and further treaties which will bring about change, because the people who vote in the referendum ask the question: what is the point in voting on this treaty if we have to vote again on another one at some future date?"
"Allow us, where we have to connect democratically with the people, to tell them exactly what is in this Treaty and, most importantly of all, let this be a welcome to small and medium-sized countries of what can be achieved by defending their interests and rights."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has always been a staunch supporter of the compelling need for a European Constitution, of a brief, strong text, an expression of European democracy and of the cohesion of its peoples."
"We supported the Constitutional Treaty - albeit with its enormous defects - and today we hope that this confused thing, we cannot call it a simplified treaty because frankly that is a joke, which today you have presented to us, is ratified so that we can proceed, Mr Crowley, to the next stage."
"We will not join in the glorification of this result, which contains only backward steps compared with the Constitutional Treaty."
"Fortunately, Prime Minister Sócrates, the IGC was short."
"I do not know, had it been longer, what other masterpieces of clarity the Council and its legal and diplomatic service would have given us."
"Therefore, mercifully it was short."
"What matters to us today is to denounce those responsible for this situation, which we consider highly unsatisfactory: first of all, the European Convention and its President, who systematically refused to include in time on the agenda the breakdown of the dogma of the veto on amendments to the Treaty and today is paying the price with the systematic dismantling of his work and oblivion."
"No one, including Prime Minister Sócrates, has recalled the work of the Convention, here; the pro-European advocates of not having referendums, who find themselves today empty-handed, with less democracy, more nationalism and more confusion."
"The British Government and the British media system, which with all of its airs of pragmatism and reliability, in reality have shamefully given in to the howls of Murdoch's tabloids and - after helping to make the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the Constitutional Treaty much, much worse than what it could have been - have managed today to persuade public opinion that to have fewer rights, less protection, less transparency and less democracy is a great victory."
"This Parliament and the Commission, which have decided to remain silent for two years pending a miraculous initiative from Mrs Merkel, the European Council and the governments who have decided to snatch away the process of reform of the treaties from public opinion and national parliaments and to play the card of entanglement and confusion to save what could be saved."
"President, ratifications have now started, a process during which the Greens will not lie to public opinion."
"This text contains positive elements, but it is full of traps and spanners in the works."
"We will work so that the ratification and application of the new Treaty do not leave aside the fact that the path towards a truly free, open and democratic Europe is not over and that this is only a small stage, and is not even that glorious."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FR) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, General de Gaulle said of Valéry Giscard d'Estaing: 'His problem is the people'."
"This statement would apply rather well to the European Council today."
"Once again, at the summit, the 27 Member States showed themselves to be very adept at horse-trading."
"The Prévert-style inventory of concessions granted to all the recalcitrant Member States deserves a mention."
"This is the cost of getting everyone to agree, from the descendents of the EU's founding fathers to the most inveterate Euro sceptics."
"In the end, only two or three things seem untouchable, and in the European Council nobody has thought of touching them."
"For example, the restrictive framework that the European Union's economic and social policies must fit into: an open market economy with free competition, the issue of credit by the European Central Bank, the orientations of the Stability Pact, strict respect for freedom of movement of capital, the gradual removal of everything investors consider a barrier to trade, and the concentration of key powers in the institutions, which are inaccessible to citizens, national parliaments and even governments themselves, particularly in smaller countries, and indeed the dimensions assumed by military aspects in the European Union's foreign policy."
"These are 'red lines', as they say in English, which must not be crossed according to the EU's ruling circles."
"The problem is that it is precisely at these issues that most of the questions and criticisms from our people are directed, and it is the persistent absence of answers to these questions, the repeated refusal to hear these criticisms, that is fuelling the crisis of confidence that the European Union is suffering from among our fellow citizens."
"Furthermore, if the members of the European Council had opened the windows of their meeting room on 18 October, they would have been able to measure the strength of this disaffection in person, as expressed on the streets of Lisbon by the largest demonstration seen in Portugal in the last 20 years, and I think that neither Mr Sócrates nor Mr Barroso will contradict me on this point."
"The ultimate challenge for the European Union - we read in the Commission Communication at the Lisbon summit - is to explain to citizens what the European Union represents for Europeans."
"Always explaining, never taking account."
"Always communicating, never having open debates and therefore, with greater reason, not having referendums."
"Yes, the European Council's problem is the people, but without the people there would be no future for a great European ambition."
"Surely this question really deserves to be discussed openly one day?"
"That is what I am asking you."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, this is not the first time that I have heard the President of the Commission and Heads of State come to this Chamber after a summit in the ancient city of Lisbon, proclaiming the whole thing to be a fantastic success and an example of how successful the European Union is."
"Yes, you remember, Mr Barroso, don't you?"
"The Lisbon Agenda."
"Here I was, seven years ago, being told that, because of that weekend meeting in Lisbon, we were about to become the most high-technology economy in the world with full employment and high growth rates."
"Well, as we know, we are 75% of the way through and the thing has crashed in ruins."
"I would not, if I were you, be too complacent about the summit you had in Lisbon last week either because, for once, the national parliaments will have their say."
"This, of course, is unusual because, generally, national parliaments do not have much to do any more, as the EU Institutions have usurped them."
"However, the national parliaments will have their say and there is a real chance that we will get more referendums than just in Ireland."
"Of course that is the one thing that you people do not want, isn't it?"
"You loathe democracy so much now that you actually call it populism."
"You treated the French and Dutch referendums with contempt and you refused to take no for an answer."
"You are the Euronationalists, dangerous people who will stop at nothing."
"What that summit in Lisbon represented was a giant deceit and an attempt to impose upon the peoples of Europe a constitution just by dropping that word and repackaging it, when it actually has all the same proposals."
"It is absolutely disgraceful that you are doing this, but I have hope and faith that in Westminster, the Mother of Parliaments for once will do her job and the British people will get a referendum."
"We have heard enough from the political classes of Europe."
"It is time that in Britain and in many other countries of Europe we heard what the people have to say."
"You cannot push on with this project without the support of the people."
"Let the people speak."
"on behalf of the ITS Group. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, two and a half years after the French and the Dutch rejected the European Constitution, in Lisbon on 19 October the European Council adopted the simplified Reform Treaty, which is a very bad name for it since it has been made more complex and only marginally 'reforms' the rejected Constitution."
"In short, they are trying to pull the wool over our eyes and convince us that this text has nothing in common with the previous one, to avoid facing up to the people of Europe with a referendum."
"You seem to be saying that this is too serious a matter to be entrusted to the people."
"Well, we think the exact opposite."
"Insofar as this is a cut-and-paste of the European Constitution, it deserves to be put to a referendum on ratification in each country, starting with France and the Netherlands."
"Only a referendum can cancel what another referendum has decided."
"Today, without trying to be party political, I am launching a big petition in my own country to try to make the French President who initiated the European mini-treaty do a U-turn and offer a referendum."
"This is about the future of our respective nations, their sovereignty, independence, identity and freedom."
"We cannot, for example, give responsibility for representing us abroad to a High Representative, any more than we can watch our seat on the United Nations Security Council being challenged in the name of the legal personality of the European Union."
"Or allow our judicial and legislative corpus to be dismantled by judges in Luxembourg."
"The parties to such a denial of democracy would carry a heavy burden of responsibility before history."
"(SK) At the Meeting of the Heads of State and Government last week, a Treaty was agreed that should adapt the European institutions to a new situation and improve the existing Treaties."
"Since the present structure of the European Union is vastly different from what it was in 1957, we have to adopt a new European document; we need clear new rules."
"I fully support this process."
"In order to be trustworthy, the European Union must guarantee human rights and fundamental liberties to its citizens."
"These values are mentioned several times in the preamble and in the articles of the Treaty, and the Union is founded precisely on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy and equality."
"I regret very much that although in Article 3 of the new Treaty we profess to act strictly in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter protecting human rights, in the same breath we refuse to include the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union in the Treaty."
"I am generalising on purpose because I do not wish to point the finger at individual Member States that refuse to express their opinion on this important issue."
"The Charter of Fundamental Rights is absent from the Treaty and I regret this."
"Does the Charter not endorse human rights, enshrined in constitutional traditions and common to all Member States?"
"I believe that the Members of this Parliament currently play a very important role in the process of reforming the Treaty; they defend the opinions of the people of Europe and they should act as a catalyst for consensus in areas such as human rights."
"Congratulations to you, Mr Socrates and Mr Barroso."
"European Parliament representative at the Intergovernmental Conference. - (DE) Mr President, President-in-Office, Commission President, ladies and gentlemen, the German Presidency has succeeded in drawing up a mandate and the Portuguese Presidency in achieving acceptance of it and implementing it."
"For this you have my thanks."
"Because of the discussions of recent days about a number of minor matters it has been forgotten that this Treaty is a breakthrough in democracy and the capacity to act, because the European Parliament now has 95% of legislation in a codecision procedure, because the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure has been removed and full rights are available in the budget sector and in the agricultural sector, the European Parliament has something to say on third country treaties and on ratifications, the European Parliament elects the Commission President and without the European Parliament, the Commission and the High Representatives do not take up office."
"It is the case that democracy and the capacity to act have been created with the removal of the third pillar and that with the new decision-making methods in the Council for the expansion of codecision, the capacity to act has been improved."
"Codecision and qualified majority decision-making are now the rule in legal terms."
"This is a reversal of matters, which is of great significance."
"The Charter of Fundamental Rights and legal personality are there and furthermore the United Kingdom's red lines have been preserved in their entirety because in these areas there are opt-outs in legal and internal policy."
"We still have to clarify certain matters: the issues associated with Article 24."
"We must fight to ensure that the transition from one Treaty to the next is not misused by the Council with regard to the allocation of posts, such as those of the High Representatives, for instance."
"We are merely able to state that there are 751 Members of the European Parliament and I see no post where there is a difference in voting rights within this text."
"Furthermore, I must state that we really do have to ensure now that this text is implemented, that we translate the Constitution into reality in the way we understand this Treaty."
"Mr President, allow me to make one comment. In 1994 I was appointed for the first time on behalf of this House - for which I should like say thank you - to the Westendorp Group."
"This was my fourth intergovernmental conference."
"When we started, we had nothing to say as Parliament."
"I should like at this point to thank Mrs Guigou, Mr Tsatsos, Mr Hänsch and Mr Méndez De Vigo, as well as my two fellow Members from the Intergovernmental Conference, for their great cooperation over these last 13 years."
"Recognition, too, for this continuity in the work to extend Parliament's competence."
"European Parliament representative at the Intergovernmental Conference. - (PT) Congratulations; the President has lived up to his surname, working with passion and reason for the success of the summit."
"Enrique Barón Crespo, European Parliament representative at the Intergovernmental Conference - (ES) President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I can testify as someone who was present at the end of the Intergovernmental Conference - I think that it is the first time that the President and the three representatives have been admitted to the Conference - and I can say that the Portuguese Presidency has listened to the European Parliament: firstly by restoring citizenship, something that appeared to be impossible until mid-September, and secondly, by giving proper treatment to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which also seemed impossible, and also by recognising the substantial extension of majority voting."
"It is not only the European Parliament that has gained things, it is Europe, and we have helped."
"The President-in-office started his speech by talking about Ioannina."
"I challenge him that we should explain to the people of Europe what the Protocol is on the Ioannina Declaration, and what has surprised me most is that governments have not fought very hard in the Council to stop the introduction of the Luxembourg Compromise into the Treaty, which would mean destroying it."
"More or less the same applies - and I am addressing the President of the Commission - to the subject of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy."
"You are going to have to work very hard on that, because Parliament is going to defend its rights in order to ensure that there is an intelligent solution when the Treaty enters into force, which I hope will be the case, given that there will be a series of very interesting posts to allocate and, of course, we want to monitor this process democratically."
"To conclude, Mr President, Prime Minister Sócrates said that the Treaty of Lisbon has been born."
"It is still a very small child, and I hope that in December everyone signs that they want it to grow, and, above all, that everyone acts with mutual loyalty and solidarity so that this Lisbon Treaty becomes a reality."
"Many thanks, Mr Barón Crespo, for recognising this task as well as the many other tasks beforehand."
"European Parliament representative at the Intergovernmental Conference. - Mr President, for 26 countries, the Treaty is certainly a great step forward towards European unity and certainly rivals the Treaty of Maastricht in importance."
"Of course, the Treaty lacks the simplicity of its late, lamented predecessor, but it preserves all the principal reforms."
"Abroad and inside the Union, people will soon see a more effective, efficient and democratic Union."
"But in one country this is not so."
"The British still seem intimidated by the success of the EU and have sought, at the IGC, to reduce the scope and force of common policies in the area of fundamental rights, freedom, security and justice, and in the common foreign security and defence policies."
"Why such a strategy of non-cooperation is thought to serve the interests of the British people is not clear."
"Nor do Mr Farage or the Conservative Party provide a preferable or alternative solution."
"It is my desire and trust that this strange, idiosyncratic British policy will prove to be as short-lived as possible."
"Thank you very much, Mr Duff, for your great engagement in your responsibilities."
"(PT) President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the best way of celebrating the important result achieved last weekend, thanks to the mandate negotiated during the German Presidency and the effective commitment of the Portuguese Presidency, that I would especially like to commend, is to make effective use of the new institutional instruments and achieve better results."
"Recently, European citizens have repeatedly been told, quite rightly, that we needed a new institutional framework to adapt the Europe of Nice to the Europe of enlargement."
"It is now time to prove that this reorganised Europe is capable of fulfilling its new mission."
"Fifty years after the signing of the Treaty of Rome the threat hanging over Europe is no longer that of war or perpetual walls of woe."
"The new challenge is to face the global world in which there are ever more people consuming and producing, where borders are disappearing and no European country is really a world player."
"We have to face the fears of globalisation and the technology revolution and prove that Europe, strengthened by the new Treaty, is capable of discovering new paths and creating new wealth."
"Yet this is also an opportunity to devise new solutions to the new problems."
"With six, twelve or even fifteen members it was easier to promote closer ties between citizens and the Community structures, but today it is the toughest of challenges."
"As the EU enlarges, the centre of power is also becoming more distant from the citizen."
"This adverse effect can be seen, inter alia, in the end of the rotating presidencies of the Council or the abandonment of the principle of one Commissioner per Member State."
"We have to counter this adverse effect and Parliament has a decisive role in this task, to attain more transparency and less bureaucracy, more development and less unnecessary legislation, more cooperation with national parliaments and less distance from citizens, more cohesion and less inequality."
"Freed from the doubts about our internal organisation, let us be a symbol of courage and let us take up the challenges of modern times."
"Today we should celebrate our capacity to unite."
"(PT) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, satisfaction, happiness, success, victory, are words that have been used here today, and rightly so, about the informal Council in Lisbon."
"Indeed, the agreement on the new Treaty was announced before midnight on 18 October."
"It was a historic moment."
"Firstly because of the results achieved, but also because it was done so quickly."
"After a little more than 12 months of intense work and negotiation it was possible to achieve the required consensus on the first day of the Summit."
"What is more, on the same day an agreement was signed with the European Union's social partners, employers and trade unions, to modernise the labour market, an important step for the new cycle of the Lisbon Strategy."
"The Portuguese Presidency is to be congratulated."
"It achieved its top priority with acknowledged skill: to give Europe a new Treaty, which was a great victory."
"Europe has emerged from a six-year impasse and can now concentrate on what is really important to citizens because, as Jean Monnet said, we cannot stop when the whole world around us is on the move, and the speed at which the world turns makes no allowance for a slow European response."
"The Treaty will be signed on 13 December, and the ratification process will follow, which should be swift and problem-free."
"As a Portuguese national I want to say how pleased I am because, once again, the name of Lisbon is indelibly linked to a decisive moment in European integration."
"Thank you Prime Minister Sócrates."
"You deserve thanks from Portugal and also from Europe for your determination and commitment. Europe is out of the impasse."
"Thank you very much, Prime Minister."
"(DA) Mr President, fortunately the Lisbon Summit ended well."
"Some excellent preparatory work was carried out by the German Presidency, and the Portuguese Presidency completed it in a professional manner."
"Unfortunately, I must point out that national interests have again played a role."
"This is definitely not appropriate for European cooperation."
"We must now have special powers to discuss the content instead of the process. However, we have unfortunately seen depressing tendencies that suggest that we would rather discuss the process rather than the content."
"However, if we are ultimately to discuss the process then I would like to state clearly that we do not need referendums to ratify the Treaty."
"Referendums are simply not the solution."
"Let the representative democracy do its work!"
"It is not because I am afraid of a no vote - far from it!"
"Rather it is because it is completely wrong to separate EU issues from national parliamentary elections."
"The EU is and will remain a completely integral part of national policy."
"Referendums are used to fire shots at a government in office."
"They enable the other political parties to avoid being assessed on their EU policies. However, all political parties will of course be assessed on their EU policies, and this will happen when we go to the polls in the national elections."
"However, it imposes two requirements: a requirement that we, the electorate, allow EU policy to be decisive in our choice of national politicians, and a requirement that the political parties must of course not use referendums to avoid responsibility for the European Community."
"Therefore, efforts to ensure that it is the content and not the process that is given the highest priority will hopefully be successful."
"(PL) President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, I am very pleased that the Treaty reform process is coming to a close."
"This is not so that the proposed changes to my convictions as regards integration can be put into full effect - at times they are very remote from that."
"The reason I am pleased is rather that lately we have been devoting too much time and political energy to institutions."
"I am convinced that the EU's success is not the result of the institutional set-up or the mechanics of power."
"This success is the result of political will and a common vision of the future."
"I hope that once ratification is concluded there will be nothing to stop us from engaging in a Europe of results, from taking more responsibility for global security, from having a more active impact on neighbouring countries, and finally from discussing EU enlargement, from winning in terms of competition, investments and growth."
"Despite what has been being said over the past seven years, institutional changes are neither a complete nor a satisfactory response to these problems."
"(DE) Mr President, from Europe's many upheavals, peasants wars and revolutions, we are all familiar with the romantic story of the fugitive being hidden in a cart-load of dung to be taken over the border and escape Richelieu's bloodhounds and the king's guards."
"If, at the end, he is successful, he does not look very nice, nor does he smell very nice, but once he has washed, then it can be said: he is alive!"
"The Constitution has fared similarly."
"Governments have buried it in a tangled mass of illegible, indecipherable texts of opt-outs, clauses, footnotes, resolutions, Minutes, and they have taken the Constitution beyond the limits under cover of this dunghill."
"The tragedy of it is simply that they sought shelter in this constitutional treasure not from the king's guards, but from the watchful eyes of citizens."
"I have been digging in this tangled mass of texts. Yes, I have actually found all the main achievements of the Constitution on which I myself have been working for more than 10 years and I could well be fortunate."
"This situation nevertheless makes me very apprehensive."
"In addition, of course, as is simply the case with such adventures, whenever anyone helped the fugitive, they ripped off part of the treasure."
"I have therefore also found the hands of a few governments in this dung hill."
"One has secured another opt-out for itself and therefore filched a part of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, a part of Parliament's rights, a part of data protection, etc. The treasure arrives damaged, but generally speaking it does arrive."
"We have gained a piece of Europe, we have saved a piece of Europe's future, not with our citizens, but without our citizens, not with the parliaments, but without the parliaments, and this is a great danger."
"We have gained a piece of Europe, but we have not resolved the crisis of confidence among Europe's citizens."
"There is therefore an enormous challenge ahead of this House: to regain the confidence of Europe's citizens."
"(PT) Mr President, we regret that the Lisbon Summit took over the essence of the content of the so-called European Constitution, previously rejected in the French and Dutch referendums, simultaneously attempting to dodge the necessary democratic debate and public consultation by means of referendums."
"Apart from being a deep insult to democracy and the sovereign will expressed, this demonstrates your fear of citizens' votes on a Treaty that represents a qualitative leap in the advance of neoliberalism, federalism and militarism, increasingly eroding the economic and social achievements of workers and the poor."
"However, the struggle will continue, as more than 200 000 people made clear at the impressive demonstration in Lisbon promoted by the CGPT also on 18 October. It was the largest in the past 20 years, and the Presidents of the Council and the Commission, both Portuguese, are symbolically it ignoring here."
"That also goes on record in the history of this Treaty."
"(CS) Mr President, after the failure of the Constitution it seemed that the principle of democratic decision-making had once again gained the upper hand within the EU, at least for a while."
"We were wrong to think that."
"Very quickly the same Constitution has returned to the table under a different title."
"Its authors do not even bother concealing the fact that it is the original Constitution in a slightly modified form with the intention of ignoring the people's democratic will in a referendum."
"The Treaty, which reinforces the role of non-elected officials of the EU, thereby reinforcing the democracy deficit, is creating, among other things, 105 legislative and non-legislative competences of the EU."
"In 68 cases it replaces the right of national veto with majority decision-making."
"It subverts the national competences in the area of foreign policy."
"It hands decision-making in the EU to the big Member States, notably Germany, at the expense of the small countries."
"A simple comparison shows that it is almost exactly identical to the Constitution for a European federal state rejected by the French people and buried by the Dutch."
"The impertinence with which it has been returned on the table with the straight face of a poker player and now under a new Orwellian title is astounding."
"A new type of utopian nationalism won in Lisbon: pan-European and EU nationalism; nationalism without any real national, cultural and historic foundations, rooted only in the long office corridors in Brussels."
"Berlaymont patriotism has claimed victory."
"Those of us who represent countries that lived for nearly half a century under the communist totalitarian regime are not easily surprised by anything."
"We have been accustomed to the insolence of power and contempt for the people's will."
"Not even in the CMEA, however, have we experienced such overt deception as today's deception by the EU of the people of the Member States."
"At least in the CMEA similar attempts were hidden behind the party politburos; but that is a thing of the past."
"The citizens want to decide themselves whether they will hand over their sovereign rights to a European super-state without a democratic or historical framework."
"That is why I want to see a referendum."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, under the Reform Treaty, which I reject, there are winners and losers."
"The reservations of Poland and Italy regarding the new distribution of seats in Parliament were resolved, except that Poland is winning other more important battles: it obtained the opt-out from the Charter of Fundamental Rights, it will have an Advocate-General at the Court of Justice and it benefits under the Ioannina mechanism."
"Even Austria won a victory by being allowed to restrict access by foreign students to the country's universities."
"Romano Prodi, before entering the meeting, announced that he would fight not to lose Italy's parity."
"He ended up losing parity with France but restoring parity with the UK, boasting of the promise secured to reconsider the distribution of seats based on citizenship after 2014."
"However, we had already obtained this at the last plenary in Brussels."
"What was accepted by the indolent Prodi administration were just a few crumbs from the table, as a result of which around three million Europeans with Italian citizenship are considered to be less European than the Pakistanis, Indians and Kenyans who have the good fortune to work and live in the UK, or the Cameroonians in France, who, although non-Community nationals, are counted for the distribution of seats."
"We could not have expected anything better from the Italian Government, supported by a boorishly Communist left and by a deceitful and hypocritical centre-left."
"As you can see, we have other reasons for not considering the Europe of these treaties as ours and for hoping that we will soon be celebrating the De profundis of the ridiculous Prodi Government."
"(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, after a detailed reading of the Lisbon Treaty it is clear that the heads of state are presenting fundamental changes to the EU documents."
"The Reform Treaty literally re-writes the EU Treaties and the founding Treaties of the European Communities."
"I would like to highlight the fact that the changes do not just concern the influence of individual states on EU processes, but also the fundamental principles themselves, on which the EU was established 50 years ago."
"The Reform Treaty transfers the principle of free competition from the main body of the Treaty to the protocols that are to be annexed to the Treaty."
"I consider that a red flag for all democratically-minded citizens."
"Ladies and gentlemen, if the EU project is to be credible, the Reform Treaty has to be put to a referendum in the Member States."
"Politicians should set aside their arrogance and comfortable situation."
"They have to explain the decision taken in Lisbon to the citizens and win them over to it."
"Otherwise the gap between the citizens and the political elite will continue to grow."
"Not only this will jeopardise prosperity; it will also deepen the democratic deficit of the EU as a whole."
"Mr President, I am grateful to the Prime Minister for his statement this morning and, whilst I note the decisions of the Heads of Government, the British people and the British Conservative Party have been consistent in their concerns about the Constitution and the very similar Reform Treaty."
"The British Prime Minister has said that the Reform Treaty is not the Constitution."
"His fellow leaders have disagreed."
"He told us that Britain's so-called 'red lines' have been secured."
"Like most British people I really do not understand or believe our Prime Minister on this matter."
"The issue is one of trust."
"Our Prime Minister gave a commitment to hold a referendum - a commitment in an election manifesto two years ago."
"A referendum on this Treaty is, therefore, not only politically necessary but also a moral imperative."
"The Irish Prime Minister said at the weekend about possible referenda: 'Why not let your people have a say?"
"I think it's a bit upsetting to see so many countries running away from giving their people an opportunity'."
"A few days ago, Gordon Brown said that this Treaty will mark the end of EU institutional reform for the next decade."
"However, over the past 15 years we have had four treaties dealing with reform, and I doubt whether the urge to have further institutional change can be resisted."
"The so-called 'ratchet clause', for example, would allow further national vetoes to be abolished."
"On the other hand, the Conservative vision for Europe focuses on the three key areas of global competitiveness, global climate change and global poverty."
"I congratulate President Barroso in particular for his determination, in any event, to pursue those aims."
"However, they can be tackled with political will and do not require this Treaty."
"We should remind ourselves of what the Laeken Declaration said."
"It said the Union needs to become more democratic, more transparent and more efficient, but it called also for us to engage the citizens more and not just to communicate our decisions to them."
"The question today is: does the Treaty respond to Laeken?"
"Laeken asked the right questions."
"Have we given the right answers?"
"Mr President, I would like to say to the President-in-Office of the Council: what a wonderful summit."
"I never doubted that you would make it, but it is one thing not to doubt and another to do it, and you did it."
"Congratulations."
"I do not know if colleagues know: it is a bit of a landmark in history."
"On the first day, we got a new Treaty of the real world."
"I know that all the maximalists here do not think it is the most beautiful treaty they have got, but the real world is not the most beautiful world you can get."
"So what you need is an effective treaty, a treaty of clear values - and you have got it."
"On the second day, friends, we got a direction - on the first day a treaty, on the second day a direction - which deals with what people would like us to do: the real world."
"What you said on the second day was that we want a Europe leading globalisation to be more human, to be more inclusive and to base it on our social coherent values."
"What you said was that the Lisbon process is not only a process for a few, but the guideline for the external direction of the European Union, which says that it is not only about being the world's strongest economic power, it is also by understanding that the world will only be more cohesive by basing it on a social market economy."
"That is what I want to underline to you today."
"I want to thank the Presidency, not only for the first day but also for the second day, because the conclusion of the second day was that this European Union is not about market societies."
"It is about social market economies, which means that we are frontrunners in uniting social issues with economic competitiveness."
"Well done, President-in-Office - and friend, if I can say that - because that leads me to my third and last message."
"Let us give the Portuguese Presidency its last summit in December: not only where a Portuguese Presidency will formally sign the Treaty, but also where we confirm the Lisbon Process in a well-done way."
"So let us go."
"Let us move."
"That is what people expect of us."
"- (FR) Mr President, the European Union is going to have a new Treaty."
"Obviously there are some regrets that can be expressed: regrets about the abandonment in the text of the symbols of the European Union; regrets about the opt-outs won by some countries, particularly on the Charter; and finally regrets about the complexity of the Treaty, for which I am requesting a consolidated text so that Europe's citizens can try to find their way around it."
"That would be good."
"All the same, this Treaty will give us the means to revive Europe, provided that we want to do so."
"With this text, the European Union will gain the tools it needs to continue its integration, to expand and to deepen its common policies."
"On energy, climate change, immigration policy, the fight against terrorism, economic coordination, foreign and defence policy and development policy, Europe can now move forward."
"It will simply be a question of political will."
"Nobody will now be able to use the excuse that the institutional means of action are lacking."
"Now, everybody will have to face up to their responsibilities, and in saying that, besides our institutions, I am thinking in particular of the Member States."
"That is good news for Europe and I hope it will be good news for its citizens."
"(PL) Mr President, contrary to the gloom-laden forecasts and baseless criticism of Poland during recent debates in this House, especially by the leader of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Lisbon Summit turned out to be a diplomatic compromise."
"Both the EU and the Polish authorities perceived the potential to reach an agreement."
"The EU side showed an appreciation of Poland's importance and potential by increasing the number of Advocates General in the Court of Justice, and also by retaining the Ioannina clause."
"We must hope that the compromise reached at the summit is only an introduction to consultation with the peoples of Europe."
"The draft EU Reform Treaty is, in the end, too important a document to be smuggled through in the secrecy of political meeting rooms."
"Let us not forget that the previous version of this treaty died in two Member States' referendums."
"Failure to allow the public to have their say once more on the future of the EU would not only be a breach of one of the EU's fundamental values but would also provide clear evidence that those in government fear the voice of their own electorate."
"Let the dictators of democracy allow the public themselves to express their will as regards the future vision of the EU."
"Mr President, I represent Scotland."
"My party, the SNP, forms the new Government in Scotland, and I believe it will prove to be more constructive towards participation in the European Union than UK governments have been."
"I accept the need to reform the Treaties and to create more open, democratic, efficient and accountable governance."
"In principle, I support an extension of QMV and codecision with the European Parliament, but the very diversity which Mr Barroso quite rightly referred to will always mean that national interests will be promoted."
"We should not lose touch with our local communities by trampling over their interests, or appearing so to do."
"For Scotland, there is a very real fear that the entrenchment of the common fisheries policy, as an exclusive competence within the Treaties, can only obstruct the absolute root-and-branch reform of fisheries management that I believe to be necessary."
"Unfortunately, but not surprisingly, the UK Government did not raise this issue at the summit."
"Yet again, Scotland's key interests have been ignored by a UK Government."
"(NL) Mr President, the Constitution is dead."
"Long live the Constitution!"
"How else to describe the events in Lisbon?"
"We all agree that this Reform Treaty is a mere clone of the Constitution rejected by the French and Dutch; one that, as Valéry Giscard d'Estaing said, is even less readable than the original."
"After all, referendums are to be avoided at all costs, we are told."
"There is indeed one major difference from 2005."
"This time the French, Dutch and other European peoples are not being given the chance to express their opinions."
"An illustration of this disdain for democracy can be found in the statements of Commissioner Wallström, who always has so much to say about bridging the gap between Europe and the citizen."
"She is urging the national parliaments to ratify this text as quickly as possible."
"Yet genuine respect for democracy requires that the citizens of all EU Member States be able to express their opinions on the Treaty, a text which, in numerous respects, erodes the sovereignty of the nation-states even more than is already the case."
"Those responsible should not complain if this fear of citizens again goes against official Europe in the subsequent European elections."
"(DE) Mr President, gentlemen, you certainly do not have it easy at the moment!"
"In the countries in which referendums were promised, the Treaty is portrayed, as in the United Kingdom or in my home country, Austria, as just a minor detail, an extension of something."
"In other countries, like Germany, the talk is of a total reorganisation of the Community and of a historic breakthrough."
"Which is now true?"
"I think we should remind ourselves again on this occasion of the words and very clear sayings of the former President of West Germany, Roman Herzog, who was after all Chairman of the Convention responsible for drafting the Charter of Fundamental Rights and who said that democracy is being eroded by the EU Constitution."
"We now have it in a modified form in the Reform Treaty."
"If you do not want it to be eroded, if you do not want democracy to be choked, please have the political decency at least to allow referendums, as there have been in the past - for the last EU Constitutional Treaty - even in Spain and Luxembourg."
"(NL) Mr President, President of the Commission, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, looking at the changes the Reform Treaty makes in such fields as migration, agriculture, and police and justice, and at the decisions regarding the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the euro area and the social market economy - which becomes an objective for the first time - and also regarding intergovernmental solidarity on energy, it is apparent to me that this Treaty builds on the results of the Convention and the June Summit, and gives us more clout and a great deal more democracy as political institutions."
"From now on, the Union will be better equipped to provide the answers people expect of it, both internally and externally."
"In the latter respect, I should like to congratulate the Council Presidency on its setting of the agenda."
"President-in-Office, by letting your summit not only decide on the Treaty, but also exchange ideas about the problem of our generation - globalisation - you have sent out an important signal."
"When all is said and done, it is not the institutions - institutional navel-gazing - but their policies that are important."
"This brings me to a question to the President of the Commission."
"Do you think that genuinely bold policymaking is possible in the period from now until the final ratification of the Treaty, or does ratification make you fear that you cannot offend people and that you must confine yourselves to 'cautious' matters?"
"In other words, can the Europe of specific projects continue in 2008?"
"Finally, two more brief questions to the Council."
"President-in-Office, have you asked the Heads of State or Government for a personal political commitment to bringing ratification to a successful conclusion in their respective countries?"
"I very much hope so."
"Secondly, when will a coordinated text of these treaties appear?"
"After all, a treaty that includes the objectives of transparency and simplification must be readable, if only out of respect for the people."
"Thank you, Mr President, and thank you in anticipation to the President-in-Office and the Commission President for their answers to my questions."
"(DE) Mr President, we have the Lisbon Strategy and hopefully we are now to have the Lisbon Treaty too, and both will move Europe forward."
"This Parliament, particularly the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, has been fighting and working for a new European treaty for seven years."
"Admittedly we have not got the Constitution, but we do say that this Reform Treaty represents progress in every respect."
"There is no single item on which we have fallen behind compared with Nice."
"Everything is moving forward and bringing us further into the Union of 27."
"We also need to say this to the citizens outside."
"The winners in the new Treaty are the people of Europe."
"There are diverse forms of direct and indirect participation in European policy and we are in a position to solve the major problems referred to here faster and more effectively."
"The winners are also the citizens' chambers in Europe, the national parliaments and this European citizens' chamber, this Parliament."
"Democracy is not therefore being eroded - as has just been said, and which is complete nonsense - but it is the completion of European democracy, which we can actually achieve with this Treaty."
"This has now been the fourth agreement."
"I hope it will be the last time that the Member States have to get together for this."
"Every power must now be invested in ratification."
"I hope that no country says no."
"It is perhaps the last chance for this Treaty."
"Every no would lead to isolation, if not to that country's self-exclusion."
"We hope this will not be the case."
"Every power should flow into ratification so that we have this Treaty by 2009."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there used to be a very witty and cynical slogan written on a wall in the Milan metro that said, 'the future is not what it once was', a bit like the weather or food."
"We live in a time when the younger generations are no longer convinced that the future will be better, as their parents once thought."
"Indeed we often hear people saying that 'Europe is not what it once was'."
"A sovereignist, nationalist, anti-European way of thinking is emerging and developing on our continent. We have heard some examples of it in this Chamber this morning."
"I believe that the Lisbon result is important, although more for the speed with which it was decided, which sends out a positive signal to public opinion, rather than its content, since there are still too many opt-outs and clauses, and it is still too complicated."
"However, Parliament, the Commission and the Council now have another 18 months in which to restore public opinion following this crisis period."
"All of us, or at least the majority of us in this Chamber, believe that Europe is the solution to globalisation concerns, and not the cause, and that we are stronger if we tackle immigration, climate change, innovation and research together."
"This is what most MEPs in here think."
"We now have 18 months in which to convince the 500 million citizens who live in Europe of this before the European elections."
"- (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Lisbon Summit obtained a single result: distancing Europe's citizens from the European Union while making more room for lobbyists and technocratic powers."
"The vision that we are fighting for - that of a Europe of the peoples, of the regions - is further and further away."
"Even in our Parliament, where are the Corsicans, the people of the Valle d'Aosta, the Basques, where are the Breton separatists, the Alsatians?"
"On the distribution of seats, it is a disgrace that our country, represented by its indignant premier, Mr Prodi, should lose out to France."
"Yet this was not enough for the evanescent Mr Prodi, who seemed like Alice in Wonderland in Lisbon, totally lost and misinformed."
"Thanks to Mr Prodi, Italy was excluded from the declaration, from the joint declaration with which France, Germany and the UK quite rightly asked Europe to take steps to avoid a repetition of the financial turbulence resulting from the US sub-prime crisis."
"According to statements made to the press about the global financial crisis, Mr Prodi said that he could not see the point of Europe's position on lending."
"The former Goldman Sachs consultant and ex-President of the Commission may act like a former consultant of a multinational bank at times, but he does not intend to worry about the momentous consequences for Italian families - including those in the north - who are burdened by costs and who cannot make ends meet..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(ES) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, the spokesperson for my Group, Mr Daul, said that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is satisfied, and this is because we have got out of an impasse, but we are not happy."
"This is due to the not very pro-European atmosphere among the governments, which contrasts with the polls that President Barroso referred to concerning the will of the European people, and also because the Lisbon Treaty ultimately includes many made-to-measure elements for governments that want more and more for themselves and less and less for Europe."
"President-in-Office of the Council, you referred - and I would like to congratulate you on the agreement that has been reached, because I would like to stress that I think that the agreement is important for getting us out of the impasse - you referred to three issues that I would like to highlight."
"Firstly, I think that it is very important to have a formal proclamation in this House of the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"This was not done in Nice, it was done in secret."
"Let us now do it formally, because the Charter of Fundamental Rights, with or without opt-outs, is the DNA of the European people."
"Secondly, Mr President, I am concerned about the distribution of seats in the European Parliament, because what you have adopted violates a principle that is in the Treaty, which is degressive proportionality."
"Is it going to come to Parliament?"
"We will see what we do, but you are well aware that what you have adopted does not provide degressive proportionality."
"Finally, the High Representative."
"I think you have reached a good agreement, but I think that the President of the Council, the High Representative and the President of the Commission form a package, which we will have to discuss in Parliament."
"In summary, Mr President, I think that it was Paul Valéry, who was a great poet and, perhaps therefore a great European, who wrote that a poem is never finished, only abandoned."
"The construction of Europe never finishes."
"In this case we have, in the interests of consensus, abandoned some of the advances of the Constitutional Treaty, but we will be here to keep fighting for them."
"We will also have supported them in a sentence of the preamble which, ironically, was rescued from the flames: an ever closer union between the peoples of Europe."
"That is our objective, Mr President."
"(NL) Mr President, the Netherlands also shared the sense of relief on Saturday morning about the agreement reached, and for this, too, I believe thanks are due to the President-in-Office of the Council."
"The new Treaty enables the European Union to progress."
"The Union will become more decisive and democratic."
"The European Union is back on its feet."
"It can now concentrate fully on its substantive task; back to work with an agenda ranging from the further development of the social Europe to a better-coordinated foreign policy."
"This is also the best way to bring Europe closer to its citizens."
"My country, the Netherlands, has seen a great deal of discussion about the nature of the Treaty that has now been adopted and about its differences from the Constitutional Treaty the country rejected in a referendum."
"The conclusion was that the differences are such that a second referendum is not necessary."
"The new Treaty lacks the constitutional nature of the original Constitution; and so we, too, have no need for a further referendum."
"Thus it will just be a case of normal parliamentary ratification."
"The reforms that have been decided on have our wholehearted support, as they make substantial progress - particularly concerning the rights of the European Parliament - without fundamentally altering the balance between the Member States and the European institutions."
"A larger Union needs different, more wide-ranging rules."
"Hopefully, all Member States will now drive ratification forward, so that we can all get going with the new rules in 2009, in order to take forward the substantive role of the Union in all areas in which our citizens have expectations of us."
"(PL) Mr President, I would like to begin by adding my own voice to the words of profound gratitude for the Portuguese Presidency."
"Considerable success has been achieved."
"The European Union needed a way out of the sense of defeat and failure, it needed a political dimension, and thanks to the Portuguese Presidency, it has one."
"I also consider it to be of exceptional importance that the Charter of Fundamental Rights is an element of those decisions, and I would like to add here that the Charter of Fundamental Rights is the compass, the instrumentarium, of Europe."
"I cannot even imagine how a country that wishes to be part of the European Union could at the same time dissociate itself from that which constitutes its moral, philosophical and political foundation."
"Critical words were spoken by my colleague Mr Duff regarding the position of the British Government, which demanded an opt-out."
"I am in a better position."
"The Polish Government, which asked for an opt-out as the result of a decision taken by the Polish people, is leaving power."
"I would like to express the profound hope that following the political change-over that has taken place in my country, and out of loyalty to the Polish tradition of solidarity, Poland will observe the Charter of Fundamental Rights in full."
"Poland will accede to the Charter of Fundamental Rights in full, without any opt-out."
"(FR) Mr President, as spokesperson for the majority French party, the UMP, I congratulate the Portuguese Presidency and I am delighted with this agreement on the text of the Treaty."
"It gives the enlarged Europe the rules it needs to function effectively and democratically."
"As co-rapporteur on the new composition of the European Parliament, I am also pleased about the Council's agreement with the motion for a resolution voted for by Parliament on 11 October."
"The Council has thereby approved the definition we gave for degressive proportionality, the translation of this principle into figures, the use of Eurostat figures to evaluate the populations to be taken into account and the desire to find a more stable system after 2009."
"The Council's agreement is more than a 100% agreement; it is a 101% agreement, since the Council adds a seat to be given to Italy, without explaining why."
"This leads me to make two comments."
"The first comment is, as you said, Mr President, that all the Members of Parliament will keep the right to vote - even the President, and even the 73rd Italian - contrary to a persistent rumour spread by some of the press."
"My second comment is that the 73rd seat granted to Italy departs from the principle of degressive proportionality written into the Treaty, proposed by Parliament and accepted by the Council."
"We must therefore make sure that the decision to apply Article 9 a is unassailable before the European Court of Justice and for this reason the rapporteurs will be proposing a revised draft to Parliament taking into account the European Council's wishes."
"Sincere thanks to you, too, for the report on the distribution of seats, as well as to Mr Severin."
"You have done great work here and we have been with you 99% of the way."
". - (FR) Mr President, 'nothing is possible without men; nothing is lasting without institutions'."
"So said Jean Monnet, and it applies very well to our situation."
"Is the Treaty perfect, then?"
"Of course not!"
"Jean Monnet has an answer for this too."
"On the Treaty of Rome, he wrote that he did not ask himself whether the Treaty could have been better as it corresponded to all that was possible at the time and to the wisdom of the age."
"1957-2007."
"Are we taking the risk of starting again?"
"No, of course not."
"There will be no third treaty."
"One crisis is enough."
"Two is too many."
"Jean Monnet again has the answer: 'I have always thought that Europe would be made through crises and that it would be the sum of the solutions to those crises.'"
"That is what the Treaty is."
"However, obviously not everyone agrees, since our British friends are so keen on opting out."
"I live on a peninsula, so I understand island mentalities."
"However, Jean Monnet experienced this in 1951 with coal and steel."
"They were not interested, it was offered to them, and then they came on board."
"Remember Tony Blair."
"He signed the Social Protocol of the Maastricht Treaty."
"We are sure to find a British colleague to sign the Charter of Fundamental Rights one of these days."
"Let us be patient, and remember the Chinese diplomat who once said that he admired the wise slowness of the construction of Europe."
"Let us go on."
"Of course, I would like to finish by congratulating the Portuguese Presidency, and as I am a French MEP, I am proud of my Portuguese President and the circumstances that mean we now seem to have two for the price of one!"
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at one blow the European Union has disengaged itself from its constitutional impasse."
"The new European Union will be more capable of action, more democratic and more transparent and it will be in a position to discharge its duties more successfully both at home and throughout the world."
"This is good, and congratulations to the Portuguese Presidency in this regard. If I mention with pride that the German Council Presidency was there at the beginning of the road to Lisbon, I hope you will not mind my saying so, as a German."
"Not all the problems have been solved yet."
"The absurd episode surrounding the 751st seat mandate and the President's voting rights made this clear."
"There should be no question at all of the Council not being authorised to remove an elected Member's right to vote - irrespective of position."
"I am grateful that both the President as well as Parliament's representatives at the Intergovernmental Conference have quickly and palpably made this clear."
"Nevertheless, there is a problem here."
"It concerns Parliament's composition, which remains unclear as from 2014."
"I am convinced that it will involve finding a system that defines and governs Parliament's composition according to objective criteria, irrespective of political caprice."
"It cannot be true that the Council effectively distributes Parliament's seats as if it were lord of the manor."
"We have to strive towards this until 2014."
"One important advance has not perhaps been recognised sufficiently to date: the strengthening of the principle of subsidiarity."
"This is a very important step in involving national Parliaments in responsibility for European legislation as far as subsidiarity is concerned."
"Subsidiarity and the demand for it strengthen the Community and do not weaken it, Commission President."
"We shall also be striving for this in the future."
"I can merely ask the national Parliaments to make thorough use of these new opportunities!"
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, I, too, welcome this agreement, which, despite a few oddities like the extra seat for Italy, is a good package that deserves ratification and will make the European Union function better, while also improving its democratic accountability."
"Let me dwell for my remaining minute on the second aspect."
"Mr Kirkhope asked just now whether we have answered the questions posed at Laeken about making the EU more democratically accountable and closer to its citizens."
"I would say that we have certainly moved in that direction."
"Let us remember one thing: once this Treaty comes into force, no European legislation can be adopted without, firstly, prior examination by every national parliament, secondly, the approval of the Council of Ministers composed of national ministers accountable to those very same national parliaments and, thirdly, approval by this European Parliament, with its Members directly chosen by citizens specifically to deal with European issues at European level."
"That is a level of accountability that exists in no other international structure."
"Look at the World Trade Organisation."
"Look at the IMF."
"Look at the World Bank."
"Look at the OECD."
"You name it, nothing above the level of the nation state has that level of democratic accountability."
"Those who are really worried about democratic accountability in international structures should focus on those institutions and organisations."
"We should be proud of what we are achieving in our democratic European Union."
"(PL) Mr President, we do indeed have a new Treaty, and this alone is cause for satisfaction."
"There is, however, something else that is more important - that the Treaty is a good one."
"It is a good treaty, because it responds to the challenges that Europe is facing today."
"Moreover, it also fulfils the aims that were stated as an obligation in the Laeken Declaration six years ago."
"In line with those aims, the Treaty arranges and simplifies both the institutional framework and the legal system of the Union."
"It democratises the European Union, among other things by reinforcing the legislative role of our Parliament."
"It brings the Union closer to its citizens, and one way in which it does this is through the citizens' initiative."
"The question is, will the Union, as a result of the Treaty, have greater significance in the world and act more effectively?"
"This, however, does not depend only on the institutions introduced or modified by the Treaty; it depends primarily on the political will of the leaders of the Member States."
"Should this will be lacking, all the institutional reform will have counted for nothing."
"In order that the Treaty does not remain a moribund law, a moribund document, I would like to appeal for a community of political will at the time of its signing and after its ratification."
"Mr President, the text of the Reform Treaty agreed at the Lisbon Summit is clear progress, a step forward in the history of European integration - I would like to call it European unification."
"Therefore, it should be greeted with satisfaction."
"Nonetheless, however important this step might be, it is not the last one."
"In the short term it is crucial to see the Treaty ratified by all the 27 Member States."
"It should now be clear to everybody that there was no plan B and there is no plan C. After ratification we must continue, in the medium and long term, with the necessary reforms and policies until a complete reconciliation between Europe's history and geography is achieved within the framework of European transnational democracy."
"In this moment of relief, it is also crucial to get rid of any democratic hypocrisy and demagogy and admit that, in this complex world, political management requires - more than ever - a professional competence which could not be the subject of referendums."
"We must ask the people to decide, by 'yes' or 'no', on principles and fundamentals, not on sophisticated technicalities and complicated compromises."
"For the rest, we must observe the principle of the non-imperative mandate."
"On the other hand, we must also admit that the progress we are celebrating today was achieved at the expense of transparency and sincerity."
"The gap between peoples and us, the political leaders, after Lisbon remains at least as big as before."
"Until we close this gap, we should keep the bottles of champagne unopened."
"(CS) Mr President, as a former member of the Convention on the Future of Europe, as the only national parliamentarian involved in the negotiations and as a convinced opponent of the Constitution since the very beginning I am glad to say that in Lisbon common sense has prevailed, at least to some extent."
"The very concept of a European Constitution was erroneous from the beginning."
"I am glad that it has been abandoned and I am glad that my country was among those who contributed to this."
"The EU is not a state, it will never be one and therefore it cannot have a constitution."
"It has to be built on an intergovernmental treaty, whereby the Member States, the national states, remain the corner stones of the whole process of European integration."
"With regards to the content, each of us likes and dislikes certain aspects of it."
"On the one hand, I am personally delighted with the reinforcement of the role of the national parliaments and the national executives through the so-called flexibility clause."
"What I do not like, on the other hand, is a reduction of the national right of veto."
"However, being a realist I am aware that we have reached the limits of what is possible."
"What I see as important, nonetheless, is the fact that for the very first time in history of the EU an artificial concept elaborated at the green table had to some extent to be reworked after being tested against reality."
"This leads me to hope that the EU will continue in the future to demonstrate that it can move away from certain concepts that prove to be unfit, such as, in my opinion, the 50-year-old obsolete federalist model."
"It leads me to hope that the EU will be able to move towards a genuine, flexible, decentralised intergovernmental organisation capable of coping with the challenges of the 21st century."
"Mr President, I trust, however, that Parliament will not succumb to the temptation to revive the already dead constitutional idea, because it would merely illustrate that it is an ivory tower."
"(PL) Mr President, I did not think the last week would end so successfully."
"Firstly, at the Lisbon Summit we adopted a new Reform Treaty, which is an enormous success, and I warmly congratulate Prime Minister José Sócrates, President Barroso and indeed all of us. It went off without any attempts to veto it or any additional battles over its final form."
"In my view that means that the European Union has emerged from its institutional crisis."
"Secondly, there is good news from my country, where the removal from power in recent days of an anti-European and far-right government is an undeniable success."
"The position of the Polish people is confirmation of what I have said many times - most Poles support European integration; Poles want Poland to be a partner, not an opponent, of the European Union."
"Such events undeniably instil optimism about the future of our common European project."
"I believe that the European Union is ready to meet the challenges of the future and, as Mr Sócrates correctly observed, the European Union is now a stronger and more internally cohesive structure, as well as being a decidedly more powerful partner in negotiations in international global relations."
"The positions of the President-in-Office of the Council and the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy are a potent weapon which, if competently deployed, may positively strengthen the image of the European Union."
"One of the most important achievements of this agreement, moreover, is that the Charter of Fundamental Rights has acquired a legally binding character."
"I hope that the new Polish Government will withdraw the decision to exclude Polish citizens from the provisions of Chapter IV of the Charter, entitled Solidarity."
"This Chapter contains provisions relating to employee and trade union rights that are particularly dear to the Polish and European Left."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate the Portuguese Presidency on an excellent result under the circumstances."
"But there is one thing we need to keep in mind: the fundamental objective of the Convention on the Future of Europe is still to be accomplished, that is, to overcome the gap between institutions and European citizens."
"We now have the means to apply our common European policies."
"What we need is political will and determination."
"Everything now centres on implementation, and there are two principles on which our implementation of this Lisbon Treaty should be based: firstly, subsidiarity."
"Defining the competences of the EU is clearly a very encouraging achievement, linked with the increased role and responsibility of the national parliaments, because our citizens should perceive that the European Community will address the problems of the Community efficiently and, at the same time, abstain from intervening in their lives where it is not necessary."
"The second principle concerns solidarity, which is a core value of the European Community. Agreeing on degressive proportionality in forming the future European Parliament is a clear expression of that solidarity, and I am grateful for it."
"Another very important test of this solidarity will be creating the common foreign policy on energy security, as proposed last month by the European Parliament, including a special High Representative on energy serving under the new High Representative for Foreign Affairs."
"Lastly, I would quote one fine expression of solidarity when President Barroso told his Russian counterpart last May in Samara that, in the EU's understanding of solidarity, Poland and Estonia are as important as Germany and Portugal."
"(PL) Mr President, following the Lisbon Summit, the discussion of the European Treaty may be considered to be closed, as we now have one supreme aim - to ratify the Treaty as quickly and as efficiently as possible."
"Parliament does have a role to play here: please bear in mind that we have greater importance under the Treaty than we had before."
"There are three points to consider: the description of the role and tasks of the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the matter of his election, this being a joint decision with the European Council from 1 January 2009."
"We need to prepare for this joint decision in several areas, primarily security and the administration of justice."
"Thirdly, we must hold a political debate to finalise the principles by which the President of the European Council will act, with particular reference to his relations with the European Parliament."
"The most important thing, though, is ratification, and it depends to a large extent on us Members of the European Parliament."
"It will take place in different ways in each country."
"We must find ways of persuading citizens that this is a success not just for the Union, not just for politicians, but above all for them."
"This is our main task - ratification."
"Thanks and congratulations."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for the excellent debate we have had on the summit and the Lisbon Treaty."
"Firstly, say what you like about this new Treaty, but one thing no one can deny is that Europe is stronger as a result of this Treaty."
"This Treaty affirms European values, the good values that were always the foundation of the European integration project."
"This Treaty boosts the European economy and creates the conditions for Europe better to play its role in the world."
"As many have observed, this is a Treaty that makes the European institutions and the political workings of Europe more democratic."
"This Treaty equips the European Union of 27 for more effective decision-making."
"Those who like democracy also like democracy to be appreciated as a method that allows effective decision-making, and all those who follow European political life understand that Europe needed more effective decision-making."
"Finally, I would like to say to anyone who has doubts about the Treaty and Europe's capability, please wake up to reality; the world has already reached its conclusion on the Treaty."
"Europe has become stronger, better able to respond to global challenges, better able to respond to strategic challenges, and since Lisbon the world has been looking to Europe in the hope that it will once again take up its role in the world."
"No, this Treaty means progress for us."
"Other people have already said it about Europe: no, do not doubt; wake up, we are stronger."
"Europe is more confident since the Lisbon Agreement and Europe is now in a position to take a stance on the future; it can move from the defensive to the offensive."
"Graham Watson was kind enough to mention Pessoa in his speech."
"I would like to thank him very much for this personal kindness, as Pessoa is one of our great poets and I would like to quote Pessoa again: he once spoke about 'a nostalgia for the future'."
"I too, as a European, am nostalgic for the future and I am nostalgic for the time when Europe discussed the future, showed leadership, and I am nostalgic for those days and I believe that this Treaty provides the conditions to enable Europe to do that."
"If you will allow me, Mr President, I would like to clarify two things: the first is about the President of Parliament, to tell Members that it never entered anybody's head that the Council might propose that the President of Parliament should lose the right to vote."
"The President will of course retain that right; I do not know how this mistaken idea arose, but what the Council decided is that this Parliament will have 751 Members (750 plus the President)."
"Next I would like to say that the Ioannina clause has been resolved, as I always said it would be."
"Ioannina must be legally binding, but should not be in the Treaty, and the solution we came up with of a declaration plus a protocol is fully in line with the mandate we were given."
"I too would like to praise the previous Presidency, as I have always done and always do in the same way."
"Throughout the whole process of this Treaty there were two decisive moments."
"The first came last October when Angela Merkel decided to make the Treaty the main issue of her Presidency and of future presidencies."
"This move required political courage and was a political risk."
"At the time no one thought it had much chance of success."
"I call this a decisive moment because Europe needed to get back to politics and also to get back to courage and political risk."
"The other decisive moment, as I said earlier, was when we decided, taking the opportunity of the last Council, to reach agreement in October rather than leave it for December."
"Finally, Mr President, I would like to finish by saying that certainly many people, and many people in Europe, who never believed in Europe are as dissatisfied with this Treaty as they would be with any other Treaty."
"However, perhaps there are some who would like a different Treaty and with them it is worth having a dialogue, to tell them that at this point the alternative was either to have this Treaty or to remain in a state of institutional crisis."
"I think that all who realise that a politician has to deal with reality rather than with fantasy will support what was decided in Lisbon."
"As for ratification, I would like to be clear that it is the business of each country."
"However, what I cannot accept as a democrat is for those who argue for national referendums to do so by trying to diminish representative democracy, challenging the legitimacy of parliamentary ratification."
"(Applause)"
"I am a democrat and Europe is democratic, and being democrats we leave each country free to decide the best method of ratification."
"Finally, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, yes, I am very proud, yes I am very satisfied, yes, I feel very honoured to have been part, along with many others, of a historic and decisive moment, the moment in which the Lisbon Treaty was born, because it means that Europe will move forward."
"(Loud applause)"
"President-in-Office, I should also like to say a sincere word of thanks specifically to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Luís Amado, to Manuel Lobo Antunes, as well as to Ambassador Mendonça e Moura and the Legal Service coordinated by Jean-Claude Pires."
"President of the Commission. - Mr President, Ms Thyssen asked a specific question: can we make progress between now and the final ratification?"
"As I said, it is by delivering results to European citizens that we can help to create the right political environment to facilitate ratification."
"It would be a mistake to slow down our delivery, and it would be against the twin-track strategy central to the Commission, which stated that we should at the same time solve the political institutional matters and deliver concrete results to our citizens."
"On the contrary, this Commission, and I am sure also this Parliament, should be active - and we could be even more active together - in promoting a European citizens' agenda."
"The second issue concerned communication and democracy."
"Communicating about a treaty and explaining it to our public is primarily the responsibility of the national authorities."
"However, it is also a task for the European Institutions."
"I agree with what Mr Queiró said about the importance of the role of the European Parliament in this matter."
"We in the Commission are ready to assume our responsibility in close cooperation with Member States and the European Parliament."
"I agree with the points made about subsidiarity by Mr Kelam and Mr Nassauer."
"It is very important to highlight the added value, in terms of democracy, of this Treaty."
"It makes Europe more democratic and more accountable and places a stronger emphasis on subsidiarity."
"Subsidiarity is a way to reinforce Europe and the European Institutions, not to weaken those Institutions, because by working close to the citizens they get more legitimacy and can take better decisions."
"I also believe that it is right in our communication, as Mr Corbett highlighted, to explain the new democratic dimension."
"We in the European Union are proud to have this kind of democratic system."
"We can always make it better, but there is no other place in the world where there is such democratic participation at transnational level as the European Union."
"We should also, in communication terms, make clear our reinforced capacity to act on behalf of the citizens in areas relevant to their concerns, like climate protection, energy and migration."
"Those are concrete concerns for our citizens and we are addressing those concerns. In communication terms, we should also highlight the reinforced capacity to act in the international scene."
"Finally, I want to highlight one point that was made clear by Mr Poignant and I thank him for highlighting the importance of Jean Monnet."
"It is true that this is not a perfect Treaty, but sometimes people say we are giving up the values and the commitment of the founding fathers."
"That is not true."
"We are doing what Jean Monnet and many others have said, which is to build pas à pas - step by step - this common project, and we have to do it by conceding now that we have to commit to our citizens, and that we have to fulfil concrete tasks and deliver concrete results."
"The Lisbon Summit, in concentrating on the Treaty and the Institutions and, on the second day, showing the way to globalisation, and the way we can together reinforce our capacity to act so that we can meet the challenge of globalisation, has indeed set the agenda for the future of Europe."
"It was therefore a great success, and the Portuguese Presidency, the Member States, the European Parliament and the Commission should really celebrate this fact and look to the future with renewed confidence."
"(Applause)"
"Many thanks, Commission President."
"This debate has shown that we can believe in the future of our continent of Europe."
"We shall be even more committed in working towards it. Many thanks."
"The debate is closed."
"Written declarations (Article 142)"
"in writing. - (FR) My first words will be to congratulate the leaders of the Member States for the historic agreement they entered into in Lisbon, which brings to an end many years of institutional uncertainty."
"I welcome the relentless work of daring, wisdom and pragmatism of the French President Nicolas Sarkozy, and Angela Merkel's excellent German Presidency in the first half of 2007 of which put the institutional agenda on the rails."
"I would like to include in these congratulations recognition of the excellent and immense work accomplished by chairman Valéry Giscard d'Estaing."
"This agreement picks up the major political advances of the old text: a stable presidency for the European Union, a person responsible for European diplomacy, and a new voting mechanism with the extension of qualified majority voting, while strengthening the powers of the European Parliament."
"I am sorry that the symbols of the European Union (the flag, anthem and motto) have been abandoned."
"This Treaty also takes account of the messages delivered by the French and Dutch people who rejected the old Treaty, in that it does not retain the character of a constitution, which the original text had, and it does not set in stone in the Treaties of the European Union a collection of European public policies that instead come under the current functioning of European democracy."
"in writing. - (HU) I consider it to be a major step that the politicians who were present in Lisbon, conscious of their responsibility and setting aside their historical grievances, have reached agreement on a Treaty that has taken six long years to produce, and which will determine the future face of Europe and establish a framework enabling it to function efficiently."
"It is important that the process of ratifying this document, due to be signed on 13 December this year, also goes without a hitch in the Member States."
"It is vital that the European Parliament should continue to pledge its support for the Reform Treaty, and here again we draw Member States' attention to the importance of the ratification process."
"Hungary has always firmly supported the constitutional process and believed that sooner or later the Member States would find a common voice and succeed in moving the process of European integration forward."
"As a member of the European Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs, I believe it is important to emphasise that the document that has been adopted can contribute positively to making European Union foreign policy more effective, and can also enhance its effectiveness in the international diplomatic arena."
"It is not only in the realm of foreign policy, however, that the Reform Treaty may be expected to bring about change, but also on numerous other issues that are vital for the efficient functioning of the EU."
"For example, it opens up the possibility that the new European Parliament and European Commission that will be constituted in 2009 will be able to commence operations on a more efficient, more transparent and more democratic basis."
"This joint success first and foremost required the political will to take joint action, so let us now rejoice in the Treaty, but in the interests of ensuring the success of the process we must not stop here; we must continue in our joint efforts to ensure that the ratification process is brought to a successful conclusion."
"In order to reach agreement on the Reform Treaty, too many gifts were handed out behind closed doors in Lisbon: Italy receives an extra seat in the European Parliament and Bulgaria the Cyrillic 'evro', Poland can continue to block the decision-making process for a number of years to come, and Austria can exclude German students from its universities."
"This horse trading is medieval and runs counter to our endeavours towards greater transparency in the Union."
"Nevertheless, we can be pleased that at long last, following years of debate, we have reached an agreement full stop, as this Treaty is an improvement on the current situation."
"It is not the most elegant of agreements, but it does ensure more democracy in Europe."
"It gives the European Parliament and national parliaments more influence, enabling European citizens to exert more direct influence on policy."
"It meets the need for common energy and foreign policies."
"Rigorous enforcement of the Copenhagen criteria is a necessity, and finally more democratic accountability is also afforded by the introduction of the 'orange card', which gives national parliaments the opportunity of contesting European legislation on grounds of subsidiarity."
"The truth about the Reform Treaty is the same as that about the European Constitution."
"These deeds transform the international organisation that is the European Community, as well as the union between its members that is the European Union, into a continental superstate."
"They also effect a recognition of this superstate (by accession to the European Convention on Human Rights of 1950, the parties to which may only be states)."
"They open up a new path for the creation of a single European law without the involvement of the Member States (through interpretation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights by the European Court of Justice)."
"One could spend a long time listing examples of equivalent significance."
"In view of this situation, we come up against the issue of guarantees of the rights of the peoples of Europe in the new superstate, since it has so far been the Member States that constituted these guarantees for their peoples."
"This problem has not been addressed at all in the Reform Treaty."
"Since the rights of peoples are none other than human rights raised to the level of community life, because of the project to establish a superstate we are facing a human rights crisis in Europe."
"We must therefore reject the Reform Treaty and set about doing some fundamental work on a system to guarantee the rights of peoples under the conditions of European integration."
"If we do not do this, Europe will be threatened by another explosion of totalitarianism."
"Agenda"
"Ladies and gentlemen, with the agreement of the political groups, and in accordance with our Rules of Procedure, I propose the following amendments to the agenda for the current part-session."
"Firstly, I propose that the vote on the motions for resolutions tabled to close the debate on the EU-Russia Summit be moved to the next part-session in Brussels."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I rise on a point of order under Rule 166, and with reference to Rules 45, 77, 89, 113 and 155."
"We took a decision yesterday that we would have a resolution on the EU-Russia Summit this week, and my Group believes that we should stick to that."
"I know there is an attempt to try to revote that decision, but I hope the House will sensibly see off such a narrow-minded approach to politics."
"(Applause)"
"Are there any other comments?"
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, this now also concerns fellow Members."
"We were not informed about this application."
"There was a communication problem here yesterday."
"Neither the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats nor my group were informed of this request."
"This is also the reason why we have been feeling relatively overlooked and have abstained from voting."
"We have both - that is, my fellow Member, Mr Daul, and I - put forward the proposal this morning that we flesh out this resolution with care."
"We note the desire for a resolution and accept it on condition that we flesh it out with care."
"After the summit we shall also have all the information available, hence the deferral of the proposal until after the summit."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I do not know how strong communications are within the large groups."
"We have always said that we want a resolution - the General Secretaries have been informed of this."
"We have said that if you speak out against this, we shall do so at the vote on Monday morning, as is our right."
"We have always said so and if this has not been relayed to you, it is not our problem, but yours."
"As regards the content: a new law against extremists, for example, has been adopted in Russia in recent weeks that clearly restricts freedom of the press and freedom of opinion."
"We therefore want the resolution to be adopted before the summit to enable the EU to state our position on the situation in Russia through this resolution."
"We shall still be able to draw up a resolution on the results after the summit, but this Parliament, which wants to be political, should also adopt political freedom of expression by a majority before the summit in order to show mainland Russia what we think about freedom and democracy here in the European Parliament."
"(Applause)"
"(DE) Mr President, we would all certainly go along with this."
"Mr Cohn-Bendit has stated precisely what we are all thinking."
"However, in this House there are rules of procedure, not just because we want to torment people, but because large groups with way over 200 members also have problems, which you have perhaps to a lesser extent, Mr Cohn-Bendit, in your smaller group, namely that we have to be able to consult one another."
"When I add the members of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and those of my group together, there are way over 450 Members in this House who need a little time for consultation."
"I would therefore make the following proposal: what Mr Cohn-Bendit has said here, that we convey to the Russian side that we consider this law unfair and that it should be retracted, the Commission and the Council can pick up from here on."
"This is certainly a statement of the will of the entire European Parliament, which has already been made clear through this discussion."
"A resolution, however, that contains 60-70 items also has to be able to be discussed a little and only by doing so will it work."
"We therefore ask for the debate, the draft resolution, and then the vote at the next sitting."
"This is in actual fact a fair compromise."
"Please endorse it!"
"Ladies and gentlemen, according to our Rules of Procedure, the point that Mr Watson has raised is correct and is well established in the Rules of Procedure."
"It is evident, however, that there is a difference of opinion on this issue."
"In accordance with the Rules of Procedure, we are going to resolve this issue in the only way that we can, which is on the basis that Parliament is sovereign."
"We are therefore going to have two votes: the first vote will be to vote on whether you want to vote on this matter."
"If the result of this vote is negative, we will leave the agenda as it is and there will be no amendments."
"If you decide that you do want to vote, we will then vote on the item, as to whether or not the vote on the motions for resolutions will be postponed."
"I therefore put to the vote the question of whether Parliament wishes to vote on this matter."
"(Parliament decided to vote on the matter)"
"Consequently, I now put to the vote the proposal that I presented to you, that is, to move the vote on the motions for resolutions on the EU-Russia Summit to the next part-session in Brussels."
"Those who vote in favour will be voting in favour of moving this vote to the next part-session and those who vote against will be voting in favour of keeping the agenda as it is."
"(Parliament approved the proposal)"
"Secondly, I propose that the following two reports, currently entered with debate on Thursday between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m., be entered directly in the votes on Thursday at 12 noon:"
"the report by Margie Sudre, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the amended proposal for a Council regulation on the conclusion of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Madagascar - C6-0064/2007 -, and"
"the report by Emanuel Jardim Fernandes, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the conclusion of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Mozambique - C6-0284/2007 -."
"If there are no comments, we shall include these votes directly on Thursday in the voting time at 12 noon."
"Mr President, I rise on a point of order on the same legal basis as Mr Watson."
"I merely wish to point out that we have had a very important debate about the increase of democracy within the EU."
"This tactic, which has, apparently, just been successful, demonstrates that democracy, even within this Parliament, needs to be extended further."
"I can say - as a member of a large group, the PPE-DE Group, of which I am extremely proud to be a member - that the blame for not holding a resolution was put on other groups."
"I then found out that this was an agreement by the two large groups."
"Quite clearly, this is an unsatisfactory way to proceed."
"I accept the decision."
"My practical recommendation to you, Mr President, would be to ensure that the full verbatim account of the debate on the EU-Russia Summit be presented by the President-in-Office of the Council and the President of the Commission to President Putin at the summit - not afterwards."
"(Applause)"
"- (FR) Mr President, regarding the entry of the reports on fishing, I do not know if it was an interpreting error, but you said that it would be with debate, and was on the agenda for Thursday morning."
"It will be without debate."
"So I think it was an interpreting error."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we propose that they be entered directly in the voting time on Thursday at 12 noon."
"They are currently entered with debate on Thursday between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m."
"We therefore propose that they be entered in the votes on Thursday at 12 noon, without debate."
"(Parliament approved the proposal)"

"- Before the vote:"
"Mr President, I rise on a point of order under Rule 166, to invoke Rule 37(1) of our Rules of Procedure."
"Rule 37(1) concerns the access to documents and provision of information to this Parliament."
"In the run-up to this vote on pesticides, many, if not all, in this House have been bombarded by e-mails asking us to vote for amendments that go even further than the Commission would like us to."
"These e-mails come from an organisation called Pesticide Watch, whose constituent organisations received large amounts of funding from the European Commission - indeed, part of the EUR 11.7 million spent in the last two years under the budget line relating to the Community action programme promoting non-governmental organisations (NGOs) primarily active in the field of environmental protection and the Life+ programme."
"Under Rule 37(1), can I ask for the various exchanges between the Commission and these NGOs, who have been lobbying us on all these matters?"
"This payroll lobbying has certainly led to an increase in the number of e-mails being received by MEPs, but surely it is wrong for one Commission DG to use large sums of taxpayers' money, and abuse the role of NGOs, to try and change the views of parliamentarians and the lead Commission DG on this matter."

"There have been errors which are statistically normal in a vote of this length."
"What are ridiculous are interventions such as yours."
"(Applause)"
"- Before the vote on the legislative resolution:"
"Mr President, on a point of order, I do not want to prolong things, and you are too polite to say so, but there is a rule which allows the President taking a vote, when presented with a vote of this length - eight pages of thirty separate votes - to put it to the House that the report be sent back to the committee to be sifted and re-presented."
"I think we should apply that rule more often."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, you have done a very good job and earned a good lunch, as have we."
"We should postpone the vote until tomorrow."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Mr President, it is 2 p.m., we should stop the vote."
"I am sorry, really sorry that a report like this should reach plenary."
"I propose that next time more work is done on it in committee and that in future, in the plan to reform Parliament, these rules are reviewed. We cannot go on working like this."
"(Applause)"
"(FR) Mr President, I think what my fellow Member said is quite right, but he should have admitted that it was his group that did not respect the work in committee and tabled all the amendments here today."
"(Applause)"
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on this point, according to Mr Cohn-Bendit, the Committee decided by a very clear majority, yet the Chamber has laboured against this decision in a way that borders on obstructionism."
"This is the truth of the situation."
"Therefore, it is not a procedural issue, but a question of political attitude."
"Ladies and gentlemen, there has been a combination of two unfortunate circumstances."
"Firstly, we had a very long prior debate, which delayed the voting time, and secondly today we have had one of the largest votes in this session."
"We are therefore going to suspend voting at this stage and I thank you for your cooperation."
"Voting time"
"The next item is the vote."
"(For the results and other details on the vote: see Minutes)"
"Explanations of vote"
"in writing. - (PT) This Convention - which aims to set out the obligations of the Parties to assess the environmental impact of certain activities at an early stage of planning and imposes on States the general obligation regarding notification and consultation on all major projects that are likely to have a significant adverse environmental impact across borders - was signed by the Community and its Member States on 26 February 1991 and approved by the Community on 27 June 1997."
"Parliament approved some amendments, notably one extending the definition of the 'public' in Article 1(X) of the Convention to clarify that the public that may participate in procedures under the Convention includes civil society and, in particular, non-governmental organisations, and one that opens the Convention for accession by non-ECE member countries upon approval by the meeting of the Parties, which deserves our support."
"The other amendments seem less important to us."
"In principle, I do not believe they create any problems."
"We therefore agreed with the rapporteur and voted in favour of the report."
"in writing. - (EL) The brief report contains serious gaps, which play down the importance of the issue."
"The legislative regulations governing the protection of the environment are a compromise between the need to protect it and the demands of big business to maximize its excessive profits come what may."
"Preoccupation with profit makes the competitiveness of the EU's multinationals a priority above all the others."
"The following are symptomatic of this:"
"i. the Kyoto Protocol, in which trade in pollutants is prominent;"
"ii. the entire legislative framework, which facilitates the use and expansion of GMOs;"
"iii. legislation on the monitoring of the use of chemical substances in consumer products to a permissible level."
"This legislation took as many as 40 years to be completed, although it naturally has many exceptions, from 1967 (Directive 67/458/ΕEC) to 2007, when the REACH Regulation entered into force;"
"iv. a still highly deficient legislative framework for the integrated management of radioactive waste;"
"v. the distorting development of biofuels, at the expense of food crops."
"Multinationals are nonetheless allowed to act anti-environmentally."
"All they suffer are some fines, which represent a very small part of the additional profits coming from the destruction of the environment."
"This proves the adage that he who pays the piper calls the tune."
"We believe that these are serious omissions."
"What is required is a brief but very meaningful and useful reference to these issues."
"in writing. - (PT) The Convention on the protection of the European Communities' financial interests and its protocols are on the list of conventions and protocols in the field of justice and home affairs contained in Annex I to the Act of Accession."
"This Convention and its protocols were adopted in 1996, with the aim of establishing a common base for the criminal-law protection of the EC's financial interests, and entered into force in 2002 following ratification by the then 15 Member States."
"In order to avoid wasting time and effort on the laborious negotiation, conclusion and ratification (by 27 Member States) of specific accession protocols to each Convention, the Act of Accession of Romania and Bulgaria introduced a simplified system for the accession to the conventions and protocols concluded by the Member States on the basis of Article 34 of the Treaty on European Union or Article 293 of the EC Treaty."
"I therefore support this proposal for a Council Decision which simplifies the determination of the date of entry into force of this Convention in relation to Romania and Bulgaria."
"I would like to speak about the package of two documents - the Commission proposal and the Council decision on the development of the Schengen information system infrastructure and its implementation and management."
"I voted in favour of both resolutions and consider them to be very important EU legislative documents."
"It is a shame that the launch of SIS II keeps being postponed."
"We are so far behind schedule that it is essential to find a way out of the situation that would enable us to use the SIS 1+ network after 13 November 2008, i.e. to extend the service provided by the SISNET network and to create a fall-back solution with the s-TESTA network."
"It is now clear that the human and financial resources allocated for the implementation of SIS II will have to be shared between the three projects being developed simultaneously: SIS II, SISone4all and the installation, operation and management of a communication infrastructure."
"This will have a negative impact on the implementation of SIS II."
"This is why the decision on the financing of SIS 1+ and subsequently SISone4all will be of great importance: will it be financed by all participating parties or will SISNET, for example, receive funding from the EU budget?"
"The correct distribution of EU and Member States' resources will be of great significance."
"However, in view of the project's importance as regards the security of the EU, it is obvious that SIS II is the greatest priority."
"We must allocate funds for EU security and the development of communications infrastructure."
"in writing. - (RO) Only one year after its establishment, in 2006, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is already requested."
"I welcome the voting of the decision to mobilize the fund, which represents a first attempt to support our European citizens who face the challenges of globalisation."
"Globalisation is a phenomenon that offers us numerous chances and opportunities, but also generates difficulties of adjustment to its consequences."
"Therefore, it is very important for the European Union to be capable not only of responding to such challenges, but also to approach them efficiently by fast mobilization of the necessary financial instruments."
"European citizens' safety and confidence in the future lie at the basis of our actions and initiatives."
"I am very pleased to welcome the orientation of this fund toward the field of labour and labour safety, but I also emphasize the importance of education in this field and the need to take into consideration this area, as well, in the future fund mobilizations."
"At the end, I hope that in the future, in case of need, each EU Member State will benefit from the mobilization of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, whose less positive effects affect us all, including in the new Member States."
"This is the only way in which we will be able to build true sustainable development over the entire EU territory."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this first ever mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund. The Fund was set up, following a successful campaign by the PSE Group, to alleviate the effects of globalisation on European workers."
"In this instance, the fund is being used to assist approximately 900 workers made redundant in the automobile sector in France."
"in writing. - (PT) In March 2007, France requested the mobilisation of the EGF in respect of the redundancies of 1 345 workers of Renault SA and 1 057 workers of Peugeot SA and their suppliers."
"Owing to the budgetary restrictions on this fund (EUR 500 million a year), its restrictive eligibility criteria and the number of workers affected, the amount of the Community contribution awarded was EUR 3 816 280."
"Thus we can see that this comes to EUR 1 902 for each of the Renault-linked workers made redundant and EUR 1 190 for each of the Peugeot-linked workers made redundant."
"The European Commission estimated that between 35 000 and 50 000 workers could benefit from this fund, but EU data indicate that the number of workers made redundant as a result of 'restructuring' is far in excess of half a million."
"The situation is all the more serious as most of these workers were made redundant as a result of 'restructuring' regarded as 'within' the EU, and therefore not covered by the fund's eligibility criteria."
"What is in fact required is an end to the policy of liberalisation and maximising profit that is the cause of relocations and ""restructuring”, and measures to preserve jobs."
"The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund came into being in 2006 under the considerable influence of the defeat of the constitutional referendum in France."
"Right from the start the impression was created that this was a compensation formula, linked more to the exaggerated problem of the 'delocalisation' of jobs to new Member States than to the problem of globalisation."
"As such, the Fund is a response to the fears associated with the enlargement of the European Union, essentially reinforcing them and blocking the benefits arising from the uniting of Europe in 2004 for new and old Member States."
"It is no surprise that we are starting with an application from France, linked to the difficulties experienced by Peugeot and Renault suppliers, for a sum of EUR 3.8 million."
"The application is properly grounded and has received full support from the European Parliament's Committee on Budgets."
"I hope that the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund will not become a method of typical rent-seeking, in other words an easy method of obtaining EU subsidies for businesses that are experiencing difficulties, allocated on the basis of criteria that are not very precise."
"Too many European companies are facing the problem of restructuring, in the name of competitiveness in the global economy, for a Fund with an annual ceiling of EUR 500 million to be able to meet all needs."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this report, which gives parliamentary support to the first ever distribution of funds from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, which was established with strong PSE support to alleviate the effects of globalisation on workers."
"in writing. - (PT) The decision to use the new European Globalisation Adjustment Fund and the response to the request from the French Government is an opportunity that we should monitor carefully to check whether this fund does actually deliver the desired results."
"According to what emerged from the debate held on the date it was set up, this fund aims to be an institutional reform for solidarity regarding the unforeseen and negative consequences of the globalisation process."
"Obviously, the free adjustment of the market will always be a better option than State or equivalent intervention."
"In any event, this fund exists in the context of the European Union and of the solutions that the majority of its Member States adopt for resolving social crises, so the challenge is to ensure firstly that the results of mobilising it are as expected and secondly that an intervention of this type does not send the wrong signals to the market, thereby unintentionally promoting solutions that eventually create even greater damage."
"Since I believe and hope that this will not be the case, I voted in favour of this report."
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to thank my fellow Members for the result of the vote."
"This is based on the result of the report on the sustainable use of pesticides."
"We have voted out the top levels here."
"We have, however, focussed on training and information for users and salespeople alike."
"Only the expert and skilled handling of pesticides can ensure sustainability."
"The latest technology and the most up-to-date knowledge are being applied here, of course."
"We support Integrated Pest Management."
"The Commission is calling for Integrated Pest Management to be made compulsory for agriculture as a whole by 2014."
"We need general standards for this."
"We cannot squeeze Integrated Pest Management into fixed criteria, certainly not throughout Europe."
"Integrated Pest Management must always be developed flexibly."
"It requires the incitements of good technical practice and it needs drive - and that drive needs to be maintained."
"We must therefore discuss this once again here before second reading."
"We still have the opportunity, together with the Council and the Commission, to bring this to a good conclusion so that we in the European Union can continue to make pest management actually possible."
"Mr President, I feel very disappointed that Parliament has not done more today on this pesticides package."
"On so many of the more radical and progressive issues, we could have gone very much further."
"But the one area that I want to focus on just now is the area of residents."
"They should be regarded as a specifically vulnerable group, an exposure group in their own right, and a small step has been taken today in order to do that, in the vote that we have just had in this Parliament."
"People who live near schools where nearby fields are sprayed and people who work or live near sprayed fields have an enormously high exposure to pesticides."
"They are exposed, on a long-term basis, to mixtures or cocktails of pesticides that are sprayed in their locality throughout the year and, in many cases, for decades."
"Until now there has not been any protection for residents as a specific exposure group."
"This is a major and serious public health issue, as farmers clearly cannot control pesticides once they are airborne, and studies have shown pesticides can travel in the air for miles."
"I wish we had gone further in terms of our ban on all aerial spraying."
"There have been many reports over the decades of acute and chronic ill-health in rural areas."
"Our Parliament could have done much more in this vote today to protect people from cancers, from leukaemia, from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and a whole range of other diseases, and I am very disappointed indeed that we did not take up that option, which had been put forward in the Committee on the Environment."
"So many of those more positive measures have, sadly, been overturned by the other groups."
"But I hope that people will look at the Parliament today and put pressure on their representatives so that, when we come back to a second reading, we can try and do better by the health of people."
"They expect us to do better."
"We should have done better, and I am very sorry the other groups did not support us today."
"(HU) As a Member representing the Hungarian Democratic Forum (Magyar Demokrata Fórum - MDF), I will be using my vote to support both of these draft legislative texts providing for stricter regulations and greater control concerning the use of plant protection products."
"I believe that these provisions represent a milestone on the road towards safer and healthier food production."
"Substances that pose a risk to health must be withdrawn, and the overall amount of pesticides we use must be reduced."
"In Hungary, for example, the amount of chemicals used is 15 times less than in the Netherlands, say, and yet while they existed the European Union's intervention stores were bursting at the seams with Hungarian maize."
"We therefore can and must move forward in the direction of producing fruit, vegetables and other foods using sustainable levels of plant protection."
"Where Member States wish to apply tougher provisions, they should continue to have the possibility of doing so. Thank you."
"(CS) Commissioner, I, too, resent the fact that human health is exposed to risk, for example during aerial spraying, and that pesticide use is constantly increasing due to a growing resistance against plant protection."
"There is no doubt that we need to modernise the rules on safe pesticide use in Europe."
"I regret however, that here in Parliament, through the Greens and left-wing Members, preference was given to populist proposals such as a ban on pesticide use either in full or at a local level."
"I consider that to be irresponsible."
"We are talking here about plant medicines and banning them would be equivalent to banning the use of drugs in human medicine."
"Both are of course poisonous if used improperly: hence we must devote our efforts to promoting standards and disseminating information, rather than adopting scientifically unfounded, indiscriminate and overly bureaucratic measures."
"Ladies and gentlemen, by virtue of common sense I did not support the majority of your proposals in the package."
"As such I do not believe that the Klaß report as approved is very successful."
"(PL) Mr President, I would like to say that I voted in favour of Mrs Klaß's report, and one reason why I did so was because this report makes reference to tightening up the proposals put forward by the European Commission."
"There is specific mention of national action plans in the context of a reduction in the frequency of application of pesticides by 25% over 5 years and by half - by 50% - over 10 years."
"It is very important for the European Parliament to be tougher on this matter and have a greener approach than the European Commission."
"I would also like to emphasise strongly that my decision was influenced by the fact that in the report that was put to the vote there is a statement to the effect that all Member States will set up buffer zones to stop pesticides entering reservoirs and drinking water."
"in writing. - (FR) As draftsman of the opinion on water quality, I saw that pesticides were implicated in the degradation of the environment, and particularly of surface and coastal waters, because they persist over time, can be transported over long distances, and constitute a diffuse form of pollution, which is difficult to locate resulting from runoffs, direct losses in the soil and the air, the washing of plants by the rain and so on. More generally, the current use of pesticides in our agriculture can have damaging consequences for our health."
"The Commission's legislative proposals on the use of pesticides, and procedures for authorisation and placing on the market were therefore very keenly awaited."
"However, I find the targets inadequate and that is why, in Parliament's plenary, I unsuccessfully supported the position adopted by the Committee on the Environment asking for an EU target of a 25% reduction in the frequency of application of pesticides within 5 years and a 50% reduction within 10 years, and buffer zones of 10 metres between fields and water courses."
"I am particularly sorry that this is a first reading and that the text is likely to be watered down even more."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of the report by Mrs Klaß on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a framework for Community action to achieve a sustainable use of pesticides because it pursues the objective of reducing the use of plant protection products and contributes to high safety standards for humans, animals and the environment."
"However, I consider it essential for the possibility of aerial spraying to be maintained in situations where there is no viable alternative or where terrestrial application involves a greater hazard, although in Natura 2000 areas, in addition to the possibility of pesticides being banned, it should also be possible to restrict their use or minimise the risks involved, which presupposes a specific risk assessment."
"When the 6th Environment Action Programme was adopted it was recognised that the impact of plant protection products on human health and the environment must be reduced, underlining the need to achieve a more sustainable use of pesticides and outlining a two-track approach with full implementation and appropriate revision of the relevant legal framework and developing a Thematic Strategy on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides."
"Now, the rapporteur considers the title of the Commission proposal to be misleading."
"The aim of the proposal is to regulate a particular class of pesticides, namely pesticides in the form of plant protection products."
"Accordingly, the term 'pesticides' should be replaced by 'plant protection products' throughout the text of the Directive."
"The Directive aims to reduce the risks associated with the use of plant protection products and on the environment and human health."
"However, measures designed with this in mind must be proportionate and it must not be forgotten that it should primarily be a matter for the Member States to help reduce the risks involved in the use of plant protection products by means of national action plans."
"This is the only way in which the differing conditions and situations at local level can be taken into account."
"in writing. - (FR) I systematically voted against the whole plant protection package to signal my opposition to a dossier that was not yet ready for the plenary session."
"Confronting 700 MEPs with 300 - 400 amendments, to be voted on in 3 or 4 instalments, is simply unworthy of a legislator."
"We might just as well organise a lottery."
"That the legislator wants to combat pesticide abuse seems laudable."
"However, organising a system that is so bureaucratic as to be inefficient stems from poor legislation."
"Anyway, if we want to feed a constantly increasing population the Earth cannot do without plant protection products."
"Today, the European Parliament refused to accede to calls by environmental fundamentalists for unworkable rules on the sustainable use of pesticides."
"The main bone of contention was the proposal by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety to ban the use of pesticides within 10 metres of water bodies."
"This would have disastrous consequences for administrators of public spaces and recreational areas such as golf courses in countries such as the Netherlands where much of their surface is covered by water."
"The outcome of the vote is a compromise between environmental protection and workable rules for authorities and entrepreneurs."
"We have a collective responsibility for precluding risks, and it is indeed true that in the use of pesticides, 'the fewer the better', but the rules must be realistic and workable."
"If alternatives are available, they must be used, but it is wishful thinking to ban all uses of pesticides by law and think that this will be without consequences for our economy and society."
"in writing. - I voted for this report as amended, which developed a reasonable compromise between preserving public safety by restricting the use of pesticides, and protecting the ability of land based industries to enhance crop production."
"The precautionary principle at the heart of the approach is one I strongly support."
"This lunchtime, the European Parliament has overall delivered a message that responds to the concerns of citizens in favour of agriculture being less dependent on pesticides, sustainable and taking account of the health of farmers and other users."
"One step forward is the health protection section, which was totally absent from the 1991 regulation and is now clearly affirmed through recognition of the substitution principle (as for REACH, aimed at encouraging the use of less or non-chemical alternatives), the priority given to the protection of the most vulnerable populations and the prohibition in principle on aerial spraying."
"It was essential to plug a legal loophole regarding the phase of use by professionals and private individuals."
"This will be achieved with the framework directive, which takes account of new habits and fashions in gardening: pesticides have even got into our homes and gardens!"
"One major regret, though, is the rejection in the Klaß report of the new approach by the Commission - known as Integrated Pest Management - which consists of allowing the use of all available agricultural techniques while giving priority to environmentally-friendly ones."
"I am sticking to my guns: integrated production is common sense applied to the agriculture of the 21st century."
"in writing. - (DE) The proposed Directive establishing a framework for Community action to achieve a sustainable use of pesticides is important, since alarming quantities of certain pesticides are still being found despite the existing framework regulations on soil, air and water."
"Evidence beyond the existing regulations also gives cause for concern in arable crops and requires a political initiative."
"National action plans with concrete objectives for reducing the risks and dependencies associated with pesticides are crucial here."
"It is extremely regrettable that in plenary we have not followed up the amendment with the objective of reducing alarming toxic and highly toxic substances by 50% by 2013 and reducing the use of pesticides by 20% in the next 10 years."
"This would have been an important political signal even in the given situation."
"The key to the sustainable use of plant protection products is rational risk limitation."
"We should achieve this aim by putting into effect the principles of the Directive on the sustainable use of pesticides."
"Each country will be obliged to draw up its own plan following the guidelines defined in the Directive."
"Each country should do so taking due account of local determinants and respecting any differences."
"The principal difference between us is the level of agricultural development."
"The countries that are among the new EU Member States often have enormous deficits to make up, especially as regards the quality and health of the foodstuffs produced."
"A reduction in the use of pesticides in these countries compared with their current level of use will backfire on us consumers."
"We also differ in our landscapes."
"In Poland, vast stretches of woodland may only be protected against pests by treatment applied from the air."
"It is our duty to the natural environment to protect the forests, while Parliament's task is to define the principles for the safe use of products that protect the natural environment."
"The Directive has much to say about the education of farmers being the most important way of implementing the sustainable use of pesticides."
"It is parliament's task to Support education and create the conditions whereby it will reach every farmer."
"The Directive's guidelines should encourage both the Member States and farmers, rather than put them off."
"in writing. - (DE) I am voting against the report because there is no longer a clear line between the various amendments, which I consider important."
"Pest management serves people and plant health and is not a warning sign for policy that has no scientific basis."
"(DE) Mr President, I believe we should be striving towards public health and consumer protection and I should like to offer my full support for these positions too."
"There is simply no sense in us introducing impractical solutions and creating situations in which food production is no longer possible with approved funds."
"For this reason I am convinced that the Breyer report cannot endure in this form and that we should amend it in this regard."
"I have voted against it and am of the opinion and am glad that a much more sensible and practical solution has been found in the Klaß report and therefore in the action plans, for which I was the rapporteur in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"For this reason I hope that we are also able to improve the Breyer report considerably at second reading, because we must improve it."
"(SV) A mixed message is being sent today."
"I think the most bizarre part today was Mr Heaton-Harris's attack, which claimed that voluntary groups are trying to influence Parliament."
"The big thing that has happened is that Parliament's position has been weakened as a result of extensive lobbying by lobbyists in the pay of industry, which puts its interest in selling more pesticides ahead of protecting public health and consumers."
"Fortunately they have not been entirely successful."
"We still have the pesticide passport, which gives consumers a reasonable opportunity to see what they are swallowing by asking their dealers."
"This protection is important and we must fight for it when we negotiate with the Council."
"However, Parliament did not protect residents as the Environment Committee wanted."
"They have worse protection and receive worse information than the committee wanted."
"This must be rectified in other readings."
"In my view we cannot continue authorising the most dangerous chemicals at the present level."
"Parliament has now avoided general reduction targets for all pesticides, which is unfortunate."
"However, I would like to say that we in the Green Group have now got through a report which can essentially be used for good negotiations with the Council, but there the name becomes a little silly."
"Just like calling the constitution a reform treaty, it is remarkable that Parliament is dubbing pesticides plant protection products."
"If all plant protection products were concerned, we could just as easily include fences in the legislation because they offer protection against roe deer."
"This shows how absurd plant protection products is as a name."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of the report by Mrs Breyer on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market as it will help to ensure high safety standards for humans, animals and the environment by establishing strict but simplified procedures, and by rationalising resources."
"The adopted report abides by the principle of subsidiarity, so that Member States can take account of specific national conditions, especially plant health and climate conditions, and appropriate risk-reduction measures can be adopted."
"in writing. - (PT) This proposal should be in line with the reasons behind the 6th Environment Action Programme with the aim of applying current knowledge of prospective and retrospective strategies for assessing the risks and dangers to humans and the environment and to create coherency with other policies."
"Thus, also in line with the Thematic Strategy for the Sustainable Use of Pesticides, the Regulation must guarantee a high level of protection for human health and the environment, giving precedence to the precautionary principle, but the measures must be proportionate and take account of the principle of subsidiarity."
"Links to other policies should be brought out more clearly."
"For instance, the regulation should not run counter to the aims and quality standards of the Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC) and its daughter directives."
"This must be ensured by regular checks."
"Each Member State should retain the option of going beyond the Community standard in its fundamental standard of protection or of making decisions in product licensing in order to implement established objectives of national pesticide action plans, health programmes or environmental protection measures, based on specific national conditions."
"in writing. - I voted for this report and am pleased that it combines the sustainable use of pesticides with effective health and environmental protection."
"in writing. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, despite voting in favour of the Breyer report as a whole, I considered it expedient to support a few amendments designed to modify the original draft."
"It is essential that we break up the monopoly of large multinationals in the field of data sharing and access, and open up the sector to increased and fairer competition."
"On the other hand, this sector is affected by geographical and environmental differences, which must be given due consideration."
"What we need is greater flexibility in terms of mutual recognition and comparative evaluation of substances."
"Currently in fact, small and medium-sized enterprises, which mainly produce co-formulants, are denied room for manoeuvre precisely because of the excessive power of the major industrial groups - and not just in data management and exchange either."
"European legislation must absolutely take into account and support their requests to prevent their slow but inexorable disappearance from the market."
"in writing. - (FR) Historically used to protect plants against various parasites, pesticides have transformed agriculture considerably."
"Nevertheless, today we are seeing that the massive use of these pesticides in agricultural and non-agricultural environments has a damaging effect on the environment (pollution of water, air, soil, etc.) and also on health (development of some cancers, fertility problems)."
"In view of this, the EU has decided to modify its legislation with a view to encouraging a reduction in the use of pesticides."
"Within the framework particularly of the Breyer report concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market and the sustainable use of pesticides, I voted in favour of setting up strict criteria for all toxic substances (neurotoxic, bioaccumulative, carcinogenic, etc.)"
"Similarly, out of consistency with France's National Pesticide Plan and REACH, I also supported a 50% reduction by 2013 in the use of extremely worrying pesticides and the replacement of the most dangerous substances with safer substitutes (including non-chemical products)."
"Finally, in conformity with the spirit of the national debate in France on the environment, I voted in favour of a tax on pesticides to encourage our farmers to reduce their use of treatment products."
"in writing. - (DE) Yesterday I was not able to make use of my speaking time."
"The vote in the Committee on Climate Change on the Hassi report, which forms the basis for the European Parliament's position for the UN Climate Change Conference, was taking place at the same time."
"The European Union's new policy on the use of pesticides is an important step towards better health and environmental protection."
"Of particular importance in the result of today's vote is Parliament's clear position against the three-zone model proposed by the Commission."
"The proposed system is misleading and would grossly contradict the aim of the sustainable use of pesticides."
"in writing. - (DE) I am voting against the report because it has not been drawn up according to strictly scientific criteria and because I regard the zone model - in whatever version - as meaningless."
"Only single authorisation makes sense in a common economic area."
"I am hoping for a considerable improvement at second reading."
"in writing. - There is no doubt that, despite current legislation to reduce pesticides, excessive amounts of pesticides exist in our air, water and food supply, affecting our health and the environment."
"Today however, while my colleagues and I voted clearly for a reduction in pesticides in our day-to-day lives, it is important that we acknowledge the practical reality of the needs of farmers and fruitgrowers, particularly in this climate of rising food prices."
"We cannot legislate in the abstract!"
"I have voted for a practical and balanced approach and voted against extreme amendments that would reduce our food supply, making farming ridiculously burdensome and impractical."
"Let us not forget that farmers are environmentalists by nature!"
"Instead of a pesticide ban, the Member States will look at training and information campaigns and Best Practice and Integrated Pest Management which will benefit us as citizens, consumers and farmers."
"I have voted in favour of realistic targets for Member States while acknowledging the diverse nature of 27 Member States. With regard to use, risk has to be the central factor, taking hazard and exposure into consideration."
"in writing. - (FR) As regards the reports on the placing of plant protection products on the market and the sustainable use of pesticides, I followed the very responsible line of my political group."
"Products classified CMR1, which are scientifically proven to harm human and animal health, should no longer be authorised."
"The obligation to inform all neighbours before spraying would only cause mass hysteria, leaving aside the fact that it would bring with it an enormous amount of counterproductive bureaucracy, which becomes obsolete anyway with the removal of CMR1 products from the market."
"I am of the opinion that the principle of subsidiarity should be used regarding buffer zones not to be treated, to prevent additional constraints being applied to agricultural production."
"I am against the creation of a special tax on authorised products because this will lead to a completely unnecessary increase in the cost of agricultural production."
"I am of course against the ban on spreading plant protection products by helicopter."
"It is unacceptable to ban this method which is the only viable method in certain regions where, for instance, vines are grown on hillsides."
"I am delighted that my amendments relating to the unacceptable effects of plant protection products that could, among other things, have a negative impact on the behaviour of certain species such as bees and that could even lead to the extinction of these species, have been taken into consideration."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the Klaß and Breyer reports on the use of pesticides because they signal progress towards better consideration of the impact on the environment and health of the use of plant protection products."
"In particular I welcome the adoption of the socialist proposal to prohibit the use of pesticides in residential or sensitive areas."
"I am also delighted by the adoption of our proposals on the systematic promotion of non-chemical techniques."
"However, I am sorry that the European right has opposed the introduction of targets for reducing the use of these products."
"There are many examples demonstrating that reduction is possible, and a gradual reduction strategy could have been introduced without endangering the industry and jobs."
"Once again, the right has given preference to profits..."
"However, small steps count, and these reports are a step in the right direction towards the sustainable agriculture of tomorrow and a healthier environment for our children."

"2008 draft general budget: Section III - 2008 draft general budget: Sections I, II, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII and IX (debate)"
"Before I hand over to Commissioner Grybauskaitė, I should like to express my amazement that other Commissioners, whom we have asked to be here, are not present."
"There are various reasons: ostensibly our invitations have gone out somewhat too late."
"This may be the case and I shall check."
"I should like to remind the Commission, however, that by Interinstitutional Agreement it has to be present during the week the European Parliament is in session."
"I shall check the matter and I expect that both the Commission and we as Parliament, of course, will honour our commitments under the interinstitutional agreement."
"I would therefore ask the Commissioner present, Commissioner Grybauskaitė, to convey this to the Commission."
"I have already said as much, incidentally, at the Conference of Presidents."
"I do not wish, however, to make any one-sided accusations here, but I shall be checking the matter."
"rapporteur. - (FI) Mr President, first I wish to thank the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets and the Committee's members and coordinators for making it possible for us to reach an excellent compromise in a very positive atmosphere."
"Parliament's Secretary-General was also very open and cooperative when the budget was being drafted."
"It is a good start to future cooperation between the administration and the Committee on Budgets."
"First of all I want to say that this system of two organisations deciding on the budget - the Bureau and the Committee on Budgets - cannot continue in the future."
"It is not the right approach to have the Bureau developing various new ideas and new projects."
"The Committee on Budgets is either a kind of rubber stamp approving the funds, or it is a bad boy or girl who cuts them out."
"That was the case here too, when there were major new increases proposed by the group chairmen, which would have gone over the famous 20% ceiling which has been jointly agreed."
"I do hope that people will listen to the Committee Chairman's guidelines on this, because he has the right idea about how this process should be gone about in the proper way, in order to achieve concrete and fitting results."
"These matters cannot be decided in two places."
"It is much better if they are decided in just one."
"When Parliament's budget was being drawn up, the administration and the Bureau showed the right initiative in proposing that remaining under the 20% ceiling should be a basic principle."
"Afterwards, the group chairmen made additions to the policy rules."
"One was that each Member's assistants should receive a thousand euros more a month, making around EUR 10 000 000 in all, and there were various other increases, when in fact we had got into a situation where extra expenditure had to be cut to some extent."
"This is obviously never easy, but it needs to be said that we have not made any real savings or cuts; instead, we just tried to adhere to budgetary discipline when it came to new increases, so that the budget would not grow too large."
"This is obviously important because we are spending taxpayers' money."
"We should think about what projects we should engage in and which of them are acceptable, from the taxpayer's point of view."
"Above all, we need to concentrate on the essential work which we have been elected to do here."
"This is a legislative body, and so we should not be implementing projects that lie outside the scope of actual legislative work."
"Let me say, however, that I happy with the joint compromise allowing Parliament an increase of just under 4%."
"That is reasonable, and in any case includes many projects which other Members here are in favour of."
"I will mention some of these projects."
"First, there is information policy, which is extremely important."
"For this, an additional EUR nine million has been added to the reserve, to be spent on the new Web TV when the prototype has been approved."
"This Web TV idea as a technical information channel is an acceptable notion, but it should not be put into effect in the way that is now being suggested."
"The political groups and the Members are not to take part in monitoring the body concerned or in the everyday work involved."
"The administration does not have the same sort of political honesty that people want to see as the political groups and the Members do."
"I have found it very hard to appreciate the idea which has been proposed by the left that politics should be expunged from policy and that information on Parliament can come only via its administration, and not through its Members or political groups."
"It is inconceivable to allow information policy to come only via the administration, and it leaves us, who have been elected to this place democratically, outside the information machinery."
"Another idea connected with this subject was that concerning the local media, which was decided in plenary just before the holidays."
"It was that Members should get a bit more money for inviting representatives of the local media to observe what is happening in Parliament and to interview them."
"The Committee on Budgets voted against this."
"I do not understand this apparent animosity towards the small local media coming from the left, as it allows us to get as close as we can to ordinary people."
"Now we in the Committee on Budgets, however, have voted against this money by a majority, and we Members cannot spend any more money on inviting the local media here."
"Thirdly, I would like to mention the Information Offices."
"Each Member State has its own Information Office, which is a good thing, but why buy the most expensive buildings in the most expensive areas?"
"Why could we not buy slightly cheaper buildings a bit further out of town and spend the relevant funds on human resources?"
"We need more people to visit places of work, places of study and schools to tell people what Parliament does and why."
"That is the best way to influence people, to go to them, and not buy costly buildings."
"This money could be better spent."
"As for the policy on buildings generally, I hope that all the institutions can together establish a common organisation to consider when and where to build and when and where to purchase property, so that we do not make decisions without knowing what others are doing and artificially raise property prices."
"I just want to comment on the resolution on the proposal to reduce the number of sittings in Strasbourg."
"This might be something of an eternal debate, but it has to go on until something gets done."
"We also have to set an example in the reduction of emissions."
"We cannot squander EUR 200 million of taxpayers' money a year."
"We must show the public that the EU has enlarged and changed, and for this we have to change."
"I have not come across one good explanation as to why this hassle has to continue."
"For that reason, I hope that we will have a vote on the subject so that Parliament can negotiate with the Council and so that the much needed change can take place."
"Once again I want to thank the coordinators and members of the Committee on Budgets for the compromise, and I hope that it will be preserved in the vote here on Thursday and that the figures concerned will remain just as we have jointly agreed."
"rapporteur. - (FI) Mr President, Commissioner, the European Union budget for 2008 is the second in this programming period."
"When the current financial framework was adopted, special priority was given to strengthening competitiveness and cohesion for growth and employment."
"The Commission's preliminary draft budget was EUR 129.2 billion for commitment appropriations and EUR 121 billion for payment appropriations."
"The Council in its draft budget cut commitment appropriations to EUR 128.4 billion and payment appropriations to EUR 119.4 billion, that is to say EUR 10.3 billion under an already very tight financial framework."
"The Council's draft budget also highlighted other questions."
"Under heading 1 (sustainable growth and employment), payment appropriations were cut by a full EUR 1 046 million, although it was an unconditional priority of budget policy."
"This autumn, Parliament also received the Commission's letter of amendment proposing an additional EUR 262 million for external actions."
"Furthermore, the Commission also proposed a review of the financial framework so that adequate funds could be set aside for the Galileo global positioning system and the European Institute of Innovation and Technology for the period 2008-2013."
"The proposal was consistent with Parliament's resolution adopted on 20 June and the first reading on the EIT legislation."
"Based on these criteria, the Committee on Budgets drafted its own proposal, which is now under discussion."
"Its key elements are as follows:"
"The budget's unconditional priority is heading 1 (sustainable growth and employment)."
"Commitment appropriations have been increased, in particular for research and training under the Lisbon Strategy and for the Trans-European Networks."
"Heading 1a also relates to funding for the Galileo navigation system."
"When the multiannual financial framework was being drawn up, Parliament warned that Galileo was under-funded."
"Now it has a deficit of EUR 2.4 billion euros, because private industry is unwilling to get involved in the project, as has happened in the United States of America."
"Because the project is politically and economically important for Europe, Parliament insisted that it should go ahead and that it should be financed out of the EU budget."
"A decision on this needs to be taken during this budgetary procedure."
"For this reason, the draft budget had Galileo and its associated EIT appropriations outside the scope of the budget, in the form of a 'satellite change' proposal."
"A condition of its adoption is that the Commission proposal for amending the multiannual financial framework be adopted."
"If that does not happen, the Galileo project will fail and EIT funding will also be in difficulties."
"It is pointless continuing to finance Galileo if the Council does not have the genuine will to see it through to the end."
"The Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund appropriations under heading 1b have been substantially strengthened, as the unpaid commitments under the funds - the RALs - are alarmingly high, at more than EUR 95 billion."
"Back in the summer, Parliament and the Council made a joint declaration regarding the Commission's slowness to approve functional programmes."
"At present, 63% of the programmes under the Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund remain unapproved, as do 83% of European Social Fund programmes and 75% of rural development programmes, even though the first programme year is already coming to an end."
"The slowness of this administration seriously threatens the EU's structural and cohesion policy and, in particular, the reconstruction of the new Member States, as the current financial framework is a massive European reconstruction project, bigger than the Marshall Plan after the Second World War."
"In this draft budget, however, just EUR 22.1 billion and EUR 5.3 billion have been set aside for structural measures and rural development respectively for the new Member States."
"Accordingly, the Committee on Budgets is proposing that a portion of the Commission's relevant administrative costs should be placed in reserve, to be released as and when programmes are approved, because this process needs speeding up."
"Another huge problem area relates to heading 4 (EU as a global partner)."
"The preliminary draft budget was clearly inadequate, owing to which the Commission in its letter of amendment proposed EUR 120 million for Kosovo and EUR 142 million for Palestine."
"The Council also proposed increases of EUR 260 million for the same regions."
"The Committee on Budgets adopted the Commission's approach, but added a further EUR 10 million for both Kosovo and Palestine."
"To defend Parliament's own priorities, the Committee also drafted an 'asterisk' amendment."
"It agrees a cut of EUR 40 million, which otherwise would have to be made in the Common Foreign and Security Policy, as the increase the Council proposed is an obvious area of interest for them and would jeopardise Parliament's priorities."
"The asterisk proposal also incorporates the increases called for by the Committee on Foreign Affairs for Palestine and Kosovo, a total of EUR 40 million, plus a smaller adjustment of EUR 7 million for the Global Health Fund and certain other lines."
"This amendment can be adopted if the Council agrees to use the flexibility instrument."
"Concerning the decentralised agencies, may I say that the Committee restored the EUR 32 million in cuts made by the Council and the personnel cuts."
"We thought that cooperation went relatively well."
"The most substantial change related to the border control agency, Frontex, appropriations for which were increased by EUR 30 million."
"Cooperation in the field of border control and strengthening it is one of Parliament's key priorities."
"The theme of this budget is 'a budget for results'."
"It aims to promote both activity-based budgeting and activity-based management."
"To this end, EUR 49 million of the Commission's general administrative costs has been placed in reserve, to be released as and when the Commission makes proposals for studies and reports, as requested by Parliament, on the development of activity-based management, the clarification of staff accountability, and the future trend in staff numbers."
"This also has to do with the declaration on executive agencies adopted in Parliament's conciliation meeting."
"It states that each new proposal must contain a cost-benefit analysis compared with the situation where the measures would be the Commission's responsibility."
"In addition, lines of accountability and responsibility in respect of the agency and the Commission should be clearly set out, and there must be an explanation of how the Commission is to take responsibility for the work of the agency and the use of funds."
"We know the warning examples from history of the 'Technical Assistance Offices'."
"The sum total for the draft budget before us is EUR 129 680 billion, which is EUR 623 million under the multiannual financial framework."
"Payment appropriations are EUR 124 194, which is the equivalent of 0.99% of the Member States' GNI."
"The figure is EUR 5 300 million under the financial framework, and so the Committee on Budgets has shown great discipline in drawing up this proposal for deliberation by the European Parliament."
"The draft budget was prepared in a spirit of strong consensus and excellent cooperation."
"I would like to thank the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Reimer Böge, for his excellent leadership, and the coordinators and shadow rapporteurs from all the political groups."
"They have shown considerable flexibility and an ability to cooperate."
"I also want to thank the Commission, and, in particular, Commissioner Grybauskaite, for showing a positive attitude, and also the Portuguese Presidency, which in tripartite negotiations and conciliation demonstrated a constructive attitude and deference."
"Finally, I want to express my appreciation and gratitude to the Committee on Budget's secretariat and the administrators responsible for the budget in my own group and the other political groups for the enormous amount of work they have done."
"I now submit the 2008 budget for deliberation by the plenary session."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, let me start by thanking Mr Virrankoski for an excellent report and for the substantial amount of work he has done on it."
"He rightly says that 2008 is year two in a seven-year financial perspective."
"It is my belief that this budget is moving in the right direction to offer value for money and with payment appropriations this year set at 0.99% GNI, it has the potential to achieve far better implementation in the coming years."
"However, in order to achieve these goals, I call on the Council, in particular, to take note of Parliament's views and to be prepared to discuss some of the issues further, and I mention four issues at this point."
"Firstly, Galileo and the European Institute of Technology (EIT): Parliament has given its approval to these schemes, but we still need evidence of budgetary discipline from the other institutions, and I make here three points."
"Firstly, I see insufficient evidence of provision for cost over-runs and late delivery of the projects. Secondly, I see insufficient evidence of very clear lines of accountability and responsibility with these major items, particularly where contracts for work on the projects are being awarded."
"Finally, I believe that the Commission should do far more to share its vision for the Galileo project and particularly the post-development phase of the project and the on-going situation."
"Secondly, under Heading 4, we already know that demand for funding for Palestine and Kosovo will extend the margin under this heading quite considerably."
"This in part has been met by a reduction in funding for the CFSP."
"But that will inevitably create problems during the next year and I think that some time after Parliament's first reading we will need to have discussions with the Council and the Commission to see how we can address that situation."
"Thirdly, I call on the Council to support Parliament's efforts to oblige the Commission to comply with the screening exercise and to achieve greater efficiency in staffing levels."
"This includes the decentralised and external agencies, where I fear there is need for far greater levels of accountability."
"Finally, it is most important that both the Council and the Commission attach far greater urgency to the achievement of a positive déclaration d'assurance from the Court of Auditors."
"In my view, their current rate of progress is unacceptably slow and, in consequence of this, the credibility of this House is seriously undermined."
"I therefore call on the Council, in particular, to show far greater urgency to address this situation."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, first of all I would like to thank the whole of the budget team for the work they have done, especially our two rapporteurs, Mr Virrankoski and Mr Itälä."
"This budget procedure confirms the narrowness of the multiannual financial framework."
"The amount of payments, at less than EUR 130 billion, or 0.99% of GDP, is very skimpy and cannot support hopes for the development of European policy."
"The teamwork in the Committee on Budgets means that the budgetary priorities of the political groups can be maintained, but the financial framework prevents the revival of the growth policies promised to European citizens."
"Our committee took particular care over the choices made by all the parliamentary committees, but the proliferation of pilot projects is evidence of the frustration with the niggardly nature of this financial framework."
"Once again, we have had to fight drastic cuts by the Council and I am happy with the compromise secured."
"The Commission still needs to execute this budget correctly."
"We will no longer put up with this draft budget being denatured through failures to execute and transfers of appropriations back to the Member States."
"Firstly, in the 2008 budget, we do not accept the failure to use the cohesion funds."
"In the Socialist Party, we have restored the Council's dreadful cuts that affected programmes such as Culture 2007, Media 2007 and Youth in Action."
"I do not need to remind you here of the importance of these lines as the new Treaty is being put to the people of Europe."
"I invite the Council to think about this; for example, giving research or Frontex the resources they need to operate, and improving the lines of information correspond to the current concerns of European citizens."
"We are also proposing additional appropriations for certain new projects to improve the capacity to accommodate refugees or for NGOs fighting discrimination."
"The European budget absolutely must continue to help those fighting the scourges afflicting European society."
"For the EU's external relations, we are reducing the expenditure of the CFSP by 40 million because we have to honour our commitments and the EU's commitments: to preserve the emergency aid reserve, help the most disadvantaged countries, support the Global Fund to fight AIDS, the World Health Fund and maintain development aid."
"For Kosovo and Palestine, the flexibility instrument will need to be mobilised to provide EUR 87 million."
"It is still to be deplored that heading 4 is systematically underfunded."
"World poverty is growing and our budget is shrinking."
"For the European Commission, I recognise that the reserve of EUR 40 million is harsh but it reflects our doubts over the effectiveness of implementing ABM."
"Allow me to give you a few examples: first of all, the failure to spend the cohesion funds, the impossibility of executing the pilot projects we hold dear, such as the Erasmus-style programme for apprentices, the lack of transparency in the choices of research firms, the poor implementation of selection competitions for new officials."
"The list is long and Parliament is asking to be convinced of the goodwill of the European executive."
"Finally, the main one, the asterisk amendment demands that Galileo and the EIT are funded beyond the ceilings of the financial perspective."
"This necessitates, forces even, a mini-revision of the financial perspective."
"Parliament cannot accept the endangering of Galileo, a major challenge from a technological, economic and political point of view, and an essential strategic tool for the political powers and independence of the EU, but I am convinced of the value of Mrs Merkel's comments in our chamber."
"On 29 June, Chancellor Merkel used this African proverb to close her Presidency: 'If you want to go quickly, go alone, but if you want to go far, go together.'"
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DA) Mr President, I would like to thank the President of the European Parliament for personally chairing this sitting and these proceedings, and for the fact that it is not taking place at midnight."
"I am very pleased about that."
"Commissioner, there is no doubt that the 2008 budget proceedings will be quite challenging."
"However, in Parliament we stand together, and when we vote on Thursday I am fairly convinced that there will be broad support for the strategy, the Committee on Budgets and the draftsman that Mr Virrankoski has selected for the Commission budget."
"The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe supports the Commission's excellent proposals for the funding of the Galileo satellite surveillance system."
"We are in favour of surplus money from agricultural schemes being used for this project instead of being returned to the Member States."
"It would not be reasonable to reduce the funding for research and transport in order to find money for Galileo, as is being proposed by the EU Finance Ministers."
"If the EU Member States agree that we are to have Galileo, they must also provide the funding for it without using it for other purposes."
"As has already been mentioned by Mr Virrankoski, we have previously been warned that Galileo has not been allocated sufficient money; the situation that we are now facing therefore does not come as a surprise."
"The other significant controversial matter as regards the Council concerns the funds for foreign affairs policy."
"We are all extremely worried about whether enough money has been allocated to Kosovo and Palestine as well."
"I would like to thank Mr Virrankoski for his extensive efforts to find a compromise that enjoys broad support."
"With regard to the agencies, we are satisfied that the border monitoring agency Frontex is receiving more funding, and we hope that a solution can be found to enable the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) to get started as quickly as possible with the LRIT Data Centre, which will be established by the end of 2008."
"The rapporteur for the other institutions, Mr Itälä, has had both an achievable task and a very difficult one."
"The difficult task was the Parliament budget, where it was unfortunately not possible to bring the expenses down to this year's level plus inflation. However, in spite of this, it has been possible to keep the expenses below the 20% ceiling."
"The ALDE Group supported the original compromise between the rapporteur and the Bureau, and it is regrettable that poor coordination between the chairs of the larger groups meant that the compromise had to be reworked."
"We should not see this happen again; we can do better."
"However, I am not chastising Mr Itälä."
"He has made a good contribution, and I would also like to thank him for finding a reasonable solution for the Committee of the Regions, which has been subject to very severe cutbacks by the Council."
"Mr President, on behalf of the UEN Group I would like to express my sincere thanks to the rapporteurs, Mr Virrankoski and Mr Itälä, and to all members of the Committee on Budgets for their efforts in drawing up the budget and their excellent cooperation."
"Many thanks."
"Does the second budget in the current budget perspective differ significantly from its predecessors, apart from in the size of the sums concerned?"
"As ever, we have to continue the funding of expenditure from previous years, and we can change only parts of the budget."
"Such significant items are the funding of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology and the Galileo project."
"There is also increased funding for Palestine and Kosovo."
"Significant changes are also to be found in the funding of the common agricultural policy and specialist agencies."
"Are we making a big mistake in loosely matching sums to later expenditure?"
"Is it feasible to do this one year in advance?"
"We try, but we always have the opportunity to adjust the budget, and this is very important."
"Perhaps in future we should create more items, as that will add significant elasticity to the budget."
"Finally, I would like once again to express my sincere thanks to Mr Virrankoski."
"Despite the very difficult area concerned, it was a great pleasure to work with him."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by stating that we have a general problem with the existing financial perspective because, from the point of view of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, the budget we have until 2013 is not really adequate for the major challenges that Europe and the current 27 Member States are facing."
"I should like to state that I see within the Council a lack of European spirit where budgeting and finances are concerned."
"I think we need, as we have already declared with the Lisbon Strategy, a genuine high-tech offensive for Europe, if we really want to build the path towards the knowledge-based society."
"We are unfortunately running way behind on this."
"I also believe that we have to do even more for research and development as well as for lifelong learning if we want to make Europe's citizens properly fit and give them the skills to cope with globalisation."
"We also have to create - and as all the polls show, the citizens of Europe are demanding this of us - a responsible foreign policy."
"If, however, we want to invest more in crisis prevention and responsible action in hot spots around the world, we need appropriate resources, which we currently do not have to an adequate degree."
"In relation to climate change policy, I also think that we have to show the world that well-understood climate change policy and selective growth go hand in hand."
"Europe must take a major step forward here, as it is only by persuading other continents and large countries like China and India and the United States that we can draw up policy on climate change and create new jobs that we shall also win over the hearts of our citizens."
"On the other hand, I think that we can, of course, economise on the European budget, on agricultural export subsidies, for example, as well as in the cultivation of tobacco and also on the costs of our meetings here in Strasbourg."
"We can see that the budget is not adequate for our major, ambitious science projects like Galileo, the satellite navigation system."
"Many previous speakers have already said so."
"If we think this is politically correct, however, the Council must stir itself here, otherwise we shall lose contact with the United States, as well as with China and India."
"With regard to the European Institute of Innovation and Technology, if we really want to show that Europe is a continent that genuinely values knowledge and wants to be a knowledge-based society, the Council will also have to do more here."
"A common European will is required here, if we are to promote Europe."
"In conclusion, I should like to thank all my fellow Members who have been collaborating on this budget."
"It is only a compromise, but a good compromise, at least on Parliament's side, and one we shall be defending."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FI) Mr President, Commissioner, there is probably a wide spectrum of opinion in all the groups."
"Some are happy with the Council's strict budget policy, while other Members feel it is a barrier to achieving all that is good and fine."
"The fact is that the Council's proposal for the budget total is incredibly low compared with combined national income and that Parliament's proposal also represents an exceptionally low level of budgetary expenditure."
"Our group is unhappy with the way the draft budget raises the Union's military profile."
"Militarisation of the Union is also one of the reasons why our group cannot support the new constitution proposal agreed last week."
"The constitution, like next year's draft budget, will do nothing to strengthen the Union's social dimension."
"We are used to the idea that the Commission never fully implements the EU budget, and the Member States are used to the idea that they will have their own resources, as they are known, returned to them every year."
"That will be due to the RALs resulting from delayed programmes under the Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund this year and next."
"The rapporteur, Mr Virrankoski, is speeding up the approval procedure for these programmes with good reason."
"It is our group's view that it is right to amend interinstitutional agreements with regard to new expenditure for Galileo and the European Institute of Technology."
"There is not enough money in the budgetary framework; instead, the membership will have to bring new money to the Union for them."
"In this House, Parliament's Bureau is not as disciplined in its budget targets as the Committee on Budgets."
"It is always trying to spend 20% of the EU's administrative costs even if there is nowhere the money can justifiably be spent."
"Such projects include the memorial to Mr Pöttering, a museum dedicated to the EU's short history, or converting Parliament's parking area into a spa and baths."
"At the same time, the Social Democrats, Liberals and Greens voted in the Committee on Budgets on the indulgent supervision of the party support funds of the Europarties and now also of the Euro-foundations financed out of Parliament's budget."
"There was no clause stating that the use of funds should be overseen in accordance with the best practices of EU budgetary control."
"My compatriots Mr Virrankoski and Mr Ville Itälä have tried, in their role as rapporteurs, to achieve a balanced outcome."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (SV) Thank you Mr President."
"The honourable Members Mr Virrankoski and Mr Itälä have dealt with the budgetary matters very competently."
"I have great respect for their work, within the given terms of reference."
"But that is the problem: they are forced to work within the given terms of reference."
"The EU's budgetary process is profoundly outmoded and therefore beneath contempt."
"The basic principle is always this: more money is coming in, so what are we going to invest it in?"
"This is a 50-year-old organisation, which for that reason should focus on zero budgeting."
"We must ask the following question: if we were starting today (and not 50 years ago), what would we invest our budgetary resources in?"
"Would we invest them in creating the Economic and Social Committee or the Committee of the Regions?"
"Would we invest nearly half in a protectionist agricultural policy, in PR and marketing for products that could not otherwise be sold?"
"Would we invest in subsidies for tobacco production, for producing tobacco that cannot be sold in the normal way, at the same time as we are by and large banning smoking in the EU?"
"Would we invest in Structural Funds which take almost all the remainder of the entire budget, thereby deciding that countries can receive money centrally from the EU budget provided it goes to a certain kind of regional policy?"
"The answer is - as I am convinced everyone sitting here in the building (which is not many) would say - no, we would not do that."
"The question is then: how can we approach the issue?"
"Well, we cannot do it if we are not prepared to look at the fundamental budgetary issues from scratch and then to work from there."
"We are therefore in completely the wrong place."
"If we conduct a normal economic analysis and consider what should be done with budget funds at EU level that are spent through Brussels, it is allocating money that the Member States would not otherwise be able to invest, for example in basic research."
"We all know from economic theory that basic research is completely underfunded on the market."
"There are always freeloaders there."
"It is assumed that someone else will pay the costs of basic research and when it is all completed, it is available to us all."
"There are many such areas and an incredibly small amount of money goes there."
"We talk about it, but we do nothing."
"In most cases money goes to what was decided 30-50 years ago."
"That is scandalous."
"We also have an EU that is buying buildings around Europe in the belief that it is cheaper."
"That is an irresponsible way to act, speculating with taxpayers' money."
"It should not continue."
"We must initiate a discussion on what the EU should do with the money we receive."
"What we are doing right perhaps takes 10-15% of all the funds."
"The rest goes to preposterous things, and to different kinds of PR work, such as the money for adaptation to globalisation."
"Individual states that compete with one another to find good institutional solutions are what created Europe and its success. Let us keep that."
"Thank you very much."
"(DE) Mr President, anyone who was in the Committee on Budgets will know how difficult it always is in the autumn to release very much money at all."
"It is usually tucked away under the reserve information services budget headings."
"There is, of course, an attempt to be active and therefore to do something."
"Here I would address you directly, Mr President."
"The LUX film award has been set up."
"The conditions were that the films would be viewed by 18 October of this year and only those Members who had seen all three films could and should vote under this budget item initiative."
"I have just looked at the list."
"There are not even a dozen Members who will be making the decision tomorrow on which Tower of Babel they will give to whom."
"I should like to ask you, Mr President, to be honest enough not to deceive us tomorrow, but to tell us how many Members have in fact legitimately taken part in this vote."
"Please ensure that the Minutes are not tampered with outside at the last minute, because the deadline for watching the films, the viewing deadline, was 18 October."
"This relatively small problem on the scale of budgets, Mr President, can be carried over to so many other areas."
"We are constantly throwing money around here without thinking about it because we have too much money and therefore even good ideas such as the film award are being knocked down."
"However, please be honest at least tomorrow, Mr President!"
"These remarks are not worthy of a reply."
"I would like to start by saying that it is a great pleasure to speak to you today, before the important vote, just after first reading."
"I wish to thank the chairman, Mr Böge, the main rapporteur, Mr Virrankoski, as well as the coordinators of all the political groups for their most successful, coordinated and positive work to achieve consensus in the Committee on Budgets at first reading."
"All the lines proposed by the Commission were reinstated - many thanks for that."
"For the establishment of practically all PDB lines, I would like to express my thanks to Parliament."
"I repeat this in English, in case of an inexact interpretation, because that is the most important part of my speech."
"At the same time, I would also like to say that, no matter how satisfied we are and our cooperation is, we still have some comments to make and say that still, in most cases, Parliament made reserves."
"This is something we tackled last year, and the Commission was capable of tackling last year, and we will try to do our best to ensure that all conditions are met by the Commission, providing all the information necessary for you to be able to release the reserves before second reading."
"I would like especially to mention the pilot projects, where, this year, Parliament took the initiative and practically used an enlarged number of new pilot projects and preparatory actions, which you propose."
"As usual, we will look carefully at each case and will present our opinion at the beginning of November through the so-called 'executability letter', which will come in time, well before conciliation and the second reading."
"On executive agencies, which are the very large, enlightening item on our budgetary procedure this year, I would like also to stress the constructive framework set by the July conciliation between us and the overall issue of agencies."
"I would like also to thank Parliament, in particular Ms Haug, for her cooperation, especially in finalising the revision of working arrangements for executive agencies which we agreed recently."
"The Commission will do its best to ensure, as an honest broker between the two budgetary authorities, and will try to have the best and balanced result between all of us for finding the budget, especially knowing and bearing in mind that we still have large problems to solve together, such as Galileo and the EIT, which is on the table after our proposal pending, mainly, the decision of the Council."
"We are satisfied at how Parliament tackled this question in the proposal and at first reading."
"So I hope that altogether - all three of us - we will be able to conclude the budgetary procedure successfully and on time."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. - (DE) Mr President, the financial ceiling for heading 4 is EUR 7.002 billion according to the multi-annual financial framework."
"The Council increased the Commission's 2008 preliminary draft budget of EUR 6.672 billion to EUR 6.89 billion, mainly by adding additional amounts for Palestine and Kosovo."
"Parliament pointed out at an early stage that these funds could not be adequate because challenges that could already be foreseen had not been taken into account."
"Now we hear from the Council that much higher amounts are required, particularly in the area of security policy."
"Unfortunately, we are still not aware of any concrete proposals."
"We must, however, come to an agreement with the Council as regards CFSP."
"Let us therefore negotiate openly and honestly on the actual needs for 2008."
"If we have approved some EUR 250 million a year for the CFSP from 2007 to 2013, the shortfall in funding will already be apparent."
"Our costs for security policy are running almost according to the time frame."
"Another important subject is Palestine."
"In 2007 we are spending significantly more than estimated, up to EUR 400 million."
"We also need more money next year than the Commission and the Council have so far estimated."
"We cannot expect Parliament to introduce lower amounts into the budget, however, and to subsequently plunder other policies in the course of the year because there has been no serious planning."
"Nor is there yet any clarity regarding the precise allocation of the tasks relating to Kosovo and the budgetary needs for 2008."
"I know we will first have to wait for the exact mandate here."
"In conclusion, I should like to point to the political dialogue we shortly need to establish."
"The European Parliament has been fighting for this in negotiations on the multi-annual financial framework and to have it anchored in the Interinstitutional Agreement."
"This would be the right forum to tackle major developments in a constructive manner, in good time and on the basis of mutual trust."
"This would be the right context for preparing a review of the new financial instruments."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Development is making an effort to set priorities with its expenditure estimated in the budget."
"We know that development aid, therefore our aid for the poorest people on the planet, is not something that happens by a snap decision and the results appear from nowhere, but there are processes here and we must work continually on these processes."
"We have emphasised that we want to combat poverty."
"This means we have to provide people with an education and ensure that they are healthy so that they are able to develop within their own environment, their own country."
"We have invested a great deal of money in the past to combat malaria, tuberculosis and Aids and we want to help these countries genuinely develop through preventive measures such as, for example, the abolition of small arms, land mines and ABC weapons by setting up a conflict prevention network and cross-border cooperation between the developing countries."
"It should not be the case here, however - and these are my two pleas to the Council and the Commission - that the Council - simply because a new topic appears on the agenda - says quickly: now we are starting to reorganise everything."
"We must help Kosovo and we must help Palestine, and we fully agree on this."
"We have to do this but we should not do it by extracting money from the poorest of the poor and by believing that we could detect something like continuity in this switchyard or that people outside might have the feeling that we are working on helping the poorest of the poor there in a really concentrated manner."
"New money needs to be forthcoming here and I know we are talking about our taxpayers' money, but they have to be told this explicitly."
"If we do this, we shall also be successful."
"The second item is directed at the Commission."
"You know exactly what our priorities are for combating poverty."
"I have just referred to them: provision of health care and basic education so that people are able to earn something themselves at home."
"We have put a great deal of money into the reserve and we shall not release this money until you have made it clear that you have accepted and adopted Parliament's priorities."
"It is not micromanagement that we want to introduce, but we have made a political evaluation, which you have agreed."
"We shall insist on it and implement it so that, as in other cases of foreign policy it, too, becomes reality and we shall therefore avail of our budget rights and opportunities to exert the appropriate pressure on you."
"Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on International Trade. - Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Virrankoski and Mr Itälä for a splendid, yet thankless, job."
"I believe it is important to underline not only the role of Parliament as the Institution with oversight over the budget, but also the role of each individual committee in regard to aspects of the budget directly under their sphere of competencies."
"I think it is very healthy that individual DGs report to the various committees on their expected expenses for a given year."
"There has to be a level of control and there has to be transparency."
"Although the Committee on International Trade does not have a codecision in trade matters - yet - I think it is a very good practice that has developed in which we have a frank and open discussion with DG Trade on budgetary matters and why certain expenses are needed."
"In terms of budgetary lines, I want to emphasise the need to maintain both aid for trade as well as the parliamentary dimension of WTO as important aspects of a trade budget."
"We need to be able to promote European goods in third countries."
"We need to have experts who help our companies to enter foreign markets but, at the same time, we need to help developing countries export to the EU."
"Without trade there is no long-term sustainable development."
"The WTO has been criticised recently for its lack of transparency."
"The parliamentary dimension of world trade talks is an important initiative we should continue to support because it improves dialogue, gives greater legitimacy and allows for greater oversight."
"On a final note, I urge the Commission to make sure that Parliament is informed in due course of any projects of microfinancial assistance so that a proper debate can be held in the relevant committees, and that we as an institution are well aware of beneficiary countries spending EU money."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgetary Control. - (ES) Mr President, Commissioner, the Committee on Budgetary Control has focused its opinion for the 2008 Budget on two fundamental points:"
"The first is compliance with paragraph 44 of the new Interinstitutional Agreement relating to the statement of assurance and the annual certification that has to be sent by every Member State."
"In this amendment we are taking up the conclusions and recommendations of the 2004 and 2005 discharge, which a minority of Member States have already applied, but we believe more should do so."
"We know that the European Commission cannot evaluate the extent to which Member States have complied with this commitment until 15 February."
"However, and perhaps in order to encourage the European Commission to continue with this evaluation without wasting any time, we have introduced a reserve in the Commission's staff costs."
"We are sure that the Commission has as much interest as Parliament does in ensuring that the Member States fully apply paragraph 44 in the area of shared management."
"I am therefore certain that we will reach an agreement on the reserve."
"The second point is transparency."
"We believe that the more detailed budgetary expenditure is, the simpler it will be for the competent budgetary authority to monitor its implementation."
"We have therefore asked for the creation of new budgetary lines in areas of spending that are very sensitive for Parliament, such as agencies, rural development and other categories such as external action, with a view to, I repeat, a very clear commitment from Parliament and from the Committee on Budgetary Control, which was to contribute to maximum transparency, which is what public opinion demands of us."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. - (ES) Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteurs, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has put forward an opinion, which was adopted unanimously - there were no votes against - in which, firstly, we celebrate the advances in appropriations aimed at improving competitiveness for economic growth and employment, and also, especially, those aimed at cohesion for growth and employment within the European Union."
"With regard to the matters that the Committee is responsible for, economic and monetary affairs, the field of enterprise, competition, taxation and customs union, the fight against tax fraud and general fraud in European statistics and, in particular, the chapter on statistics, we do of course welcome the budgetary advances, the budgetary approach, but of course we have also, found inadequacies."
"We would have liked more money, more money used for economic growth, in other words more money for the well-being of citizens, to provide clearer support for monetary union programmes, to provide clearer support for small and medium-sized enterprises as a source of job creation."
"Of course, we all need to be guided by the principles of austerity - this should come first and no one says so more than myself."
"However, this and the current shortcomings in our Union budgets are poles apart."
"We believe that the European Union should really have to make more incisive budgets in terms of stimulating economic growth that will create employment, and for this purpose allocating resources that belong to all the EU countries is absolutely necessary."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs I particularly welcome the fact that the Commission is now willing to spend 44.2%, corresponding to EUR 57 billion of the budget, on growth and employment."
"The increase in the corresponding budget headings by EUR 2.3 billion for 2008 effectively support the Lisbon Strategy."
"I should particularly like to highlight the three pilot projects in the social sector, even though the Committee on Budgets has not approved the funds for this in one instance and has substantially reduced them in a second instance."
"Even the project on the employment situation in health care, which has been reduced somewhat by the Committee on Budgets, is particularly close to my heart, because there have been considerable problems here since the EU enlargements in 2004 and 2007."
"The pilot project should therefore be carried out as we have devised it."
"This applies particularly in regard to possible regulations for social services."
"The same also applies to another project we have proposed, namely the social integration of migrants."
"Please therefore support the amendments we have re-inserted."
"I should also like to promote once again the family project to be carried out by the foundation in Dublin, which we would like to support to the tune of EUR 400 000, but which the Committee on Budgets has entirely rejected."
"Family-friendly jobs, the improvement in the housing situation for families and continuing family support are also prime objectives for us in Europe."
"The treatment of these subjects should therefore be incorporated into the work schedule of the foundation in Dublin and the necessary funding made available, of course."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has restored the budget figures reduced in its sector by the Council to the amounts stated in the Commission's preliminary draft budget."
"This means a 10.3% budget increase for the environmental sector compared with the 2007 budget year."
"We believe this is also entirely appropriate for the most important instruments in the environmental sector."
"The EMEA, EEA, EFSA and ECDC - these are the abbreviations for our agencies, with whose work we are entirely satisfied - have also recovered their money."
"Life+ is agreed, work is beginning and the new health action plan is also replacing the old one from January 2008."
"So far, so good - all of it!"
"We shall certainly be able to make an evaluation at the end of the year or in early 2009."
"The HELP programme is giving us cause for concern, however."
"We know how harmful tobacco consumption is."
"However, we also want the European public to hear and understand this message."
"2008 is the last budget year in which we shall be receiving money for this anti-smoking campaign from the tobacco fund."
"We are asking the Commission to think very quickly about where the money for this campaign can come from in subsequent years."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me first of all, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, thank the rapporteur and our fellow Members on the Committee on Budgets for their continually constructive and effective cooperation."
"Two closely linked topics in particular are central for us in the Committee on Industry."
"On the one hand these concern - as has already been addressed today -Galileo and on the other hand, the European Institute of Innovation and Technology project."
"Both initiatives involve ground-breaking projects of vital importance in terms of policy on innovation and industry that deserve our full support."
"The European Institute of Innovation and Technology will make an important contribution to the transfer of technology from science to industry and to enterprises."
"There is still a backlog of demand here in Europe."
"Funding, however, raises questions."
"The Committee on Industry has been arguing very clearly in favour of funding not being at the expense of other forward-looking programmes."
"We should not therefore be taking money from the Seventh Research Framework Programme, from a programme for life-long learning or from the Trans-European Networks programme to finance the European Institute of Innovation and Technology."
"No, we in the Committee on Industry are pleading for funds to be redeployed from the administrative budget for the benefit of the EIT."
"Thankfully the Committee on Budgets has also accordingly undertaken to do this."
"Furthermore, the Committee on Industry is pleading for clear funding even beyond its own budget line."
"Considerably more problematic is Galileo."
"Perhaps you would allow me simply to point out the following from the viewpoint of industrial policy: I believe there is agreement that we need Galileo and that it also has to be financed."
"The latest resolution on Galileo has resulted in Parliament arguing for Community funding, as has also been proposed by the Commission."
"Having said that, it is crucial, in my view, that the project ultimately continues."
"The project does not have to be relaunched but can be based on the considerable efforts of the industrial enterprises involved."
"This should also be taken into account during the upcoming negotiations."
"Everything else regarding Galileo I am handing over to my colleague Mr Böge, who will also be responsible for continuing negotiations on the Committee on Budgets together with his colleagues here."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. - (ES) Mr President, firstly I would also like to start by thanking the members of the Committee on Budgets for the support that they have given to the amendments that were put forward by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, that were also adopted practically unanimously by the committee."
"Firstly, with regard to budget Title 12, 'Internal Market', I would just like to say that what the committee aimed to do through our amendments was to recover the amounts in the PDB that had been envisaged by the Commission, which the Council document had subsequently reduced."
"I would like to mention or remind you of the importance that everything related to the internal market has in the European Union."
"I think that is obvious."
"It is one of the main bases for all the subsequent development that has been built around it."
"In some years, such as last year and next year, 2008, in which important legislation is to be adopted, for example the Services Directive, and also there are plans to continue moving towards legislation to perfect the internal market, we understand that it is necessary to recover the amounts envisaged in the PDB."
"The same argument could apply to Title 14, 'Customs Union', which also refers to perfecting the Union's external borders, which, in turn, will enable us to ensure that our single market functions correctly."
"Finally, with regard to Title 17, relating to consumer protection, which concerns the committee for which I have been draftsman, I would like to say that, with the support of the Committee on Budgets, we have recovered the amounts in the PDB for the SOLVIT Programme."
"There are different levels of development of consumer policies and consumer protection policies in the various EU countries."
"On many occasions there are discrepancies that need to be resolved through non-legal, out-of-court instruments."
"SOLVIT has proved to be a good instrument for this."
"Finally, and I will conclude, Mr President, I would like to especially thank the Committee on Budgets for its support for a pilot project that has been allocated EUR 1 million, that will enable a study to be carried out in the next year monitoring and comparing the application of consumer policy measures in the various Member States."
"Mr President, in its opinion the Committee on Regional Development gave particular attention to the budgetary lines relating to Chapter XIII, or the heading 'Regional Policy'."
"We appealed to keep, or if necessary reinstate, all the budgetary lines from the preliminary draft budget."
"The Committee on Budgets met our demands, and even, in line 130616 relating to the European Regional Development Fund, asked for an increase in payments of EUR 900 million."
"The Committee on Budgets also shared our concern about the use of the unallocated part of the money in the cohesion area for additional funding of other projects, such as the European Institute of Technology, on the strength of a decision by the Council that would be at odds with the principle of cohesion and would also deplete the European Parliament's prerogatives."
"To sum up, this is not our dream budget, it is not a budget that could delight us, but the Committee on Regional Development supports the draft budget proposed by the Committee on Budgets."
"Many thanks."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. - (NL) Mr President, the following ritual is performed every year with regard to the agricultural budget: the Commission adopts the draft budget, then the Council makes cuts to many lines without much justification, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, backed by the Committee on Budgets, restores those lines, and then we start discussions on the basis of the Commission's letter of amendment to adopt the precise budget for the following year."
"Why it is necessary for the Council to constantly make those cuts is a mystery to me, as we have been holding discussions based on that Commission letter of amendment since as far back as the Treaty of Amsterdam, as it provides us with the most recent figures available."
"I think that we had better continue that way."
"The Committee on Agriculture has increased a number of lines: those for school fruit, school milk, and so on, as we all want awareness of good nutrition to start at an early age."
"We appreciate the pilot projects and the preparatory action originally adopted by the Committee on Budgets."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries. - (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Fisheries, within its sphere of competence, submitted a number of proposals for amendments to the Committee on Budgets for consideration, most of which were well received and concern, in particular, the strengthening of European maritime policy in preparatory actions for the sustainable development of the ocean of opportunity represented by Europe's oceans and seas, more resources for fisheries control so as to ensure the sustainability of the seas and oceans and for collecting information vital for the development of a sustainable fisheries policy, for the proper operation and efficiency of the Community Fisheries Control Agency and, moreover, regarding the outer most regions, to guarantee the effectiveness of the current programmes vital for minimising the constraints that continually and specifically affect those regions."
"The reports by Mr Virrankoski and myself are a clear signal for strengthening the fisheries policy, even with all the constraints linked to the Financial Perspective; I therefore urge my fellow Members to give them firm support and the Council to take account of the proposals we have submitted as well as Parliament's proposals."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Culture and Education. - (DE) Mr President, I am speaking here for the Committee on Culture, which is responsible not only for culture, but also for education, youth, media and sport."
"Our budget is very limited when compared to what it ought to be."
"I believe that when we take a good look at how successful the ERASMUS programme has been, whereby university students in Europe can study in different countries, make friends in other parts of Europe, and discuss it afterwards among their friends and contacts, it is clear that it makes an essential contribution to mutual understanding in Europe."
"I believe that we should do more for communication, especially now that the Heads of State or Government have agreed on the Reform Treaty."
"The idea of 'going local', working with people in their own environment to gain their support for a European future, is crucial."
"I am delighted that two pilot projects, at least, were possible: EuroGlobe, a mobile theatre like those from Shakespeare's era, set up to tour European capital cities so as to really involve citizens, and a culture project on the theme of artist mobility, to enable Europe's young artists to come together, work together and shape Europe's future."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am standing in for Mrs Dührkop who cannot be here."
"The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs had defined three main priorities for the 2008 budget."
"The first of these priorities concerned the strengthening of the operational resources available to the Frontex agency, which, as you know, is charged with coordinating cooperation on the EU's external borders."
"This objective has been met: if Parliament takes our lead, Frontex will receive 30 million in additional operating appropriations, that is, more than double the 2007 allocation."
"The second priority concerned the need for transparency in the management of the computerised systems for controlling entry to European territory."
"Appropriations were therefore put in reserve for the Schengen SIS I and SIS II systems and for the visa information system, known as the VIS for short."
"These appropriations will not be released until we have adequate legal bases where necessary, and whatever the case, information about the invitations to tender and contracts."
"Finally, our Committee's third priority concerns the European Return Fund."
"All the appropriations for this were placed in reserve and will only be released once the Council and Parliament have adopted the Directive on common standards and procedures for returning illegally staying third-country nationals."
"The Council should know this: no Directive, no dough."
"It is as simple as that."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. - (LV) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased that finally, following the Lisbon Summit, we can move on to the signing of the Reform Treaty and its ratification and implementation."
"We all understand that this new Treaty is necessary for Europe's development and consolidation."
"For this reason, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, I was surprised that budget heading 3b, which relates to European citizenship, was the only one where significantly reduced expenditure had been planned compared with the 2007 budget."
"At a time when the European Union's institutional structure is changing, resources are needed for communication with EU residents."
"EU citizens must be informed about changes to be made, and their cooperation and support must be secured."
"I am therefore grateful to the members of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs from my political group, and especially the rapporteurs and the members of the Committee on Budgets, for their support for my proposals on various budget headings to increase expenditure on this programme."
"I hope that Parliament will also support the budget amendments and that these resources will be used appropriately to strengthen the European Union. Thank you."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality. - (DE) Mr President, it is important to treat the budget in a gender-neutral manner, as we should and must do, from the women's policy point of view."
"The aspect of gender is of great importance here and 'gender budgeting' must not be merely empty words, but must be seen to be put into practice."
"It is very important that we top up the DAPHNE programme."
"Unfortunately, our amendment did not get through and we will now raise it in the Plenary once again."
"We Social Democrats support the amendment and the increase of funds for DAPHNE, because it is a relatively small, but very important programme to combat domestic violence."
"Then it is also important to provide appropriate financing for the European Institute for Gender Equality, to ensure that it is launched successfully."
"It is also important that expenditure for the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue is distributed equally between the sexes."
"There are a great many women, especially migrants, who should be given a vital role in this intercultural dialogue."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Petitions. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to thank the two rapporteurs, Mr Virrankoski and Mr Itälä, for their excellent work."
"I believe that the budget should be the fundamental political act of each public institution, but also of each private entity, because it illustrates the policy decisions on which public money will be spent."
"There are three fundamental elements: first, rigour; second, the courage to make effective and efficient policy choices; third, control of expenditure."
"Evidently, as Mr Virrankoski said, this all requires a firm and resolute policy which also embraces the revision of procedures, which I fully support."
"Now, as to the question of the Committee on Petitions, we felt we should suggest to the Committee on Budgets that the proposed increase of 4.69% in the Ombudsman's budget was fair and appropriate, partly because the Ombudsman is now a key political figure in the democracy and transparency of the European Union and in sound administration, which he must guard vigilantly."
"(HU) Mr President, Commissioner, the most important item in the budget for 2008 is cohesion policy."
"In practice there are underdeveloped regions in every Member State, and so we all have an interest in this issue."
"Moreover, cohesion is also in the interests of those who are involved in financing this process, and not just in the interests of the beneficiaries."
"This is why we cannot accept any suggestion of making significant cuts, equivalent to around half a billion euros, to payments relating to cohesion policy."
"In my view, Parliament is convinced that the new Member States will be capable of adjusting and spending all the funds available to them."
"We all need to push for this in our own countries as well."
"This is not the only item about which we are, and will continue to be, in disagreement with the Council."
"We can also state with certainty that we have managed European citizens' money well, in other words responsibly, for the 2008 budget is much lower than the ceilings set out in the financial framework."
"That is why it is disappointing that daggers are still drawn in the debate on the Galileo Programme budget or on the European Institute of Technology."
"Both of these would be advantageous for the European Union's development, so why do we have to put obstacles in the way of making them a reality?"
"I thank the European Commission and the rapporteur for their work, and ask Parliament to support the amendments proposed by the Committee on Budgets and thereby to lend solid support to the negotiations preceding the second reading."
"Lastly, Mr President, permit me to salute the Members of Parliament present today on this, my country's national holiday."
"I am of course referring to the 1956 Hungarian Revolution. Thank you for your attention."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Council has done this year what it always does: it has allowed its civil servants in the Ministries of Finance to put together a budget that takes into account the Council's main aim which is 'keep the figures down' and, most importantly, 'keep payments down'."
"It bears no relation to the political plans that we in the European Union want to implement - no relation at all!"
"The Council in its many formations is still in the habit of preaching on Sundays and being content to let others, that is, Parliament, do the real work for the rest of the week."
"It does not matter whether the issue is external policy matters, or aid for Kosovo or Palestine or about implementing policies on competitiveness for growth and employment that are extremely important for Europe, vital to its survival, in fact."
"Parliament looked ahead and pointed out, even during negotiations on the financial perspective 18 months ago, that there would be problems with financing exactly these policies within the foreseeable future."
"However, our message fell on deaf ears and now the Council has to make it up as it goes along."
"Sooner than we expected, we are facing a situation where we are having to provide public funds to rescue the Galileo project because the dream of entrepreneurial initiative has collapsed."
"The European Parliament was able to agree fairly quickly that it would finance the beginning of the Galileo project with European money, by using the 'Community method'."
"We see anything else as quackery, and want no part of it."
"We are prepared to provide Galileo with EUR 2.4 billion from 2008 to 2013, in addition to the EUR 1 billion that were already planned."
"However, since the required funds are not available in Heading 1a, and are not going to fall from the sky, we are prepared to take it from other budget categories, from Heading 2 2007 and 2008, making EUR 2.2 billion, and EUR 220 million from Heading 5."
"Certainly that is a lot of money from Heading 2, but it is possible without farmers being deprived of funds."
"Prices for agricultural products are high on the world market, so our subsidies can be reduced."
"The transaction for which we created the basis in the Budget Committee in the first reading, is called a 'minor revision'."
"Pah!"
"The Council avoids even the most minor of revisions like the plague but that is the Council's problem."
"Anyway, we are prepared to create the preconditions for Galileo, a flagship of European technological innovation."
"That fact that, as part of this minor revision, we are prepared to make funds available for the European Institute of Technology is, for us, worth only passing mention, due to the size, well, actually the smallness, of the amount initially required: EUR 2.9 million from 2008 to 2013."
"We expect the Council to get moving and to come to Parliament and move in our direction."
"Mr President, allow me one further remark."
"We really expected the Finance Minister or at least a State Secretary from the Portuguese Council Presidency to attend this debate at the first reading, so that we could welcome his presence."
"Nothing against you, Mr Mourato, but even the Portuguese Vice-President of our own Parliament is no substitute in this instance."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as spokesperson for the ALDE Group, I would first like to express my appreciation of the work done by our fellow Member, the rapporteur, Mr Virrankoski, and in particular I would like to tell him that we wholly support the strategy he has developed on Galileo with the agreement of the Committee on Budgets."
"Europe needs Galileo."
"We want funding for Galileo to be Community funding and we want the appropriations to be guaranteed without having a negative impact on other priorities."
"I would also like to thank our rapporteur for having kept in the list of pilot projects a few we were particularly committed to, in particular the rapid alert mechanism for child abductions or disappearances."
"I would like to say a word about the report by Mr Itälä who, unfortunately, is not in the chamber."
"I appreciate the initiatives to increase the resources available to regional media for publicising Community initiatives among citizens."
"I believe that the regional and local media can have a much greater impact than certain centralised, more bureaucratic initiatives."
"However, I must say that there is an initiative in Mr Itälä's report that I do not like at all."
"This is the increase by EUR 1 000 per month in the secretarial expenses for each MEP."
"I do not like this initiative, which is a product of an agreement between two political groups, by chance the two largest, and which happens to come along the year before the European elections."
"I consider it a disguised subsidy for the re-election of a number of our fellow Members and I will be voting against this provision."
"(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, I have taken the floor in the debate on the budget for 2008 in order to raise the following issues."
"Firstly, although at nearly EUR 129 billion, the expenditure in this budget is the highest in the history of the Union, the ratio of this expenditure to the gross national income of the 27 Member States is the lowest ever, and, following adjustments by the European Parliament's Committee on Budgets, is barely 0.99% of the gross national income in commitment appropriations, which I would like to emphasise."
"Secondly, within the Financial Perspective period 2007-2013, the commitment appropriations ceiling for 2008 is set at 1.08% of the Member States' gross national income, so we are looking here at a significant discrepancy between what we wanted to fund just two years ago and what the European Union wants to fund now."
"You cannot have more Europe for a lot less money."
"This view has been repeated over and over again in this House and we need to be reminded of it again today."
"Thirdly, we must support the decisions of the European Parliament's Committee on Budgets that significantly increase the funding for the Galileo Programme, the European Institute of Technology and certain external activities of the European Union."
"Fourthly, we must press for the European Commission to accept the programmes put forward by Member States for regional development and the development of rural areas as quickly as possible."
"More than EUR 20 billion will be allocated to the new Member States specifically in 2008."
"It would therefore be a good thing if these funds could be utilised as effectively as possible."
"Finally, fifthly, it is worth noting the instigation of the fund for adaptation to globalisation, which will enable companies experiencing the negative consequences of this process to take advantage of transitional support and to safeguard EU jobs."
"(FR) Mr President, I am going to focus my comments on the report by our colleague, Mr Itälä, who has done a good job."
"We know it is always very difficult to decide the budget for our institution."
"I have only one real regret: there is something very special about the 2008 budget."
"It is the last budget in which we could collect a lot of money together for investment, particularly in Parliament's property policy."
"We have 32 places of work, if you count all our offices in different capitals."
"Apart from Brussels and Strasbourg, we own only six of the places in which we work in the various countries."
"We know there is an acquisition policy, which the Court of Auditors is regularly asking us to pursue but we cannot implement it because Mr Itälä - and I understand his concern about sending out a signal by saying we are not spending all the money because we want to remain below the 20% ceiling - is preventing Parliament from injecting money into it and putting together a property portfolio."
"However, it was 2008 or never, because in 2009 we will be paying for the Member's Statute, as you know, and we will no longer be able to do it."
"Apart from that climb-down, I have to acknowledge that Mr Itälä has done a very good job, and in particular it is one of the greenest budgets I have seen as it contains many provisions, particularly provisions to reduce carbon emissions, offset our carbon impact, a desire to have a fleet of vehicles that includes hybrid cars, the desire to cut the number of meetings by holding videoconferences, and even by reducing the amount of travel by officials, who do not necessarily follow us to the places where they are needed."
"To sum up, therefore, we should have had more money for investment and actions in 2008, the pre-election year, but generally speaking it is still a very good report because of the impact on policies I hold dear."
"That is why we will vote for this report, Mr President."
"(PT) In the two minutes I have to speak I would like once again to point out that budgetary history is repeating itself."
"The European Commission presents the proposed Community budget, this time for 2008, the Council proposes significant cuts to the Commission proposal, and Parliament comes forward with a proposal for reducing the cuts in the Commission's and Council's drafts."
"Everything seems normal, were it not that all these proposals are below the 2008 budget in the Financial Perspective for 2007-2013."
"As happened in the previous financial framework for 2000-2006, the budget ceiling provided for in the current Financial Perspective is not being adhered to, since the Community budget in 2007 was EUR 1.6 billion less in commitment appropriations and more than EUR 8 billion less in payment appropriations, without taking account of actual implementation."
"It is clear that the amounts entered in the Financial Perspective for 2007-2013 are already insufficient in themselves, in our opinion, to promote real economic and social cohesion in an enlarged European Union of 27 countries."
"Basically, all these proposals for the 2008 Community budget run counter to the requirements of the rich countries which impose a ceiling on the budget of about 1% of Community GNI, thereby reducing its share of this budget and minimising its redistributive role."
"Parliament's proposal covers aspects that improve the draft presented by the Council, such as increasing the appropriations for the cohesion policy, as we also proposed, though we should stress that its effective implementation is to a large extent undermined later to meet the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy's neoliberal agenda, which we firmly reject."
"However, even Parliament's proposal represents a cut of more than EUR 5 billion in payment appropriations, in relation to what was agreed for 2008 in the multiannual financial framework."
"Since this is a phase of the negotiation process, we hope that, in contrast to what has happened in the past, Parliament will at least seek to ensure that the minimum amounts laid down in the Financial Perspective for 2008 are adhered to as closely as possible."
"Mr President, for budget debates, there is a well-known law we call the law of the three 'Ls', because budget debates involve reeling off Litanies, like in a religious Liturgy, which ends up causing economic Lethargy. We are finding this with the 2008 budget."
"The litanies first."
"Mr Virrankoski reels off these litanies like Mr Elles did in 2006, and like our fellow Member Mr Garriga Polledo did in 2005."
"First of all, the litany of cutting off appropriations: in the draft budget, the Council of Ministers cuts off the appropriations in the preliminary draft budget."
"Mr Mulder has explained to us that this is quite normal for agriculture, for example."
"The European Parliament, however, is proposing to restore the appropriations."
"The litany is also one of a budget consistently below the ceilings of the multiannual financial framework."
"The multiannual financial framework is already very short of the necessary appropriations and the budget even more so."
"It is a cascade of Malthusianism."
"It is also a litany of political priorities: year after year, fighting poverty, education, training, agricultural multifunctionality and the seventh framework programme on research are mentioned, and that is where the liturgy comes in."
"The liturgy is primarily in the budgetary nomenclature and the ideology supporting that nomenclature."
"The nomenclature is the presentation of the budget by activity, the preparation of the budget by activity."
"In practice, the expenditure is chopped up into titles, into political fields, which correspond to the directorates-general."
"The budget is like a huge salami, a type of grocer's shop inventory, the problem being, as the rapporteur has seen, that dividing the budget up by activity creates confusion with the multiannual financial framework, which is split into broader categories. One has five categories: competitiveness, preservation of natural resources, freedom, the EU as a global partner, administration, and the other has about thirty political activities, and the correspondence between these categories is difficult to establish."
"All this is done in the name of a budgetary ideology, the ideology of performance, competitiveness, effectiveness, efficiency and results, and this creates a jumble of nebulous tools, results indicators, performance indicators, activities sheets."
"This budgetary technology is presented as new, as being in the vanguard of budgetary intelligence, but it is actually something quite old, dating back to 1947."
"It was the American Hoover Committee that first talked about the concepts of performance, cost/benefit, efficiency, targets and results."
"It was this that gave the US the Planning, Programming and Budgeting System in the 1960s under the Johnson Presidency, and that under President Carter gave the BBZ, or budget base zero - the budgetary performance ideology that subsequently spread to New Zealand, the United Kingdom, France in 2001 with its organic law on finance laws, and even Mexico in 2006."
"One might understand from this why the European budget is lacking in transparency and really in efficiency too."
"The European Parliament does not contain 100 people capable of understanding the European budget by activity, with the consequence that this entails: the economic lethargy of the European Union."
"Because if there is no Galileo, if there is no Lyon-Turin link, if there is no Genoa-Barcelona link, if the capital cities are not connected by high-speed trains, if the research budget is not what it should be, if the budget for a Europe of 27 Member States is the same as the Spanish budget, if the European budget is one twentieth of the budget of the United States, it is precisely because of this Malthusian ideology."
"Perhaps it is time we realised that alongside the ordinary budget, we need an extraordinary budget to make loans financed by a major European loan, which would permit investment."
"(SK) If we were to rate the confidence in centrally financed activities of the EU according to budgetary expenditure expressed as a share of EU GNI, the trajectory of the confidence curve would resemble that of a falling leaf."
"This is truly alarming."
"Payment appropriations as a share of EU GNI have fallen regularly for several years to around 1%."
"In the 2008 draft budget they dropped to 0.95%."
"Similar trends can be seen not only with regard to the volume of budget resources but also payment appropriations in relation to the payments ceiling of the multiannual financial framework."
"In particular the proposed EUR 10 billion in unallocated payment appropriations appears to be a substantial deviation from the aims of the long-term financial framework."
"I, too, am astonished that the Council is proposing over EUR 1 billion of cuts to payments for the programmes aimed at improving European competitiveness and cohesion."
"I therefore share the view that the payment appropriations are insufficient in the light of the policy challenges faced by the EU."
"That is why I will support the proposal to increase payments appropriations to 0.99%.of EU GNI."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today I would like to address two important reserves in the Commission Budget: one for buildings policy and one for staff."
"Regarding the latter, it can be said that the screening report has shown us that the Commission employs almost 11 000 staff in administrative support and coordination - administering the administration."
"If you add the translators and housekeepers to that, it then becomes the area with the greatest growth in staff numbers, because that adds a further 5 700 people."
"Given that we mention 'better regulation' from time to time, we must immediately start requiring 'better organisation'."
"To do that, we need more information, and that is what the reserve is for."
"Part of the job that Parliament gave the Commission to do was benchmarking, comparing staff positions with those in international organisations."
"The Commission is not allowing us to see this comparison, stating that it has agreed to keep the identities of those organisations anonymous."
"That is a bit rich!"
"We can only make progress here if Parliament receives the information it has asked for - proper information, not fragments."
"The screening gives us a one-off, first-time look at the staff structure of the Commission, for which we are grateful, but there are no conclusions, and the Commission has not produced an action plan."
"I must ask firmly that this action plan be presented."
"Nor are there any conclusions about buildings policy in Brussels."
"The communication from the Commission in July on building needs does not take into account the results of the staff screening, although the same Commissioner is responsible for both."
"You are not that Commissioner, which is disappointing and cannot continue."
"The amounts placed in reserve by Parliament compel the Commission to link these two documents."
"The Commission must finally get to work on this matter and do its job properly because, in my view, the results of the staff screening that we have been given so far cannot be presented to our voters."
"(SK) To begin with I would like to thank both rapporteurs."
"My thanks to Mr Itälä for over eight months of cooperation on the issue of the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2008."
"Over the last four years the institutions' budget has increased by almost 18%, chiefly as a result of enlargement."
"In the future this budget will not grow at such a rate."
"If we want to make the institutions more efficient, we need to improve the cooperation between them."
"I am glad that the fears of risks associated with such cooperation have not come true."
"On the one hand, we have been trying to ensure that all the tasks that the citizens expect the institutions to fulfil will be fulfilled."
"On the other hand, we have been trying to ensure effective use of the funds."
"When allocating the European Parliament's budget, the most important thing for us is to concentrate, both now and in the future, on our main role and priority: improving the legislative process."
"Issues that are not related to this have to be reduced in the budget to an absolute minimum."
"We are well on the way to achieving that."
"Ladies and gentlemen, back in March we said that you need to have better information on all the resources and materials at your disposal, so that you can work in a responsible and efficient manner."
"We are therefore calling for the creation of a knowledge management system that will enable the Members to work in an effective manner, using all documents."
"Ladies and gentlemen, you want to prove to the voters that you manage their funds responsibly."
"However, sometimes we do not have documents available in even the most common languages."
"There are extraordinary committee meetings for which new resources are needed."
"We need to improve flexibility in this area."
"Spending on buildings accounts for a large portion of the institutions' budget: we should therefore keep a close eye on this in the future."
"In the past, there were instances where European institutions bought or leased property for prices above the market value."
"In the future we want closer attention to be paid to all aspects of purchasing, leasing and renovation."
"Our aim is to lower costs and ensure flexibility."
"We want to avoid cartels and monopolies."
"Our next priority is to provide better information to the citizens of the European Union."
"We have thus decided to strengthen this area by helping regional and local media."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we want to continue to make the institutions operate more efficiently."
"The reports we receive about their activities must be more informative."
"These reports should clearly indicate whether or not the targets have been reached."
"I welcome the method used by the institutions to prepare the budget with the help of inflation coefficients as well as on the basis of what is really needed."
"In conclusion, I want to thank the rapporteur because we have managed, by way of a number of difficult debates, to reach a good compromise that will lead to better use of European taxpayers' money."
"- (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one and a half minutes to say what you think of the 2008 draft budget is a formidable task, but I would first like to take the time to thank our rapporteurs, Mr Virrankoski and Mr Itälä, with whom we have had to navigate our way with great difficulty through the decisions that the Committee on Budgets is proposing today."
"Of course, the2007-2013 multiannual financial framework squeezes us into an austerity that unfortunately does not allow us to pursue, either as steadily or above all as quickly, the objectives we have set ourselves for Europe, the policies of which are, to my mind, the only way of saving the regions of Europe because they can give our fellow citizens the comfortable lifestyles they aspire to in a global environment that has metamorphosed and is constantly shifting and evolving."
"I therefore invite Parliament to support our committee's initiatives, especially with the prospect of a mid-term renegotiation of the multiannual framework and the definition of a new mechanism for own resources."
"On the subject of this budget, because I only have a little time I would just like to mention one point."
"As permanent rapporteur for the Structural Funds in the Committee on Budgets, I have decided to ask the members of the European Commission what the reasons were for putting 30% of the administrative costs of these funds in reserve."
"The study we presented recently with Mr Virrankoski on the implementation of the Structural Funds highlights the considerable time it has taken the Commission to approve the national frameworks and operational programmes, so there are now record outstanding commitments of three years; by taking this firm stance on the reserve, we wanted to raise the alarm."
"The regional policies, like the support for research and innovation, are policies of prime importance for the future of our economy, and therefore for jobs and the quality of life of Europeans."
"We want to do things quickly, but we want to do things well, which explains the high level of appropriations we are asking the Council to support."
"(GA) Mr President, there is one aspect of the budget that should be mentioned, and that is the money to be set aside for the common agricultural policy."
"The CAP, as it is called, has undergone numerous reforms in the last 15 years: the Mac Sharry reforms, Agenda 2000, and the decoupling of payments from production."
"I should like to clarify one point: the governments of the Member States might not agree to any changes to the payments to be made under the CAP to farmers in Europe as a whole between 2007 and 2013."
"Indeed, in my country, Ireland, firm financial arrangements have been laid down for farmers under the agricultural policy to be pursued between 2007 and 2013."
"We know that agricultural policy is to be the subject of a health check, but not a general review."
"And the check will not cover the financial arrangements which EU leaders have made for farmers in Ireland and Europe up to 2013."
"I hope that this will be understood and that nothing will be left out; and that there will be no attempts at distortion, for it is vital for farmers throughout Europe that everything should be in order."
"(DA) Mr President, our group is naturally voting in favour of the amendment proposal to allocate even more money to Palestine."
"However, we must highlight the fact that both the Council and the Commission should ensure that we do not end up in a situation in which we are throwing money into a bottomless pit."
"This is the case with much of the aid that is currently being given and contradicts the EU's principles for aid, where the beneficiary must be made able to develop a sustainable economy."
"However, this is impossible because Israel is stifling Palestinian society and its economy, and not just in Gaza."
"The delegation from the Committee on Development witnessed this when it visited the West Bank and Gaza in September."
"EU money flows endlessly without Israel being held accountable at all."
"We have been given an account of a dialogue from Washington, in which one of the White House's Middle East consultants was asked about the EU's role."
"He responded: 'EU?"
"We give orders, Europe pays!'"
"This is true, too!"
"We keep on paying out, and Israel is simply being allowed to destroy everything that we have built up."
"The Commission and the Council must now make demands on Israel."
"The blockade of Gaza must be stopped in order to allow goods and people to move in and out."
"Gaza is now effectively one large open-air prison."
"The barriers on the West Bank must also be removed."
"It is not only our delegation that is saying this; the message from the World Bank and from our own ECHO was equally clear."
"If there is no hope of improvement or any light at the end of the tunnel, we are abusing EU citizens' tax payments, and this must stop immediately!"
"(EL) Mr President, the EU's budget is the main way to achieve political priorities."
"Its budgetary policy seems to have three aims: business competitiveness, anti-terrorism and intervention in third countries."
"Expenditure is used to achieve these three aims, but the interests and concerns of the masses are entirely different."
"They relate to their future places of work, income, pensions, and state school and university education."
"Let us ask ourselves about the political priorities set by the budget: do they really improve the lives of citizens?"
"Is the EU as a global player meeting its commitments fairly?"
"How does the allocation of some EUR 741 million to promote freedom, security and justice improve the lives of European citizens?"
"The Commission's recent consultation paper on the reform of the budget says that today and especially in the future the budget ought to intensifying competition for raw materials and markets, shifting the balance of economic power and liberalising huge new markets which create new opportunities for Europeans."
"However, this is exactly what is leading the people of Europe astray."
"For a start, instead of the budgets of Member States being aimed at social justice, they are aggravating the struggle to control the markets regardless of the means."
"Secondly, this stirs up public opinion in third countries against Europe."
"(PL) Mr President, we are still at the beginning of the new financial perspective, so we are being cautious in programming expenditure for 2008."
"At the same, this is the fourth annual budget of this parliamentary term, and we have therefore accumulated sufficient experience of the budgetary procedure and the specific rules of the game between Parliament, the Commission and the Council."
"That is most probably why a record number of amendments were smoothly voted through in the Committee on Budgets under the efficient leadership of Mr Böge in a spirit of consensus, which will certainly facilitate block voting on Thursday and will certainly equip us with greater negotiating strength in shaping the draft budget for 2008."
"The priorities for 2008 have been named again and again, and the funding of the Galileo Programme has again and again been specified as a problem."
"I am therefore pleased to make the point that for the first time the Baltic Sea region has been given consideration in this budget, not by way of a declaration, but in a financial, i.e. a real sense."
"Perhaps this is because both the Commissioner, the two rapporteurs and the Chair of the Committee on Budgets are inhabitants of that region."
"It is good that the European Union is taking on global commitments, but the larger the European Union becomes, the more its responsibility increases for our own continent, including the Baltic Sea region, i.e. the internal sea of the European Union as it is now, and everyone knows what a poor state it is in."
"In view of this, it is good that we have found, in the form of pilot projects and preparatory actions, a financial instrument to increase funding for regional development, safety of navigation, simplification of border-crossing procedures, and above all, protection of the environment."
"I hope that these priorities will stand up for themselves in the stern mirror of the European Commission, along with the whole of our budget strategy."
"(MT) Mr President, I will start by saying that I agree with what Mr Itälä has said on the issue of budgetary procedure and that no one is prepared to be a 'rubber stamp'."
"I therefore suggest that we discuss this subject as quickly as possible in order to address the difficulties and the differences that appear to exist in an effective manner."
"On a different level, we welcome the EUR 30 million increase in Frontex's budget."
"Realistically we expect an improvement in the Agency's structure, better coordination and more determined operations."
"Parliament gave a clear and concrete signal that it is now up to Frontex and the Member States to eliminate the inefficiency, the unkept promises and the delay we have suffered over the past year."
"Another point that I would like to address relates to reports and studies produced within or commissioned by the various institutions, including the Commission."
"There is a need for a common database of reports and studies in order to avoid duplication of work, reduce waste and at the same time make information more accessible."
"In addition, there should be an annual report that lists these studies and reports, who won the contract, how much they cost and, if possible, what use was made of them."
"We should also examine the impact and added value of the reports produced by the Economic and Social Council and the Committee of the Regions, particularly in the light of reports that are too technical or reports that have already been produced by the Commission or by Parliament."
"On the subject of the purchase of premises, I would like to remind you that in 2006 it was agreed that we would once again reexamine the policy regarding the purchase and leasing of buildings used by the institutions, including the information offices."
"I am under the impression that over the years, the institutions, for various reasons, have bought and leased buildings at a price that appears higher than the market price."
"Without questioning the merits of the policy on the purchase of buildings, it still makes sense to examine, in an institutional manner, how we can improve the conditions under which we purchase and lease premises and to bring offices closer to the market prices and thus avoid the situation of cartels or monopolies."
"Lastly, I would like to congratulate the Finnish double act on their useful work and the manner in which negotiations were conducted."
"(HU) Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Virrankoski, who has done an excellent job."
"However, I would like to make the point that if the European Union wants to be a global player, then it is ridiculous that it wants to spend less money on foreign policy than on administrative expenditure."
"Secondly, it is also unacceptable that expenditure under the enlargement heading, considered a priority, should also be lower in nominal terms relative to 2007, and, thirdly, it is unacceptable that expenditure on external affairs should increase to a lesser extent - by about 1.5% - than general expenditure, which is set to increase by 2%."
"This means that the European Union has not ensured that there will be sufficient resources available to carry out the tasks it has set out; nor has it ensured that there will be sufficient funds to implement foreign policy priorities."
"Adequate funds have not been allocated for the mission to Kosovo, nor for providing assistance to the Palestinian people;"
"I fear the budget will have to be amended again several times next year because no provision has been made for this."
"The imbalance between the eastern and southern components of the European neighbourhood policy has been a recurrent problem for many years."
"The countries to the south have received three times as much money in per capita terms as those to the east, and this is unacceptable."
"Lastly, I think it is important to resolve the issue of cooperation between the European Parliament and the Council regarding the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) heading."
"As yet there has been no ex ante agreement or policy dialogue, and until this happens, I agree with placing EUR 40 million in reserve for the CFSP. Thank you very much."
"(PL) Ladies and gentlemen, one of the things on which we have to decide today is the allocation of the first tranche of financial support for the European Institute of Technology."
"This is a particularly important and keenly-anticipated decision for Wrocław, which is hoping for this institution to be located there."
"It is very bad that we have not managed to set up this institution before the end of negotiations on the budget perspective; it is greatly hindering its start-up."
"Today we have an opportunity to make up for lost time and send some EUR 3 million to get the institution up and running."
"Its full funding during 2010-2011 can only be assured through a review of the budget perspective."
"I can assure you that this money will be a good investment."
"This is evidenced by the readiness and enthusiasm of the Lower Silesian local authorities, businessmen and the world of science to get involved in this project."
"I therefore ask you to accept these amendments."
"(FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my thanks go to the rapporteurs Mr Itälä and Mr Virrankoski for their excellent work."
"I am glad that the Committee on Budgets approved the two pilot projects connected with the protection of the Baltic Sea."
"I hope that the plenary session will also give its support to them."
"It is time we paid closer attention to the Baltic."
"Since the 2004 round of enlargement it has been an internal sea of the EU, but at the same time it is one of the world's sickest and most polluted seas, something that shames the EU."
"One of these pilot projects has to do with reducing the amount of hazardous waste that ends up in the Baltic Sea and correcting the oxygen deficit in the deep basins of the sea."
"The other is connected with cutting the sulphur dioxide emissions from shipping though emissions trading."
"If this experiment gives good results, sulphur dioxide emissions trading may become a viable way to cut sulphur dioxide emissions in all sea areas of the EU, which would clean up the air we all breathe in the future all over Europe."
"So I also hope that the plenary session will support these initiatives."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs, as others have done."
"However, in my remarks, instead of the three 'L's used by Mr Martinez, which if I remember correctly were 'litany', 'liturgy' and 'lethargy', I would rather use three 'I's, which are 'implementation', 'initiation' and 'imagination'."
"Firstly, I should like to thank the rapporteurs, particularly Mr Virrankoski, for including a couple of paragraphs about the monitoring of the budget."
"It is extremely important that we think about the question of value for money."
"Even if that particular term is not included in the resolution, it is, no doubt, in the hearts of everybody that we need to be able to justify, with our specialised committees, the monies we are actually spending, not just in the current period, but also in the fact of having the national management declarations, which it seems many Member States are still reluctant to put together."
"Secondly, I would like to thank both the rapporteurs and the Commissioner, in this regard, for having, in my own budget for the year 2007, implemented those pilot projects and preparatory projects which were included."
"There are quite a few of them, and it is nice to have a certain continuity as we go through into 2008, particularly picking up on the pilot information networks, but also on the projects with the EU, China and India."
"That brings me to my last point, which is the question of imagination."
"Einstein said that imagination is more important than knowledge."
"We have seen in this debate that many colleagues - Mr Mantovani, Ms Guy-Quint and others - and myself always deplore the fact that we have too little money in category four, the external actions."
"We know perfectly well there is too little, so I would put in a particular plea at this stage, as we look towards the budget review, that maybe we should actually use a little imagination to see how the European Union will be called upon in the future to meet the global challenges of the future and to play its part in global assistance and the functioning of the global economy, and then make sure we have the means to be able to implement what we wish to take on as our policies."
"- (ES) Mr President, with a budget that represents 0.99% of the Union's GDP we cannot have a solid political position."
"With regard to category 1a, competitiveness for growth and employment, it should be pointed out that this is the first time that the figures on these policies represent the majority of the preliminary draft budget."
"However, the Council's figures cut down these categories relating to the Lisbon Strategy, which should be at the core of the Union's policies."
"I would like to mention the financing of Galileo and the European Institute of Technology, which are priority projects for our competitiveness and credibility."
"The financial perspective 2007-2013 are insufficient to finance projects of such strategic importance."
"Another point relates to the Frontex Agency, which plays an essential role, both from a humanitarian point of view and from a political point of view."
"The European Council in June reiterated the need to strengthen Frontex in order to improve the Union's capacity to manage its external borders."
"This is also one of the priorities that have been expressed on several occasions by Parliament."
"Proof of this is the proposed increase of EUR 30 million in commitment appropriations for the Agency's operational costs, which is an increase of 127% on the preliminary draft budget."
"The allocation to category 4 is clearly insufficient for achieving our objectives and fulfilling our promises as a global player and, in particular, as has already been said here, in the operations in Kosovo and Palestine."
"Finally, I would like to say that the confirmation of the Union's participation in EXPO Zaragoza 2008 - Water and Sustainable Development - is the right decision and is a good opportunity to bring European policies closer to the citizens of Europe, which we need to do."
"(FI) Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur Kyösti Virrankoski for his excellent preparation of the budget."
"He has listened to the different parties concerned, and has also taken the proposals of the Committee on Regional Development into proper consideration."
"The rapporteur Mr Itälä has also done a very good job."
"It is important that the appropriations for regional development remain at an adequate level."
"At the same time, we have to ensure that regional policy practices and administration are simplified and clarified both in the Union and in the Member States, so that all the appropriations set aside for regional development can be spent more effectively and wisely in the Member States to reduce regional differences and to implement the Lisbon Strategy."
"The bureaucracy that is the bugbear of the Union also disrupts the implementation of regional policy."
"The first year of the new programming period is almost over, and most of the programmes are still unapproved."
"This is a serious problem, as the rapporteur said."
"Because the Commission and the Member States have been dawdling, projects have been slow to begin and the first year of the programming period will be a problematic gap year."
"The Commission should approve the rest of the programmes without delay, so that the appropriations reserved in the budget can be spent effectively and fruitfully, and so that the new programmes can get under way properly."
"(MT) Thank you, Mr President, and thank you, too, Mr Virrankoski and Mr Itälä."
"With this budget, Parliament will double the Frontex Agency's budget to almost EUR 70 million."
"This is a measure that speaks for itself, because the priority that Parliament is giving to Frontex is now clear to all."
"The increase of EUR 30 million has been allocated to Frontex's operational budget in order to increase its missions in those areas that are worst hit by the influx of migrants."
"At the same time, Mr President, we have put 30% of Frontex's administrative budget in reserve because we want the Agency to be more effective in its work."
"There are three conditions for removing this reserve: firstly, we want the Director of Frontex to establish regular contact with us to strengthen Parliament's scrutiny of the Agency."
"Secondly, we want detailed information on Frontex's work programme for the coming year, and because Commissioner Frattini, Vice-President of the European Commission, himself announced that from next year Frontex's mission in the Mediterranean would become permanent, we now expect the Agency to be allocated far more than the EUR 10 million that it originally projected up to now for missions on the maritime borders."
"Thirdly, we want an updated and realistic list of the resources, ships, aeroplanes, helicopters that the Member States are prepared to put at the disposal of Frontex missions."
"We do not want ficticious lists, like we had this year, where the Member States supposedly agreed to provide Frontex with about 21 aeroplanes, 27 helicopters and 117 boats but in practice, when the missions came to be carried out, the Member States unashamedly ignored their own promises."
"Therefore, we expect Frontex to work to a proper schedule that can be relied upon before we remove the reserve. Thank you."
"(SV) Mr President, rapporteurs, ladies and gentlemen, many are now wondering why Parliament is seeking a revision of the long-term budget."
"Are we really not able to cope with new needs such as Galileo, the European Institute of Technology, the EIT, the EU's work in Kosovo and Palestine, and at the same time make budget cuts?"
"The problem is that budget ceilings apply to the whole budget, but of course they also apply to each individual budget category."
"In order to avoid, for example, Galileo entailing cuts to other research programmes, we are requesting what we call minor revision."
"But note that this is within the framework of the overall ceilings."
"We would prefer to cut surpluses in the agriculture budget, that is what is important."
"As regards Palestine and the costs of the EU's work in Kosovo we want to use the 'flexibility instrument'."
"Otherwise we have to take money from Africa or Latin America, and that would be unreasonable."
"The EU's rigid budget model needs to be changed."
"But I want to be clear, I do not want to step outside the overall framework, only to achieve greater flexibility within the framework in order to manage new needs."
"How otherwise will we in future, for example, address what is needed in climate and energy policy?"
"In addition to this, I want to mention just two things."
"First, the debate on the Treaty shows the importance of increased resources and a long-term perspective in the EU efforts in respect of communication, dialogue and democratic development."
"I then tried to make some adjustments to the allocation of quotas in this area by the Committee on Budgets."
"I hope that we are now all agreed on more aggressive investment."
"Secondly, I want to mention the pilot project that I myself have initiated."
"It relates to support for the reconstruction of cultural and religious institutions and monuments in conflict-affected areas."
"The proposal concerns, first of all, the Balkans, but in the long term it should also be possible to use the experience gained from that in other areas where destroyed museums, and razed churches and mosques, can constitute a cause of conflict which the EU can help to remove."
"Such areas could be, for example, Palestine, Afghanistan, Iraq, and perhaps even Tibet."
"In this area I appeal for the Members' understanding and support. Thank you."
"(FI) Mr President, first of all I wish to thank the rapporteurs, Mr Virrankoski and Mr Itälä."
"I know both men and I also know that they are in favour of openness and transparency and are keen to structure the European Union's economy on a sustainable basis, as is only appropriate."
"It is good to keep a tight rein on expenditure and acknowledge the demands of common sense."
"I would like briefly to focus attention on a few issues, the first of which is research and innovation."
"Although I know that this is largely in the hands of the Member States, all the same, the European Union needs to remember its own commitments, the Lisbon Strategy, for example, and it has to keep to them, so that we can channel budget money into research and innovation, creating new added value for Europe."
"I am delighted with this emphasis on the Baltic Sea."
"I believe it has largely emerged on account of the rapporteurs."
"It is good to realise what a state the Baltic is in and these two pilot projects are a good start."
"It is true that we need considerably more input, but this is a good place to begin."
"Thirdly, when drafting the budget it is important to remember the principles of sustainable development and the Union's values."
"This must be the way to act, for example, when we send money to third countries, and we are involved in various projects such as the Palestinian Autonomous Area."
"We need to ensure that resources are used properly and that they do not result in work which runs counter to democracy, human rights and freedom of speech, that is, the Union's values."
"The way in which money is spent and the Union's values must always go hand in hand."
"(RO) At the beginning of this year, we planned to negotiate together with the Council a pragmatic and efficient budget of results, which would achieve the policies now necessary in the European Union."
"By our amendments in the Committee on Budgets, we have made severe cut-backs in the programmes consuming the tax payers' money without any real value added."
"The cut-backs in agriculture, amounting to 553,000,000 euros, namely 77% of all the cut-backs operated, reveal another clear agenda of the Council to gradually eliminate this policy that the entire structure of the new Member States' economy depends on."
"I am glad that, in the Committee on Budgets, we have managed to reestablish the level of the funds designated to agriculture."
"I also hope that the operational programmes and the rural development programme will be approved as soon as possible by the European Commission."
"Besides these aspects, I would like to speak about the importance of the budget for the European Union's youth policy."
"The budget we have proposed operates a 9% increase in finances for lifelong learning programmes, reaching a total amount of 900,000,000 euros."
"These programmes have contributed to advancing the European idea more than anything else."
"90% of young people identify the European Union with the possibility to travel, to study and to work anywhere in Europe."
"For these young people, we have to do more."
"One of the problems they deal with is the small number of European scholarships, especially as regards the Erasmus programme."
"In the current budget, we have increased payments by 100,000,000 euros due to the European Union's enlargement to Romania and Bulgaria."
"Nevertheless, we have to make sure that a bigger share of this money reaches every student."
"Erasmus should not be an additional income for young students but, on the contrary, the main support for those with low financial possibilities."
"Last, but not least, I would like to remind the Commission of the commitments undertaken in the trialogue of July, namely to ensure an adequate number of jobs for the new Member States."
"At present, very few Romanians or Bulgarians work in management positions and, on the contrary, many of them work under temporary contracts."
"The additional funds we have provided to the European Union's Selection Office should be spent efficiently for the employment of permanent personnel for the new Member States as soon as possible."
"(BG) It is a challenge for a representative of Bulgaria, one of the newest EU Member States, to take part in the adoption of the 2008 budget as a full member."
"This has become possible thanks to the enlargement policy pursued by the European Union and supported also through its budgetary policy."
"I support the report and congratulate the rapporteurs and coordinators on the agreement they have reached with regard to the budget and its changes."
"The draft 2008 budget, in its Sustainable Growth part, makes it possible even for the newest EU Member States to achieve the goals facing them in connection with their membership."
"The operational programmes within the framework of the Structural Funds ensure high quality and qualifications of human resources, competitiveness, improvement of the infrastructure, strengthening of the administrative capacity in transport, the environment, etc. Regrettably, the available resources are less than what is needed."
"I wish to express my support also for the strategic increase of payments to the Structural Funds, the Social and Cohesion Funds, because this will enable them to expand the operational programmes and their capabilities."
"I support also the 30-percent reserve for the administrative expenditures line because I believe this is a way to ensure efficiency of expenditures and control over spending."
"The draft 2008 budget pays attention also to the new regions that have joined the EU."
"In the Black Sea Region, these are Bulgaria and Romania which are also borders of the European Union."
"The policy of the EU and the national governments is aimed at transforming the region into an area of security, stability and goodneighbourliness."
"The region needs improvement of the infrastructure, more investment, and adequate measures to protect the environment because of its high industrialisation and its transformation into a transfer zone for raw materials in the energy sector."
"The European Union with its policy and financing should guarantee both the environmental security and the stability and security of energy supplies to Europe.."
"The Black Sea Monitoring and the Framework Programme for the Black Sea Development is a pilot project which I am confident that the European Parliament will support; it is a right step towards good development of the Black Sea region and towards integration of the citizens of the Black Sea region into the EU membership policy."
"(LT) I would like to speak about the impact of the EU budget on the wellbeing of the ordinary citizens of Europe, some of whom are following our debates today."
"Very often we hear that the European Union must develop into the world's most competitive economy, and the budget can facilitate that."
"However, it should be restructured in order to be more efficient and should encourage scientific research and innovation."
"Regrettably, in reality it appears that the European Commission does not even have a definition of what constitutes scientific research."
"Various projects have different expenditures set to be financed according to the research and innovation programme."
"We constantly speak about Europe and its influence in the world."
"The 27-strong newly enlarged European Union is capable of making changes on a world scale."
"The budget allows substantial funding for aid for third countries."
"However, according to the investigations carried out by the Court of Auditors, the funds are very often used inefficiently."
"The reason for this is because most of the countries to which we give our aid are governed by non-democratic regimes."
"Human rights are being abused and aid projects help a handful of people to get richer rather than improve the wellbeing of ordinary people."
"I would therefore like to urge you, ladies and gentlemen, to ensure that we adhere to the condition defined in our documents, in particular that aid programmes should be allocated in line with the promotion of democracy and human rights."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, thank you to the whole budget team for their good work."
"Please allow me a few remarks from the point of view of the Committee on Regional Development."
"In its estimates, the Commission evaluated the need for finance and, in harmony with the threshold values of the Interinstitutional Agreement and the terms of the financial perspective, took into account the likely applications for the current period."
"Thus, logically, the commitments within the framework of the Structural Funds for 2008 increase by 0.9%, and payments by 3.2%, while monies for the Cohesion Fund increase by 14.4% for commitments and 36% for payments."
"Since the Commission is, in fact, the only institution that has unrestricted access to the required information in connection with overall financial requirement, our Committee was guided by the Commission's proposal and also unanimously and immediately corrected unjustified amendments undertaken by the Council in its draft budget."
"Above and beyond our amendments, we also simplified the administration and made the use of the funds more efficient, particularly against a background of the Lisbon and Göteborg goals."
"We focused on the unique status of small and medium-sized enterprises and traditional small business activities such as research and development."
"Not least, we considered it important to make special mention of the JEREMIE and JESSICA initiatives, to mention but two of the many key points in regional policy."
"We also support the Commission in facing the future demographic challenges in Europe, particularly that in some regions and even in entire Member States, population ageing has become a major problem due to declining birth rates."
"Family values must be promoted, for example by helping young women to balance family and career responsibilities."
"This is forward-looking policy, which must also be reflected in the key areas of regional policy."
"(NL) Mr President, a Europe anchored in solidarity: that is what we want."
"The 2008 budget contains some new elements that further demonstrate this."
"A more modern budget is also needed, however: one that is in keeping with the knowledge-based economy - and anchored in solidarity."
"At the initiative of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, more financial assistance is to be provided to Palestine and Kosovo."
"This is essential, however complex."
"There are other issues, too, where Europe must show solidarity."
"Support is needed for the Global Health Fund and for my initiative to reinforce sexual and reproductive health and rights in poor countries, examples being the reduction of maternal mortality and the right to an abortion."
"This supports the emancipation of women, thus aiding the development of poor countries."
"Solidarity is also relevant when it comes to the reorganisation of the EU budget."
"The best way of doing this, of course, is to reduce agricultural subsidies, which is eminently feasible now that prices are high."
"Europe must invest in new technology, and Galileo has shown that there is room for another budget."
"We can live with lower agricultural subsidies, whilst Galileo stands for increased employment and innovation."
"(SV) Thank you Mr President."
"The adoption of the budget each year is one of the most important duties we MEPs have."
"It is one of the few opportunities we have to send a very clear, collective message about what kind of EU we in Parliament want to see."
"Generally, I think that it is good that an increasing number of my fellow Members here in the Chamber seem to see the importance of holding back EU funds, but there is still much to be done."
"I think that it is important for us to set the right priorities in the budget, but the work on monitoring the money and its use is as important as budgeting for the right purposes."
"If we are doing it today, I think that unfortunately in many areas we are seeing that some of our money almost does more harm than good."
"In addition, the institutions must develop the EU's accounting system so that it is easier to understand and monitor the money, so that we can see both beforehand and afterwards how it is actually spent."
"It is a question of transparency."
"Personally, I would hope that the 2008 EU budget would signal more clearly an EU that prioritises, an EU that focuses on its core task - to create free movement of goods, services, persons and capital."
"But unfortunately this year's draft budget leaves much to be desired in this respect."
"Let me just take a few brief examples: grants for silkworm breeding, bee-keeping, cotton farming, energy crops, figs, hemp, nuts, olive groves, rice cultivation, and tobacco."
"Export subsidies for cereals, sugar and products from the wine sector."
"Altogether, these budget headings amount to more than EUR 1 858 436 000."
"Aside from the fact that the budget headings, in my view, are an incredible waste of European taxpayers' money, they are doing more harm than good."
"They affect people outside the Union."
"Nevertheless, one of the most serious examples is, I think, the EU's export assistance for agriculture, where the EU subsidises its own agriculture sector and thereby dumps goods and prices on the markets of poor countries."
"This invalidates the poor countries' natural competitive advantages and is a serious obstacle on their path to prosperity."
"We have to do something about this, not in 2013 but next year. Thank you."
"Chairman of the Committee on Budgets. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Budgets recommends for the first reading in the Plenary a 2008 budget of EUR 129.6 billion for commitments and EUR 124.2 billion for payments, with strict observance of all our agreements and commitments, both from the multi-annual programmes and the financial perspective and, I might add, well below the ceilings that we agreed in this multi-year plan, in a spirit of budgetary discipline and, at the same time, linked with an offer to the Council to resolve current issues such as Galileo and the financing of foreign and security policy sustainably."
"I would like to express my sincere thanks to the rapporteurs, Mr Itälä and Mr Virrankoski, who, together with the coordinators and staff, did an excellent job preparing for the first reading."
"Firstly, the Parliament budget."
"Between the vote by the Committee on Budgets and the vote in the Plenary, a process of conciliation has been under way in consultation with the Bureau of this House, with close involvement by the administration."
"As part of this process, we were able to resolve several contradictory positions judiciously and satisfactorily."
"However, I would like to add at this point that a Bureau and an administration must be willing to face questions and criticism from the Committee on Budgets, as that is part of our task."
"Part of the conflict that we discuss every year was able to be resolved by creating a deadline of two to three weeks between presentation of the administrative proposal on the Parliament budget and the decision by the Bureau, to enable the Groups to be listened to more closely at the beginning of the process rather than at the end of the procedure."
"Commissioner, in your letter dated 17 October, you again laid out the implementation of the budget as at the end of September."
"You showed where it was working well and where it was running into difficulty, where some programmes had possibly been implemented too late, and where the Commission itself had practised a little too much micromanagement regarding other questions for the Member States."
"However, overall, the report showed implementation has improved since the May report."
"If the Commission now wishes to remain credible, it can no longer claim late implementation or other difficulties for 2008 to justify being in arrears with payments or commitments in the implementation of the 2008 budget."
"Today we can say that, with the agreement between the institutions on the agencies - starting with the German Presidency and concluded by the Portuguese Presidency - and thanks to the exceptional work done by our permanent rapporteur Jutta Haug, the development of the agencies has been firmly re-established so that, in future, no agencies will be set up without adequate cost-benefit analyses and without clarifying whether they add any value."
"Therefore this must be continued in the code of conduct that is being agreed for the executive agencies."
"At this point, Commissioner, I must also say that this year, we dealt very circumspectly with the Commission's administration budget, but that does not have to be the case every year."
"However, the continued assessment of staff positions, screening, development - prudently and without exaggeration, but carried out very transparently - those stay on the agenda for us."
"Mr President, we have taken a very clear position on Galileo."
"When we talked about the Reform Treaty this morning and gave it solid support, then in future that will be called the Community method."
"If Member States believe they can rely on a hodgepodge of financing or on financing outside the Community budget then, in the light of this development in Europe, that is simply absurd and does not make sense."
"In my second point I would like to speak about the financing of the Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"Without Parliament, the CFSP would already be bankrupt, for we would have to front up with approximately EUR 90 million, according to the Decision of the Heads of State or Government in December 2005."
"When I now hear that we may have to go well beyond what the Council and the Commission put forward to us, with Palestine and Kosovo to be added as well, then we are prepared to find a way through."
"Obviously we will also have to talk about the flexibility instrument, on the basis of the vote."
"This also applies to further acknowledgement of Parliament's interests, as expressly - and correctly - called for by the Committee on Development."
"The Presidency must realise that, with the exception of Galileo and the Common Foreign and Security Policy, everything can be decided by Parliament on its own."
"Therefore my urgent recommendation: the Council needs to get a sufficient mandate so that we can put both Galileo and the Foreign and Security Policy on a firm footing - hopefully not only for 2008."
"If this is not achieved, then we are all going to have to have further sittings during the 2008 budget."
"The door is open for all negotiations, but we expect a clear signal from the Council that it is taking action on these two key questions."
"Either way, from the point of view of this Parliament, there will be a 2008 budget."
"(Applause)"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday 25 October 2007."
"Written declarations (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - We must demonstrate to the European taxpayer that the EU's budget is value for money and represents sound financial management."
"Therefore, the EP's continued monthly commute to Strasbourg totally contradicts this, especially with our focus on climate change."
"Whilst I welcome the comments in the Itälä report on greener use of transport, these hardly tackle the scale of the problem."
"We urgently need to act as pioneers and set a real example."
"On the Virrankoski report, I am disappointed by the level of funding for poverty reduction programmes to the poorest regions, including Asia."
"If the EU is to have credibility as a global power it needs to put its money where its mouth is."
"Whilst I welcome the support for Palestine and Afghanistan, in the case of the latter, the EU strategy needs greater collaboration with neighbouring countries India and Pakistan to achieve long-term success."
"Furthermore I regret the proposed reduction to CFSP funding, especially in Kosovo."
"This should not be delayed or underfunded."
"Finally, I support the emphasis on the Lisbon Agenda creating jobs and increasing skills."
"These initiatives will really bring added value from the EU to the people I represent in the West Midlands."
"(The sitting was temporarily suspended)"
"Membership of Parliament: see Minutes"
"Commission Question Time"
"The next item is Question Time (B6-0318/07)."
"We wanted today, and I think some colleagues are aware of this, to try a little experiment in order to make Question Time a little more friendly and interactive."
"I would therefore invite all Members of this House to come forward to the front row of seating so that we can be a little more friendly amongst ourselves and the Commission."
"Please, come forward to the front seats rather than sitting right at the back."
"I can see that some of you are still shy."
"Come on, it should be fun to have an experiment!"
"The following questions are addressed to the Commission."
"First part"
"Subject: Child abduction"
"In the light of the number of cases of child abduction and disappearances, what measures is the Commission proposing to coordinate Member States' means of preventing and punishing these types of acts throughout the European Union?"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - The Commission fully agrees on the importance of combating the disappearance and abduction of minors."
"Enhancing children's rights, as you all know very well, is one of my personal priorities."
"The first action undertaken by the European Commission in relation to this was to support, in 2001, the creation of a European network of organisations, the European Federation on Missing and Sexually Exploited Children, which is now called Missing Children Europe."
"To date, we have 21 organisations in 15 Member States."
"Then, with the financial backing of our Community programme, the Daphne Programme, several centres were created or revamped from 2001 to 2005, with the aid of Child Focus."
"Several Member States have, over the last 10 years, set up emergency call lines in order to speed up searches and support families of missing children."
"Cases of missing children and abduction can quickly become, and still become, cross-border phenomena."
"We therefore propose to have a single telephone number for urgent calls about missing children."
"To that end, the Decision of 15 February 2007 on reserving the national numbering range beginning with '116' for harmonised numbers for harmonised services of social value will be implemented."
"This is an important decision by each Member State, particularly in relation to the 116000 number for hotlines to report missing children."
"You know that putting in place the services corresponding to a 116 number remains the responsibility of Member States."
"There, unfortunately, I have to say that three Member States have not yet responded."
"Legal measures have been taken by 17 Member States."
"There have been calls for candidates for the management of the hotline numbers in 12 Member States, and only four Member States have so far chosen service providers: Belgium, Denmark, Greece and Portugal."
"So I am not at all satisfied at the state of play in implementation of the decision taken in February 2007."
"In addition to these emergency phone numbers, a mechanism of assistance in the search for missing children is necessary."
"Several systems already exist and can serve as an inspiration for a Europe-wide action."
"You know about the American system, 'Amber Alert', the French 'Alerte enlèvement' and the Greek 'Amber Alert Hellas' system, which are already in place."
"We support Member States in putting similar mechanisms in place nationally."
"Provided that all Member States adopt such mechanisms and that interconnection schemes are put in place, resolving cross-border cases would be possible and easier."
"To that end, we have drafted guidelines describing our idea for a Europe-wide child alert mechanism."
"The issue was discussed for the first time at the informal Justice and Home Affairs Council on 1 October 2007."
"Finally, we support the creation of an international database of child abuse images, which will be a new tool to help identify victims and criminals."
"The feasibility study and implementation phase are funded by the AGIS programme and, since September 2005, this database used by Interpol is funded mainly by G8 governments and private companies."
"So far this database has made it possible to locate and arrest several criminals in Europe and outside Europe, most recently a very well-known paedophile in Thailand, and save victims."
"- (ES) Madam President, thank you very much for enabling us to be face to face with the Commissioner, whom I have already asked many questions on similar matters."
"The issue of missing children is a distressing one."
"For example, in my islands alone, the Canaries, three children have disappeared in recent years without a trace, meaning that they have not even appeared in paedophile networks."
"They disappear completely, which leads us to wonder whether these children are used for certain purposes such as, for example, trade in organs, and whether mafia organisations with possible international connections are operating within the European Union."
"This makes me think that this is a matter that requires an initiative that is somewhat more ambitious than those that the Commission has undertaken so far."
"I know that the Commissioner has always been ambitious, but I also invite him to be ambitious in this area, as it is a distressing matter for parents and for society in general, because children are the most precious thing that we have."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (IT) Mr President, Mr Medina, I fully concur with your wishes and I can tell you how dissatisfied I am to see that even when we adopt initiatives, the Member States do not implement them."
"The idea of a single telephone number in Europe for urgent calls should have been specifically implemented by each Member State by the end of September."
"This is now the end of October, and only four Member States have a functioning system; the other 17 have adopted initiatives but are still lagging behind."
"The other proposal that we want to make is for closer cooperation to monitor what is commonly referred to as 'sex tourism'."
"Unfortunately many European citizens apparently travel as tourists to other parts of the world to commit horrible acts of paedophilia, and in this area I agree that international collaboration must be stepped up."
"I agree with you - and sadly we have proof - that missing children are often used for organ trafficking."
"Unfortunately this applies not only to my own region, but to other regions very close to the European Union, such as the Balkans, Eastern Europe and the Black Sea."
"Unfortunately, organ trafficking is a reality, not to mention the discovery of organ trafficking of adults and children from the Far East and South-east Asia."
"Obviously, even though this is an area which until now national governments have not been willing to hand over to the EU, it may soon be handled more effectively by the European Union, partly as a result of the adoption of the agreement on the new institutional treaty."
"(EL) Madam President, may I ask the Commissioner if it is certain that in all Member States births of children are being declared?"
"Is the number of children crossing the borders of the EU being recorded, so that their possible disappearance or the use of their organs can be made known?"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Yes, you are right."
"We have discovered cases of children not yet registered at border crossings, and that is why I attach great importance to identification."
"Identification means helping the countries of origin, either within the EU - though I do not think that is the case - or especially in neighbouring and partner countries, where there is sometimes a lack of control regarding registers, and where children who are not yet registered, or not registered at all, are a matter of particular concern to me."
"That is precisely why we have decided to aid strategic projects to help and strengthen the civil registry capabilities of partner and neighbour countries, partly through European funding programmes."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, in your examples, you specifically mentioned that four Member States had set up emergency call lines."
"There have been other issues - I remember the situation with the tsunami at that time - in which those who came into this area, for example to indulge their inclination for paedophilia, were protected by data protection and their relatives and the authorities were unaware who was really affected here."
"Is it not time to stop pussyfooting around and start naming these Member States?"
"'Naming and shaming' would be a suitable method of prompting these Member States to do what they should, so that they finally demonstrate better behaviour."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - I have already said that I am not at all satisfied with the level of implementation and, so far, only four Member States have implemented this decision."
"This decision now has to be implemented by all the Member States."
"The fact that only four Member States so far are implementing a decision unanimously taken in February 2007 shows that we have to do much more."
"Concerning the right balance between protecting the confidentiality of data, or the protection of privacy of data, and the fight against paedophilia, when we talk about paedophiles and crimes and the abuse of children, from my personal point of view I am on the side of the victims - the children - and I am not on the side of the criminals."
"So, provided that all the guarantees are acknowledged, we should first of all support the victims and parents, not the suspected criminals."
"Member of the Commission. - Actually, I had some problems pronouncing it myself."
"To begin with, I had hoped it would be eradicated without my having to learn how to pronounce it, but unfortunately it is becoming persistent so we now have to discuss the issue."
"First of all, I had the opportunity yesterday, during the one minute speeches, to hear the Honourable Member's intervention on this issue, and I share his concerns."
"One could say that, relatively speaking, we have a low number of infections - for example, about 250 in Italy as compared to more than 150 000 on the island of Réunion a few years ago."
"However, the worrying thing is the trend."
"What is actually raising our concerns is the fact that we now have tropical diseases spreading in Europe as a combination of climate change, which of course helps the proliferation and survival of the vector, and at the same time increased mobility, which allows the introduction of the virus via the movement of people coming from the tropics."
"It was important for us to take immediate measures."
"From the beginning the Italian authorities reacted correctly, rapidly and effectively, so one can now say that the situation is at a much lower level, even though we still have on-going cases."
"The first thing the Commission did was to take various measures, using existing instruments or adjusting these to deal with the situation."
"First of all we made sure that we offered technical support through the European Centre for Disease Control, once again proving the wise choice of the European Union in establishing such a centre."
"We now had to deal with this new threat and new form of challenge."
"We adapted our legislation and included vector-borne diseases in the list of diseases to be addressed as a priority."
"At the same time we asked Member States - and this is a legal obligation on them - to notify the Commission and other Member States through the early-warning response system."
"It is very important to be able to detect cases as soon as possible in order to prevent the spread of the disease."
"The European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC), in addition to the case definitions, also produced standard operating procedures and is updating them regularly."
"Very importantly, we upgraded and strengthened laboratory capacity in order to detect and identify the chikungunya virus."
"We did this through the European Network for Diagnostics of 'Imported' Viral Diseases, which is funded under the public health programme."
"Also, through the same programme, we are funding joint activities with Member States to further strengthen preparedness for public health emergencies."
"We had the opportunity to discuss in plenary a communication and action plan on generic preparedness, which was adopted in 2005."
"The system is in place and we can use it of course, and it has been used, but we will of course adapt it and adjust it to be able to deal with this form of health threat as well."
"Information for the public is very important, and is something we also do through the ECDC, both for the areas affected and also for travellers."
"Technical guidance documents on the rapid detection of cases of chikungunya fever are in place, as the cornerstone for an effective epidemiological surveillance."
"Also, the ECDC has produced a robust package of technical guidance documents: information for health care workers; case definitions for chikungunya fever; and flow charts for identification of cases."
"These are available and are currently being used by the competent authorities to facilitate decision-making processes at national level."
"We are also dealing immediately with the issue of blood safety, which is an important factor as well, with the cooperation of the national competent authorities."
"However, if the situation persists, my services are ready to adopt a new donor-deferral rule for this disease as well."
"The new public programme and other instruments will also fund research in addressing many issues related to vector-borne diseases, as we also need to look at the issue of the insects themselves, and of course at global change through projects like Eden, which concerns emerging diseases in a changing European environment."
"All this demonstrates how climate change has an immediate effect on health."
"In parallel, I should mention that we also have problems in animal health which have developed because of climate change."
"The European Commission is planning to adopt a communication next year dealing with that aspect of climate change too."
"(SK) Commissioner, thank you for your competent reply and congratulations to the Italian authorities for their appropriate action."
"Looking at the whole matter, I find it somewhat strange that no vaccine against the chikungunya virus is available yet, even though, according to some data, up to 1 million people were infected with the virus in Africa."
"I understand this to some extent when it comes to bird flu because in that case a virus that can be transmitted has not been isolated yet and therefore we cannot develop a vaccine."
"However, in this case we seem to have a virus that can be identified by serologic and other methods, and a serum or vaccine against it could now be developed."
"If the virus happened to spread, such a serum or vaccine would be an effective treatment against the chikungunya virus and perhaps also against an even worse infection: dengue fever."
"Member of the Commission. - The Commission is fully aware of the scale of the humanitarian needs inside Iraq and its neighbouring countries."
"The Commission's response to this crisis is twofold."
"Firstly, in order to support the refugees from Iraq and neighbouring countries, the Commission has immediately responded with the financial decision on EUR 6.2 million in humanitarian aid, adopted in May 2007, to address the most urgent needs of the refugees."
"That assistance will be further increased to EUR 7 million by the end of 2007."
"The Commission has engaged with the governments of Syria and Jordan, which bear most of the burden of the refugee crisis, to develop assistance programmes."
"Those governments have clearly indicated that they were not in favour of external humanitarian assistance programmes, implemented via international organisations and NGOs."
"They expect the international community to support their national systems, mainly in the fields of education and health, as these systems also benefit Iraqi refugees."
"Consequently, the Commission has identified quick impact projects for a total of EUR 37.7 million, for which the Commission is in the process of consulting Member States."
"All these actions form the Commission's immediate response to the refugees' most pressing needs."
"The Commission realises that they only partially alleviate the enormous suffering and the pressure on the institutions and social fabric of neighbouring countries, and that is why it is currently further developing its response strategy in order to match it with appropriate funding."
"Secondly, as far as the situation inside Iraq is concerned, the Commission is supporting the International Committee of the Red Cross with, so far, EUR 4 million, and is currently identifying additional solid and acceptable partners operational in Iraq with a view to increasing its level of assistance."
"It has to be acknowledged that while there are significant humanitarian needs, there are also significant impediments to the delivery of humanitarian aid."
"These are severe security concerns and problems of access that prevent the Commission and any other donor from allocating funds which are truly commensurate with the level of needs."
"There is in fact a dearth of humanitarian partners able to operate and implement programmes inside Iraq that properly address the needs of the most vulnerable people."
"Finally, the Commission would like to recall that it is the main financial contributor to the international reconstruction fund facility for Iraq, with a contribution of EUR 123 million."
"That is, by the way, 46 % of the total contributions to date."
"Since 2003, the Commission has committed over EUR 800 million in Iraq."
"(PT) Madam President, Commissioner, thank you very much for your clarifications, but may I remind you that Iraqi refugees in Egypt are already estimated to number 200 000; the European Commission is not offering anything for Egypt."
"The University of Amman has just conducted a study which estimates that Jordan has more than a million refugees - an absolutely catastrophic macroeconomic impact; the European Commission is not taking any steps to address this."
"Even Israel is setting up a quite remarkable medical assistance programme for Iraqi children."
"As for Syria, I am not a party to the talks that the Commission has been holding with Syria, but I have often spoken with the Syrian authorities: the fact is that they already have perhaps 2 million more inhabitants."
"Today, Madam President, allow me just to remind you of this, today, right now, in Rabiah, on the border between Syria and Iraq, a huge humanitarian disaster is developing: thousands of Iraqis, who heard a rumour that the borders were about to open, have gathered there and cannot enter."
"The situation is absolutely tragic and we can no longer ignore what is going on."
"I think we all share your concern, but our rules allow half a minute for supplementary questions."
"Member of the Commission. - I have already mentioned that the governments, especially the Syrian Government, which the honourable Member referred to, have clearly indicated that they were not in favour of external humanitarian assistance programmes implemented via the international organisations and NGOs."
"So the amount of assistance provided reflects the reluctance of the Syrian and Jordanian authorities to let international non-state actors, such as the UN and NGOs, intervene in their respective countries."
"Our assistance can only be directed through organisations that are accepted by the local authorities and have sufficient operational capacity."
"This imposes a natural limit on what we can do."
"We are, however, working on capacity-building programmes and engaging in direct dialogue with the Jordanian and Syrian authorities to strengthen our implementing capacity in these countries."
"It should be noted, if I may say so, that the Iraqi Government itself seems very reluctant to assist its neighbours."
"The Iraqi Government has repeatedly declared it will allocate USD 25 million to assist Iraqi refugees."
"However, although commitments were made at the Sharm el-Sheikh Conference last May and relations were strengthened between Iraqi, Syrian and Jordanian officials, it seems as though Iraq is not cooperating sufficiently."
"We therefore have to ask the Iraqi Government to assume at least its financial responsibility for its own citizens."
"The lack of coordination among UN agencies in managing humanitarian crises is of high concern."
"We note strong competition - and it is awful to say so - between the UN humanitarian agencies, instead of close cooperation."
"We hope that the appointment of a new humanitarian coordinator will improve the ability of our UN partners to address the crisis."
"(LT) Recently Turkey, a candidate for EU membership, launched military action against Iraqi Kurds in Iraq."
"What is your view on this?"
"What impact could this action have on the situation in Iraq?"
"Would any aid be required and what is the Commission's opinion on Turkey's action?"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - It has been drawn to the attention of the honourable Member that the detailed answers provided below relate only to the Commission, which is of course by far the major employer amongst European institutions."
"One of the purposes of Directive 1999/70/EC concerning the framework agreement on fixed-term work is to establish a framework to prevent the abuse arising from the use of successive fixed-term employment contracts or relationships."
"To prevent abuse, clause 5(1) obliges Member States, where there are no actual legal measures to prevent abuse, to introduce one or more of the following measures to prevent abuse arising from the use of successive fixed-term contracts:"
"objective reasons justifying the renewal of such contracts and relationships;"
"the maximum total duration of fixed-term contracts or relationships;"
"the number of renewals of such contracts or relationships."
"The rules governing the employment of staff in the European Institutions are laid down in the Staff Regulations, which were discussed with staff representatives before being adopted by the Council."
"The European Institutions are thus bound by law to respect the provisions of these Staff Regulations."
"The Staff Regulations allow the European Institutions to recruit three main types of staff: permanent officials, temporary agents and contract agents."
"Temporary agents and permanent officials occupy a post in the establishment plan."
"There is no limit to the level of responsibility which permanent officials and temporary agents can exercise."
"The situation for contract agents is different."
"They do not occupy a post in the establishment plan and they must work under the supervision of a permanent official or a temporary agent."
