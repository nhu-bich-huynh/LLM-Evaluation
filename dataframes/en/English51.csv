"This is why I appreciate the action taken by Mr Prodi and by the Commission over which Mr Prodi presides: because the Commission is succeeding in providing guidance."
"Our political initiative, and that of the European Parliament, must strengthen this ability and force the Member States to transform their short-sightedness into the capacity to create a vision, to give political direction enabling recovery to take place, to make further progress in the field of a major supranational authority."
"What we want to achieve is not merely a wider geographical Union of 25 States, what we must achieve is a genuine political objective."
"Mr President, ten speeches ago our committee chairman, Mr Wynn, said that everything that was important had been said."
"I want to add my voice to those who congratulated Mr Mulder, the chairman of the committee, Mrs Schreyer and the expertise that we have all around us."
"Look at all the expertise that is involved in this job and I genuinely mean 'expertise' of our assistants in our Groups, the staff of the committee and the Commission and the experts in the Council of Ministers."
"Then look at what we apply all this expertise to: a game that I have sometimes described as push penny, which was a game played on a window sill or a table using two pennies, a halfpenny and two sets of goals and you push the penny around."
"I am becoming increasingly disillusioned with this whole budgetary procedure and I tend to see it as a game of push penny."
"Literally one cent, one per cent of the GDP of the European Union, and what power do we have over it?"
"The agricultural budget has been given to six or seven million people out of the 400 million people in the Union."
"It is spread most unfairly: EUR 17 000 per farmer to French farmers, EUR 3 000 per farmer to Portuguese and Greek farmers."
"But we have to forget about that."
"The Council puts that there and that has to be financed anyway."
"Look at our next big spending: regional policy."
"What does it do?"
"I come from a country that received generous portions of regional finance early on, but that is not so today."
"Spain, for example, receives a net transfer of about EUR 200 per capita a half per cent of GDP."
"If Spain is an example of our policies of solidarity in regional policy, then I say it gets nothing."
"That half per cent of GDP makes no difference: it is imaginary."
"Mr Aznar may sell his policy of social economic cohesion."
"I say we need to look at all this again."
"There are so many things we could do without increasing public spending throughout the European Union by transferring some things from national competence to European competence."
"Development cooperation has to be one of them and research has to be another."
"We are not going to build a Community and send in regulations to the new countries in Eastern Europe."
"We are already unpopular."
"Nobody is questioning the existence of the state."
"There are a lot of people questioning the existence of Europe. If the budget is to be an instrument of building Europe, we had better start thinking anew."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs and indeed all those concerned with the budgetary process."
"I am rather an absentee member of the Committee on Budgets myself."
"I wanted to talk this afternoon about a small but highly sensitive programme the European Initiative on Democracy and Human Rights, which is Line 1904 in the budget and to which amendments have been tabled on which we will vote tomorrow."
"I was the rapporteur who set up this fund in 1992, which now has EUR 100 million in it."
"I am currently rapporteur for the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy on the two financial regulations which will cover the financing of this programme in 2005 and 2006, as well as the communication from the Commission called 'Reintegrating human rights and democracy in the Mediterranean'."
"It is on this particular point that I want to focus."
"It seems to me that we need to be very conscious of the arc of instability running up from Morocco through the near-neighbour countries to the European Union as we enlarge next year."
"Indeed this whole region was called an 'arc of reform' by President Bush, but it is not so."
"There are many problems, some of which were referred to by Mr McCartin just now, and by other speakers too."
"The European Parliament, which set up this Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights, should now encourage the Commission immediately to refocus its 2004 priorities on this wider Europe programme, and in particular on the Arab countries."
"Some will know that the UNDP 2002 report focused on the lack of democracy in the Arab countries."
"The 2003 report contains surveys of public opinion in those countries which show that the Arabs actually have the highest demand and appetite for democracy of any region in the world."
"We in the European Parliament therefore have a special duty to sustain, encourage and develop those programmes, particularly in 2004."
"I intend to make use of the codecision on these two financial regulations to encourage the Commission and the Council to allow the European Parliament once more to have the oversight that it used to have on these programmes and to provide the political cover which the Council of Ministers cannot provide."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as the final speaker for my group before the rapporteur, I wish to pay tribute to the major consensus which we have achieved here. However, I also have a number of critical comments concerning the manner in which the Group of the Party of European Socialists has liaised with the press during this budget procedure."
"The basic question is this. Can the budget be used for political purposes?"
"Can we place items in the reserve in order to achieve political goals?"
"We seem to be doing so in a wide variety of areas, Mr Walter."
"We are doing so in Afghanistan, because we have said: ‘Various things that this House views as desirable are not happening in Afghanistan."
"We have the impression that the Commission is downplaying the importance of combating the drugs trade."
"Please supply us with the information about what you are doing, and then we will release the funds.’"
"Mrs Gill’s budget is full of reserves which we intend to use as a means to persuade the administration to take action and ensure that at least some progress is made."
"In this respect, this budget is indeed an instrument for this House to signal its political goals."
"We in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats adopted the same approach to the Vienna-based European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia (EUMC), when at the height of the debate – namely when the Centre refused for more than two weeks to publish a study on anti-Semitism which was then published by our fellow Member Mr Cohn-Bendit and others – we asked: ‘Why on earth are you getting EUR 6 million per year if you are not going to publish your reports?’"
"That was precisely what we did, although Mr Walter did not notice. When he finally woke up, he issued press releases that said: ‘Mr Laschet has no expertise whatsoever."
"The Committee on Budgets cannot do this.’"
"Mr Walter, I would have expected you to table a motion here today to retrieve the funds from the reserve."
"After all, the plenary could have made that happen."
"Just because you sleep through decisions that we take in the Committee on Budgets, it is unfair of you to go to the press and issue this kind of press release."
"I will give you a shout at around 5 p.m. today, shall I? ‘Good morning, Mr Walter, the items have been put on ice, and the Committee on Budgets will only release them when the confusion between politics and academia at the EUMC has been resolved’."
"You might like to mull over this simple piece of advice, Mr Walter, before you make such ridiculous statements again."
". Mr President, it is very kind of you to give me the floor once more."
"I should like to thank everyone who has contributed to this debate."
"I am glad that there is indeed a broad consensus, in so far as I am able to bring this about."
"However, that is not the reason that I have asked for the floor."
"Mrs Gill and I have had an excellent working relationship this year, but we have forgotten one thing this afternoon."
"We have not thanked the Commission specifically enough for its constructive cooperation."
"Mrs Schreyer was always very open and always available for discussion, as were her officials."
"We greatly appreciate this."
"This budget could not have been achieved without the active cooperation of the Commission in seeking solutions to the problems that arose in the course of the year."
"Once more, my thanks for this, and my thanks once more to every one of you."
"I believe, Mr Mulder, that the applause coming from all sides of the Chamber is ample display of this House’s gratitude to you for your work."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote on this important dossier will take place on Thursday at 11.30 a.m."
"Thus concludes our budget debate."
"The sitting is adjourned until 5.30 p.m, when it will resume with questions to the Council."
"– The 2004 Budget for an enlarged Europe is less than 1% of gross national income, the lowest since 1997."
"Commitments are decreasing; payments are decreasing."
"Structural funds, such as agricultural expenditure, are similarly decreasing."
"Funds from Heading 4 allocated to foreign aid have been reduced to a bare minimum: aid to Latin America has also been cut by EUR 35 million."
"There is great financial pressure on essential elements of EU policy, such as human rights or the duty to provide help to the most needy. Funds for development aid have been similarly hit by measures of devastating severity."
"In such conditions, how can we seriously believe that poverty will be eradicated by 2015?"
"As for the question of funds for Iraq, it is not only a matter of finance."
"The occupation must end immediately."
"The Iraqi people need to recover their sovereignty as quickly as possible so that they themselves can identify their needs and arrange the means to satisfy those needs."
"Recourse to the flexibility instrument will release EUR 95 million."
"The solution proposed – to reduce funds from Heading 4 – is unacceptable."
"This Budget does not meet the challenges that the EU must meet today for a fairer, more caring world."
"What is the EU committed to doing to secure a democratic resolution of the appalling situation in Iraq and the withdrawal of the occupying forces from that country ?"
"– At the outset, the Council wishes to reiterate the European Union’s commitment to contribute to the political and economic reconstruction of Iraq."
"The European Council of 16 and 17 October 2003 considered the following factors essential for the success of the operation: adequate security conditions, a major pivotal role for the UN, a realistic timetable for handing over political responsibility to the Iraqi people, the creation of a transparent multilateral donor fund in order to channel the support of the international community."
"From the security point of view, the situation still gives cause for concern and the recent waves of terrorist attacks are creating extreme difficulties for the efforts being made in Iraq to achieve stability and reconstruction."
"As regards reconstruction, the European Union gave firm commitments at the Madrid Donors’ Conference."
"Given that security continues to be a priority in Iraq, the Council hopes that the positive outcome of the Madrid Conference may rapidly be translated into tangible results on the ground."
"The agreement reached on 15 November 2003 between the Coalition Provisional Authority, which holds power in Iraq, and the Iraqi Government Council to speed up the transfer of powers to the Iraqis is a positive step."
"The new plan provides for the installation of a newly elected government in Iraq by the middle of 2004."
"The European Union is prepared to help the new Iraq get back on its feet."
"The European Council has called on the Commission and the High Representative, Mr Solana, to present to it, by March 2004, a medium-term strategy for the Union’s relations with Iraq."
"At its meeting in Brussels on 12 December 2003, the European Council confirmed this approach in its conclusions – points 49 and 53 – and the Presidency, on behalf of the European Union, released a statement on 15 December concerning the capture of Saddam Hussein in which the Union, once again, states that, in light of this important event, the political process in Iraq needs to make progress, with the widest possible involvement of the people, towards the swift transfer of sovereignty to a transitional Iraqi Government and towards the establishment of the conditions necessary for the country’s economic and social reconstruction and development."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I believe that the Union, as a political entity, must give effective and universal joint commitments on issues as serious as Iraq, which we all hope will be resolved as soon as possible, especially when, despite the capture of Saddam Hussein, we face the near certainty of daily carnage and a drawn-out conflict, in addition to an extremely serious political problem of territorial, ethnic, religious and social integration that cannot be resolved simply by placing on the table naïve demonstrations of goodwill."
"Apart from the positive measures that the European Union has adopted, will the Council speak with a single voice in the quest for peace and solidarity in its talks with the UN, the United States, and with the states in the region?"
"Or will the Union remain paralysed, as it is today, in the face of this tragedy?"
"To conclude, does the President-in-Office of the Council really believe that all resistance in Iraq is simply terrorist activity, as he has just stated?"
". – Excuse me, but I did not fully understand the question."
"If, as it appears, the Member was asking in his last question whether the Council considers that there will be a split over the approach towards reconstruction in Iraq, my reply is that I hope that will not happen and we will work towards that end."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I am delighted that Saddam Hussein is to be tried for his violations of human rights, and that he and all dictators who commit crimes in the world should be prosecuted."
"Today is World Day of Peace and, to celebrate this event, the Pope has said some interesting things, including, amongst other things, that in order to combat terrorism, repression is not enough, and he also said that decisions relating to measures to be applied to States must be adopted within the framework of the United Nations."
"Do you believe that the invasion of Iraq is in line with the words of the Pope on this World Day of Peace?"
"I hope you have understood my question."
"I do not know, Mr Ortuondo, whether it is really a supplementary question to mention the Pope."
"But Mr Antonione is entitled to reply as he sees fit, but only if he wishes to do so."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, one of the questions I asked referred to your statement that all resistance in Iraq is terrorism."
"I believe that, at the very least, you should answer this question, because I believe it is profoundly relevant."
"Mr Ortuondo and Mr Nogueira, I would ask you not to get into a general debate on Iraq, since we often discuss these matters in this House."
"There is a clarification of what you asked."
"What did Mr Nogueira ask?"
". – I do not think I said anything of the kind."
"Frankly, I believe it is clear what the situation is in Iraq."
"That terrorist activity exists on a wide-scale can be inferred by anyone with access to information services."
"At the same time, it is clear that it is not only terrorist activity that is taking place, but this is not the place to establish the respective percentages of terrorist and non-terrorist activities."
"I would ask you, Mr Ortuondo, if you really have a point of order, to make it, and if not, not to speak."
"You have fifteen seconds for your point of order."
"Mr President, my question related, firstly, to whether the invasion of Iraq has demonstrated that terrorism cannot only be combated through repression – and we should ask the Iraqis who they consider to be the terrorists – and, secondly, to whether the decision has been taken within the framework of the United Nations or within another very particular United States framework."
"On 27 July 2003 the tanker ‘Tasman Spirit’ which was being directed by a local pilot ran aground at the entrance of Karachi harbour, leaking a substantial amount of its cargo and causing an environmental disaster."
"The 'polluter pays' principle is not in question."
"However, whereas in the case of the ‘Prestige’, the Spanish authorities held the shipowning company accountable, in the case of the ‘Tasman Spirit’ the Pakistani authorities are holding the entire crew accountable and have banned the Greek seamen - EU citizens - and their Filipino colleagues from leaving Pakistan."
"The Pakistani authorities have also detained the mechanic Nikos Pappas, the salvage master, who is employed by a different shipowning company and arrived in Pakistan on 17 August, 20 days after the shipwreck occurred."
"How does the Council intend to respond to this case of hostage-taking of European citizens by the Pakistani authorities which has outraged Greek public opinion and what urgent does it intend to take the Pakistani Government?"
". – The Council is interested in the case of the Greek and Filipino seamen placed under house arrest in Pakistan and in the measures taken by the Pakistani authorities."
"It considers that the request of the Pakistani Government regarding the detainees is groundless and unprecedented in international law."
"Intensive negotiations are under way with the Pakistani authorities and various steps have been taken to support the Greek seamen, including via the head of the EU mission in Islamabad and during the recent visit to Brussels of the Pakistani Foreign Affairs Minister."
"On 4 November 2003, the Council called on the Presidency of the Union, in Islamabad, to take urgent steps with a view to securing the immediate release of the persons concerned."
"This initiative was taken on 9 December on the basis of a letter, which was the result of prior cooperation between the Greek and Italian authorities during a meeting in which the crew members’ lawyers also took part."
"– Thank you very much, Mr President-in-Office."
"What you said is positive and demonstrates sensitivity on the part of the Council."
"I would repeat that this is a hostage issue."
"The ship's cook cannot be held for an accident caused by the ship, at the pilots' responsibility of course, which resulted in pollution."
"Nor can the seaman who swabs the decks. Nor can the salvage company manager."
"In this sense, I should like to ask the Minister to take , until the Italian Presidency's dying breath, if I may put it thus, on a major humanitarian issue involving European citizens."
"In other words, so that these people can spend Christmas and the New Year at home."
"In other words, would it be prepared to intervene with the Pakistani Government at a very high level, at the level of Prime Minister and President-in-Office of the European Council or at the level of the Italian Foreign Minister?"
"Once again, I thank the Italian Presidency."
"No, no, I offered the floor to Mr Antonione, but he listened and gestured to me, in principle, that he is not going to reply."
"If Mr Antonione wishes to answer – and I say this to him explicitly – at the request of the honourable Member, then he may do so."
"Mr Antonione is entitled to reply with words or with gestures, as he sees fit."
". – I believe that I already replied to the Member’s request when I confirmed that we intend to take urgent steps to secure the immediate release of the persons concerned."
"I believe this covers our intention and the measures we are taking to resolve the situation at the earliest opportunity and we hope that a solution can be found before the Christmas holidays."
". – The right to enjoy the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health is a fundamental right which is in line with the provisions of Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights."
"That right is currently denied to more than one fifth of the world’s population."
"The lack of health care and services, supplies and information and the spread of HIV and AIDS are jeopardising all attempts to eradicate poverty which, according to the Treaty, is the main objective of Community development policy, as confirmed in the joint declaration of the Council and Commission of 10 November 2000 and enshrined in the UN’s millennium development objectives."
"Pursuant to Article 35 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, in defining and implementing all Union policies and activities, a high level of human health protection must be assured."
"The European Community’s development policy with regard to sexual and reproductive health is based on the action programme of the UN International Conference on Population and Development held in Cairo in 1994 and on the key measures, known as ‘Cairo + 5’, adopted in 1999 by the UN XXI General Assembly."
"Those programmes and key measures stipulate that reproductive health should cover: advice, information, education, communication and services in respect of family planning; education and services in respect of pre-natal care, safe childbirth and post-natal care, with particular reference to breast feeding and health care for the newly born child and mother; prevention of and appropriate treatment for sterility; prevention of abortions performed under dangerous conditions and appropriate treatment for complications caused by such abortions; treatment of infections of the reproductive organs, of sexually transmitted diseases and of other conditions affecting reproductive health; information, education and advice, where appropriate, in respect of human sexuality, reproductive health and responsible parenting."
"On 15 July 2003, the European Parliament and the Council adopted the regulation on aid for policies on reproductive and sexual health rights in developing countries."
"That regulation aims to provide financial assistance and specific advice for the purpose of improving reproductive and sexual health in developing countries and guaranteeing observance of human rights."
"Recital 16 clearly stipulates that the regulation prohibits the promotion of incentives in favour of sterilisation or abortion and that abortion should never be presented as a method of family planning."
"It should be noted that, amongst the specific measures eligible for the Community’s financial support, Article 3 of the regulation includes the reduction in the number of abortions performed under dangerous conditions."
"Within the framework of European Union policy concerning the promotion of human rights, fundamental freedoms, democratisation and the rule of law in third countries, Council Regulation No 975/1999 on development cooperation policy and Council Regulation No 976/1999 on Community operations other than those of development cooperation aim, , to make a technical and financial contribution to measures with the particular aim of promoting and safeguarding human rights and the fundamental freedoms enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and of other international instruments concerning the development and consolidation of democracy and the rule of law."
"Finally, as regards the last question, Recital 5 of the aforementioned Regulation No 1567/2003 provides as follows: ‘The Community and its Member States uphold the right of their individuals to decide freely on the number and spacing of their children; they condemn any violation of human rights in the form of compulsory abortion, compulsory sterilisation, infanticide, or the rejection, abandonment or abuse of unwanted children as a means of curbing population growth’."
"Thank you, Mr President, for your very detailed reply."
"However, I have a supplementary question, which can really be answered with a simple yes or no. I understood that abortion should not be used as a family planning method."
"After all, that is what the resolution adopted by this House says. My question, therefore, is this: Does the term ‘reproductive health’ include the promotion of abortion, yes or no?"
". – No."
"Does the Council believe that EU funding of organisations which provide abortion where legal, or which promote legislation for abortion where currently illegal, is compatible with the declaration by the World Medical Association's second assembly in Geneva in 1948, which calls for the utmost respect for human life, from the time of conception?"
"Does the Council believe that the Republic of Ireland's budget for bilateral overseas aid, which commits almost more funds for reproductive health than for safe drinking water and adequate sanitation, is compatible with the European Union's commitment to improving the provision of basic health care in the developing world?"
"–I am not in a position to go into the details of this question and, therefore, to answer it fully because, to be quite honest, I do not know what the honourable Member means by ‘policy on abortion’."
"We could spend a long time discussing the type of abortion we are referring to – spontaneous abortion or induced abortion."
"I really do not feel able, personally, to give a detailed answer to a question framed in this way."
"I can only make the general point, as I said in my main answer, and repeated in the following answer, that we do not accept that abortion should form part of policies on reproductive and birth control education."
"– Mr President, this is not strictly speaking a supplementary question, but, with your permission, a very brief reminder of the Rules of Procedure, with reference to Rule 43."
"Listening to the President-in-Office of the Council’s answers to Members of this House, it strikes me that they are extremely important and deserve to be heard by more of us."
"Furthermore, Rule 43 calls this session ‘Question time to the Council and Commission’ and I believe it would be very useful – even though it is the Council, of course, that is deluged with such questions – if replies were given in the presence of a Commission representative. That way, by abiding more strictly by the letter of the Rules of Procedure, we would have a greater understanding of what the different institutions think of the questions put to them."
"Mr Gollnisch, I can see that you are a perfectionist when it comes to the Rules of Procedure, but what the Rules of Procedures say is clear and that is that Members can put questions and can put them to whoever they wish, to the Council or to the Commission."
"These questions are often put to the Commission as well, but that is for another day."
"You have misunderstood my question."
"I am saying that it would be useful to have a Commission representative present to hear the Council’s replies."
"That is all I wanted to say."
"That is all very well, but you can find another way to make that point since we cannot take up the time of Members who have put questions and wish to receive a reply, as we are now doing."
"Following the EU-China Summit, we can see that the line followed by the Commission and Council with regard to China is positive and constructive, and that its effects will be beneficial to our interests and to the progress of the Chinese people."
"We are, however, perplexed by the radical difference between this policy towards China and that followed towards Cuba."
"We should like to know the keys that justify this differentiation."
"Does the Council think that respect for human rights and the rule of law – summary court proceedings and the application of the death penalty, freedom of expression and religion, political and social pluralism, etc. – is more satisfactory in China than in Cuba?"
"Has the Council decided to advise the Member States’ ambassadors to invite Chinese ‘dissidents’ to their respective national day celebrations?"
"Would it be reasonable to freeze cultural cooperation with China?"
"What reasons underpin the difference in behaviour towards one country and the other?"
"Is it the number of inhabitants, the economic and commercial potential, or the distance between their capital cities and Washington?"
". – The Council notes that the European Union has given a commitment to observe, wherever they may happen to be under threat, the principles of freedom and democracy, as well as human rights and fundamental freedoms."
"It takes every opportunity, apart from when meeting with its interlocutors, to uphold and defend these principles in general terms as it does so, when necessary, in specific cases."
"In pursuing this objective, however, the European Union may give preference to a variety of means and instruments in order to ensure that its measures have maximum effect and to take into account the particular characteristics of each national situation."
"The instruments at the European Union’s disposal, and developments with regard to individual cases, are reported in greater detail in the annual reports on human rights, about which the European Parliament is regularly kept informed."
"The Council notes that, as regards Cuba, the European Parliament has supported the Council’s action in various resolutions."
"Further, the Council stresses that, in any event, it is not competent to express with regard to the situation of such third countries comparative judgments like those expressed in the question."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I am surprised that you should reply to such a highly political question in such bureaucratic terms; but since that is how you want it, I must ask whether the Council intends to establish measures for China similar to those established for Cuba, such as recommending that the Embassies of the Member States receive representatives of the opposition, of the resistance relating to Tibet, or defenders of human rights who clearly do not take the line of the Chinese authorities, over the holidays."
"That is what my question relates to."
". – I believe that I have already given a reply which, as the honourable Member has observed, I understand is bureaucratic and not political;"
"I note that fact and I am sorry."
"Nevertheless, as the Member can easily understand and knows better than I do, I reply on behalf of all fifteen countries of the European Union; the position adopted by those countries may not always have a political direction which is shared in its entirety, such that the questions – as you know – are prepared by EU officials irrespective of which country holds the EU presidency."
"Therefore, if the replies are bureaucratic, this is rooted in and is part of the current make-up of our European Institutions."
"That reply, however, also contains, in a manner of speaking, the answer to your further question insofar as it states that we must occasionally inform ourselves about the particular situation of each individual country, and therefore I do not think it is appropriate or fitting to make comparisons between one country and another."
"In that sense, I can only tell you that no assessment has yet been made with regard to any possible action to be taken in respect of China, and to an even lesser extent has any assessment been made as to whether such action should be on a par with that taken against Cuba."
"In view of the length of time that has elapsed since the original Commission proposal to replace Council Regulation (EEC) 3820/85(1) on Drivers' Hours, with still no news of a common position being established, would the Council agree that it is reasonable to expect a common position to be prepared without further delay?"
"Could the Council advise when the Parliament might expect to see such a document?"
"The Council would like to assure the honourable Member that, since the proposal in question was tabled, several Presidencies have tried to make headway on this issue with a view to achieving a Council common position on the matter."
"Considerable resources have, in fact, already been appropriated for negotiations on this issue."
"Nevertheless, there were differences in opinion in the Council, which remain today, on a number of key elements of the proposal for a regulation, which have led each of these Presidencies to draw the conclusion that it would not be possible to achieve a qualified majority on the Council common position."
"Recently, under the Italian Presidency, the Council bodies once again assessed the possibility of achieving a common position on the proposal for a regulation in question."
"The incoming Irish Presidency has stated that it intends to continue negotiations within the Council bodies, on the basis of the progress achieved to date, with a view to reaching a political agreement on the Council common position during its Presidency, that is to say during the first half of 2004.The common position will, of course, be presented to Parliament as soon as a political agreement has been reached."
"In my constituency there are organisations, such as the Shropshire Playbus Association, that are very concerned that the valuable local service provided by mobile educational play areas could be at risk if the exemption specified in Article 13(1)(f) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3820/85 on drivers' hours were to be revoked as part of any proposal to replace or update this regulation."
"I should like to ask the President-in-Office, firstly, if he values the work of such organisations, and secondly, if so, whether he would support the Council doing what is necessary in any revision of the regulation so that such organisations may continue to perform this important service to society."
"I am sorry that I am not able to give a precise answer."
"I can only take note of this supplementary remark and the information that the honourable Member has provided us with in order to investigate the matter and, if appropriate, also to give those who will have the task of leading the work during the next six months the chance to reply in more detail to this request too."
"On 12 November, the parliament-appointed Greek National Radio and Television Council (ESR) decided to impose a fine of EUR 100 000 on the private television station Mega Channel for showing two men kissing in the popular late-night TV series 'Close your eyes'."
"Mr Laskaridis, President of ESR, reportedly stated that 'there have been unacceptable and extreme dialogues which prepared a vulgar atmosphere and led to an event which might happen in the society but it is not usual."
"It is a peculiarity which is out of the productive process of life'."
"Demonstrations have followed in Athens, while the private TV station has announced that it will appeal to higher courts, and a petition was signed by all private TV stations calling for a rethink of the decision."
"Does the Council not believe that this decision is contrary to Art. 6 TEU and to the European Convention on Human Rights?"
"Will the Council express its concern to the Greek Government concerning the homophobic decision of the ESR?"
"The Council recalls the principles on which the Treaties are founded, in particular as regards respect for fundamental freedoms."
"The Council has not dealt with the case in question, but notes that not all internal avenues of appeal have been tried."
"The answer is unacceptable as regards what we might call the formal aspect, but it is not the first time that the Council, and likewise the Commission, has been asked to intervene regarding breaches of Article 6 of the Treaty."
"Often these breaches relate to the traditional outlook of certain political and religious regimes that we have seen in recent years, such as the Taliban regime, in which confusion between sin and crime becomes a reality."
"What we are condemning is this: the Greek National Radio and Television Council made a judgment, clearly based on moral grounds, although this was not within its competence to do so, and decided to fine a private television station for showing two men kissing."
"Clearly, not all courses of action have been taken but it is equally clear that, regarding this specific fact, there is a case for an assessment to be made and for a political opinion to be issued."
"The Council can also make political assessments."
"Mr Turco knows that the Council never passes political judgment on domestic issues in Member States;"
"I believe, though, that however bureaucratic my answer, that it has to some extent given you an idea of what we are trying to do and how we are completing proceedings before deciding on any possible measures."
"The US Government is once again opposing any prison visit to the Cubans Gerardo Hernández and René González, being held in the USA, by their wives and families, by refusing to issue the latter with visas."
"This is an attitude unworthy of the government which seeks to give the world lessons in democracy, but is clearly violating human rights in this particular case, given the conditions under which the trials took place, and the appalling conditions in which the men are being held."
"Does the Council intend to adopt any measure in keeping with international law, which covers human rights and the Geneva Agreements on prisoners?"
"Is the Council aware of the degrading and humiliating treatment which the wives of these men are being subjected to by the US Government?"
"The Council would like to stress its general disapproval of any situation in which human rights and respect for the individual are not adequately guaranteed."
"As has already been stated in the answers to questions H-0544 to H-0549/03 from September’s Question Time, the Council is aware of the trial and imprisonment of five Cuban citizens who have been residents in Florida since 2001 and the concerns that have been voiced by human rights NGOs as regards their conditions of detention."
"Nevertheless, the Council is not in a position to discuss the conditions of the trial."
"As regards the position of Mr Hernández and Mr González, the treatment of the two Cuban prisoners and their families is an issue for bilateral resolution by the United States and Cuba, since protection of the rights and interests of third country citizens is, according to the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, the individual competence of each Member State concerned."
"Furthermore, the Geneva Conventions are legal provisions which only govern the treatment of people captured during armed conflict, and not the treatment of civilians like these two people who have been detained on the grounds of alleged violations of criminal law."
"As regards the more general issue of respect for human rights, the Council would stress that it is taking advantage of all meetings held at any level with third countries to spell out the need to guarantee and promote such respect."
"In particular, the Council would like to stress that, in the Conclusions drawn up after its meeting in Brussels on 12 December 2003, it issued a declaration on transatlantic relations in which it insisted on the need for the European Union and its transatlantic partners to defend a common agenda based on the promotion of the rule of law, democracy and human rights."
"In this case, however, the Council informs the honourable Members that the case of the Miami Five has not been discussed with the United States since this is a matter for bilateral resolution by the latter and Cuba."
". Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to thank you for your reply to the question put and I understand your interest."
"However, the issue goes deeper than that, because since March and April the situation created in Cuba and also the European Union’s responses have drawn the attention of the whole of public opinion to what is happening in Cuba and also to the relationship with the United States."
"It is not therefore an entirely bilateral issue, but rather it is of international importance."
"My supplementary question is therefore based on the view that concrete action by the European Council is necessary given the great importance of the issue."
"My question is therefore: do you intend to communicate this concern about the defence of the human rights of these five people and their families to the Council?"
"I take note of your remarks: we will, of course, look at them in more depth and, when we have done this, we will be in a position to give you a specific answer as to the measures that the Council decides to adopt, if appropriate."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, a short while ago, in reply to Question No 5, you told us that the Council considers that it has an obligation to get human rights respected throughout the world."
"I assume that means from the Arctic to the Antarctic, with the United States of America located somewhere in between."
"You also told us that the way in which it does so depends on the level of relations it has with the country in question."
"Is the level of relations which the Council has with the United States of America such that it does not allow it to raise the issue of the human rights of these five prisoners with the government of the United States?"
"Or perhaps it has to do with the issue denounced in Question No 20 by Mr Patakis, in other words that the Council relies on the United States for the European Union's policy on Cuba and related issues?"
"I am sorry that the honourable Member has misinterpreted my replies, at least as regards the stance that I intended to take."
"As regards defending human rights, I have said and I will say it again, that the Council of the European Union will promote the defence of these rights on every occasion and in every situation at all levels – I could repeat a reply that I have already had occasion to give here in this House regarding a similar issue – not least where the United States are concerned."
"It did just this when, at bilateral level, in the recent meeting that took place with the Secretary of State Colin Powell, the Council and the Member States of the Union present at the meeting brought up concerns regarding the issue of Guantánamo Bay."
"As far as the United States-Cuba issue is concerned, the situation is different for this specific case because, as I said before in my initial reply, the issue is still seen as being in the context of bilateral relations between the United States and Cuba."
"I would like this to be clear in my replies as well."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to continue on the same issue: I do not understand why the bilateral nature of the issue means that Europe has to remain silent over its policy of defending human rights, which is our policy, as Mr Antonione tells us."
"We are looking at a situation in which not only have prisoners been tried in a manner which we believe to be entirely arbitrary, unjust and contrary to the Rule of Law, but also in which the wives of those prisoners are being denied the right to visit their husbands."
"We are talking about the rights of women, regardless of their nationality or that of their husbands, who are being denied a right which, as human beings, is recognised under international law."
"I asked about this issue last month and now I am asking, Mr Antonione, whether or not you believe the time has come to make some representation, so that these women’s rights, which the US administration is denying them, are respected."
"I believe that I have already replied to this question in my main answer."
"All I can do is repeat what I said."
"As regards the situation of Mr Hernández and Mr González, the treatment of the Cuban prisoners and their families is a matter for bilateral resolution by the United States and Cuba, since the protection of the rights and interests of citizens abroad is, according to the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, the individual competence of each Member State concerned."
"I believe that the issue can be considered without a doubt, as I have said, to be among the matters that the two countries need to discuss and resolve bilaterally."
"Immigration policies need to be aimed at equipping us to deal with current and future migration flows in a responsible and efficient manner, by opening up channels and drawing up an effective European framework."
"All the Member States are in fact currently preparing to improve the management of migration flows, and have stated their wish to work together with the countries of origin."
"The Commission communication on immigration and employment COM(2003)0336/final, put forward ideas in this direction, e.g. exploiting opportunities offered by the WTO's General Agreement on Trade in Services to provide temporary mobility mechanisms for persons who come to the EU to provide a service, which would satisfy the hopes of many developing countries; and the idea of improving temporal migration within the European employment strategy and the various Community action programmes."
"Furthermore, highly satisfactory experiences of regular temporary migration do exist, many of them linked with agricultural work; management of temporary migration by issuing temporary resident permits, and offering seasonal work to workers from third countries."
"Does the Council not believe that the EU's migration policies should feature positive measures covering and including issues related to temporal and seasonal work?"
"The importance of the admission of citizens of third countries for temporaral or seasonal work is fully recognised by the Union."
"In particular, it must be pointed out that, in its proposal for a directive on the conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals for the purpose of paid employment and self-employed economic activities, the Commission proposed the introduction of a special ‘worker’ residence permit."
"On 27 November 2003, the Council took note of how much progress had been made in work on this proposal."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I am grateful for your reply, although I find it rather skimpy."
"I would like you to expand a little further, because my main concern is whether temporary migration is going to be introduced into Community action programmes and the European Union's employment strategy."
"I believe you have said that it is, but I would like you to reply by expanding on your answer."
"My supplementary question relates, in this respect, to whether the Council will ensure that this temporary migration is carried out within the context of respect for the social and employment requirements in force in the European Union and whether it will also be offered to women, under equal conditions, within positive actions to promote women."
"I believe that, although concise, my answer already contains everything that could be useful to answer the supplementary questions that the honourable Member has put to me."
"I would stress, however, that the commitment to keep workingon the issue of temporaral migrant workers seems clear to me, as does the need for the Council, the Commission and the competent authorities to check, from a legislative point of view, that all the rights confirmed and respected within the Union are equally respected as regards these issues."
"I believe that the issue of active employment policies, particularly where women are concerned, is being explored as part of the current investigative work, and I have no reason to believe that the matter is not being dealt with."
"In my previous question (H-0669/03) of 4 November 2003(2) I endeavoured to draw the Council's attention in good time to the unacceptable situation obtaining during the municipal elections in Albania on 12 October so that the European Union might take appropriate action to intervene and warn the Albanian authorities and thereby avert fresh violations of the democratic process during the re-run of the elections on 16 November. Unfortunately, however, the Council failed to take any action, as its written reply of 19 November 2003 shows, and as a result there have been new incidents of violence and attempts to manipulate the democratic convictions of candidates and citizens."
"In view of the above, will the Council say what measures it now intends to take within the framework of Albanian-EU cooperation to address the repeated and flagrant violation of human and civil rights in this country?"
"The Council has repeatedly explained to Albania that correctly conducting municipal elections in a lawful manner is part of the process of the country’s with the European Union."
"The serious failings demonstrated in the municipal elections of 12 October and 16 November 2003, in particular in Imara, can only harm further with the Union."
"In this connection, Albania has been made fully aware of the fact that a constructive political climate and a policy of sustainable reforms remain crucial elements for progress in negotiations for the Stabilisation and Association Agreement and, therefore, for any further with the EU."
"I thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his reply."
"I have taken note of the warnings given by the Council to the Albanian Government and I trust that the Council will closely monitor the application of the necessary preconditions for smooth developments in relations between Albania and the European Union as regards respect for human and political rights in Albania."
"What is the current state of the negotiations with third countries on controlling immigration into the EU?"
"The Council attaches great importance to immigration issues being integrated into the Union’s relations with third countries."
"In a meeting of 2 November 2002, the General Affairs and External Relations Council adopted precise conclusions on this issue and identified nine countries with which the Union will step up dialogue regarding immigration."
"The issues relating to immigration have been discussed in all kinds of negotiations between the Community and third countries, and each cooperation and association agreement and any other type of agreement concluded recently or still in the process of negotiation include clauses relating to immigration."
"As regards readmission, the Council stressed its importance in the meeting of 6 November and supported a swift conclusion of the agreements currently being negotiated."
"On 13 October and 25 November 2003, the Council adopted decisions on signing readmission agreements between the European Community and Macao and Sri Lanka respectively."
"The readmission agreement with Macao was signed on 13 October and the agreement with Sri Lanka should be signed shortly."
"Furthermore, the Council should soon adopt a decision on the conclusion of the readmission agreement between the European Community and Hong Kong."
"It must also be noted that the Commission has concluded negotiations for a readmission agreement with Albania, which will be signed on 18 December 2003."
"As regards the other third countries with which the Commission has received a mandate from the Council to negotiate readmission agreements – Algeria, China, Morocco, Pakistan, Russia, Turkey and Ukraine – negotiations are still in progress."
"Finally, the Council refers the honourable Member to the Brussels European Council Conclusions of 12 December 2003, in which it reaffirms the importance of the dialogue with third countries of origin and transit of migratory flows and underlines the importance of continuing to assist those countries in their efforts to stem these migratory flows."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to thank you once again for your detailed reply."
"It appears that there are difficulties, because there are agreements which have been under negotiation for a long time, and that they have come to an end."
"My supplementary question, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, is: what are these difficulties?"
"Are they economic difficulties?"
"In other words, is the European Union's contribution sufficient for those countries?"
"I imagine that the main difficulty lies in the current lack of available means both to deal with the immigrants received and to repatriate them."
"What does the Council believe can be done with regard to resources to ease and alleviate this great burden we are currently enduring in the European Union as a result of these imbalances, and in particular in order to facilitate repatriation of immigrants who arrive illegally?"
"With regard to the difficulties of negotiations with individual countries I am in a position to give neither a precise answer nor a general answer because, in actual fact, it is not the Council that negotiates such treaties but the Commission."
"You would therefore need to ask the Commission what difficulties there are, their type and nature, and if they are the same for each country or if they are different."
"More generally, as regards the measures that the Council can take to address financial and probably not just financial – difficulties, I believe that the institution has already undertaken precisely to make every endeavour to ensure that some sort of solution can be found to the general problem of illegal immigration through readmission agreements, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, material aid for the economies and the people of the countries from which the flows of illegal immigrants originate."
"What progress is the Council making with agreeing common criteria for reporting of statistics about crime across the enlarged Union from next May?"
"Recommendation 1 of the strategy for the beginning of the new millennium provides for an evaluation mechanism and a timetable for implementing recommendations to become an integral part of the preparations for reviewing annual reports on organised crime."
"In this regard, in relation to the drawing up of the aforementioned annual reports, the recommendation also refers to the contact and support network, one of whose main aims is to seek to establish at European Union level a uniform definition of the phenomena associated with organised crime and its aspects."
"The mid-term review of this strategy for the beginning of the new millennium carried out by the multidisciplinary group on organised crime under the Greek Council Presidency, of which the Council took note on 3 October 2003, calls upon the Commission to launch a study on statistics development in the area of organised crime, in close collaboration with Europol, building upon the work already carried out and using, in particular, the Annual Organised Crime Situation Report and Eurostat."
"Following the results of this study, the Council will be able to assess possible initiatives in response to the need to establish a research, documentation and statistical network on organised crime."
"It should be pointed out that the coming Irish and Dutch Presidencies have recently organised the first European conference on organised crime with the support of the AGIS programme."
"The future Dutch Presidency plans to organise a follow-up to this conference in November 2004."
"The need for common, comparable data has been stressed in these meetings."
"That was a very full reply and I will need to study it."
"I was at the conference organised by the Irish Government recently."
"It made progress and that was why I tabled this question."
"If we do not have a common definition of what organised crime is, and if we do not have the ability to collect statistics across the European Union, how can we possibly know how to fight against organised crime?"
"I am grateful that progress is being made, but I am particularly interested to know whether you are including in this the ten accession countries which will be joining in May."
"Regrettably, a lot of the organised crime which affects us derives from Central and Eastern Europe."
"Mr President-in-Office, would you agree that the greatest cause of the very substantial rise in crime in the world today is the drugs industry, which is doing so much damage to our young people in so many countries, and that a major step in reducing crime would be to wipe out that drugs industry?"
"Therefore, is it possible for the European Union to take the necessary steps to deal with the countries where those drugs are produced as an industry, to eradicate them completely, because the only thing they offer to the world is total damage in every way?"
"I am not in a position to say whether or not this is indeed the main activity on which organised crime bases its trafficking."
"Without a doubt – it is a well-known fact – this is one of the most important trades."
"I do not know if it is the most important but it is certainly one of the most important types of trafficking."
"I certainly agree that this trafficking has a huge negative impact on all Member States of the European Union and that every endeavour needs to be made to try to eliminate this scourge of today’s society."
"In this sense, I can say that the Union is already taking – possibly not sufficiently given that the results are not as positive as we had hoped for– steps to intervene in producer countries."
"We must try to do more."
"It is not always easy to succeed in eradicating particular situations in countries that have a very weak legal system, always supposing that they have any."
"The line that you took in your question, Mr Hume – trying to investigate the issue precisely in the producer countries, in which the trafficking in question originates and where the drugs are produced - is undoubtedly one that I agree with and support."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I have a question about security in Brussels."
"We know that the official statistics that are collected on this issue often do not reflect reality because many members of the public are no longer willing to report crimes to the police."
"Are there any arrangements in place or any opportunities for us not to rely solely on police statistics but also to commission studies in order to obtain an accurate picture of the real crime situation and especially on how to combat crime effectively in future?"
"I am not in a position to give a precise response to this supplementary question."
"I will take note of your remarks, Mr Rübig."
"I believe that these are policies which, to some extent, are the competence of each individual country."
"I do, however, take note of such considerations and, in this case too, we will carry out investigations to discover whether they could be useful, not least with a view to taking a path that will give better results in combating these forms of crime, which are without a doubt very bad for our society."
"No progress has been made under the Italian Presidency in setting up new agencies or in decisions on the seats of agencies already set up."
"What is the view of the country holding the presidency regarding the seat of the Food Safety Authority?"
"The Council reminds the honourable Member that Member States’ representatives decided at a meeting of Heads of State or Government on 13 December to establish definitively the seat of the European Food Safety Authority in Parma."
"On that occasion the seats of nine other agencies were also established."
"– Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, this question was put before the decisions of 13 December were known about, and I congratulate Italy on succeeding in acquiring this Food Safety Authority for itself."
"Italy was the only country that did not agree that this agency should be located in Helsinki at the summit held two years or so ago, but now you have got it and you have my warmest congratulations."
"Congratulations too on agreeing generally on the agencies package, because it seems reasonably balanced, and although you acquired the Food Safety Authority you had to distribute these agencies among other countries too."
"In its answer to Oral Question H-0699/03(3), the Council did not explain to what address farmers from the Azores fined for exceeding authorised production levels should send the bills relating to the fines which the Council claims to have waived."
"Instead, it referred to the decision taken by the Council in June to reduce by 23 000 tonnes the specific milk quota allocated to the Azores as an increase of 50 000 tonnes."
"Does the Council not consider that its attitude is incompatible with the basic respect to be shown for the truth and for citizens in any country governed by the rule of law?"
"Within the framework of the political agreement achieved on reform of the CAP, the Agriculture and Fisheries Council, at a meeting last June in Luxembourg, decided to extend the derogation from certain measures implementing the system of quotas in the milk sector for the Azores up until the marketing year 2004/2005."
"Furthermore, the Council allowed the said region an additional quota of 50 000 tonnes as from the marketing year 2005/2006."
"In the meeting held in Brussels on 16 and 17 October 2003, the European Council invited the Council to examine the Commission proposal as soon as possible."
"As has already been pointed out by the Presidency in the answer to question H-699/03 by the honourable Member in November 2003, the Council hopes that, in the session of December 2003, after it has received the European Parliament’s opinion, it will be able to adopt the regulation proposed by the Commission extending the derogation from certain provisions of the quota system for the Azores in the milk sector as of the marketing year 2004/2005, in order to make it easier for the milk sector in the said outermost region to adapt to the supplementary quota allowed by the Council."
"The Council invites the honourable Member to contact the Commission for the information that he would like to see mentioned in the Council’s answer."
"Mr President, I thank the Presidency for the clarification it has given and I can also clarify to the Presidency that, today, in this House, the opinion of the European Parliament on this matter has been adopted and that the Council will, therefore, be in a position to take a decision."
"I wish to emphasise, however, that this decision does not add a single litre of milk to the Azores’ milk quota and nor does it exempt any producer from fines."
"This must be made clear and there should be no attempt to cloud an issue which is crucial to the economy and agriculture of the Azores."
"The question I would like to ask you, however, Mr President, is whether, in this decision that you will be taking in December, you will uphold the principle of adapting the regional quota to the Azores’ self-sufficiency in milk and dairy products, as decided by the Nice Council in December 2000, since this is, I believe, a fundamental principle which, if upheld, could lead in future to the much-needed adaptation of the regional quota?"
"I am sorry to say that I am not in a position to answer your supplementary question."
"We will investigate the issue and provide you with a detailed reply."
"I am not currently able to reply."
"Although it is a member of the Council of Europe, Georgia has had to rely solely on its own resources and US support, and not on the aid of the EU and its Member States, to bring about its ‘velvet revolution’."
"It is nonetheless the case that the EU cannot continue to regard the Caucasus in general and Georgia in particular as a one-time Soviet buffer zone. On the contrary, it must, without further delay, learn the lessons of the latest events and recognise the great maturity shown by the Georgian people and their right to enter the EU fold at an early date."
"As the interim President, Ms Burdzhanadze, has said, the next few months will be vital for setting Georgia firmly on a new path. Without substantial financial aid from the international community, Georgia may not be able to benefit to the full from the new situation."
"Does the Council realise that Georgia’s remarkable velvet revolution has been achieved without EU support worthy of the name?"
"Will it take the opportunity afforded by the new situation in order to bind Georgia to the EU by proposing that the country be placed on the list of candidates for accession?"
"Finally, will it provide special financial assistance to Georgia to enable it to hold the forthcoming presidential and parliamentary elections under the best possible conditions?"
"In its statement of 24 November 2003, the European Union welcomed the peaceful solution to the recent crisis in Georgia and confirmed that it is looking forward to working with the new political leaders of that country."
"In the meantime, the interim President, Mrs Burjanadze came to Brussels to meet the High Representative, Mr Solana, and the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi."
"On that occasion, she was assured that the European Union would give the utmost support to Georgia in the coming elections."
"As stated by the General Affairs and External Relations Council of 8 December 2003, EU relations with Georgia, like relations with Armenia and Azerbaijan, are firmly based on a long-term commitment to partnership and cooperation."
"The EU would like to help Georgia and other countries of the Southern Caucasus to consolidate their relations with the European Union."
"Finally, I can confirm that the EU has specifically offered Georgia EUR 2 million in special financial assistance to help the country organise the forthcoming elections."
"The Commission has also accelerated the disbursement of EUR 5 million under the food security programme."
"Furthermore, some Member States of the EU have, for their part, confirmed that they will provide aid to Georgia."
"– Mr President, I am grateful to the President-in-Office of the Council, but I have noticed that the Minister has studiously avoided answering the question regarding Georgia’s prospects for joining the EU."
"Is it a question of ideology, Mr Antonione, or do you believe that the EU would undergo a fundamental change of character if it had thirty-five members instead of thirty-two ?I would like to try and understand."
"As a member of the Council of Europe, Georgia has the right to join the EU, as do the Balkan countries, whose right to do so has recently been recognized."
"I do not understand why you are ignoring something that seems to me to be Georgia’s right."
"I do not want to avoid the question but, since Georgia has not even presented a request, it is difficult to give a reply to a country that has not even declared that it is willing, inclined, available or anything else."
"In any case, before being able to consider Georgia, and the same goes for other countries that may want to set out on the road towards with the European Union, it is only too clear that the appropriate conditions must be in place, that steps forward need to be taken for us to be able to consider the path towards , even if not in the very near future."
"I must also tell you in all honesty, Mr Dupuis, that there has never been any kind of line taken in the Council bodies to make it possible to set down now, in principle, the limits and boundaries of the European Union."
"This is, therefore, a debate between you and me or perhaps between those that may be interested from a general, idealist or political point of view, which would not be specific enough to carry any real weight."
"This is all I can say in answer to your question."
"The Italian Presidency has not yet answered my written questions on the same subject tabled in July 2003 and I am therefore tabling them again for an oral answer."
"Will the Council say what the 'exceptional circumstances' are which 'justify' the Council's decision to approve Italian State aid to Italian milk producers pursuant to Article 88(2), third paragraph, of the EC Treaty?"
"If the same 'exceptional circumstances' are present in other Member States or in new Member States, will the Council approve similar State aid?"
"Will the Council explain how its decision to approve Italian State aid to Italian milk producers is consistent with the provisions of Article 12 of the Treaty concerning equal treatment of European citizens, including, therefore, milk producers?"
"In its decision of July 2003, the Council examined the compatibility with the common market of aid that the Italian Republic intends to grant to its milk producers, in the form of pre-financing of amounts owed by them to the Community by virtue of the additional levy on milk for the period from 1995/1996 to 2001/2002."
"The Council concluded that exceptional circumstances exist which justify considering such aid to be compatible with the common market by derogation from Article 87 of the Treaty."
"These exceptional circumstances are fully detailed in the Council decision."
"The Council considered that the principle of equality was respected because milk producers in other Member States of the Community have not come up against exceptional circumstances similar to those occurring in Italy."
"In this regard, the Council and the Commission stressed in a joint statement, recorded in the Council Minutes, that this decision was justified by an exceptional situation peculiar to Italy and that it intended to settle past problems once and for all regarding the application of the additional levy in Italy."
"As a result, both institutions have stressed that this decision cannot be considered a precedent for any future problems in the application of the levy, either in Italy or in any other Member State."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for the answers I have been given."
"I have just one more question."
"When the President-in-Office of the Council speaks of the exceptional circumstances in Italy and of this not having to create a precedent, I would ask if Italy has now itself implemented the common rules so that, form now on, the Italian milk producers too pay a special duty for exceeding the production quotas."
"I do indeed believe so, yes."
"Recent events in Georgia have once again sharply focused attention on the problems facing the countries of the Caucasus and the region as a whole."
"Will the Council outline its policy towards this region?"
"What actions has it taken to create a Stability Pact equivalent to that for south-eastern Europe to promote the democratisation and development of, and cooperation with, the region?"
"What initiatives does it intend to take to cooperate with the Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC/PABSEC), a regional organisation which comprises all the countries of the region (EU Member States, candidate countries and non-Member States) and which may be used as a format for addressing the broader problems facing the region?"
"Does the Council envisage the probable accession in the long term of Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan to the EU, given the very ancient cultural and economic ties linking the region to Europe?"
"The European Union has been doing its utmost to consolidate its policy in the Southern Caucasus since the Council declared, in 2001, that the Union wanted to play a more active role in this region."
"The most clear and tangible sign of this approach was the nomination, in July 2003, of Ambassador Talvitie as the European Union’s special representative for the Southern Caucasus with the specific task of helping the Council to further develop a global policy."
"The Council used the joint action on the nomination of a European Union special representative in order to establish the objectives of EU policy in the Southern Caucasus that are now in the public domain, which are: a) to helpArmenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia to implement political and economic reforms, in particular in the areas of the Rule of Law, democratisation, human rights, good governance, development, and the reduction of poverty; b) to achieve compliance with the instruments in force,prevent conflicts in the region, help resolve conflicts and prepare for a return to peace, also by supporting the return of refugees and internal evacuees; c) to become constructively involved with the main national actors in neighbouring countries; d) to encourageandsupport further cooperation between States in the region, in particular between States in Southern Caucasus, especially as regards economic, energy and transport issues; e) to make the Union more effective in the region and to give it a higher profile there."
"The Union has been actively promoting democratisation, development and cooperation in the Southern Caucasus for more than a decade."
"The Commission and the Member States have given substantial financial assistance to Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia since their independence in 1991."
"In 1999, the Union concluded partnership and association agreements with all three countries, and also actively supported their accession to the Council of Europe."
"As regards the organisation of economic cooperation in the Black Sea region, the European Union recognises and supports the action to promote economic cooperation at regional level, which will increase the area’s stability, security and prosperity."
"The European Union is open to the possibility of boosting its current cooperation with the Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC) to develop the region."
"As the General Affairs and External Relations Council declared on 8 December 2003, EU relations with Georgia, like those with Armenia and Azerbaijan are firmly based on a long-term commitment to partnership and cooperation."
"The European Union wants to help Georgia, as well as the other countries of the Southern Caucasus to consolidate their relations with the European Union."
"Mr President-in-Office, first of all, thank you for the reply you have given me."
"However, I should like certain additional details because three years ago it was said in this very Chamber that the European Union would promote a stability pact in the area equivalent to that for the Balkans."
"So far, nothing has been done."
"The point has been repeatedly raised in this Chamber that, while we support regional cooperation, and at Black Sea level there is even a bank and an intergovernmental and interparliamentary procedure and secretariat, our relations with it are as if it were a far flung country, a country in the Far East."
"Because this area is of vital interest to the European Union and because numerous countries, such as Armenia, Moldova, Georgia, Ukraine and so on, have asked for prospects of accession to the European Union, I consider, for the moment at least, that the reply does not match the political needs of the region."
"I therefore await clarification."
"The Council proposal for a regulation concerning trade in certain equipment and products which could be used for capital punishment, torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment has been looked into many times by the Council’s preparatory bodies."
"On the basis of such work, it was agreed that the Commission would present an amended proposal, taking into consideration comments from delegations."
"The Council has not yet received this amended proposal."
"As soon as it does receive it, the Presidency will do everything necessary to ensure that it is swiftly adopted."
"I would like to ask the President-in-Office when the Council requested the Commission to forward the amended proposal."
"In addition, could he indicate specifically what types of products are intended to be covered by the amended regulation which the Council has requested?"
"It seems extraordinary that we continue to permit the export of implements from the European Union which are used for torture by agents within the states we allow them to be exported to."
"Indeed these products, because they are exported from the European Union, carry an EU logo."
"I am not in a position to give a detailed reply."
"We will proceedto an investigation and give a written reply on the issues that you have just highlighted, Mr de Rossa, both as regards the times, that is to say the date when the Council asked the Commission for an amended proposal and, in particular, regarding the identification of products that are subject to this request."
"The President-in-Office may have misunderstood my question."
"One part of my question asks when the Council requested the Commission to present an amended regulation, not when we expect the Commission to respond."
"I understood perfectly."
"Mr de Rossa, I am not currently in a position to give you the precise date because I do not have the documents here and I cannot simply conjure a date out of nowhere."
"Frankly, there are some things that I know, but I certainly cannot know everything."
"Since I do not wish to give you an imprecise date, I suggest that I look into this further because I do not have the documents here that would allow me to give a precise answer as to when the Council asked the Commission to present an amended proposal."
"As I just said, we will also add details of all of the equipment and products to this: I do not know how they can be defined, since these are issues in which feelings naturally prevail over the material aspect."
"We will, therefore, be more precise as regards the definition of this equipment."
"Mr President, I am slightly out of order, I do not have a supplementary question."
"I simply assume that, because the Greek language is difficult, the President-in-Office was unable to understand the interpretation of my previous question."
"I understand him, some languages are difficult to comprehend and I therefore reserve the right to raise my supplementary question again as an oral question at the next part-session."
"Pursuant to the Rules of Procedure you have the right, Mr Souladakis, to reproduce the questions on the countries of the Caucasus."
"As we stated, this was the last question, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure."
"Since the time allotted to Questions to the Council has elapsed, Questions Nos 19 to 24 will be replied to in writing.(4)"
"We thank all the Members who have spoken, and in particular the President-in-Office of the Council, and wish you a happy Christmas, and may you continue working, although not in the Presidency, but in the Italian Government, for the European Union."
"– The next item is the joint debate on three recommendations for second reading, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"- A5-0425/2003, on the laying down of Community procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use and establishing a European Medicines Agency (10949/2/2003 – C5-0463/2003 – 2001/0252(COD)) (Rapporteur: Mrs Müller)"
"- A5-0446/2006, on the Community Code relating to medicinal products for human use (10950/3/2003 – C5-0464/2003 – 2001/0253(COD)) (Rapporteur: Mrs Grossetête)"
"- A5-0444/2003, on the Community Code relating to veterinary medicinal products (10950/3/2003 – C5-0464/2003 – 2001/0253(COD)) (Rapporteur: Mrs Grossetête)"
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our debate this evening concerns the revision of the body of legislation relating to medicinal products in the European Union and its impact on patients and the pharmaceutical industry."
"In this context, it is important to note that knowledge about the manufacture of medicinal products and the action of any given drug is not general knowledge."
"Due to the complex scientific interactions and manufacturing processes, very few patients in Europe will be able to evaluate the opportunities, risks and prospects of success of a treatment with any given drug."
"That is why we need an agency to evaluate the safety, efficacy and quality of medicinal products on behalf of the patient."
"This evaluation must meet high scientific standards, not only in the interests of patients but also in the interests of manufacturers."
"After all, if problems arise as a result of serious adverse reactions to a drug, the manufacturers are likely to forfeit their reputation and have to pay financial penalties, while patients have the physical effects to contend with."
"This means that the reform of the legislation on the authorisation of medicinal products, which is the subject of our debate today, must guarantee the safety of medicinal products but also establish general conditions which authorise and underpin research by pharmaceutical companies and thus boost their competitiveness."
"This not only benefits the companies concerned; it also safeguards jobs. Not least, patients benefit from the research findings and from new and effective medicinal products."
"With this legislation, we have, I believe, succeeded in resolving the dilemma between the need for high standards of health protection, on the one hand, and the industry’s calls for better conditions for research and competitiveness, on the other."
"In a global economy with different legal frameworks in Europe, Asia and the USA, and with the forthcoming enlargement of the European Union, this was not an easy task."
"The global compromise with the Council that has now been achieved offers us the opportunity to conclude the package reforming the legislation on medicinal products in the second reading."
"It is a good compromise, as it generally reflects the views of this House on key issues concerning legislation, pharmacovigilance, the scope of the centralised authorisation procedure, protection and the composition of the Agency's Management Board."
"I believe that the compromise tailors the legislation to reflect scientific progress and economic developments, and patients will benefit from this."
"Let me comment briefly on the key topics."
"A particularly important aspect of the reform of the legislation on medicinal products is improving pharmacovigilance."
"This House has successfully enforced a high level of safety in the authorisation procedure as well as an effective system of surveillance and control."
"With the establishment of a database at the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMEA), the Agency will in future play a key role in an effective pharmacovigilance system."
"This is especially important because a well-functioning pharmacovigilance system is essential for patients’ wellbeing."
"Although the compromise does not establish a compulsory centralised authorisation procedure for all new active substances – a proposal which was endorsed by this House at first reading – the list of indications has nonetheless been extended to include orphan drugs, with a further extension after four years to include indications for autoimmune and viral diseases. As a result, a wide range of new active substances will be subject to the centralised authorisation procedure in future."
"The European Medicines Agency in London will guarantee, through the structures and working methods envisaged in this legislation, that scientific resources are coordinated effectively, thus safeguarding the high standards of the evaluations."
"Centralised authorisation through the EMEA will ensure that all patients in Europe enjoy the same prompt availability of innovative and effective medicinal products."
"The provisions on data protection were another controversial topic."
"The protection period agreed in the current compromise, of eight years, plus two, plus one, for the centralised and the decentralised procedure, ensures, firstly, that there is an incentive to carry out research, and secondly, that the further development of proven active substances is rewarded."
"This uniform Europe-wide provision protects the economic interests of manufacturers engaged in research and the interests of generics manufacturers and – unlike the period originally proposed by the Commission – reduces the burden on the national health systems."
"The global compromise with the Council places patients’ needs at the heart of the legislation, promotes research and innovation and also safeguards the competitiveness of European industry."
"That is why I urge you, ladies and gentlemen, to support the Council’s compromise."
"As is always the case with compromises, not all our proposals have been fulfilled."
"Nonetheless, I believe that we have found a solution, even on controversial points such as homeopathic medicinal products."
"Through the mutual recognition procedure, it is now possible for every patient in Europe to access these medicinal products."
"On the matters concerning the WTO, too, I believe that we have found an acceptable solution, although it is beyond the scope of this legislation to regulate these issues."
"The Commission has pledged to present a proposal on this topic in the new year."
"I therefore believe that the overall outcome is good and that the compromise is worth supporting."
"I do not think that initiating a conciliation process with the Council will produce a better result, especially as it will not solve the two issues that I have mentioned."
"Tomorrow’s vote – and I urge my fellow Members to support the compromise on that occasion – will enable us to launch sustainable legislation on medicinal products."
"I would like to take this opportunity to thank my fellow rapporteur Mrs Grossetête, as well as the Secretariat, the Council and the Commission, for their cooperation."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, this evening we are examining the review package of legislation on medicinal products for human use and veterinary medicinal products."
"This review represents two years of work, indeed more than two years of joint work, of research, questions and negotiations: two years which will, I hope, be crowned with success at tomorrow’s vote."
"I should like to extend very sincere thanks to my fellow Members of the European Parliament, across all of the groups, with whom I have held countless meetings, and in particular my fellow rapporteur, Mrs Müller."
"I should like to thank her for collaborating so effectively."
"I have listened to the requests made by fellow Members. I have put forward their arguments to the Council."
"I have involved them every step of the way, so that everyone could share in today’s result."
"I should also like to thank the Commission, in particular Commissioner Liikanen and his outstanding team. I have had first-hand experience of their dedication and have appreciated the quality of our exchanges."
"I should also like to thank the Council for being willing to adopt a constructive approach on these dossiers so as to reach an agreement at second reading."
"These expressions of gratitude will, however, count for nothing if Members of this Parliament do not act responsibly tomorrow and adopt the compromise that has been negotiated, rather than vote in favour of other amendments which, I believe, are more of a reflection of individual interests than the common good."
"Yes, we have a compromise and a compromise is never satisfactory on all counts."
"But consider the strides forward that we have made in protecting public and animal health!"
"The objective of striking a balance, which was so difficult to attain at the outset, has been achieved."
"Attempts were made to pit the various different partners against each other, and in particular to put the health system and innovation on opposing sides."
"In fact, analysis has shown that generic medicines on the one hand and innovations by pharmaceutical laboratories on the other are not contradictory."
"These two products are not incompatible, but complementary."
"Generics do not develop without innovation and innovation is stimulated by the availability of generic medicines."
"Protecting patient health means being able to counteract the emergence of new diseases, to confront old scourges when they reappear and to provide more effective treatment."
"Protecting patient health means giving scientific research the necessary resources to discover either new molecules or new therapeutic applications for existing medicines."
"Innovations come at a price."
"Let us not forget that safeguarding our health requires significant financial investment."
"Data protection is therefore essential to guarantee medical advances, the European medical advances of which we are proud."
"The result of our compromise, known as 8+2+1, is what I would like to see adopted in tomorrow’s sitting."
"Research and development are at the root of health protection, which would not be complete without the availability of generic medicines."
"Generics are very important for our European health systems and for patients."
"I therefore welcome the approach adopted by these directives."
"The term ‘generic medicines’ has been introduced for the first time."
"It is also proposed to start using the Bolar system in the Union, a proposal that our amendments have, by the way, served to improve."
"This provision will enable all generics to be made available more quickly."
"My fellow Members and the Council also accepted my ‘eurogenerics’ proposal, which will prevent any hold-up in the development of these products, in particular in the candidate countries."
"The review of pharmaceutical legislation does not seek solely to strike an optimum balance between generics and innovation."
"Many other aspects that are just as important have been studied."
"I am thinking in particular of the definitions of medicinal product, generic medicinal product and biosimilars."
"These have been the subject of heated debate."
"Personally, I have always advocated an approach based on product safety."
"Having definitions that are too broad would be counterproductive for both manufacturers and patients."
"A satisfactory balance has been struck in this respect, as is illustrated by the provision on borderline products."
"I know that this point raises further questions."
"Simply deleting this so-called ‘borderline products’ clause would not have resolved anything and would require each manufacturer to seek judicial clarification from the courts, which would involve hiring lawyers and waiting months and months for a judgment."
"Drawing up a list of exemptions did not appear to be the right solution, either."
"Such a list would never have been exhaustive."
"We already have legislation on cosmetics, food supplements and medical devices, to name but a few examples. This is legally valid and our task here is not to call it into question, but to resolve a very real problem."
"Here I have a request to make of the Commission and I would actually like it to give an undertaking in this regard, so as to increase the legal security of those active in the field. There is no doubt that it would be helpful if the competent Commission services were to convene a meeting as soon as possible of all of the stakeholders that I have mentioned previously."
"I believe that this would be particularly important to set their minds at rest."
"On the basis of this meeting and in the light of rulings already handed down by the Court of Justice of the European Communities, a joint and official interpretative statement could then be published."
"I sincerely hope that this proposal is acted on, in the same way that I expect the Commission to clarify its position on the Doha Declaration."
"I know that this too is an essential point for a good number of my fellow Members."
"The issuing of an authorisation for a medicinal product for human or veterinary use does not, however, signal the end of checks on its efficacy and safety."
"Strengthening pharmacovigilance has therefore been one of our priorities."
"This has made it necessary to modify the existing provisions: firstly, to make it possible for inspections to be carried out unannounced at the manufacturing source and secondly, to shorten the deadlines for mandatory submission of the periodic reports and to set up a system for the rapid exchange of data collected by all of the partners so as to ensure that the pharmacovigilance systems are applied consistently across the Member States."
"We have also stressed that pharmacovigilance should be independent and requested that the management of funds earmarked for this purpose remain under the direct supervision of the competent authorities."
"My fellow Members and I also wished to take into account the environmental aspect of medicinal products."
"This point was, moreover, raised with the Executive Director of the EMEA in London, who confirmed that this was a valid approach."
"However, under no circumstances should this constitute grounds for a marketing authorisation to be refused."
"We all know, for example, that the products used in chemotherapy may cause harmful chemicals to be discharged into the environment, but we would not consider banning their authorisation."
"This would not make any sense."
"The idea here is to assess better the environmental risk and, for all therapeutic classes, to take effective measures to reduce its impact."
"This is a very important issue for this Parliament."
"I also wanted, with the support of my fellow Members, to return to the issue of information."
"It is our responsibility to address the problems that arise."
"It would have been easy to ignore the subject, but we have not done so."
"We are therefore asking the European Commission to table a clear paper setting out what exists in this field, to analyse the potential benefits and risks of making information available to patients, to reflect on the responsibility of the information provider and to table proposals."
"Nevertheless, I do have a number of regrets where these reports are concerned."
"The most significant concerns the scope of application of the directive and the Council’s refusal to make the centralised procedure obligatory immediately for all new active substances."
"Here, Parliament has been too European for the Council."
"The compromise does, however, include some significant pathologies in the scope of application and a review clause in four years’ time will enable us to strengthen this provision and increase equal access to health for every European citizen."
"I would congratulate my fellow rapporteur, Mrs Müller, who negotiated this."
"Where the EMEA and the composition of its scientific committees are concerned, common sense should prevail."
"It would seem to me to be inconsistent and even very dangerous if the professionals appointed to sit on these committees did not have a similar level of expertise."
"It is the criterion of competence and not nationality that will guarantee the quality and effectiveness of the scientific evaluation."
"We will be very vigilant on this point."
"On homeopathic medicinal products, Parliament wanted to go further than the proposed compromise."
"I am very aware of this, but advances have been made in the field of mutual recognition."
"This provision will secure the development of this category of medicines."
"We should look at what is being proposed and not just at what has not been agreed in the negotiations."
"It is important to put things in perspective, as it shows that homeopathic medicinal products have not been neglected, just as veterinary medicinal products have not been sacrificed."
"All of the provisions that I have mentioned so far also apply to all veterinary medicinal products."
"These directives do not seek, as I have had occasion to hear, to hamper social security systems or to give one sector an advantage over any other."
"On the contrary, they guarantee the development of a high level of health protection."
"They facilitate access to products for all patients and encourage scientific research by supporting essential growth in generic medicines."
"Neither do they divide the fifteen current Member States or the enlargement countries."
"I hope that tomorrow’s vote is favourable, so that our three institutions are successful in improving human and animal health."
"I am confident: we have an undertaking from the majority of the political groups."
". First of all, I would like to thank and warmly congratulate the two rapporteurs, Mrs Müller and Mrs Grossetête, for their work and efforts, particularly in the search for a global compromise with the Council."
"The review package, as originally proposed by the Commission, had three important objectives: first, to guarantee European citizens a high level of health protection; second, to increase the availability of innovative medicinal products while at the same time encouraging competition with generic products; and third, to prepare for enlargement."
"I am glad to note that the final compromise proposed by the two rapporteurs and by the Council would indeed meet these objectives."
"Where the compromise amendments are concerned, I would like to concentrate on the most important issues."
"First, the data protection scheme and generic competition."
"The Commission wanted to strike the right balance between innovation and generic competition by adjusting criteria for achieving it."
"The measures in favour of generic competition we proposed were agreed upon and even improved on thanks to Parliament’s amendments during the first reading."
"Regarding innovative industry, the Commission proposed harmonising the data protection period at 10 years across the board as an essential element for a smoother operation of the single market."
"This period also represented one of the major tools available in the context of pharmaceutical legislation for rewarding innovation."
"We also proposed a one-year extension when an innovative indication is granted after initial market authorisation."
"The current compromise, known as 8+2+1, meets our objectives and expectations."
"I am fully aware that the impact of this harmonisation in the new Member States was much discussed during the debate."
"First, I would like to welcome the provision regarding the non-retroactivity of this harmonisation."
"This was a preoccupation of the acceding countries and is now a part of the compromise today."
"This provision will limit the effect of the new protection period to medicinal products authorised after the implementation of the directives."
"Second, I would like to state that the Commission will give full consideration to any request for a transitional period presented by the new Member States on adoption of the legislative package."
"The rest of the compromise on the data protection scheme and generic competition, including a one-year period in the case of switches and a one-year period for well-established substances in the case of innovative indication and clarification of generic and bio-similar definitions, is also welcome and acceptable to the Commission."
"Regarding the scope of the centralised procedure and the need to reinforce the role of the European Medicines Agency, despite your support during the first reading, the Council has taken a more limited approach on the scope."
"The common position did not follow the Commission and Parliament approach, but extended the current scope of the centralised procedure to some extent."
"The current compromise further extends that scope, and more importantly, allows for future development."
"It takes account of some of the most important therapeutic needs of today and probably of the near future."
"The Commission welcomes the compromise solution."
"More generally, the new legislation will consolidate the Agency’s international role and will increase its role in key sectors such as market surveillance, pharmacovigilance and public awareness of medicinal products."
"This development is also to be welcomed."
"To perform these tasks, the Agency had to undergo some adjustment, and the compromise amendments related to its administrative structure, and in particular the composition of the management board and of the scientific committees, meet this objective on the whole."
"Third, the environmental aspects."
"The possible effects of the use of medicinal products on the environment is important."
"The question needed to be addressed carefully as, at the end of the day, the availability of certain medicines was at stake."
"The compromise amendments, which require an environmental impact assessment and possible mitigating measures but leave the criteria for granting the marketing authorisation untouched, are to be seen as a well-balanced solution."
"Fourth, the implementation of the Doha Decision concerning the granting of compulsory licences for the export of patented medicines to countries with insufficient manufacturing capacity."
"First of all, I would like to stress and reiterate the Commission’s political commitment to ensuring that the implementation of this decision is facilitated and that the right conditions are in place for its operation and efficient application."
"However, Amendments Nos 6 and 19 pose a problem of form because a clause regulating the exports cannot be part of a directive dealing with the placing of medicines on the Community market."
"This proposal concerns only market authorisation in Europe."
"It in no way impacts on exports of medicines from Europe."
"Nevertheless, the Commission fully agrees with the principle of the implementation of the WTO General Council Decision of 30 August 2003, both at Community and at Member State level, in the context of the patent legislation."
"The Commission undertakes to address the implementation of this decision in the EU as a matter of the highest priority in early 2004 with a view to bringing forward an appropriate legislative proposal."
"Finally, information to patients."
"The Commission’s attempt to modernise this part of the legislation has not been as fruitful as I would have wished."
"However, I am pleased to note that the issue is now part of the compromise."
"I would like to ensure that we make steady progress towards a future Community information strategy to deal with this question."
"Concerning recommendations for second reading from Mrs Müller and Mrs Grossetête, the Commission can accept entirely the global compromise package as proposed by the Council and accepted by the two rapporteurs."
"As to Mrs Müller's request, once the legislation is adopted my services will organise a hearing with a view to adequately implement Article 2(2), where all stakeholders will be given the possibility to have input."
"This compromise allows the settlement of a number of important questions and a dynamic approach to the tasks of the agency and the scope of this centralised procedure."
"The proposed harmonisation of the data protection scheme, irrespective of the procedure used, is a major improvement."
"I would also like to reiterate the importance of the new environmental features introduced in the legislation."
"As regards the veterinary legislation, we also note that if the provisions have been brought into line globally with those of the human medicinal products directive, some specificity has been adequately kept, in particular concerning environmental impact."
"In the veterinary sector, environmental impact may determine the final authorisation of the given product and therefore constitutes a criterion for its evaluation."
"In conclusion, I would like to urge Members of Parliament to support the two rapporteurs on the approval of the compromise so as to conclude, at this stage, the legislative process of the pharmaceutical review for the benefit of all European citizens."
"Mr President, I am extremely satisfied with the exceptional results achieved by this Parliament and in particular with the work that has been carried out in recent days, which has shown significant, positive interaction between the various institutions."
"My warmest thanks therefore go to Mrs Grossetête and Mrs Müller, Commissioner Liikanen, and Mr Brunet, as well as to Mr Silano from the Italian Presidency who intelligently and openly contributed to drawing up these compromises that have finally been accepted."
"As we know, the main aim of all of the institutions is finally to have new legislation that allows European citizens to have equal opportunities and to have access, as soon as possible, to new, more powerful drugs, which are more selectiveand more easily tolerated than existing ones, hopefully at a reasonable price."
"I will focus on just a few points."
"As regards the composition of the management board of the European Drugs Agency, the current compromise proposal is preferable both to the initial Commission proposal and to the one from the rapporteur Mrs Müller, which, in my view, contains major deep-rooted conflicts."
"The management board, as approved, will be predominantly institutional – as I had personally wished for on a number of occasions – with the addition of two representatives from the Patients’ Association and two from the Doctors’ Association."
"Furthermore, I am satisfied with the length of the data protection period because this agreement is, in my view, very well balanced and will, on the one hand, give new impetus and incentives to European industries to invest more in scientific research and, on the other hand, will allow them to respond to ethical requirements, by implementing a solidarity policy towards developing countries and also towards some of new Europe’s accession countries."
"The agreement reached to see a further data protection period in the case of a ‘switch’, as well as in the case of new therapeutic indications for well-known medicinal products, is also a step in the right direction."
"Another point of the agreement regards the development of an EMEA centralised procedure for the marketing authorisation of new medicinal products."
"As I have stressed on numerous occasions, I agreed with the initial Commission proposal and I am convinced that new medicinal products should in future be subject to authorisation by the EMEA."
"Finally, I hope that in Europe the pharmacovigilance system, which I outlined as a pharmacologist and that guarantees maximum protection of citizens, will be made more efficient and transparent."
"Mr President, I also support the rapporteurs and all who have worked hard for this compromise proposal."
"There is always a danger that a trialogue before second reading will turn into a kind of Bermuda triangle of lost hopes and failed expectations."
"That has not happened in this case, and we can all accept the achievements that we have."
"Everyone has sacrificed something to find a balance."
"I accept that the failure to accommodate the Doha amendments, the further recognition of homeopathic medicines and the limited extension of data exclusivity for switch products will leave some here with heavy hearts."
"It is when I turn to the third report on veterinary medicinal products – which the Commissioner dealt with briefly – that I confess to some further anxiety."
"Again, I support the compromise amendments: they enhance the EMEA, they recognise some limits to the status of prescription-only medicines, which we all support and welcome, and they allow options in relation to the centralised procedure."
"Nevertheless, they could go further in acknowledging the position of some Member States, including my own, where routine medicines are used by qualified persons, but not veterinarians."
"Amendment No 27 would have allowed an explicit derogation to allow this to continue, alongside prescription-only medicines."
"The Commission indicated before second reading that Amendment No 27 was acceptable in principle - it was not to the Council."
"Nevertheless, I hope to hear from the Commissioner, when he winds up this debate, that there will be a subtle and consensual solution to this dilemma that will be in the spirit of compromise and of the Christmas season as well."
"– Mr President, Commissioner Liikanen, I too should like first of all to congratulate my two fellow Members, Mrs Grossetête and Mrs Müller, on their excellent work on this review of pharmaceutical legislation, which is undoubtedly one of the most important public health dossiers of this parliamentary term."
"What we have on the table today is a package of amendments that has been negotiated by the two rapporteurs, the shadow rapporteurs and the Italian Presidency."
"It is an overall compromise, a balanced compromise, which has been accepted by the majority of the Member States and which gives guarantees and proposes measures to foster the growth of both branded and generic medicinal products."
"The agreement with the Council incorporates a series of proposals that are dear to our hearts."
"I am not going to repeat what has already been said by previous speakers, particularly on the subject of pharmacovigilance or the EMEA and the centralised procedure."
"However, I would like to take this opportunity to highlight the five-yearly renewal of authorisations, which will enable the national authorities to remove medicinal products from the market if they are no longer effective; the clear distinction that needs to be drawn between information and advertising, together with the Commission’s undertaking to table a report on current practices; the collection of waste and the environmental impact of medicines, and the Braille inscription on the packaging – which has not yet been mentioned – for the partially sighted."
"Finally, and most importantly, I would draw your attention to the fact that the definition of generic medicines has been broadened and the eurogenerics concept has been introduced."
"This will harmonise and facilitate conditions for launching generics across Europe, and constitutes a major step forward in this review. Our rapporteur mentioned it, but it has not been stressed enough so far."
"I was also delighted with Commissioner Liikanen’s response to Mrs Grossetête’s question about so-called ‘borderline’ products, whose status does require further clarification."
"This brings me to what has been – it has to be said – the real battleground in Parliament and between the Member States from the outset: the question of data protection."
"The 8+2+1 formula should be supported, as that is what we need today: a win-win approach, I would say, which will promote research, which is crucial for Europe, and provide better patient access to less expensive medicines, with the impact that we know this will have on our governments’ health budgets."
"To my fellow Members and representatives of the four Member States who voted against this fair compromise and continue, in their efforts to defend health at a lower cost, to take data protection as their main, if not in many cases their only, target – as if the debate could be limited to this question alone – I should like to say that they are taking a huge risk."
"The risk that they are taking is no more and no less than that of seeing Europe become nothing but a sales counter and of letting the United States become the only country where innovation takes place."
"I will remind you of just one figure."
"Since 1996, the proportion of new medicinal products launched worldwide by Europe has fallen from 55% to 28% – in other words, it has halved – and I am not talking here about turnover but about insufficient investment in research and development."
"In conclusion, it is important that we do not choose the wrong target or strategy in this debate."
"If the essential objective for Europe is to continue to care for its patients, and care for them well – and we all agree on this – then we need to pursue a genuine policy of innovation, stem the brain drain, fight against parallel imports and, as I was saying, promote, not a head-on collision between industry and generics, which would be fruitless, but a win-win approach, which will be of the greatest benefit to patients."
"On behalf of the Liberal Group, which I am representing, I think that this is what we have succeeded in achieving here at the end of two years of work together."
"Mr President, we have been working successfully on this project to revise European legislation on medicinal products for two years."
"It is true that, at that time, I had hoped for a lot more than this compromise package, negotiated with the Council and the Commission, which will be put to the vote tomorrow."
"For me, this process of revision of the procedures for European marketing authorisation of human and veterinary medicinal products should lead to a radical development of the criteria for evaluating and authorising medicinal products in the interests of patients, public health and health-care professionals."
"The principal aim of this revision was to have the European Agency legally recognise all of the new substances."
"In actual fact, the centralised procedure will only focus on some illnesses."
"The London Agency has sufficiently enlarged its sphere of activity to ensure its funding, but the national authorities have, for their part, retained the most lucrative classes of medicinal products, namely those regarding neurodegenerative disorders or cardiovascular diseases."
"The interests of the Commission and the Council are safe, but are they those of the patients?"
"Over and above introducing Braille, we have improved pharmacovigilance and transparency in patients’ interests, but it is true that some last-minute Council compromises subtly weakened these gains."
"The majority of the documents relating to the evaluation of medicinal products should be publicly accessible, but what about pharmacovigilance reports?"
"The public authorities responsible for issuing authorisations should be independent of companies but remain, in actual fact, dependent upon private taxation."
"Patients do not have the means to directly inform the competent authorities of the side effects of medicinal products, and doctors are not obliged to do so."
"It is a great victory, however, that advertising for medicinal products subject to prescription was rejected, but until when?"
"In terms of public health, the environmental impact of the new medicinal products should be assessed."
"This should not be the sole evaluation criteria, but it must be considered in the benefit-risk equation for a medicinal product and, therefore, be one of the conditions for granting a marketing authorisation."
"The environmental risk goes far beyond the damage to nature; pollution linked to discharges of toxic residue from medicinal products represents a risk to human health."
"Clearly, treatments for which the medical benefits outweigh the environmental risks should continue to be used."
"When effective alternatives exist, however, they should be promoted."
"I am sorry to say that the final wording of the amendments concerned does not recognise the full scale of the problem."
"For a doctor such as myself, the evaluation of the effectiveness of medicinal products compared to others is sorely lacking in this new pharmaceutical package."
"It is only the safety and the quality of the new substancesthatcount."
"It is of little importance whether or not they provide a significant clinical benefit."
"I endeavoured to make the concept of added therapeutic value acceptable in order to encourage firms to carry out research into substances that are genuinely innovative, and I came up against the opposition of all of the institutions."
"I was, however, persuaded that this debate will return to this House, because the pharmaceutical industry no longer wants to make do with placing new bogus treatments on the market and overprotecting them for years."
"It is true that the major cause of friction related to the authorisation of generic medicinal products."
"The pharmaceutical industry is trying to delay the sale of generic products, and this is normal."
"The Commission and some Members shared this reaction, however, by restricting the definition of generic products, tightening the conditions for granting authorisations and extending the periods for authorisation by using various tricks: switch, new indications etc."
"Despite opposition from the majority of Member States faced with problems of funding their social security, the first European medicinal products will have the longest protection period of administrative data in the world."
"I wonder, furthermore, about the compatibility of such protection with the Doha provisions that call for the creation of generic medicines for export."
"That is certainly the main concern raised by this legislation when it comes to funding public health."
"Finally, another major disappointment was in the area of homeopathic medicinal products."
"In actual fact and in conclusion, I recognise that we have made much progress, and I welcome this, but it is true that there still remains a great deal to do in the years to come."
"Mr President, I, too, wish to thank the rapporteurs and the Commissioner."
"Nevertheless, I still take issue with two points: patent protection and homeopathic medicinal products."
"In May, ten countries will be joining the European Union."
"Naturally, they are most welcome; at least that is what we tell them."
"Of course, saying and doing are two different things."
"That is also evident today: the proposals that the Commission and the Council have made here can hardly be called a warm welcome."
"For one thing, the compromise on patent protection is extremely disadvantageous for the new Member States."
"In the accession negotiations, it was agreed with these countries that they would include a protection period of six years in their legislation."
"The ‘8 + 2 + 1’ compromise would mean health care in these countries becoming much more expensive: to the tune of hundreds of millions a year."
"Commissioner Liikanen may well promise a transitional period, and I welcome that in itself, but it is less than was agreed."
"Amendment No 55, which I and my colleague Mrs Corbey have tabled and which has the support of a large number of observers, returns to the new Member States what they were promised, thus translating our good words into good deeds."
"A second point is that the compromise proposal on the table also pays particularly scant regard to homeopathic medicinal products, even though a substantial majority in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy did advocate this."
"One hundred and ten million Europeans use these medicinal products, and we must not deny them this."
"I therefore call on my fellow Members to support Amendment Nos 20, 21, 22, 23 and 38."
"Mr President, like Mr Blokland and some other speakers, I want to speak on behalf of the accession states."
"When I was chairing the debates on Mrs Grossetête's and Mrs Müller's reports in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, I was presented with a petition, which I have with me here tonight."
"It was signed by a large number of members of the observer teams from the accession states."
"Almost all the accession states are there represented."
"Certainly a very large number of Polish observers are very worried about this proposal."
"I support the Grossetête and Müller reports."
"I congratulate both our rapporteurs, and I imagine that they will be very glad to see the back of these three proposals."
"They have done very good work."
"However, I also support the ten-year data exclusivity period for the present 15 Member States."
"But I am very aware that the accession states have recently negotiated legislation in their own countries to put the on to their statute book, and that included a period of data exclusivity of six years."
"We are in danger here tonight of glossing over something very important, and I cannot understand why, given that the accession states were able to ask for derogation periods, we are not already hearing exactly what derogation periods they are asking for."
"Part of the trouble may be the responsibility of the accession states themselves: they have not yet asked the Commission the Commissioner can tell us this for delays, temporary derogations, extensions, etc."
"It would be far better, however, and in the interests of transparency, if, before we adopted this legislation - and I know that it is almost too late - we had a list of the derogations requested from the accession states in order to build these into the preamble to the existing directives before us."
"Mr Liikanen may say that is impossible."
"If he does, he is wrong, because that is precisely what we have done in the draft directive on packaging, which we have almost concluded."
"The accession states asked for certain derogations."
"We asked what the dates were."
"They gave us the dates."
"The Commission said that these dates were fairly acceptable."
"We then built into the packaging directive preamble reference to the dates of derogations that the accession states requested."
"If we adopt the legislation before us now without specific reference to the negotiations and to the deadlines requested by the accession states, then we are in danger of producing legislation which is not transparent, because nothing will appear in the Official Journal alongside these directives drawing attention to the deadlines available to the accession states before they need to implement them."
"This is a very bad way of proceeding."
"I have some sympathy with the Poles and others who are worried about this."
"I can see that it is necessary for the health of the western European pharmaceutical industry for us to go for the ten-year data exclusivity period, but we need to be fair to the accession states and, above all, we need to be transparent about the arrangements that we reach with them."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, to begin with, I should like to join in thanking the rapporteurs for their efforts towards bringing this important dossier to a successful conclusion."
"I am very happy that this Parliament, together with the Council, has succeeded in refining the Commission’s proposals substantially, which were indeed very sweeping and liberal at first."
"What is being served up is of course a compromise, with some elements that are good and some that are not so good."
"In any case, it is a good thing that all medicinal productsfalling under EU regulations will have to comply with the same criteria of quality, safety and efficacy."
"Another thing of great importance is that commercial advertising is still outlawed."
"Do you recall the original Commission proposals, which, as a pilot project, sought to permit advertising of medicinal products for AIDS, asthma and diabetes?"
"In my view, patient information must be guaranteed to be reliable and objective."
"It is logical, therefore, that this flow of information be organised and coordinated by the public sector in the first instance."
"I am pleased that the Commission is now being given the task of putting forward proposals, based on an overview of the current situation, to bring about improved, objective information provision, which, in my opinion, will have to include information and sales via the Internet."
"The duration of data protection, however, is less positive, in my opinion."
"After all, in comparison with the United States or Japan, for example, the period of protection for medicinal productsin Europe is extremely long."
"Admittedly, it is a good thing that, from the eighth year, the generic pharmaceuticals industry will be able to start some preparatory work in order that it may place generic medicinal productson the market from the tenth year."
"In my opinion, however, there are too many possibilities for an extra year’s protection to be added, for example when a new indication can be proved."
"In my view, this was entirely unnecessary."
"I sincerely hope, therefore, that the Commission will monitor the situation closely to ensure that these possibilities are not abused."
"Finally, I also regret the absence of an amendment on Doha."
"Mr President, my warmest congratulations to my fellow MEPs Mrs Müller and Mrs Grossetête, and also to the brilliant Commissioner Liikanen and the Italian Presidency."
"We have reached a good compromise: eight years for generic medicinal products, to begin with: the European Parliament achieved this."
"The ten years has been dropped."
"The Dutch Government voted against the common position since it would mean an extra EUR 160 million expenditure per year in the Netherlands alone."
"At first reading, the European Parliament reached a good compromise of between six and eight years."
"We have held on to this, and have also been able to push it through in the face of opposition from the Council and the Commission."
"The centralised procedure via the EMEA in London is increasingly becoming the norm for an increasing number of medicinal products."
"That is a good thing."
"In this regard, too, Parliament has put its stamp on the legislation in no uncertain terms."
"We should have liked more, but the compromise is acceptable."
"It was very important to us, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, to incorporate the environmental effects of medicinal products into that Community legislation."
"REACH does not do this – a small error on the part of our brilliant commissioner."
"That deficiency has now been remedied, however."
"In the case of veterinary medicinal products, negative environmental effects can even lead to a blockade."
"That is not the case with human medicinal products, but negative effects will indeed be taken into account."
"I am happy that the Commission has spoken out on Doha and stated that it will present legislation in early 2004."
"We shall hold the Commission to this."
"American advertising of medicinal products is and remains banned."
"We in the Verts/ALE Group welcome this."
"We shall have to discuss later on how provision of information to patients can be improved via websites and telephone helplines, and indeed that is the crux of the matter."
"Direct patient reporting did not make it."
"Member States can develop this further, however, and some of them will do so, and the subject will return to the agenda later."
"The line between food supplements and medicinal products is not sufficiently well defined."
"Let us hope that the Commission will conduct an accommodating policy on this."
"Homeopathic medicinal products did not make it."
"We in the Verts/ALE Group shall continue to fight for these."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to express my thanks to the two rapporteurs."
"I think we have a good compromise package on the table and I will work to ensure that this House votes for it by a large majority tomorrow."
"The most important point, in my view, is that we will have a uniform system of protection in Europe."
"Regardless of whether we think that eight or nine years is the right period, I believe it is very important, in an internal market, that we do not have the differences which have hitherto existed in Europe."
"That is a major step forward."
"I also greatly welcome the fact that we have been able to achieve an additional year of protection for existing substances."
"Progress sometimes proceeds at a snail’s pace, and it is not always a new substance that brings improvements."
"Sometimes, improvements can also be achieved through studies on existing substances."
"I think we have achieved very important progress here."
"Let me remind you that at first reading, there were a number of points which were already non-contentious but were nonetheless very important."
"We need to speed up procedures."
"We also need to speed up the procedures further where particularly important medicines are concerned, and we need an adjustment of the structures of the European Medicines Agency to the EU of the Twenty-Five."
"All this is very positive."
"I also think we were right to reject the Commission’s proposal on information and advertising."
"The Commissioner has expressed his regret yet again that this was the case, saying that the Commission was proposing to modernise this part of the legislation."
"I am still sceptical."
"Let me give you a specific example to show why I am so sceptical."
"The industry claims that it merely wants to provide information and naturally has no intention of engaging in the type of aggressive advertising that we are familiar with from the USA."
"A few weeks ago, I was in Bratislava in Slovakia, which is not yet part of the EU but thankfully will be joining on 1 May 2004."
"Opposite my hotel, there was a large billboard."
"It showed two people – a couple – lying listlessly in bed."
"Above them, there was Pfizer’s little blue pill – Viagra – and the name of the website:"
"I thought to myself: ‘So this is the objective information that the industry wants to supply to patients via the Internet.’"
"This was advertising, and I for one would prefer not to have this type of advertising in Europe."
"It is not that I have anything against Viagra, but I think that in view of its side effects, Viagra should not be marketed on the Internet but should be prescribed by doctors."
"Objective information should also not be supplied in the manner depicted on the billboard."
"That is why I think we were right to reject this proposal and accept Mrs Grossetête’s compromise."
"I think we have achieved a great deal."
"Sadly, we have surrendered on one point, Commissioner."
"We said that we would not include paediatric medicinal products in this legislation so that the rules on paediatrics could be adopted more swiftly than the overall package."
"Unfortunately, we still do not have a proposal from the Commission."
"Regrettably, I must say to the Commissioner that the Commission should keep its Christmas break short."
"We expect your proposal on paediatric medicinal products in January."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, my heartfelt thanks to the two rapporteurs."
"The amendments improve the common position, but, as far as I am concerned, it is not necessary to wrap the pharmaceutical industry up in cotton wool any longer or any more."
"At the start of the second reading, I put a number of questions regarding the new Member States on the table."
"I shall not pursue these, as I fully agree with what my colleagues Mr Blokland and Mrs Jackson have said on this subject."
"The second point is much more fundamental and concerns the manufacture of medicinal products for developing countries that are undergoing a serious health crisis."
"In early December it became known that AIDS has claimed five million lives over the last five years."
"This is a serious situation, but there is hope."
"On 30 August, on the eve of the WTO Conference in Cancun, the United States, the EU and developing countries came to an agreement speeding up the enablement of the manufacture of generic medicinal products for developing countries."
"It was not an enormous agreement, but it was a start nevertheless."
"However, we must now put that into practice."
"I cannot understand why the Council, the Commission and some fellow MEPs are not prepared to do what the European Union decided before the Cancun Conference."
"The Commission seems to be of the opinion that this matter belongs with the Community patent and national patents legislation."
"That does not seem to me to be an acceptable stance, because we do have data protection."
"That is exactly what this legislation is about."
"A minute ago, Commissioner, you asked me to name a specific medicinal product that cannot now be manufactured on account of data protection, and AZT is such a medicinal product."
"Now, as it was at first reading, Parliament is prepared to get involved, and several resolutions have been adopted, for example the report by Mrs Sandbæk from the Committee on Development and Cooperation, which unanimously called for the Doha agreement to be implemented in this legislation."
"Finally, I have two questions for you, Commissioner."
"Firstly, you have just said that you are prepared to introduce, in the near future, the legislative measures enabling the implementation of the decision of 30 August."
"When can we expect a proposal from you, and is it possible that that will take place in January?"
"Secondly, I am assuming that products manufactured in the European Union are always authorised in the EU."
"Are you now stating that the data protection in this legislation does not constitute the slightest obstacle to the manufacture of generic medicinal products for developing countries by European undertakings?"
"If not, are you prepared to amend this legislation again if necessary?"
"Mr President, may I add my voice to the fully deserved congratulations my fellow Members have offered to the two rapporteurs, Mrs Grossetête and Mrs Müller?"
"We can agree that what we have here is a hard-won compromise, a compromise in which a large number of Parliament’s wishes, in particular, are also fulfilled."
"It is not Parliament who is the winner here, however."
"The winner is the citizen, who will soon be given the possibility of obtaining a good supply of medicinal products, quickly and efficiently."
"A compromise cannot be achieved, however, without some watering down."
"I accept that it is not possible to win on every point."
"May I add some criticisms, however?"
"The first relates to the decision on pharmacists that was taken in the compromise."
"I understand that that amendment did not fit in the legislation as it stood."
"A good supply of medicinal products also requires, however, that pharmacists make their know-how available, not only to patients, but also, in particular, to those writing out the prescriptions."
"That is an omission."
"If we do not regulate this here and now, I shall fight for its regulation in further legislation dealing with the quality of health care."
"As far as I am concerned, it must not be the case that the only places still concerned with medicinal products are supermarkets, because it is cheaper that way."
"My second point concerns homeopathic medicinal products."
"On this subject, the compromise achieved does all users of these medicinal products a great injustice."
"I ask myself why the compromise that has now been achieved would fail if we now voted for a couple of original amendments, such as Amendment No 20."
"I know that some fellow Members have requested a separate vote."
"I have the feeling that we are failing to answer the questions of many on that point."
"I should like a definite answer to the following question."
"Why do we not go further with these homeopathic medicinal products?"
"After all, what has now been adopted in this compromise does not by any means present a solution."
"I am genuinely sad about this."
"My next point concerns Doha and medicinal products."
"I agree with Mrs Corbey’s comments."
"Unlike my fellow MEP Mr Liese, I think that it is a shame that we still do not consider our European citizens fit for independence when it comes to information on medicinal products."
"I am not in favour of advertising; I am, however, in favour of information."
"I think that an independent citizen should be able to obtain the information he or she needs in Europe, too, instead of being redirected from the website of a European undertaking to that of a US undertaking to find this information."
"I think that that is a shame."
"We have missed an opportunity."
"Those were my remarks, and I should like an answer from the Commission regarding homeopathy."
"Mr President, in the space of one minute I can only paint a sketchy picture of the rapporteurs’ work, and I apologise to them in advance."
"I recognise all that they have done."
"I would simply like to say to you that the compromise, which consists in providing medicines with data protection for eight years, plus two, plus one, is a great New Year gift from the European Parliament to the pharmaceutical industry and recognition of the effectiveness of powerful lobbies."
"This gift will, however, further deepen the deficits for the Member States’ social security budgets by delaying the marketing of generic medicines."
"Why such generosity?"
"The pharmaceutical industry put forward the reason that it must fund research, but studies have proven that only a fifth of new medicinal products launched on the market during the last twenty years were really innovations. In addition, the New York Times writes that two thirds of medicinal products approved between 1989 and 2000 were only minor modifications of existing medicinal products."
"Furthermore, if our social security systems urgently need generic medicines, then what about developing countries where 95% of AIDS victims live and where there are also a large number of endemic diseases?"
"There, the lack of generic medicines is,quitesimply, criminal."
"Amendment No 19 of the Grossetête report refers to this."
"For goodness sake, let us adopt this and uphold the spirit of Doha."
"Let us at least set our solidarity with the developing world against the pharmaceutical lobbies."
"Mr President, I thank Mrs Grossetête and Mrs Müller for their personal commitment."
"There is a lot of good in the package before us but, if we are honest, there are a lot of problems as well."
"We have tried to do too much, too fast, with the threat of conciliation and enlargement used as the big stick to knock us into line."
"I object."
"In the months and years ahead we will pay the price, not least to the lawyers who unfortunately will have a field day."
"Commissioner Liikanen, you mentioned that one of the objectives included the need to prepare for enlargement."
"I say to you that a race to conclude this package before enlargement is not the same thing."
"On the Human Medicines Directive, concerns have been raised that, with the wide definition of medicinal products and the supremacy clause, it is possible that food and food supplements, cosmetics and medical devices could all be classified as drugs."
"The Commission's and the Council's solution to this problem is to insert wording in recital 7 Amendment No 60 to the effect that: 'Where a product comes clearly under the definition of other product categories ... this directive should not apply', thereby distinguishing between medicinal products and other products."
"The problem with this solution is that recital 7 will not have any legally binding effect."
"Indeed this recital will not actually go into the Pharmaceuticals Directive itself."
"I have seen an expert legal opinion which advises that, unless modified, the Pharmaceuticals Directive will completely subsume the Food Supplements Directive."
"I have two specific questions on this, which I would like you to answer, Commissioner."
"Why did the Commission and the Council not propose that the recital 7 wording should go into the operative article of the directive to ensure that it has legal effect?"
"What assurance can the Commission give that even if recital 7 wording is not put into an operative part of the directive, it will still be effective in addressing the problem of borderline or frontier products?"
"The Veterinary Medicinal Directive would have benefited significantly if it had been dealt with on its own rather than as part of a package."
"It has not had the scrutiny it deserves, not least in the working groups where it has been dragged along in the wake of the Human Medicines Directive."
"Commissioner Liikanen, you accepted my amendment consolidated Amendment No 3 at first reading over 12 months ago on the prescription-only medicines issue."
"You accepted this in principle, but the text presented to the Council and hence the second reading in Parliament of the common position amounted to the deliberate thwarting of the clearly expressed will of Parliament on three occasions and your own will as Commissioner."
"The common position now requires all medicines for use in food-producing species to be subject to veterinary prescription, but with the possibility of an exempted list of medicines being available without prescription."
"From considerable correspondence with you, Commissioner, it is clear to me that the exemptive list will contain very few medicines and is not a solution."
"Medicines must be available to the farmer in a sensible manner."
"Animal welfare and food safety must be our priority."
"We all appreciate the ability to purchase certain medicines over the counter, without the need to go to the doctor."
"Simple pain relievers, cough medicines, vitamin supplements are cases in point."
"Likewise the farmer should have access to certain medicines without the need to consult a veterinary surgeon."
"By making access to medicines too difficult, use will decline and animal welfare will suffer."
"The use of preventative medicines such as vaccines will decline and we will end up treating sick animals with antibiotics, as opposed to protecting the animal against disease."
"This is not a food safety issue."
"All our information confirms that residues arise from medicines that are already the subject of a prescription regime in all Member States, namely antibiotics."
"Putting even more medicines into the prescription regime will do nothing for food safety."
"Food safety can only be improved by intensive monitoring programmes and large penalties for anyone who violates the residue limits."
"I very much welcome the proposed resolution of the present crisis concerning the availability of veterinary medicines for a range of minor species, including equine veterinary medicines, but this crisis arose because of inadequate scrutiny and inadequate understanding of a previous directive."
"In conclusion, there is no public veterinary medicine as in human medicine, only private veterinary medicine."
"We have an extra duty of care on grounds of animal welfare, the integrity of the veterinary practice, the truth about the impact of the food chain and, most importantly, the economic viability of our farmers."
"We turn to you to ensure that in future there is protection in all these areas, and proper scrutiny, particularly of the Veterinary Medicines Directive."
"Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteurs."
"The pharmaceutical review is important for EU citizens."
"In this review we are not only encouraging research and innovation but we are also trying to get generic medicines on to the market more quickly."
"This will cost the taxpayer less."
"Considering that the drugs bill in the UK has gone up in the region of 30% in the last three years, it is no wonder that a sensible pharmaceutical compromise is necessary."
"We have a compromise package on offer: either Parliament accepts a compromise or we go into a conciliation process in which we risk losing much of what Parliament has wanted."
"I urge colleagues to back the compromise on offer."
"As one of the movers of the original amendments, I warmly welcome the introduction of Braille on the information packaging that patients receive."
"Product names will appear in Braille form on the packaging and a full information text will be available in a range of formats, including Braille, on request."
"I would have preferred more, but I accept the compromise as a step in the right direction in giving access to information to blind and partially sighted people."
"This is a balanced piece of legislation and one which I feel happy to support."
"I hope that colleagues will support the compromise."
"Mr President, I thank Mrs Grossetête for her excellent work on this report."
"The tragedy is that human and veterinary medicines have been confused rather, because both of them are combined in one report."
"We should really be looking at them quite separately."
"I will come back to that in a moment."
"On that score I agree totally with what Mrs Doyle said."
"I would like to take this opportunity to thank both the UK and the Irish Permanent Representatives for their work."
"It is a pity that their work on this report has been rejected by some Member States."
"The Council's co-called common position is not at all a compromise: it is merely a way of expressing the Commission's original proposals, and the Commission has made it clear that any listing of products arising from comitology proposals will largely be under its control."
"The common position would mean, as Mrs Doyle quite rightly said, that many rural small businesses would be put out of business."
"That is of particular importance."
"There has been huge confusion here and this is where the Council seems to have got it totally and utterly wrong that we are asking for exemption for prescription medicines."
"That is not the case: they are already covered under food safety regulations and completely off the record as far as we are concerned."
"We are not asking for that sort of thing."
"Mrs Doyle quite rightly said that while you can go to the chemist's and get a pill for a headache, the problem is that in the United Kingdom and Ireland you can go to similar locally registered people where you can get flea powder, teat-dip for cows all those sort of things."
"And we are going to put at risk not only animal health but also animal welfare and the whole principle, because people just will not bother to pay the money for a vet. That is very important."
"This is already covered, as I have already said, by legislation."
"In the United Kingdom we do not eat horses, dogs, cats, or budgerigars for that matter, so these should not apply."
"I would say to you that if you cannot accept this sort of proposal then maybe we should have taken veterinary medicines out of this particular proposal and had a separate piece of legislation for it."
"In fact, tomorrow, if you are not prepared to accept what Mrs Doyle and I are saying, it might be an idea to vote against this particular piece of legislation and send it back to committee."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this House and our fellow Members have contributed, through their many amendments over the last two weeks, to ensuring that we could achieve a good compromise with the Council."
"I believe this compromise is a gift to European citizens and not, as some Members of the House might think, to the pharmaceuticals industry."
"I take a different view."
"Those of us who have worked intensively on this package of legislation and are familiar with the details also know that the situation is different."
"With the EMEA, we have created efficient structures which safeguard the quality of evaluations, thus ensuring that safe medicinal products are available to patients."
"We have a database containing a wealth of information for patients, doctors and, indeed, for companies themselves."
"We have transparent authorisation procedures, and we have information about adverse reactions, to cite just a few examples of what we have achieved for patients."
"We have a centralised authorisation procedure which covers a wide range of indications."
"As a result, a great many new and innovative medicinal products are subject to the centralised procedure and can be made available at an early stage to patients."
"We have asked the Commission to compile information and guidelines to ensure that the information supplied to patients is genuinely independent."
"All these are things which directly benefit patients."
"In five years’ time, we will have a new authorisation procedure, which will include a cost-benefit analysis."
"In other words, we have achieved a great deal for patients."
"That is why I would ask everyone to be rather more cautious, perhaps, in their arguments for and against this package."
"On the two points concerning the WTO, I have tabled an amendment myself, but I think the most sensible approach is for the Commission to put forward a proposal next year which deals fully with this topic and does not simply produce detailed legislation on the hoof, which would not be a good approach."
"I therefore urge all fellow Members who may have a rather critical viewpoint to support this compromise tomorrow."
"It will benefit Europe’s citizens, and that is a real gift to patients, no one else."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteurs on having produced very good reports."
"I want to state at the beginning that I totally support the view put forward by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten on homeopathic medicine."
"However, as the report I want to deal with tonight is on prescription-only medicine, those are probably the only pleasant comments I will make tonight."
"Is this something you really want to take forward?"
"Both Mr Sturdy and Mrs Doyle asked whether this should not have come forward in separate legislation."
"Surely common sense, somewhere, some time, must prevail, even within the European Commission. Surely!"
"You must listen to what people are saying and the concerns that they have."
"Is this not, once again, total interference in the internal affairs of people within their own nation state?"
"When will you ever learn?"
"I wish to speak on prescription-only medicine because it will have a tremendous effect on my constituency in Northern Ireland."
"We have an efficient, workable, effective system of agricultural merchants."
"Mr Sturdy and Mrs Doyle have said that they have the same system in their own areas as well."
"It works, is effective and does not need to be scrutinised in this way."
"It has done that for centuries."
"What harm has ever been done by those agricultural merchants?"
"All you will do, Commissioner, is drive this trade into the black market."
"You will drive it underground."
"You will drive people to sell on the black market, under the counter."
"That is all you will do and that is what you have done in many other policies, from fishing to every other area in the European Union."
"The European Union and the Commission are not listening to what the people on the ground are saying."
"That is what you must do."
"I know that this is essentially a UK, Irish and perhaps also a Dutch problem."
"But we have that problem."
"And you have to reflect on what we are doing."
"I am amazed by the dictatorial attitude that has come forward from the Commission and indeed from some Member States that want their own way at all costs: get what you want, regardless of the rest!"
"This sends out the wrong message."
"In my opinion that is not what Europe is all about."
"Europe is about much more than this."
"Europe can be much more than this."
"You will deserve what you get, in the longer term, when they start to go underground."
"I urge this House to support the amendment put forward by Mrs Doyle and others."
"That is the way forward."
"I hope, Commissioner, that you will reflect upon that, go back to your college of Commissioners and say that this has to be looked at again."
"You must be flexible."
"You must allow for what has been handed down and what works in certain areas at this moment in time."
"Do not force decent, honest people to go underground; do not force them into the black market."
"I am terribly unhappy that the United Kingdom Government is backing out and not supporting its industry through Coreper."
"It is chickening out of the situation."
"It says it is going to do it by the back door, which will end up placing a tremendous responsibility on farmers and many other people in my constituency and other areas."
"Once again I ask you to support the amendment put forward by Mrs Doyle and the rest of us, as a way forward."
"Mr President, firstly, I thank Mrs Grossetête for her report and I support the last speaker."
"The problem here is that whenever we try to put the whole of Europe together and try to bring in legislation that suits every Member State, one size does not fit all, and that is why I urge this House to support Amendments Nos 27 and 28 by Mrs Doyle."
"Most of the medicines which at present farmers in Ireland and the UK buy not from vets but from general suppliers are either drenches for worms or vaccines and they are administered by the farmers."
"Therefore, it is not the case that the vet will do the administration; these drugs will just be bought from the vets."
"Vets will then have a monopoly on the sale of these commodities and it puts farmers again at a competitive disadvantage."
"We have been told many times by the new world that farmers have to live in that they have to face up to responsibilities and the marketplace and yet here we are preventing them from being able to compete in buying those medicines."
"It is absolutely crazy to try to force this through."
"I echo again what Mr Nicholson said."
"I rather fear that the UK Government, having said all along that it would support the farming industry so they would be able to buy these medicines from suppliers and not from vets, has capitulated and caved in."
"Therefore, it is up to this Parliament to put this legislation forward in a way that will allow flexibility between Member States."
"That is what we are being asked for."
"A huge fuss is being made about food safety, but this is not the issue, because these drugs, wormers and vaccines can be bought from suppliers."
"They can be registered there and therefore we will know when the farmers have bought them."
"The farmers will then administer them, so there is no need go through all the procedure of veterinary prescription and vets-only medicines."
"Therefore, I urge the House once again to support Amendments Nos 27 and 28 by Mrs Doyle."
"– Mr President, all the same I would like to respond to some objections made by my fellow Members."
"First of all, I am disappointed to see behind me that Mrs Jackson left a long time ago."
"I would have liked to tell her what I am going to do and I will also give her an answer in writing tomorrow morning."
"We have concerns regarding the enlargement countries."
"These formed part of the discussions that we had with the Council and the Commission so that, quite rightly, the difficulties that some enlargement countries, but not all, could face with the application of this pharmaceutical legislation were taken into consideration."
"We know, furthermore, that the Commission has made a commitment to propose derogations for some enlargement countries as soon as this legislative package is adopted."
"Above all, however, I would also have liked to tell Mrs Jackson that, this morning, I received a letter from one of our observers from the Czech Republic who declared that he fully supported protecting data for eight years, plus two, plus one, feeling that this was an acceptable compromise between protecting data for six years and the proposal to protect it for ten years plus one."
"He is completely aware that it is important to protect patent rights whilst allowing generic medicines to enter the internal market."
"This is a letter which I will make available to my fellow Members."
"It is not the only one that we have received in this area."
"Furthermore, I would also like to reply to the British and Irish Members on the issue of veterinary medicinal products."
"When I hear my fellow Member, Mrs Doyle, say that we have proceeded much too quickly, I really do find this rather appalling, being aware of the discussions that we have been having for months with the Commission and the Council; hours of discussions to quite rightly find a good compromise."
"When it is an issue of animal safety, I believe that we cannot prevaricate on this issue either."
"When it is an issue of animals raised for food production, you will understand that the concept of safety is essential in this case."
"It is essential for us and it is essential for the Council."
"We also had a large number of discussions about this too."
"The British Members declared that there ought to be separate legislation, but that is what we have!"
"I would like you to look at the texts."
"We have two directives and today we are discussing two directives."
"One regards medicinal products for human use and the other regards veterinary medicinal products."
"There are simply a number of provisions regarding the directive on medicinal products for human use that are the same as the provisions for the directive on veterinary medicinal products."
"I would, therefore, like you to look closely at these texts, before speaking, in order to avoid this type of mistake."
"When you refer to something that is specific to Britain and Ireland – and I hope that it is not because of this specific characteristic that you are going to take the risk of not adopting this compromise – I would like to remind you that Article 67 of the common position rightly provides for derogations, medicine by medicine."
"You, therefore, already have the answer in the text."
"All the same, I would like there to be a little more honesty in this type of discussion."
"When you tell us that horses are not in fact part of the diet in the United Kingdom, then you really should not forget, and you know this all too well, that when these horses are no longer of use in the United Kingdom, then they are exported to other Member States to end up on our butchers’ stalls."
"This is why there should be much more safety regarding the prescription of veterinary medicinal products."
"There are still many things to be said but I would like to finally conclude by stressing that we ended up with compromises that were especially difficult to reach and that the Italian Presidency made the necessary effort to consider a number of requests that it did not intend to take into consideration at the start, and it would be particularly serious to be responsible for not adopting these compromises."
"Like my fellow Member Mrs Müller, I appeal to your sense of responsibility: do not allow yourselves to adopt amendments that are not part of the compromises."
"You would call these compromises into question."
"That means to say that there would certainly be conciliation, Mrs Doyle, but it is not absolutely certain that we would obtain the results that we amassed today."
"I therefore ask you to adopt these compromises tomorrow and, above all, not to risk, or be responsible for, allowing what we have achieved through weeks of work to run aground."
". Mr President, I would like to reply to at least those Members who asked questions and who are still present."
"Firstly, Mrs Corbey's written question on Doha."
"If I rephrase your question it will be easier to give a reply."
"I want to be very precise here."
"Authorisation is needed for medicines only in the EU market, so this legislation concerns medicines which are authorised for the Community market."
"Mrs Corbey asks whether I declare that data protection does not hinder and here I rephrase it the production of the medicines in the EU to be authorised in the developing countries."
"If I rephrase it like this, then my reply is 'yes'."
"It means that this legislation concerns the authorisation to market products in the EU."
"If TRIPS and patents mean that products produced in one country can be exported to a developing country, this has no impact, because this protection only concerns authorisation to market: it is not linked to manufacturing."
"We are not regulating manufacturing via this regulation, we are regulating authorisation to market."
"There is one small exception: Bolar provision, because there is always some production as regards generics."
"I fully share the concerns of Mrs Corbey, Mr Whitehead and many others that we must respect Doha."
"Doha takes a strict position on the patent."
"It does not take a position on data protection."
"Data protection is not linked to market authorisation outside the EU."
"Products outside the EU will be authorised for placing on the market by the authorities of those third countries, according to their legislation."
"I hope that this has clarified the situation."
"This does not hinder in any way the implementation of Doha."
"Secondly, as far as commitment is concerned, what I have said here before has been accepted by the whole college of Commissioners: it will be our first priority in early 2004, which is in two weeks' time."
"I will do my best also to help my colleagues prepare, because not all the proposals fall under my direct responsibility."
"I will, however, take this issue up once this has been voted."
"Mrs Jackson raised the issue of the new Member States and asked how many of them have asked for a transition period."
"So far none have asked, but for good reason: we cannot start to negotiate on transition periods before the legal act has been adopted."
"Then we will be able to start negotiations."
"My position which my colleagues support is positively open."
"We understand the transition period is a problem here."
"Mr Liese raised the issue of paediatric medicines."
"I feel a little uncomfortable here because I personally told this House that a proposal would soon be forthcoming."
"As I said before, the Commission decided that this proposal should go through an extended, in-depth assessment, which has delayed the procedure."
"On the one hand, this is good for better regulation but, on the other hand, it has caused a delay."
"We will do that early in 2004."
"I will take personal responsibility here because it is my proposal."
"Mr Liese also raised the question of direct consumer advertising."
"He mentioned a case in Bratislava."
"If you have been surfing the Internet or looking at your e-mail, you will have seen a lot of aggressive advertising which pops up on your screen and which you cannot do anything about."
"That is an explosive problem which we must deal with, but I am sure we can come back to that in the future."
"I turn now to the points made by Mrs Doyle, Mr Whitehead, Mr Parish and Mr Nicholson on veterinary medicine."
"I know they feel very strongly about this issue."
"Mrs Doyle has talked about it in committee and elsewhere and I understand her problem."
"When we say that we can accept an amendment in principle, it would of course be more precise to say that the amendment should be subject to modification, because normally, permanent derogation will never go through in the Member States' institutions."
"Permanent derogations are exceptional."
"The compromise gives a limited exemption which should be applied in a harmonised manner."
"It states, however, that Member States may grant exemption from this requirement according to criteria established in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 89(2)."
"So it will limit it, and this can be done on the basis of this compromise."
"Mr Nicholson mentioned internal affairs."
"That issue was raised in the Council and many Member States strongly contested that position."
"They say that even though the medicines may not circulate on the internal market, meat, as a food product, circulates."
"So there is an impact across the national borders."
"That has been the position of many Member States and for reasons of internal market coherence they contested the possibility of having a permanent derogation in this area."
"Unfortunately Mrs de Keyser has gone, because I would have liked to reply in even more depth to her comment."
"Discussions regarding the pharmaceuticals industry are always problematic."
"We have public objectives which are accepted across the board: we need to have better health that is what medicines are for."
"But if there are no innovative new medicines we will not be able to tackle illness in the way we should."
"There have been some success stories in the last 20 years for example, illnesses which were extremely difficult to handle without heavy treatment in closed institutions can now be treated with medicines."
"But this cannot be done without innovation."
"Twenty or thirty years ago people with mental illnesses were placed in institutions."
"Today they can live freely, which means better quality of life and also lower costs."
"So we need to pursue innovation."
"Let us take the example of Alzheimer's Disease."
"If we do not find any new, innovative medicines the cost will be enormous."
"We must support innovation."
"Somebody referred to the situation in America where exclusivity periods are shorter."
"Compare the costs for a moment."
"Because we in Europe cover the costs from public budgets we want to have a say in pricing levels."
"The longer protection period gives some compensation for innovation, due to the lower prices."
"I commissioned a study in 2000 to assess the state of the European pharmaceuticals market."
"It showed that in Europe there are countries where, after the expiry of a patent or data protection, there is no change in the price level of generics."
"They remain at the same price level."
"So there are high prices when they are put under a patent and under data exclusivity and no change after that."
"This proposal will certainly create a real European market for generics."
"When the rules are the same and they are harmonised, I am sure the generic industry will profit from this opportunity."
"We need to invest in innovative medicines in order to be able to tackle difficult diseases but, at the same time, we need to push prices of generics down to reduce the costs."
"That is the balance we want to achieve."
"I am personally convinced that in that area this House has been working on very good balance."
"Finally, I want to thank this House for a good debate."
"It has been very committed in its work throughout this period."
"I must also say that not all the issues have been solved here, but we all have worked very hard and very well to find a compromise which is good for public health and innovation."
"Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, on a point of order?"
"I would appreciate it if you would tell me under which Rule you are requesting a point of order."
"I am always polite."
"That means that I am always sitting in this Chamber to hear the answers of the Commissioner."
"If the Commissioner does not give me an answer regarding homeopathic medicine, then I will convince him tomorrow, when a large part of this House will vote against some compromises because we did not get an answer."
"Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, you know that this is not a point of order."
"It is a political position."
"Mr President, it is a question to the Commissioner."
"My question to the Commissioner was crystal clear, and I should like a little bit more clarification on this."
"Just to make sure we are all singing from the same hymn sheet: the Doha amendment serves to enable manufacture for developing countries lacking that capacity themselves."
"Am I to understand from your answer that we are sending unauthorised medicinal products to developing countries?"
"If so, those developing countries must then authorise them themselves, but how can they do this if they ..."
"Mrs Corbey, this is not a point of order."
"I cannot reopen the discussion on this matter."
"I understand, but I cannot reopen a discussion that has already taken up so much time."
"You do not have a point of order."
"Mr President, mine is as much a point of order as the last two were."
"I asked two specific questions on the Human Medicines Directive, particularly on the definition of a medicinal product, and recital 7 on the legality of it."
"Maybe those two specific questions could be answered by the Commissioner."
"They are important."
"Again, that is not a point of order."
"I will make myself clear."
"The Commissioner has answered questions, naming each Member that took the floor."
"Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, please!"
"I heard the Commissioner answer the questions of each Member, mentioning the names."
". Mr President, in the middle of my reply there was a lot of shouting in the House, so I had to conclude earlier than planned."
"However, I am ready to continue my reply."
"In response to Mrs Corbey, I should like to clarify that there is a difference with regard to manufacturing authorisation - Doha concerns manufacturing."
"We fully support it."
"Authorisation to market is regulated by this directive which is before the House."
"It in no way limits Doha for they are handling different parts of the issue."
"If, according to Doha, manufacturing is allowed for developing countries, the authorisation to market in developing countries will be given to the authorities of the countries."
"The question is that this data is needed for authorisation to market."
"On the issue raised by Mrs Doyle concerning recital 7: it is an explanation of the clause provided for in Article 2(2); the provision contains only the legal wording of the clause."
"I said, in part, when I replied to Mrs Grossetête, that my services will discuss with all interested parties the proper application of this issue."
"With regard to Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's question, on Amendment No 20, which asks for Member States to take due account of products registered in other Member States, our position is that the common position goes beyond that amendment because it submits these products to mutual recognition."
"I have tried to reply to all the questions that were raised."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (Α5-0452/2003), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on traditional herbal medicinal products (12754/1/2003 C5-0519/2003 2002/0008(COD)) (Rapporteur: Mr Nistico)."
"Mr President, after this report on the legislative package regarding medicinal products – a report that, as we have seen, made veins and pulses tremor – my report is like drinking a relaxing cup of camomile tea."
"I am in fact extremely satisfied, and I would, therefore, like to thank both the Council and the Commission, and also all the shadow rapporteurs, in particular Mrs Roth-Behrendtwho I am sorry to say is not here today because she has the flu – and she apologises for her absence – and of course all the Members who contributed to improving this directive."
"The directive, as adopted, finally brings order to an area that is very confused and much debated."
"On the one hand, it precisely states the scope of the directive and excludes the use of herbal products as provided for in the other directives; on the other hand, in the interests of consumers and their health protection, it specifies characteristics regarding quality and good production practice."
"Whilst the value of therapy with traditional herbal products must be recognised, it must also not be forgotten that inappropriate use can lead to the emergence of undesired side effects, sometimes serious ones."
"So far, for example, the ‘Food and Drug Administration’ has registered about 2 900 cases of toxic effects, including, if you look closely, 104 deaths predominantly caused by abuse of ephedra, as well as serious side effects of other products that are used daily such as St John’s Wort, ginkgo biloba and also ginseng."
"This is why it was important to adopt a directive that seeks to protect consumer health which, on the one hand, calls for better quality and safety standards, but also, on the other hand, for it to be obligatory for labels and illustrative leaflets to include rigorous scientific indications that are simple and clear for citizens about the potential toxicity of herbal medicines, as well as their interaction with food, drinks and other medicinal products when taken together."
"As you know traditional herbal medicines mean those that have been in use for at least 30 years, of which 15 years in countries of the Community."
"Nevertheless, at the request of an individual country – and this was a reason for improving the directive – and with a reasoned opinion from the Technical and Scientific Committee for Herbal Medicinal Products of the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMEA), the period of use of 15 years can be significantly reduced."
"Another positive aspect is the creation of a Committee for Herbal Medicinal Products as part of the EMEA."
"Parliament clearly indicated how this committee should be distinct from the Committee on Proprietary Medicinal Products."
"It should deal with classification, with preparing a list of traditional medicinal herbs, with updating lists, with preparing relevant monographs, and with assessing dossiers in the event of disputes at national level."
"At second reading, Parliament proposed and also adopted two amendments."
"In particular, an initial amendment inserted in the recital intends to clarify, somewhat unnecessarily, the scope of the present directive by specifying that this only regards traditional herbal medicinal products, whilst the use of plants or herbs for food use fall under the current specific European legislation for food products."
"The second amendment is merely a specification: it concerns inserting the word ‘traditional’ when talking about herbal products."
"Both of the amendments were then adopted by the Council, as appears from the communication to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy of 8 December 2003."
"After all, the current directive defines the harmonised legislative framework for all countries of the European Union in favour of free movement of traditional herbal medicinal products within the Community."
"This guarantees, furthermore, the maximum level of public health protection on the basis of documentation requested regarding quality, efficacy and safety."
". In January 2002 the Commission proposed its directive amending, as regards traditional herbal products, the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use."
"Now we have the possibility to adopt the legislation successfully in the second reading."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr. Nisticò, for his consistent effort in this."
"What were the concerns that we wanted to address through the adoption of this legislative initiative?"
"The proposal aimed at guaranteeing a high level of health protection for European patients using traditional herbal products."
"It was also intended to ensure a single market for herbal medicines by introducing harmonised rules and procedures."
"To that end, the proposal provided for a simplified registration system for traditional herbal products."
"The quality requirements to be met are the same as those for all medicinal products."
"But to avoid unnecessary testing and burdens on firms, the legislation foresees that new pre-clinical and clinical trials will not be necessary when sufficient knowledge already exists about a particular product."
"The Council common position is consistent with these objectives and main principles."
"Moreover, it retains the substance of around two-thirds of the amendments proposed by the EP during its first reading."
"On 27 November the parliamentary committee adopted two amendments."
"The Council has already acknowledged that it finds these amendments acceptable."
"The first aims at clarifying that foodstuffs (including herbal products) will continue to fall within the scope of food law."
"The second aims at specifying the purpose of the list of herbal substances to be drawn up by the future committee on herbal medicinal products."
"The Commission supports these two clarifications."
"I would like to take this opportunity to thank you all for your efforts concerning the adoption of this directive, and in particular for the discussions over the past weeks leading to the possibility of successfully concluding the dossier during this second reading at the European Parliament."
"Mr President, I should like to commend Mr Nisticò on his success in bringing Parliament and the Council together on the issues that remained outstanding during the second reading."
"As a result of negotiations between all concerned, a compromise was agreed on prior to the vote in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, allowing for a consensus incorporating only two amendments tabled by myself and other colleagues from an original list of ten amendments."
"Under the first of these amendments, traditional herbal food products that are non-medicinal should continue to come under existing food legislation and not pharmaceuticals legislation."
"The second amendment essentially provides that the list of herbal substances to be set up by the Committee for Herbal Medicinal Products should only cover the medicinal use of herbal substances."
"This would allow, for example, herbs to be used, along with vitamins and minerals, as food supplements and to come under food legislation."
"This logical approach avoids overlapping jurisdictions."
"The solution presented in the common position and the European Parliament's two amendments is eminently sensible and has the full support of the Commission."
"I would urge colleagues to give them a positive vote tomorrow."
"I welcome this directive, which recognises the value of medicinal plants as an important complement to modern chemical medicines."
"The traditional and herbal medicines sector is one that is of increasing significance and is expanding in scope and popularity across the Community."
"This directive allows for the fast-tracking of traditional medicinal herbs, which is most welcome."
"However, we must look towards establishing systems that encourage research and development."
"This was a key concern of mine in my former Amendment No 10, tabled in the Environment Committee, which was aimed, at one level, at avoiding the constraints imposed by an overly narrow and historical definition of traditional medicines, to further product development."
"This amendment was withdrawn in the interest - shared by all of us here - of maintaining the integrity of the directive."
"As in the conventional medicines field, innovation must be encouraged in this area and we must look to the future as well as to the past."
"I hope that when the Commission reviews this directive in three years' time it will recognise that this is a dynamic field and one in which new products are constantly emerging."
"While efficacy and safety must never be compromised, we need to look at building in mechanisms that will allow traditional medicines to continue to evolve in terms of their application and use and the better exploitation of the therapeutic potential of medicinal plants."
"This is an exciting area, one that we must not be afraid of, and one that will not benefit from over-regulation."
"We must protect the consumer in terms of efficacy and safety, but at the end of the day we must leave the choice with the consumer."
"Again, I thank Mr Nisticò for his sympathetic acceptance of colleagues' views and of our amendments in the various areas."
"I thank him for his cooperation throughout."
"Mr President, I thank our rapporteur, Professor Nisticò, who has done a lot of work considering how controversial this debate was in first reading."
"The directive based on the common position text will introduce a regulatory regime for traditional herbal medicines, giving the public assurances as to safety and quality, as well as systematic consumer information relating to traditional herbal remedies sold over the counter."
"The common position incorporates significant additional areas of flexibility over the scope of the directive, as had been sought by Labour MEPs, including a number of herbal interest groups as well."
"These include greater flexibility to take account of evidence of traditional use from outside the EU and the possibility of vitamins and minerals being added to traditional herbal remedies which are ancillary to the activity or the active herbal ingredients."
"It is due to this progress that we have had very few people disagreeing with our approach during this second reading."
"As I described in first reading, presently consumers are unaware of some shoddy practices going on in this sector."
"Last year I gave the example of echinacea root."
"Over the past few weeks there has been some debate over echinacea due to a report by the University of Washington in Seattle questioning its effectiveness."
"However, there are plenty of other reports highlighting its effectiveness and, as a user of this product, I believe it helps especially at this time of year in combating colds."
"Sadly, in information provided to me analysing four different echinacea root products only one contained what it claimed it had on the label."
"This is not good for echinacea and certainly not good for the consumer."
"One product failed to comply because of excessive amounts of ash and acids in soluble ash."
"Another did not contain echinacea root at all and another had not been solely manufactured from echinacea root powder, as was claimed on the label."
"This means that when I purchase this product I have a one in four chance of getting what is described on the label."
"This is just not good enough."
"That is why the Consumers' Association, the British Herbal Medical Association, the European Herbal Practitioners' Association, the UK National Institute of Medical Herbalists, the Register of Chinese Herbal Medicine, the International Register of Consultant Herbalists and similar herbal practitioners across Europe back this initiative."
"The message from genuine manufacturers who love the herbal sector is clear: they need basic regulations which reward quality producers and give consumers the standards they deserve."
"The herbal sector is no longer a cottage industry."
"It is a multi-million-dollar industry, and genuine manufacturers who are doing the right thing are suffering commercially because cowboy dealers are breaking the rules."
"We need regulation in this sector in order to protect the consumer and reward those decent producers making quality products."
"I hope Members will back this recommendation for second reading and the sooner this becomes law, the better."
"I should like to thank Professor Nisticò once again."
"Mr President, this directive is supposed to harmonise the legislative framework for traditional herbal medicines."
"While I believe it is very important that we try to cut out cowboys and people who operate in a completely unacceptable manner, this legislation was supposed to provide a simplified registration procedure that would allow the registration and marketing of certain traditional herbal medicines that have been on the market for a specific period of time."
"In the first reading it was quite clearly limited to herbal medicinal products or pharmacological activity and excluded food supplements."
"Many feel that it is extremely important to protect the herbal supplements already on the markets of most Member States."
"These herbal supplements should be regulated under food law."
"We need to safeguard the long-term future of traditional medicines, which I believe are much more important and beneficial than the synthetic and pharmaceutical approaches to health care."
"Member States must also be allowed to introduce national rules on their territory to accommodate any traditional or non-conventional approaches to health care not covered by the directive."
"Health care must take precedence over commercial considerations."
"Where Member States wish to have control over any health care tradition that they consider to be of value to their citizens, they should be entitled to do so, regardless of the aspirations for commercial harmonisation."
"Harmonisation should not mean that diversity is destroyed."
"European citizens have a right to retain their local cultural traditions."
"This is particularly important where the cultural traditions relate to health care products that are not yet scientifically understood."
"Traditional medicines should be protected as living traditions."
"In many EU countries traditional medicine is a living tradition that has continued to evolve over many years and has the capacity to continue to evolve."
"The natural evolution of traditional medicine is stunted by this directive that defines 'traditional' in a purely historical context and restricts its application to what took place many years ago."
"The scope of traditional medicine is greater than the directive recognises."
"This must be taken into account."
"Traditional medicines are used extensively to treat a wide range of serious conditions in Member States, which should be entitled to introduce appropriate regulation to accommodate such practices."
"I believe that if you stunt the possibility for traditional medicines, you are doing a disservice to the consumer and the public."
"Everyone recognises that there are people who act in an unorthodox manner, but I believe that traditional medicine is much more beneficial, in the long term, than the pharmaceutical approach."
"Mr President, many people have good experiences of using herbal medicine to supplement ordinary medicine and treatment."
"Herbal medicine must, moreover, be seen as an ecologically sound alternative to the many unnatural chemicals we let out into the environment in the form of chemical medicine."
"The area of natural medicine is far from being fully charted."
"There are presumably many good products around the world that we have still not used or with which we are unfamiliar in Europe."
"We must not rule out the development of all these known and unknown ecologically sound medicinal preparations."
"That is what I in actual fact think we are doing with the directive’s demand for approval and registration."
"In Denmark, we obtained a similar regulation of herbal preparations a few years ago."
"From previously having approximately 2 500 different products, there are now only 50 approved products."
"Well-educated and experienced therapists now complain about the lack of legal access to many important preparations for treating, for example, cancer and allergies."
"I cannot therefore support the directive."
"Mr President, I appreciate that a large number of people will benefit enormously from this directive - the lobbyists and those who are entertained by them."
"But vast numbers of UK suppliers of herbal medicines are small business people, often sole traders, for whom the prospect of having to register products under this directive will be a burden too great to contemplate."
"The result will inevitably be the decline of the small specialist shopkeeper in favour of the large pharmaceutical companies."
"With this proposed directive we are seeing yet another imposition of the Nanny State, creating laws where none currently exist in the UK, for a well-established small market whose consumers are invariably well informed."
"The proposed amendments will disallow the registration of significant numbers of products currently recognised as traditional herbal medicines, on which many people depend for their wellbeing and in which they have great faith."
"My party is totally opposed to this legislation, which we see as yet another area in which harmonisation is being imposed to the detriment of the freedom of individuals."
"Mr President, I understand that the purpose of this proposal is to allow the regulation of herbal medicines under a simplified procedure."
"However, it is a fact that producers, retailers and consumers have been astonished and dismayed by the cascade of highly restrictive legislation dealing with such products that have been safe and available in certain Member States including my own for many years."
"We have heard from certain colleagues, particularly in the UK, that is also the case there."
"We need simple, basic regulation to protect the consumer because there are, as Mrs Stihler has said, products that purport to contain herbal remedies that do not actually contain those herbals."
"However, while doing that, we need to ensure that products are not withdrawn from the market as a result of legislation and we cannot be certain that this is going to be the case under the present procedures."
"I welcome the clarification that the amendments make to the report."
"It is particularly important to clarify that the Committee for Herbal Medicines should only deal with products for medicinal use, not food use."
"I, like MrsStihler, use echinacea."
"I also use garlic."
"Garlic is an extremely potent medicinal remedy; it is also a food in wide circulation."
"We risk making a nonsense of ourselves if we allow this committee to deal with food products."
"I want to emphasise this point to the Commissioner and I hope he takes it on board."
"I would like to thank all the colleagues in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy for their hard work, but it is a fact that there is a great diversity of traditions within the Community and the harmonisation of this legislation really risks losing products that are in safe use and have been in safe use for years."
"Our citizens will not accept this."
"I give the Commissioner full warning that if this ensues it will not be a happy result either for the Member States or for Brussels."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"– The next item is the recommendation for second reading (Α5-0458/2003), on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on measuring instruments (9681/4/2003 – C5-0417/2003 – 2000/0233(COD)) (Rapporteur: Mr Chichester)."
". Mr President, we now come to a measure of great length, weight, size, volume, thickness and complexity with the capacity to affect a wide range of instruments."
"National legislation on measurements and measuring instruments has been with us a long time."
"It precedes European legislation and reflects the importance of accuracy of measurement on the daily life of people."
"All EU and developed countries have metrological institutes charged with the task of establishing traceability of measurement results."
"The first question to ask is: why the interest in measuring instruments?"
"The answer is because all developed countries have complex economies which need a minimum level of measurement accuracy for fair trading in the public interest."
"Thus all legislation is based on the premise that the public interest is served if measuring instruments are subjected to legislative requirements that guarantee this minimum level of accuracy."
"A number of concepts or issues are raised in this proposal."
"Optionality: Amendment No 2 essentially states that a Member State will be free to decide whether or not to regulate in this field."
"However, Member State legislation should not act as a technical barrier to completion of the internal market, nor cause unfair competition."
"Regarding harmonised standards, in order to meet the essential requirements for any of the instruments covered by this directive, the manufacturer must show conformity in one of three ways as made clear in Amendment No 21."
"It is important that manufacturers have the choice between the requirements in new Annex 2, together with the detail of the instrument-specific annexes M1 to M10, or by applying the relevant European harmonised standard, or by compliance with the relevant parts of the normative documents adopted by the OIML and approved by the new measuring instruments advisory committee and published in the Official Journal."
"This advisory committee also has an important regulatory role which is why new Compromise Amendment No 30 is so crucial in requiring proper consultations with representatives of interested parties i.e. the industry and practitioners."
"Perhaps the most important improvement to the common position lies in Compromise Amendment No 32: the joint declaration of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission regarding conformity assessment procedures."
"It has been a matter of much concern to your rapporteur that there is inconsistency between the conformity assessment modules in Council Decision 93/465/EEC and Annexes A to H1 of the common position."
"After much discussion, the compromise position has yielded a commitment to review both texts and bring forward a full set of coherent conformity assessments very soon, which I believe will make industry much more content."
"In which context I thank the presidency for its measured but constructive approach and I thank the Commission for being instrumental in finding the compromise text."
"One matter remains before this long process reaches conclusion."
"That concerns our desire to distinguish between manufacturers and traders in the definition of terms in this proposal."
"If the Commissioner is willing to give an undertaking that he will include a review of the definitions in the overall review of the conformity modules I am mandated by the committee to withdraw Amendments Nos 3 and 11."
"We naturally expect the Council to respect the spirit of cooperation and compromise involved so as to shorten the procedure."
"I shall close by thanking my shadow rapporteur, Mr Glante, other colleagues, and the staff of the committee for their helpful and constructive work on this proposal."
". Mr President, firstly, let me express my congratulations to the European Parliament and in particular to the rapporteur, Mr Chichester, for his intensively prepared second reading report and by using the word 'intensively', I am not exaggerating."
"The present proposal replaces ten existing directives and implements the principle of the new approach for technical harmonisation."
"The aim of the proposal is to ensure appropriate consumer protection by imposing the use of high-quality instruments for measurement tasks, covering commercial transactions."
"Examples are gas meters, electricity meters, petrol pumps and taxi meters."
"The proposal imposes technical requirements, expressed in performance terms, allowing for different technical solutions to be applied, thus allowing innovative products to be developed and enhancing competitiveness in line with the principle of subsidiarity."
"The proposal, however, does not use legal instruments to lay down which measurement tasks must be performed."
"This remains the competence of Member States."
"I am pleased that the rapporteur supports the common position concerning measuring instruments."
"His amendments contain many good and useful suggestions, all of which the Commission can support."
"In reply to the rapporteur's question, the revision of conformity assessment procedures, which has been agreed upon in the joint declaration and in Amendment No 32, also includes harmonisation of the definitions of specific terms used in certification, such as 'manufacturer', 'authorised representative', 'trader', etc."
"With the Commission’s support for Parliament’s amendments, I trust that the Council will agree with you in a second reading."
"Thank you, Mr President."
"Commissioner, Mr Chichester, ladies and gentlemen, I was my group’s shadow rapporteur during the first reading of this Measuring Instruments Directive, and have followed the inception, development and progress of this directive throughout the two readings."
"The rapporteur has been kind enough to express his thanks to me, and I would like to take this opportunity to reciprocate."
"He has shown a masterly grasp of this highly complex and technical subject matter and settled into the work very quickly during the second reading."
"We worked well together."
"I think it is important to say this, for although our political views diverge in a number of respects, we were able to collaborate very closely and productively on this project."
"There is no point in seeking confrontation needlessly."
"I would therefore like to reciprocate his thanks."
"It was a great pleasure working with him."
"As has already been mentioned, this new directive replaces ten existing directives."
"It may thus be a small contribution to dismantling bureaucracy, which is something we are always calling for in a range of areas."
"It remains a complex but also a very important directive."
"On the issues of optionality and the distinction between manufacturers and traders – Amendment No 32 and Commissioner Liikanen’s statement play a key role here – there was vigorous debate about whether the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy would be willing, yet again, to conclude the matter through an informal trialogue during the second reading."
"I would like to reiterate – especially since I myself will have an opportunity to make a statement on my own report tomorrow – that the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy is showing good will and is happy to adopt this approach."
"This must not, however, become the rule."
"We are making these exceptions in order to speed up the procedure."
"The compromises which have been found are acceptable."
"The Commission’s opinion and statement are good too."
"Naturally, I very much hope, as do the rapporteurs and my fellow Committee members, that the Council will write this letter and submit this declaration accordingly so that we can actually conclude the matter and do not wind up in a conciliation procedure after all, on the basis of the compromise which has now been achieved."
"Otherwise, I am very happy with the outcome."
"I hope that European industry, users and manufacturers will be satisfied with it."
"Perhaps you will permit me, at the end of our pre-Christmas session and almost at the end of the year, to express my hope that our British colleagues and above all the hospitality industry in Great Britain will be satisfied with the rules on measures for beer glasses."
"I understand that this is a particular problem."
"However, I think we have found a good solution here as well."
"Thank you very much for the collaboration and particular thanks to the interpreters for providing their services at such a late hour in the evening."
"Mr President, I would like to join in the congratulations just expressed to our rapporteur."
"At this time of night I cannot match him in using words skilfully in the form of puns as he did in his speech, but, well done!"
"I am pleased that we will be able to present this to the public as a move towards efficiency and clarity."
"This will not get big headlines in newspapers for the rapporteur or anyone else, but it is extremely important for the public to have clarity and security in the measuring instruments used as listed for items of public health, public safety, public order, protection of the environment and, indeed, the levying of taxes and duties and the protection of consumers and fair trading."
"All those public goods need accurate, trustworthy measurements, and in the European Union we need to get rid of the barriers to trade that might exist without such instruments."
"A quite considerable range of instruments has been mentioned, including water meters, taxi meters, exhaust-gas analysers and breathalysers."
"We support, as Mr Glante has said, the principle of optionality: it is quite reasonable to give Member States a choice as to whether or not they regulate."
"But with that choice goes a responsibility not to put up trade barriers or to be unfairly competitive."
"The comitology issues that concern us appear to have been solved."
"This is an example of the new approach to harmonisation."
"We have to bear in mind that there may well be technological advances or problems we have not heard or thought of, perhaps, for example, electromagnetic interference."
"The simplification, clarity and conciseness of the rapporteur are helpful."
"I am glad that the Commission agrees and I look forward to the Council of Ministers taking the same approach."
"The joint declaration on the procedures for ensuring conformity with the review of texts will be welcome."
"I am glad that the countries which will be joining us in May 2004 will have an example of how Member States can make decisions in the context of a European Union which wants fair competition and does not want barriers to trade."
"I am sure that they have been following this work with interest."
"We hope there will be an agreement at second reading."
"Our committee has a reputation for putting in hours of work in the form of informal trialogues."
"Some of us sometimes question whether we are misguided in doing that in comparison with other committees such as the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"But my belief is that, so far, we have managed in an assertive way to put across our points of view."
"I congratulate the rapporteur again."
"Mr President, after this memorable, perhaps even historic weekend, we should be making even more use of our right to ask questions."
"Is what we are doing here really necessary?"
"Do we need it to the extent envisaged?"
"Is it not rather surprising that a fellow Member who generally lobbies for as little regulation as possible is now working in such technical detail?"
"Is it really a success for Europe if we have now more precise knowledge about the measures on beer glasses in Great Britain?"
"I doubt it very much."
"Are we not on the wrong track?"
"Is it not precisely this form of regulation, which concerns neither product liability nor very clear principles, that is likely to lead us in quite the wrong direction?"
"Surely we need genuine transparency in our work, and that includes what we are doing here."
"If we look around the group of fellow Members here, surely all we are doing is just patting each other on the back, with very high costs for the taxpayer."
". Mr President, it was not my intention to hog the debate, but in response to Mr Martin's question I should like to point out that, yes, harmonisation is necessary here."
"In the light of the famous case law, harmonisation is necessary because national technical regulations conflict and separate conformity assessments are required."
"The proposal in question based on the new approach replaces some 11 existing old-approach directives which allow for national legislation to exist alongside Community provisions and are technically outdated."
"Harmonisation thus allows firms to gain from economies of scale and to improve the competitiveness of European firms in the global market."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.(1)"
"The next item is the statements from the Council and the Commission on the Members' Statute."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate on a Statute for Members of the European Parliament."
"Mr President, when the Council Presidency wrote to you on 21 November 2003, we stated clearly that the Council was fully open to dialogue with Parliament on this issue."
"Moreover, that statement confirmed the offer made by the Greek Presidency, in the person of Mr Papandreou, on 20 June 2003."
"That is why today’s debate is important, providing us with an opportunity to move forward and to explore the possibility of reaching agreement at last after 25 years."
"Mr President, the Council fully respects the primary role played by the European Parliament in drawing up the Statute for its Members."
"According to the procedure laid down in the Treaty, it is Parliament’s responsibility to lay down the regulations and general conditions governing the performance of the duties of its Members, after seeking an opinion from the Commission and with the approval of the Council, which requires unanimity as regards taxation."
"It is therefore clear that the European Parliament cannot introduce the Statute without the consent of the Council, and the Council cannot approve the Statute unless Parliament puts forward proposals it can accept."
"It would be as well to remember this."
"Mr President, I know that many of you are keen to know what the Council's position is on the Statute in general and, more specifically, on a number of proposals which have been made at different levels in recent weeks."
"When Parliament forwarded its proposal for a Statute to the Council last June, it was clear that substantial differences existed between our respective positions, thus preventing the Council from giving its approval."
"You will remember that, before that, last March, the Greek President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Papandreou, outlined to a Parliamentary delegation the parts of the Statute which were acceptable to the Council and which were not."
"I regret to say that Parliament's June proposal was too far removed from the Council’s positions and that made it impossible for us to give our approval."
"I will, if I may, outline once again the Council’s position on the key issues."
"Firstly, the Council is of the unanimous view that we cannot modify primary law by means of the Statute: the aspects relating to primary law will therefore have to be regulated through a different instrument."
"The Council welcomes the measures recently adopted by the Bureau of the European Parliament on the reimbursement of expenses."
"In the Council’s opinion, this reimbursement must be carried out on the basis of costs actually incurred."
"On taxation of Members of Parliament’s salaries – a point which requires unanimous agreement in the Council for it to be able to give its consent – the provisions regarding the Community tax to be applied to the salaries received by MEPs must not prejudice the entitlement of the Member States to subject these salaries to their national tax system, provided that the salaries are not taxed twice over."
"As regards retirement age, while there was a clear preference in the Council for a retirement age of 65 years, we would, in a constructive spirit of compromise, be prepared to accept a limit of 63 years."
"As regards the difficult question of salary, the Council does not have any objection to determining the figure by taking as reference a particular percentage of the salary of a Judge of the Court of Justice, an approach which would solve the problem of annual adjustment."
"I would draw your attention to the fact that all the positions I have just outlined are the result of lengthy, detailed Council debates that took place a long while before the Parliament approved its Statute on 3 June 2003."
"As regards some recent initiatives put forward in Parliament, the Italian Presidency has witnessed a positive initial response from all the delegations in the Council."
"Should these initiatives secure the support of Parliament, we would be closer than never before to agreement on this longstanding issue."
"As I stressed at the start of my speech, dialogue is the only way to eliminate our differences and the Council is ready for dialogue."
"For its part, the Italian Presidency has always been willing to find a solution and I know that the incoming Irish Presidency fully endorses this approach."
". – Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, please allow me firstly to say that the Commission has received the initiatives of the rapporteur and of the Italian Presidency in relation to the Members’ Statute with great satisfaction."
"I sincerely hope that, after such a drawn-out debate over so many years, we will be faced with the real possibility of reaching an agreement on this issue which has been dragging on for such a long time."
"I would therefore like once again to acknowledge the effort and work over all this time by Mr Rothley, who has worked in the most dedicated and tenacious fashion in favour of this House, and everybody should be grateful to him."
"At the moment, the Commission does not wish to enter into the detailed content of this initiative, since we do not yet have the official proposal."
"However, perhaps I could remind the honourable Members of the position we adopted following the approval of the Statute last June."
"At that time the Commission issued an opinion which contained two general observations: firstly, in relation to the provisions of the Statute which are governed by primary law; secondly, with regard to the financial implications of the Statute."
"In the first case we said that the provisions of the Statute cannot be modified by means of a fundamental act, on the basis of Article 190 of the Treaty, and in the second case, we indicated that the sums in question would represent a significant burden for category 5 of the financial perspectives."
"Logically, all of this referred to a text which was different to the current one."
"We will now have to see exactly the form the text takes in order to be able to give a detailed opinion."
"In any event, Mr President, the Commission will always be constructive and of course we fervently hope that an agreement can be reached between the institutions."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, let me be quite frank and say that many of us feel ill at ease today."
"Why?"
"If we were to take ourselves and our resolutions really seriously, then this oral question could not be put, and there would certainly be no resolution deviating from the Members’ Statute adopted on 3 June this year."
"Another reason why we feel ill at ease is that it seems strange that, four days after the collapse of the Intergovernmental Conference on ‘The future of Europe – a European constitution’, we find ourselves, in a request for urgent debate, calling on the Council to agree on a Members’ Statute, even though it has hitherto not done so or shown any desire to do so."
"The constitution would be more important to us than the Statute, although there is no real connection between the two, but we do this nevertheless, and, all the same, the larger groups are tabling a joint motion for a resolution."
"Why?"
"We do it because a statute for Members of the European Parliament is not about party-political, national, or individual interests or game-playing; on the contrary, the procedure and content should remain a matter of common concern."
"We do it, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, because we deeply regret the dishonesty, the tactical considerations, the individual election strategies and the false conceptions of our roles that are involved."
"The fact is that we are not meant to be engaging in dialogue with one another; it is for you to say ‘yes’ or ‘no’"
"to what we have adopted as a proposal for our Members’ Statute, and because we want to abandon this shared path."
"It is because we want to make it clear that it is the Council, which represents the national governments, and not this House, that must bear responsibility for this unsatisfactory state of affairs."
"That is our final offer; our new message to you is that you must, by 15 January, say ‘yes’ or ‘no’."
"Even though many of us regard the proposal on taxation as contrary to EU law, unjust and essentially wrong, we put forward this motion as a token of goodwill and of our awareness of the problems in the Council."
"Taking discussions at national level on pensions into account, we are raising the pensionable age by three years."
"Although a statute should also govern the functions of a Member of this House, we are dividing it and removing the elements of primary law, but that is where it stops, for we too have our dignity, and those who do not respect themselves will not be respected by others."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my group, I hope that the moment of truth has come for the Members’ Statute."
"I would first of all like to acknowledge the perseverance and tenacity of the rapporteur, Mr Rothley, not as a member of my group but as a representative of Parliament as a whole, and also the perseverance of the President, because we have been working together for a long time and, before he was President, we had taken certain actions which I would like to remind you of in order to explain the points under discussion."
"At the beginning of this legislature, after the adoption during the last one of the Rothley report, we created a working group in order to be able to define the most controversial elements of the Statute and I would like to point out that an ex-Secretary of the Council and an ex-Secretary of the Commission participated actively in that working group, as well as other important personalities, because we wanted to deal objectively with an issue with a constitutional dimension."
"We always talk about the institutions, but people work in the institutions, and we, as representatives of the European citizens, must be equal when it comes to legislating."
"It is not acceptable that we are creating legislation which is applicable equally to all citizens of the Union when we are in such a different, and in some ways such a questionable situation."
"In this regard we must recognise that public opinion and the media are right when they make certain criticisms."
"We must therefore resolve this issue."
"The Constitution has not been approved – it is true – but during this year – and also with the participation of the Council – we have been able to take a step forward with the approval of the Statute on European Political Parties."
"And it is not that we are soldiers of the political parties, but we are part of these formations which since the Treaty of Maastricht – when there were recognised – contribute to expressing the Union’s democratic will."
"Therefore, within this passionate and extremely complex debate, I believe that this is an occasion when – and I hope this is demonstrated in the vote – we have been able to achieve unity in the House – in Parliament – so that we can express ourselves clearly."
"As the President-in-Office of the Council has pointed out, it falls to us to decide on the Statute which you have to approve."
"I believe that the step we have taken responds to a philosophy of shared legislative power, which is what we have advocated for legislation in the European Union."
"In other words, we do not want to do it against your will or in confrontation with the States and that is why Parliament is now stretching out its hand to you in order to be able to resolve this thorny issue."
"On the three issues raised – which I hope will be approved in the resolution – which my group advocates, I believe that the President-in-Office of the Council has been very clear and explicit in relation to primary law, with the reimbursement of expenditure and with taxation."
"He has also talked about the level of remuneration and I also believe that he has made an interesting observation on the problems it can prevent."
"There is a final issue on which nothing has been explicitly said, but I believe that the President-in-Office of the Council has also spoken on behalf of the next Presidency, expressing the Irish Presidency’s desire to continue with a shared will with this process."
"I therefore believe that before 15 January we may have a positive solution for the Statute, which I believe is one of the most important advances we can achieve in terms of dignifying the work of MEPs and the resolution of one of the Union’s most difficult and complex constitutional issues."
"Mr President, I am running short of inspiration about what to say on the subject of the Members' Statute."
"We have said it all before."
"We say every time 'this is the last chance' and surely this must be it."
"Perhaps I should begin where I left off in this Chamber in June when I offered an explanation of vote on behalf of the ELDR Group's abstention and my own national delegation's vote against the then resolution."
"We said we could not give our support then, due to the inclusion of primary law and the lack of the possibility of national tax."
"I could say on behalf of my Group that 'we told you so' as now, by and large, the majority of this House seems to have arrived at the same position – so we make progress."
"But before I sat down last time I also said I hoped that the Council would make a better job of this than we did."
"Well now we are back, offering the Council a clear and acceptable package."
"Sadly, we all know that the Council did not have a very good weekend."
"But here is a chance for it to deliver a success story for Europe before the end of this mandate."
"It may seem a very small success, but its implications for the good name of European democracy are huge."
"Next summer when we face Europe's citizens in elections we could have a Parliament with its own House in order, its Members across Europe treated and respected equally and on a transparent basis, or we could continue with the current disgraceful mix and muddle which leaves us all open to ridicule."
"I have said it before, and I will say it again."
"I believe we all come here to work on behalf of Europe's people, not to spend our time in debates about our own pay and status."
"Council, you have the chance to get us out of this ridiculous situation and thereby enhance the Union in the eyes of its citizens."
"Please, please do not mess up this time."
"– Mr President, our parliamentary group is totally in favour of a Members’ Statute."
"We have always been convinced that we need to establish a Statute that guarantees equal political and financial dignity for the representatives of Europe’s citizens."
"To this end, we have consistently followed and actively supported all the steps that have led to the current proposal now under discussion in the Council."
"I would also like to say, quite clearly, that we are opposed to any delaying tactics."
"The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left calls for this Statute to be approved as soon as possible."
"We feel that the principle of equality between MEPs is a necessary element of justice and transparency for our citizens."
"Obviously, as is the case for all compromise proposals, we are not entirely satisfied with the one under examination, but we will not fail to make a constructive contribution, which will be open to dialogue between all the Parliamentary groups."
"The issue that is still a matter of disagreement is the age of retirement."
"The current proposal is to give MEPs a pension at the age of 63, while the Confederal Group of the European United Left believes that the age should be lowered to 60."
"This proposal does not aim to protect the privileges of MEPs; we are putting forward the proposal because we are convinced that all European citizens should retire at the age of 60, at the very latest."
"My colleagues and I have always opposed reform of pension schemes based on an increase in the contributions period, which I consider to be unfair."
"We are convinced that there are sufficient financial resources to enable all European citizens, including MEPs, who are citizens like everyone else, to retire at the age of 60."
"As regards the principle of the single salary, we are convinced that it represents a principle of democracy and equal treatment."
"Why should an MEP from Estonia be paid far less than a German?"
"At the same time, however, we realise that, in certain Member States of the European Union, this could give rise to untenable situations, where an MEP receives a salary several times greater than that of their President."
"This is why we have to be politically flexible."
"Perhaps we could close the gap between differing remuneration of MEPs by basing it on the monthly salaries of senior State offices in that particular country; but, for us, the principle of the single across-the-board salary is an irrevocable one."
"Finally, as regards the payment of the travelling expenses of MEPs, we would like to remind you that the Bureauof the European Parliament has drawn up a proposal that a majority in my group has asked to see put into practice when the Statute comes into force"
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what our group now endorses with the utmost modesty is what we could have done months ago if we had listened to the smaller groups, but history is history and the future belongs to us all, and so we believe it to be a very good thing that we have ended up in our present situation."
"One thing that this means is that we want to adopt a basic resolution to the effect that the same provisions apply to all Members of this House, since we all do the same work."
"At the same time, though, we will, by adopting this, be taking a decision to put an end to the rules on billing for travelling expenses, which are far from transparent and, in my – our – view, quite simply not right and proper."
"This is something we must always make clear."
"By adopting the single statute, we are also voting to do away with reimbursements of travel costs that are utterly absurd."
"It is important that this should become a matter of public knowledge."
"Secondly, we are also making it clear that we are intelligent enough to make transitional arrangements possible, so that the enlargement countries will indeed have time to join in this joint arrangement, for it would be absurd if someone, on becoming a Member of the European Parliament, were, overnight, to start earning more than the Prime Minister of a country."
"This is about opting in rather than opting out, for the same Statute will apply to us all."
"Precisely when these states’ MEPs join in, will have to be laid down by the Council in the form of intelligent rules – in other words, by an opting-in arrangement."
"When one is in place, then the future of our statutes will be guaranteed."
"A number of Members of this House are somewhat outraged at our having stipulated that our entitlement to a pension will begin at the end of our sixty-third year of age."
"I would have thought that sixty-five would be right, for we should demand of ourselves what we demand, at the present time, of society as a whole, without getting special treatment."
"I am, therefore, firmly opposed to the idea of reducing the figure adopted in this resolution."
"To do so would send the wrong message to the public."
"Let me sum up by saying that all is well that ends well."
"Many thanks to all those who have lent a hand in this."
"Mr President, we shall shortly be celebrating a silver jubilee: this Parliament has now been a directly elected body for 25 years."
"Nevertheless, the legal status of the Members is a patchwork that is falling apart on all sides."
"Pay according to national rules varies to such an extent that it bears no relation to responsibility and workload."
"At the same time, travel expense reimbursement is running into figures that are increasingly out of proportion to the actual expenses, particularly owing to competition in air transport."
"At the Amsterdam Summit in June 1997, a legal basis was incorporated into the Treaty enabling Parliament to draft a statute, which was to be adopted by the Council."
"Now, six-and-a-half years on, that Statute has still not been adopted."
"With the accession of ten new Member States on1 May and the elections next June casting their shadow, it is now make or break time."
"Do we mean to face the electorate once again with an unjustified system of expense reimbursement and an unaccountable difference in Members’ pay?"
"It seems to me that it is time that we moved on to debate political issues of a different order."
"A common statute for the Membersfrom all the Member Statesdoes justice to the ideal of equal pay for equal responsibility."
"At the same time, it is at odds with subsidiarity."
"As far as many members of the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities are concerned, this is reason to retain a nationally determined legal status."
"At the same time, the whole group wants to see a radical reorganisation of the reimbursement of travel expenses."
"Year in, year out, our group submits a budget amendment to the effect that reimbursement be based on the travel expenses actually incurred, and every year a majority in this Parliament rejects that proposal."
"Indisputable as that last point may be, it leads my Dutch fellow Members and me to the conclusion that reimbursement of travel expenses cannot be achieved on its own, but only in combination with a statute."
"For that reason, we think that the Statute should have been in place long ago."
"Until recently, that was prevented by the familiar three stumbling blocks, about each of which I shall say a few words."
"The first is primary law, immunity and suchlike: fortunately, the resolutions finally cut this loose."
"This part inevitably has to go its own way."
"The Council has repeatedly stated its intention to cooperate on this, and we shall hold it to that."
"The second is the retirement age."
"It has emerged that, on average, MEPs retire at 62 in practice."
"In the light of social developments, the age of 63 preferred by the Council is not unreasonable."
"The third is national taxation."
"Years ago, the then Belgian Presidency proposed a compromise enabling us to accommodate subsidiarity on this point."
"One knot that we still have to cut concerns pay."
"The present national figures include extremes of high and low."
"As far as the lowest figures are concerned, I assume that, historically, these were not based on a full-time position."
"In our view, a weighted average of the present 15 figures would represent a sound system of remuneration according to work done."
"The idea of expressing that as a percentage of the remuneration of a judge of the Court of Justice seems to be a good solution, including where index-linking is concerned."
"The Italian Prime Minister yesterday expressed pride that last weekend’s summit took so many decisions with great energy."
"As far as we are concerned, the Statute is the test."
"If this Presidency can report that the Council approves the Statute, it can consider itself a success."
"If not, it is over to the Irish Presidency."
"A good start is half the battle."
"The Irish have demonstrated their capacity for hard work, and therefore I sincerely hope that they will be able to give the green light to the Statute by 15 January."
"Mr President, I should like to state once more, on behalf of my colleagues in the Movement for France delegation in the European Parliament, that we are absolutely opposed to Members of the European Parliament being paid their main salary out of the Community budget."
"Under the Treaty, MEPs are the representatives of their respective nations, and it is therefore by the latter that they must be paid."
"In the same way, the shaky tax compromise at present under discussion is not acceptable."
"A simple, clear principle is required: MEPs must be subject to the same tax as their fellow citizens."
"If, by some misfortune, the statute now being discussed were to lead, as may be feared, to an increased parliamentary salary and to reduced income tax; if, moreover, the idea were created that MEPs were escaping the financial controls of their own countries and were becoming employees of Brussels; then I say to you loud and clear that our fellow citizens would not accept this, and the EU’s credibility would be dealt another terrible blow."
"Governments therefore need now to resist pressure from the federalists who want to detach Members of the European Parliament from their respective countries on the pretext of a principle of equality between MEPs that exists nowhere in the Treaties and that is entirely invented."
"In order to bring Europe closer to its citizens, we must, on the contrary, strengthen the link between MEPs and their nations."
"To summarise, the main parliamentary salary must be paid by the country of origin represented by the MEP."
"Income tax must be levied on a national basis."
"Expenses must be reimbursed on the basis of actual costs."
"Finally, and by way of a compromise, it could be accepted that daily allowances should be considered as a supplementary income paid by the European institutions and subject, therefore, to Community tax."
"That is the very most we can accept."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this has been an unending tale of woe ever since 1998, and I believe that the reason for this is the absence from any of the Council’s statements over past years of any clear indication of its position."
"All the letters to which reference has been made were in legalese and gave no clear indication of what the Council was prepared to accept; even today, we have heard nothing along these lines."
"Having heard the Council’s presentation this morning, I can, quite simply, come to no other conclusion."
"Having said that, the Council’s position, as it has crystallised over the past months, is dishonest and mendacious;"
"I make no bones about saying that, and I do so with reference to one decisive point, namely the way in which the taxation issue has been handled."
"The Council accuses this House of taking the Statute as an opportunity to interfere in issues primary legislation, but the Council itself evidently sees nothing problematic in the way it seeks, in this Statute, to deal with such primary law issues as taxes."
"The question is, therefore: what do you actually want, and how, when you have it, is it meant to work?"
"We know from the information given us by all three legal services – Parliament’s, the Council’s and the Commission’s – that what is actually proposed here is contrary to the law, yet this Parliament is nonetheless prepared to go along with it."
"Here and now, though, I can tell you that, in the event of this resolution being passed and of some Member State or other availing itself of this option, the matter is certain to end up in court – eventually in the European Court of Justice, which will have to hand down a ruling."
"With the draft resolution that has now been put on the table, I believe we have reached the limit; we can do no more."
"Earlier on, Mr Karas was right to say that we too, in this House, have a dignity of our own."
"I believe that the offer has now been made, and what we are now waiting for is a definite statement of the Council’s position by 15 January at the latest."
"This is also about what can be expected of our future colleagues, whose nomination processes are currently underway in the Member States."
"They, too, have to know under what conditions they will be working in future in this Parliament."
"The deadline, then, is 15 January."
"By then, we want to know for sure what the Council wants, and what it does not want, or else this statute will have run out of time in the life of this Parliament."
"– Mr President, Commissioner de Palacio, let me start with a word of thanks to the Commission for the support we have always received from it, and also, many times over, to the Italian Presidency of the Council."
"I found what it had to say clear and precise."
"Let me say that the resolution we have produced, and the Italian Presidency’s statements today, make it possible for us to come to an agreement, but please let us do so quickly, for we cannot allow this issue to overshadow the elections."
"So what is this about?"
"After almost a quarter-century of direct elections to the European Parliament, we still have the structure of a parliamentary assembly, but we have to develop into a real parliament, and that is what this Statute is for."
"Of course, it is only an initial step, which has, of course, to be followed by what has already been laid down in the 1965 Protocol."
"Only then will we have a real statute for MEPs, and so I appeal to the governments to take this issue up and take it forward."
"The second point I want to make is that we all know that the current position, with differing salary-related payments and this wretched system for reimbursing travelling expenses, is unsustainable, but let me remind you of a simple truth: these things can only be sorted out together."
"There will be no Statute unless the way in which travel costs are reimbursed is reformed, but that will not be reformed without a Statute."
"If you want to detach the one from the other, then you will end up proposing a solution that lacks both fairness and solidarity."
"This is where we need clarity and transparency; that is how we treat with respect those who elect us and by whose money we are paid."
"I would like, at this point, to thank all the group chairmen for making it possible to submit a joint resolution, but there are three persons whom I would like to name, without whom we would not have got to where we are, namely the chairman of my group, Mr Barón Crespo, the Chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, Mr Gargani, and, of course, the President of the European Parliament, Mr Cox."
"Following what I hope is the merely temporary collapse of the new constitution, let us, today, send out a very quiet message to the effect that there is perhaps such a thing as progress in Europe after all."
"Mr President, it is a particular pleasure to be called to speak immediately following Mr Rothley, who has done so very much during the whole of this Parliament to bring the matter to the conclusion that we seem now to be at the point of reaching."
"He has paid compliments to other colleagues, so let me pay a very warm compliment to him."
"It has been a great pleasure to work with him on this matter."
"It is something to be welcomed by us all that, provided the Council keeps its eye on the ball, we shall have a proper Members' Statute before the next elections."
"It is absolutely critical to these elections."
"I shall not be a candidate myself, so I speak without a personal interest in the matter."
"Indeed, I will be 63 when I retire, but not on this pension scheme."
"It is essential to have a proper expenses regime and to have a common salary."
"I have been rapporteur several times on privileges and immunities under the existing protocol."
"It must be said that it is an extremely labyrinthine and arcane system and not a satisfactory basis for the privileges and immunities of a House of this kind."
"Therefore, although this matter is not going to be brought home at this stage, I would echo the proposition that we must work hard in the near future to get the whole issue of privileges and immunities put on a proper footing as well."
"– Mr President-in-Office of the Council, as you can see from this Chamber, the feeling is unanimous: after 25 years, it is time for the European Parliament and the Members of this Parliament to have a single Statute or a single set of rules."
"Furthermore, after 25 years, it may well also decide on our place of work."
"Perhaps unlike my colleagues, however, I personally think that it is just fine."
"There is a genuine problem: public opinion is focusing on us and this system is not working."
"Of course, I find the word ‘Statute’ a bit pompous."
"The basic idea was to incorporate into the Statute a genuine charter for MEPs, which would also include the prerogatives of MEPs, a common package that would have given a meaning to the word ‘statute’."
"If we want the extremely important system of financial provisions for MEPs to progress, let us call it by its name."
"We should, however, reserve the word ‘statute’ for a time when, like national parliamentarians, we have common rules for the other issues that had also been incorporated – and which today have to be removed, or we imagine they will have to be removed, for a whole series of reasons – but which remain fundamental."
"Our statute will only be valid when we have provided for prerogatives and functions and for effective equal status with national Members of Parliament, as, for example, in Italy, where MPs can visit prisons whenever they wish."
"This seems to me to be the correct meaning of the ‘Members’ Statute’."
"Mr President, I believe that when substantial problems exist, as in the case of the Statute, we simply need to be patient because, in the end reason will prevail, awareness will emerge and everyone will act responsibly for a moment."
"Personally, I have to say that, in the course of my long political career, this is one of the few times when I really must express my satisfaction in plain, non-rhetorical terms."
"I cannot refrain from doing so and I must thank you, Mr President; with this interinstitutional agreement and this Statute, you have, discreetly and without fuss, made a significant contribution to the cause of Parliament."
"I believe that, if this unanimity we see really does bring results, this will be remembered as an important day."
"Under your guidance, Mr Rothley and I have stubbornly – I would even say pig-headedly – insisted on discussing this issue and putting forward arguments that have prevailed in the end."
"I believe that the Italian Presidency must take the credit, even though the Constitution has not seen the light of day – if Mr Antonione will allow me to say so, for this point which really is the most relevant."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we could have achieved a result even before 9 December, but this was not fully understood when I convened the committee, on 9/10 December, to force the Council to face up to its responsibilities."
"We still have time, though, and I believe that, if we are to attribute a fundamental significance to the date of 15 January, we must act now."
"Personally, I see no problem, if you agree Mr President with convening the committee now for 12 January, in that it would be, Mr Antonione, a clear, transparent and specific act by Parliament."
"This is the first time I have been in the European Parliament in this legislative period, but I have studied this issue throughout the long process."
"The first part gives autonomy, guarantees, visibility, transparency and unanimity to the rules governing the Members of the European Parliament and to Parliament as a whole."
"This deals with the amending of primary law."
"The second part is the necessary organisational section, where we have achieved a balance by way of a compromise that I think does credit to Parliament."
"It is true that small sacrifices have been made, but the issue now looks fairly clear and acceptable."
"If, as Mr Rothley has said, the words of the Italian Presidency are now clear, if the Presidency has spoken on behalf of all Member States and all the governments, I think that, on 15 January, after the prior meeting of the committee on 12 January, this major problem can genuinely be resolved and Parliament will have taken a great leap forwards."
"Mr President, since I have sat with Willy Rothley for the last ten years, I have been a privileged witness of his determination to make progress on this issue."
"I would like to congratulate him and recognise his efforts, since he really deserves it."
"Furthermore, I would like to stress that both the President-in-Office of the Council and the Vice-President of the Commission and my colleague, Mr Lehne, have pointed out that respect for primary law includes a very important principle, that of the unity of Community fiscal legislation."
"In our proposal there is a modification of the exceptional fiscal status, taken up in the so-called ‘Belgian compromise’, which only makes sense in so far as it is a delegation, a kind of opting out with regard to general law, but which cannot be interpreted as a general power before the States to establish taxation on the sums paid by the Community institutions."
"With this exception, the proposal that the various political groups are now presenting in the European Parliament could effectively represent a step forward in the establishment of unitary status with regard to the European Union."
"I do not believe that now is the time to invoke the subsidiarity principle, but quite the opposite: we are building a European Union which must be based on common institutions with a common operation, and this is what explains the proposal for European parliamentary statute and a statute for European political parties."
"It is not a question of granting privileges of any type, but of establishing a situation of equality amongst all the Members of the European Parliament."
"I hope that we can approve the text without any of the amendments presented."
"Mr President, the history of the package of terms and conditions of Members of this House is not a very glorious one and it does no particular credit to all those who have been involved with it, who seem somehow to be hexed by the subject matter."
"I do not want to go over old ground."
"The current version of the Members' Statute is not perfect – far from it."
"But in the real world it is probably as good as one can hope to get."
"From our point of view we British Conservatives have four cardinal principles: firstly salary should be comparable to our national MPs' salaries; secondly we should pay the same tax as our constituents; thirdly the expenses regime should be cleaned up; and finally there should be a clean break with the past."
"The proposed salary is not the same as a UK MPs' salary, but the overall package is not dissimilar when all aspects are taken in the round."
"We shall pay tax on the same basis as our constituents."
"The expenses regime is going to be cleaned up and, while there is not an entirely clean break with the past, the anomalies are such that I do not assess them to be very great and they will of course waste away over time."
"As a result, we shall vote for it."
"I would like to conclude by saying to all those who are likely to be the important players in the end game: do not faff about."
"Let us get the whole matter done and dusted in double quick time!"
"Mr President, today we have a chance to remove the barriers which have held back meaningful discussion on the whole question of the Statute of Members."
"If we can make progress on the Statute, then we can tackle the thorny question of our own expenses."
"Because of the covert way in which we MEPs are paid expenses, we have left ourselves wide open to criticism."
"The Statute and the reform of the expenses are inextricably linked; they go hand in hand, as Mr Rothley clearly pointed out."
"Therefore, while we are asking the Council to make progress on the Statute, I am asking Parliament to make progress on reform of the expenses scheme because, if we bring in a system that is clear, unambiguous and fair as regards our expenses, then we can face the electorate with confidence again next June."
"Mr President, first of all, it should be said that the contents of the compromise that appears to have taken shape lately cannot be said to be acceptable, just as various aspects of the original proposal were unacceptable."
"We can certainly support the principle behind it: to give every MEP the same dignity and, above all, a constant reminder of a single point of reference for the exercise of their mandate, with the same common rights and responsibilities."
"Many aspects of the proposed law run counter to this principle: the first concerns the time when this law would come into force."
"In my opinion, rivers of words and of ink have already been spoken and written on the enlargement of the European Union, to support and comment positively on the many facets of the procedure; I do not intend, therefore, to add my positive thoughts on the matter."
"Nevertheless, it has not been uncommon, especially recently, for the Community institutions to adopt legislative provisions and with many expressions of regret acknowledging the need to involve the future Member States only in the conciliation phase."
"Since that is the case, it is difficult to understand why it is a matter of such urgency to adopt the aforementioned Statute, since this would be done without the contribution of MEPs from the future Member States."
"I mean that we are being deliberately ‘forgetful’."
"Furthermore, if the principle is one of equality, indeed material equality, it is difficult to understand why MEPs, from whatever State they may be, when carrying out their mandate, which is at least equal to, if not higher than, that of a national MP, may have fewer prerogatives than the latter."
"In emphasising this point, I am, of course, referring to the national systems that provide the highest guarantees, because I find a system of rights that, in practice, tends to dumb down the guarantees provided for, is unacceptable."
"There is, however, more and it concerns points that are, if you like, less noble, but that also call the concept of dignity into question."
"Certainly, nobody would object to a single source being responsible for the payment of salaries, but there is no doubt that one of the major problems here is the size of the salaries, that is, the reference to the amount that should, in the future, be paid as against current remuneration, whether this be higher or lower."
"In terms of ethics within their own country, I cannot see how one could justify a European Parliament Member suddenly receiving a higher, and in some cases much higher, salary, even from a source other than the current one."
"Similarly I cannot imagine how other Members could contemplate receiving a lower salary than the one they receive today, especially in consideration of the higher salaries received by national MPs, if not, indeed, by regional advisors, in the same State."
"If, for a moment, however, we examine the principle of equality and see it as a positive factor, the concern expressed about taxation would mean falling back again into the trap of extreme disparities."
"Then the compromise on the age of retirement does not seem to be worthy either."
"The overwhelming majority of the Member States currently set retirement in public organisations at the age of 65 or over."
"Thus, either we have the courage to ignore the fact that, because the pension scheme for MEPs is practically self-financed, it falls outside the pension costs of each Member State and, for the sake of pure political consistency, we opt for a retirement age limit of 65; or we show similar courage in admitting that the fund is, in substance, of a private nature and that the only valid rules are those dictated by actuarial statistical calculation."
"I think that, in the event that the two other institutions fail to address this, the first to place themselves in a position of subordination will not be Parliament so much as its own Members."
"Mr President, I would like to make three observations in relation to what we have heard here this morning."
"The first observation relates to the difficulty raised by certain Members regarding the difference, in their scandalous judgment, between the pay of an MEP and that of certain political posts in candidate countries."
"Mr President, I believe that this difficulty makes no sense, because, within the fifteen current Member States there are also differences in income, and we are not for that reason going to establish different pay for each of them."
"And within each Member State there are regions with different levels of income and, as far as I know, national Members of Parliament are not paid differently according to the region they come from."
"Therefore, Mr President, it is entirely logical that there should be a single statute and pay should be the same for all the Member States, and observations of this type seem to me to be offensive to the candidate countries."
"The second observation relates to the idea that MEPs should be paid from the budgets of their respective States."
"Mr President, this is absurd as well, because if our function is European, our pay should come from the European budget, or are Members of Parliament in the national states paid by their constituency within the State?"
"They are paid by the State as a whole."
"The third observation, Mr President, relates to the idea we have heard about the homogeneity which must exist between the pay of the European Member of Parliament and the national Member of Parliament."
"This is also absurd, Mr President, or is it the case that in the Member States a councillor of a small town is paid the same as a councillor of the large city, or a councillor the same as a senator?"
"Each post receives a salary in accordance with its level and its scope."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, all the factors for resolving this problem are on the table; the ball is in your court."
"Resolve them once and for all, because this problem has gone on too long."
"Mr President, many things have already been said and, in the minute at my disposal, I will not even be able to cover the most important aspects."
"I believe that there is no doubt as to the need to adopt a statute, even from the point of view of the role and legitimacy of this Parliament."
"Furthermore, everyone in my group, in particular Mr Rothley and Mr Barón Crespo and the Italian delegation, have always declared themselves in favour of the Statute and have always supported the need for it, voting for it with conviction last June."
"I believe, however, that we should not delude ourselves, Mr President."
"What we are, in fact, discussing today – and, if it is necessary, let us do so – is not the Statute, but the adjustments of salaries."
"I think that it is rather humiliating for Parliament, but that is all we are discussing."
"Let us call a spade a spade."
"If it is the only thing we can do – and this is the Council’s responsibility – let us do it; but we must not call it a statute, because this is not a statute."
"I should like to thank the Council and the Commission for the helpful statements they have made today, and all the speakers in the debate – in particular Mr Rothley and Mr Gargani for their exceptional contributions behind the scenes, over such a long period of time and, in particular, during the Italian Presidency."
"I should like to stress to the Council that if we have the wisdom later today to produce a clear majority on this, then we need to deal with it as a matter of the utmost urgency."
"If that should happen, we look forward to working with you on that urgent matter."
"The debate is closed.(1)"
"The vote will be at noon."
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the role of the Union in conflict prevention in Africa, particularly in the implementation of the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement in Côte d'Ivoire."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make a number of points on the issue of conflict prevention, management and resolution in Africa, a matter which has been at the heart of the Italian Presidency’s work regarding the African continent throughout these six months."
"The most urgent task would, in actual fact, appear to be stabilising the continent, in other words preventing or eliminating armed conflict, where it is present."
"Indeed, everyone agrees that only by creating conditions of peace and security across the board can we promote development."
"Without these conditions, the eradication of poverty, the promotion of human rights, high-quality employment and environmental protection are empty dreams or short-lived achievements."
"There is to be no bartering of development for peacekeeping operations – we simply need to adopt an integrated approach."
"The United Nations Secretary General, Kofi Annan, made this quite clear when he said at the African Union Summit in Maputo that a comprehensive approach is needed which focuses in turn on peace and security, human rights and democracy, reconstruction and development."
"The first people to become aware of this were the African Governments themselves, which, already in the programme document for the New Partnership for Africa’s Development, stated that war and underdevelopment are two aspects of the same problem and fuel each other."
"On the basis of this hypothesis, they have set up the necessary bodies to prevent, manage and resolve their crises, in particular the Peace and Security Council and the joint committee of the largest African States."
"The new political element which must be stressed is this new determination on the part of the Africans to shoulder their responsibilities in the field of peace and security too on the basis of the principle of ownership."
"This is an attitude which the European Union has consistently encouraged and supported with measures seeking to strengthen African capacity, at both pan-African level and subregional level, through ECOWAS, IGAD and SADC."
"In the face of this changing political situation, the Italian Presidency has worked actively to encourage a European response that would be able to meet the challenge."
"To this end, we promoted, first and foremost, a theoretical reflection on conflict prevention, management and resolution in Africa, through a research seminar organised in Rome on 28 July."
"We reinvigorated the EU-Africa dialogue, which had come to a halt after the postponement of the Lisbon Summit, through two troika meetings, the second of which was held on 10 November in Rome."
"This reinvigoration focused principally on the issues of peace and security, on which substantial convergence with the Africans was recorded."
"Lastly, we implemented ongoing measures to support the peace processes underway in Côte d’Ivoire, Liberia, Sudan, Somalia, Ethiopia/Eritrea, North Uganda, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi, and so on."
"We sustained constant diplomatic activity, which took the form, not least, of a series of numerous EU Ministerial Troika missions to Africa."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the results – the short-term results, at least – are largely positive."
"The real-time management of the Liberian crisis, both at political and diplomatic level and at financial level, contributed decisively to bringing the conflict to an end, to the conclusion of a peace agreement and to the establishment of the current transitional government."
"In the same region, now that the recovery of Sierra Leone has been consolidated, it is Côte d’Ivoire which is facing the greatest trial."
"Côte d’Ivoire is the real driving force of the region’s economy and it is in this country that the most important battle is being fought out."
"The progress made thus far is appreciable."
"The creation of a national reconciliation government, the adoption of an amnesty law, the agreement of 4 July 2003 between the national armed forces and the rebels, are significant stages in a process which needs to be completed by the quartering and disarmament of the troops and the extension of the State’s administration to the whole territory until the presidential elections scheduled for 2005."
"The European Union has done and is continuing to do everything in its power to ensure that a way out of the present is found, that reunification becomes irreversible and that the implementation of the Linas-Marcoussis Agreements is completed."
"The declarations of 22 September and 9 December, the mid-October visit of a European Ministerial Troika and the work of the European Union representative in the Monitoring Committee are evidence of this."
"Thanks to the rapid intervention of the French armed forces and the ECOWAS troops, it was possible to avoid open conflict."
"However, the need remains for a more substantial United Nations peacekeeping force, within which African troops can continue to operate."
"This is the request made by ECOWAS at New York, and this request must be supported by the European Union."
"These references to specific conflict situations make one appreciate the determination displayed by the Africans to manage their conflicts, on the one hand, and, on the other, the huge amount of work which needs to be done in order to strengthen operating capacities, particularly those for which subregional organisations are responsible."
"In this sense, the EU-Africa partnership can only evolve into tripartite cooperation between the European Union, the United Nations and Africa, in which each component complements the others."
"The Artemis operation – the first European-led military operation to take place outside the training ground – showed the effectiveness of a rapid intervention with trained, well-organised forces, which can stop a crisis situation of conflict and then allow a larger United Nations force with an appropriate mandate to address larger stabilisation tasks."
"The forces of the subregional African organisations too can play this role of rapid intervention to resolve a crisis with a view to being replaced by the slower, better-organised United Nations machine."
"This could be the case in Burundi, where the first wholly African peacekeeping force is currently operating, which could be replaced by the United Nations within a year from now."
"Thus far, we have mentioned specific measures carried out by the European Union under pressure of crises and humanitarian emergencies."
"The most remarkable innovation is, however, the creation of a Peace Facility – allocated EUR 250 million and financed by the EDF – decided by the Council of the European Union on 18 November 2003."
"In this way, the European Union is giving itself a dependable rapid-intervention instrument which ties in with the strategic partnership relationship linking the European Union to Africa and with the principle of African ownership."
"The peace facility will make it possible, with all the guarantees provided by decision-making procedures, to fund a specified range of activities which are part of peacekeeping operations carried out by African forces."
"The request for this submitted by the Maputo African Union Summit thus met with a response from the European Union which made good the commitments and promises so often reiterated."
"For at least a decade, along with the United Nations, we have been urging Africa to take control of its future and, with the support of the international community, to break the vicious circle of conflict and poverty."
"Now that the African leaders themselves have taken up the cry, as is shown by the new philosophy which underpins the creation of the African Union and Nepad, implementing the promises with appropriate decisions becomes a matter of political credibility."
"If wisely implemented, the Peace Facility could prove to be one of the most important instruments for the future of relations between Europe and Africa."
"In conclusion, I would like to stress that, in the field of conflict prevention, management and resolution in Africa, substantial developments in planning and operation have been mapped out."
"We are trying to establish these developments through the revision of the base document, on which the overall action of the European Union in the sector has been based thus far: I refer to the European Union Common Position concerning conflict prevention, management and resolution in Africa of 14 May 2001."
"The operation we have launched, which is underway, calls on us to integrate the current common position, updating it, first and foremost, with a reference to combating terrorism and organised crime, which are fuelled by situations of conflict; therefore, with a firm reference to the role of civil society and, within civil society, the role of women; then, with particular focus on the economic dimension of the conflicts themselves and, in this regard, on the unlawful exploitation of natural assets; lastly, with a reference to the very serious situation of what are known as ‘failed States’, or territories with no control or public institutions which can exercise the necessary authority and provide basic services."
"This is an ongoing operation, which we entrust to the future Irish Presidency and which will firmly establish the European Union’s overall approach to the major issue of conflict prevention, management and resolution in Africa."
"Mr President, unfortunately the crisis in Ivory Coast means that today we have once again to deal with this country – which was not very long ago a good example of political stability – its economic progress and the living conditions of its inhabitants."
"Six political groups in this House are sponsoring a resolution, which we will certainly approve this very morning, in which we essentially call for the strict application of the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement as the surest way of re-establishing the Rule of Law and the peaceful coexistence of all the parties in conflict."
"I entirely agree with the Commissioner, Mr Nielson, who has just stated that all efforts will be doomed to failure if the conflicting parties do not show clear signs of goodwill to achieve those agreements and live in peace together."
"I must say that this lack of vocation or capacity for agreement amongst them seems to me to be the most serious obstacle we are facing in terms of achieving peace in Ivory Coast."
"A few months ago this Parliament visited the country and spoke with representatives of the whole of civil society, the authorities and the opposition."
"What we saw was not in every case a good example of a will to resolve the crisis."
"It is well known that the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement was not accepted with satisfaction by significant sectors of Ivory Coast society."
"When Mr Gbagbo returned to Abiyan, he was received with huge protests against the agreements which he himself had accepted – then he told us that he had not signed them, using a kind of double language which seemed to me to be unacceptable."
"Within the government itself, some of the ministers representing what we could describe as the ‘rebel sector’ gave a clear demonstration of what it means to be a rebel."
"Their words were not at all friendly towards the other part of the government, to which Mr Gbagbo belonged."
"Mr Gbagbo himself, who was very friendly and very pleasant and who, during a meal which we were invited to in the presidential palace itself, explained to us his view of the problem, he said things in the presence of many of us who were there – no less than 10 or 15 people – which I believe do not point in the right direction, such as, for example, that he had to strengthen his army and that he had plans to buy certain military materials in the countries of the East."
"We believe that this is the completely wrong direction."
"There are other examples, such as the ethnic issue, which, as we say in the resolution, is not at the root of the conflict and is probably not its only cause."
"But I must say that this issue of ethnicity and Ivory Coast citizenship was brought up in all our conversations – several dozen of them – during which every one of our interlocutors spoke about the problems caused by the thousands, hundreds of thousands of people originating above all from Burkina Faso who create problems and who are victims – themselves, in many cases – of violence."
"I therefore believe that we must continue to make every effort to ensure compliance with the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement, establishing greater coordination between all the parties with the DAC, the United Nations and the European Union."
"Having seen what we have seen, and in view of what I have summarised briefly, I cannot be very optimistic about the immediate future of that country which is so in need of peace."
"Mr President, since that mission to the Côte d'Ivoire by ACP and European Parliament parliamentarians in May 2003 it has become increasingly clear that the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement is a rather imperfect instrument."
"There remains, as others have said, an extremely worrying reluctance on all sides to work together, to co-exist, to cooperate and to work for reconciliation."
"That was absolutely clear when we were there and it remains the case."
"There has to be an end to impunity and, as the Commissioner said, a much clearer determination is essential to achieve demilitarisation, demobilisation and then rehabilitation in that country."
"Mr Prodi visited Côte d'Ivoire in November and he made serious pledges on these issues."
"This Parliament would like to see those pledges turned into real and immediate financial assistance as quickly as possible."
"ECHO still needs more support in order to do its essential work of implementing the accords."
"This is the key to bringing peace, as is the need to put in place humanitarian assistance, protection for civilians and so on."
"In the context of African Union and our ACP obligations, Commissioner Nielson suggested an extremely welcome and innovative way in which we can support Africa's own efforts to manage conflict."
"My understanding is – and I would like clarification on this because it was not clear from what the Council said – that certain Member States want to use the peace facility, which is well worked out, to fund directly sub-regional organisations, apparently without consulting the African Union, or even seeking the endorsement of the African Union."
"For me this is an incredible proposal and one I would like to hear explained this morning."
"Would the Council agree that the European Union must give sustainable long-term support to the continental peace efforts that have been made and give assistance to the architecture which has been put in place to build security on the continent by the African Union?"
"Does the Council believe that the Member States would agree to support the declared wish of all African Heads of State that finance be managed under the African Union's authority and in no other way?"
"I would appreciate some clarification as to where we are at the moment on the extremely important proposal for which Commissioner Nielson was responsible."
"Mr President, for a long time the future of Côte d’Ivoire looked bright."
"It was one of the countries in Africa held up as an example of stability and economic growth."
"Little by little, Côte d’Ivoire fell into a cycle of violence, chiefly since the introduction of , or Ivorian identity, a concept that is in fact comparable with apartheid."
"It is absolutely clear that the ruling political class, the President included, is capable of anything in order to reinforce its power, and, and in so doing, does not even balk at taking the path of ethnic cleansing."
"The parallels with the events of ten years ago on the eve of the genocide in Rwanda are alarmingly great."
"There is of course no immediate alternative to the Marcoussis Agreements, but Mrs Kinnock is right in saying that these may well have to be evaluated and the necessary adjustments made."
"At any event, the main problem is their enforceability."
"The international community must no longer stop at lip service."
"Commissioner, the European Union must consider all possible initiatives and instruments, including deferring aid to Côte d’Ivoireuntil the government is prepared to implement the Linas-Marcoussis Agreements consistently and in their entirety."
"Remaining silent and looking on passively today could very well be interpreted as passive complicity tomorrow."
"Please let us avoid a repeat of Rwanda."
"Mr President, the situation in Côte d'Ivoire continues to deteriorate."
"We have condemned the concept of ‘ivoirity’, which has tainted the electoral legitimacy of Laurent Gbagbo, but we have also condemned the military rebellion, which is unacceptable in a democracy."
"We were sceptical about the signing of the Marcoussis peace agreement, which showed every sign of having been dictated by the former colonial power."
"As might have been expected, it was not viable and led to the resignation, in September, of the rebel ministers in the government of national reconciliation."
"Although progress has been made in recent months, new confrontations over the last fortnight have weakened the chances of relaunching the peace process."
"Now, the violence in the north, as well as in the cocoa belt, and the abuses by the so-called patriotic forces are leading to ever-increasing human rights violations."
"We request that these cease without delay and that the government and the rebel forces stop exploiting demonstrations which, in reality, are not at all spontaneous."
"We demand that investigation procedures be put in place to punish those responsible for the abuses."
"We condemn just as vigorously the assassination of the French journalist Jean Hélène, and we ask that an international inquiry be set up in order to bring those responsible to justice."
"We call for genuine negotiations to be resumed with a view to bringing the conflict to an end."
"It is only by taking account of all the political forces in the country and of the balance between these forces that it will be possible to find a peaceful and democratic solution, leading to the relaunch of a peace process that must include the disarmament of the militias, together with free legislative and presidential general elections under international supervision."
"If this is to be achieved, the European Union’s policy of prevention must tackle the structural causes, that is to say poverty, the unequal distribution of wealth, social injustice, the oppression of minorities and the disorganisation of the state."
"Alongside this, the EU must adopt a coherent trade and development policy in order to guarantee aid to the African economies and, in particular, to the African population."
"In this context, we call upon the Commission not to extend the fisheries agreement with Côte d'Ivoire for as long as implementation of development cooperation within the framework of the Cotonou agreements remains suspended."
"To conclude, we would signal our commitment to respect for minorities, which is an indispensable basis for the peaceful settlement of these conflicts in Africa."
"– Mr President, there can be no doubt that the role of the Union, together with the United Nations and the African Union, is very important in conflict prevention and peace-making on the continent of Africa, which continues to be torn apart by quarrel and armed conflict."
"The situation in Côte d'Ivoire is a typical example of tension based on social and ethnic differences."
"The murder of the French journalist Jean Hélène, the correspondent for Radio France Internationale, reveals the depth of the crisis and disdain for the Marcoussis agreement."
"This agreement, together with the Cotonou agreement, offers a very good framework for crisis settlement and respect for human rights and the rules of democracy."
"Nonetheless, generally when we talk of democracy and peaceful coexistence in an area in which violence is a daily reality, we need to take account of two serious factors."
"First, traditional and local approaches to conflict settlement."
"Viable solutions depend to a large degree on the ability of local society to build up a relationship of trust and cooperation between opposing groups."
"Experience has shown that solutions based on local values and mediation techniques have far more potential to bring about lasting peace."
"That is why we also need to incorporate local perceptions and practices into international mechanisms."
"Secondly, serious account needs to be taken of the role of women in conflict settlement and the reconciliation process and I am grateful to Mr Antonione for mentioning this."
"This issue has repeatedly preoccupied the European Parliament's Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities and we have processed relative positions on the role of women in peace processes."
"Analyses have also been carried out by the UN and, within the framework of the Greek Presidency, there was a related report and conclusions by the European Council in Thessaloniki."
"The Council and the European Commission therefore need to take account of this factor and to reinforce the initiatives of women in peace processes through the budget; EUR 250 million would be a respectable sum."
"Finally, Mr President, I should like to mention that on 10 December, which was International Human Rights Day, the Manο River Women’s Peace Network was awarded the UN prize for human rights for 2003."
"This is an organisation, consisting of women from the three countries of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, which played a crucial role in preventing hostilities between the three countries by forcing the political leaders to return to the negotiating table, thus earning the praise of the Secretary-General of the UN in April 2002."
"I mention this in order to stress the importance of the role of women, which is often disregarded."
"Mr President, during the night of 11 to 12 December, murderous new confrontations hit Côte d'Ivoire."
"These confrontations, between Côte d'Ivoire soldiers and unidentified armed men, are again giving rise to fears that the peace process in Côte d'Ivoire will be blocked."
"These events are suddenly taking place at a time when the ex-rebellion forces had decided to announce their imminent return to the institutions of the government of national reconciliation."
"Unfortunately, we observe how the proliferation of militias is a very dangerous consequence of the conflict."
"Many witnesses’ accounts, collected by the Human Rights Watch organisation, report multiple abuses committed with total impunity by pro-government militias."
"At a time when the country was preparing to take a decisive step towards peace, this new eruption of violence – and this in an extremely troubled context – is again preoccupying the defenders of the Linas-Marcoussis agreements."
"These agreements, let us remember, were aimed at bringing the hostilities to an end, ensuring a return to peace and stability and preserving the territorial and ethnic integrity of Côte d'Ivoire."
"In the light of the Linas-Marcoussis agreements, the current priority is the need to pursue the process of disarmament and of rehabilitating the forces present in Côte d'Ivoire."
"That is why the Côte d'Ivoire Government and, above all, President Gbagbo, must ensure that people’s rights and freedoms are protected and bring the hostilities to an end without delay. Otherwise, we could be led to request the suspension of aid to Côte d'Ivoire, aid that, as we are well aware, is indispensable to the people of Côte d'Ivoire."
"Indeed, we fear, Commissioner, that EU aid is unfortunately used in large part for purchasing arms."
"Let us therefore be prudent, rather than naive or complicit in a further genocide."
". – Mr President, let me start by reacting to the last contribution."
"There is always the problem and risk of indirect consequences of supporting a government in a difficult situation like this."
"But we are very cautiously doing the right thing by not turning our backs on the country, but instead finding areas where we can do something meaningful, also bearing in mind that there is a legitimate government in the country."
"We have used the Cotonou system to organise dialogue and to establish benchmarks along the way leading back to normalisation, and we are linking and conditioning our support to the Marcoussis Agreement and the process there."
"I have already addressed the specific aspect of fisheries."
"Let me say a few words on the peace facility in response to Mrs Kinnock and Mrs Karamanou."
"I very much welcomed the conclusions of the European Council last week relating to the peace facility."
"It was clearly stated in these conclusions that the Council recognises the importance of this peace facility and it also makes the point quite clearly that the financing of these peace operations will create a noteworthy and important impulse in strengthening the capacity of the African people to create and preserve peace on the whole continent."
"So there was no reference whatsoever to any ways of doing this other than what is implicitly referred to here as an all-African effort."
"It is the case that we foresee, and the African Union and the Commission also expect that regional organisations should be used as implementing agents for handling individual cases."
"However, it is clear from the whole architecture of the proposal that decision-making is supposed to be the responsibility of the African Union."
"This is also the prevailing view in the discussions that are taking place inside the EU."
"This is very important, because stability and African ownership of this process is the key to success."
"We look forward to the next steps in the chain of implementation, to take place shortly."
"I should like to say to Mrs Karamanou that the peace facility would not cover the cost of supporting women's organisations or other activities like that."
"It is very important that this facility should only cover those actions relating directly to peacekeeping or peace-building activities which cannot be funded by other sources."
"That is what is new in this and why we are moving into a new area of activity and a new method of funding and decision-making."
"All this is new for good reasons, and we have to be very careful not to overlap with what can in fact be funded through other sources, otherwise the opportunity would be wasted."
"My final remarks on the situation in Côte d'Ivoire and what we are trying to do: we are not in a situation where we have cut off or frozen spending."
"We have not suspended the Cotonou working relationship, but we have to adapt to the situation."
"We are gradually trying to move forward and link it to a process of reconciliation."
"In fact, the country strategy paper and the national indicative programme, totalling EUR 298 million, were discussed by the EDF Committee on 20 November and we will try ensure that the implementation of this is linked to the implementation of the Marcoussis Agreement."
"We will include interventions such as promoting security of land tenure, and good governance will also be an important element, along with support for the 2005 presidential and parliamentary elections."
"This is a very sad case, but we have to be stubbornly optimistic."
"To conclude the debate, I have received six motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure(1)."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12 noon."
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the removal of the EU embargo on arms sales to China."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the embargo on the export of weapons to the People's Republic of China was adopted by the European Union in 1989 following the events in Tiananmen Square."
"The embargo permitted only exports not associated with repressive activities or with activities violating Human Rights, to be examined on a case-by-case basis."
"China believes that the embargo is now out of date and that the level of cooperation in all sectors between China and Europe, as well as the rapid changes underway in the People's Republic of China, are such as to justify it being lifted."
"This fact is being more and more frequently and vehemently stressed on every possible occasion, both multilateral and bilateral, by our Chinese interlocutors, who have recently pinpointed the lifting of the embargo as a short- or medium-term priority in China’s relations with the European Union."
"From the point of view of the implications, were the embargo against China to be lifted, the European Code of Conduct would, in any case remain applicable, the result being that, in reality, weapons exportation would not vary substantially."
"The matter of the possible lifting of the embargo has, in recent months, been discussed in the European Union but consensus has not been reached on whether this revision is appropriate."
"The European Union acknowledges that, between 1989 and today, the political situation in China has evolved significantly and that important changes have taken place in the European Union's relations with China, including the quality of political dialogue."
"Indeed, with the establishment of the EU-China Dialogue on Human Rights, an important vehicle has been created in which both sides can exchange opinions and develop projects aimed at fostering tangible improvements."
"Furthermore, and the Chinese are placing particular emphasis on this, the Chinese Government underwent a complete change at the Party Congress held last year and today's leaders declare that they had nothing to do with the events of Tiananmen Square."
"Nevertheless, from the standpoint of the European Union, whose public opinion still vividly recalls the events in Tiananmen Square, the issue is considered highly sensitive since serious problems relating to respect for human rights persist in China."
"Indeed, economic liberalisation and the country's gradual integration into the international community are not being accompanied by similar political liberalisation and China still has a long way to go before reaching the human rights standards considered normal in our societies."
"The Union's policy on the matter is under intense scrutiny and non-governmental organisations and public opinion expect tangible results."
"Moreover, it should also be pointed out that Beijing has rejected the idea of making the lifting of the embargo dependent on tangible progress in human rights."
"In any case, the necessary conditions for lifting the embargo are not yet in place in the European Union: this was clearly explained to our Chinese counterpart during the recent European Union-China Summit."
"It is, moreover, clear that there are differing positions within the European Union on the subject and, in particular, on the stance to be taken in the face of repeated requests from the Chinese."
"The matter will therefore have to be further discussed in depth in the future."
"Decisive impetus has been supplied in this regard by the European Council of 12 December 2003, which called on the General Affairs and External Relations Council to review the question."
". – Mr President, I fully share the presidency's views."
"I would add some additional remarks even though it is obviously not an issue on which the Commission takes a lead, given the way in which the CFSP is operating."
"Nevertheless, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao of China recently said during his meeting in Harvard in the US that China's reform and opening-up aims at promoting human rights."
"The two are mutually dependent and reinforcing."
"This is encouraging language showing that they present human rights in a context which is linked to their general orientation of where they want to go and they do it on their own initiative."
"But we should not jump to conclusions and the reality on the ground is the real yardstick in measuring progress, also in an area like this."
"We have seen some real change but also there is still good reason for keeping up a systematically organised dialogue with China on human rights."
"We have been systematically doing this through the years."
"The issue here of course is that a number of Member States are favourably disposed towards considering a lifting of the arms embargo and have also made that position public."
"These Member States believe that there is no longer a technical need for the embargo as arms sales to China are already covered by the EU’s 1998 Code of Conduct, or that the issue should be considered in the overall context of our relations."
"Other Member States believe that lifting the embargo is premature."
"They underscore the need for further progress in human rights."
"Last week’s European Council referred the issue to the first General Affairs and External Relations Council under the Irish presidency."
"The Commission fully supports an in-depth political discussion of this matter."
"Developing a clear EU line on this question at the highest level is important."
"Factually speaking, lifting the embargo would have few practical implications for European arms exports to China, since the 1998 EU Code of Conduct prohibits arms exports to countries which have not forgone using arms for internal repression or aggressively against another country."
"It is in fact the Code of Conduct which applies in this issue."
"That said, and given the high political and symbolic value of the whole matter, any consideration of this should include an updated political assessment of how far things have moved on the human rights front since 1989."
"We are naturally interested in Parliament's views on that question so the Commission welcomes the discussion here today."
"– Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats firmly rejects the latest attempts by the German Chancellor, Gerhard Schröder, to lift the arms embargo on the People’s Republic of China."
"I am glad that the Council representative made it clear that the Council currently maintains the line that the arms embargo must be retained."
"You described the situation, Commissioner, but I urge you to be cautious."
"The 1989 European Council was right to impose the arms embargo after the peace demonstrations in Tiananmen Square were put down in such a bloody fashion."
"Commissioner, we too believe that there have been improvements in the human rights situation in China since then, but they have not been sufficient."
"Only recently, on 13 October, the Council reconsidered the situation in China and, just as Parliament had done in the same month, noted that the current human rights situation in China, as regards fundamental civil, cultural and political freedoms did not meet even the international standards recognised by China."
"That being so, although we want progress in China, we should wait before it is achieved, and so it would send completely the wrong message if the embargo were to be lifted at the present time."
"On the contrary, we should be telling our Chinese friends that they need to make perceptible progress where human rights in China are concerned."
"There is a second reason why we should do this."
"You will be aware that presidential elections are to be held in Taiwan on 20 March next year, and the People’s Republic of China has, over recent weeks, been adopting a positively hostile stance towards Taiwan."
"As long ago as 23 October, this House stated its view that China should withdraw the rockets it had stationed in the coastal provinces opposite Taiwan and should commence peaceful dialogue across the Strait of Taiwan, which amounts to a flash point."
"That is the second reason why lifting the arms embargo makes no sense whatever."
"I therefore hope that we will not now send the wrong message, even if only by editing what we say, in the belief that we can lift the arms embargo because everything is laid down in the code of conduct."
"On the contrary, I believe that the tensions and the human rights situation, which is still unsatisfactory, mean that we have to maintain it."
"Mr President, my group opposes lifting the arms embargo, and thus we support the general line of not lifting the arms embargo on China now."
"I should like to add a couple of things, however."
"Everyone who has had the opportunity to visit China on several occasions over the past ten years – as I myself have done – will know that a tremendous economic dynamic is discernible there, with substantial regional differences, and with what could almost be described as rigid capitalism at internal level, which gives rise to numerous major social problems."
"A society developing in this way also needs a political system capable of handling this."
"There is clearly an enormous tension between that economic freedom on the one hand, which leaves insufficient room for shaping at the social level by the social players such as the trade unions and others; and the political level on the other, which leaves no room for political democracy."
"We are, of course, all watching that whole process with bated breath."
"China is no small player."
"It is large and powerful both in economic terms and in terms of population size."
"When trying to look at that region from a geopolitical point of view, therefore, do not just look at it in relation to Taiwan."
"Naturally, that is one point, but much broader factors affect that region."
"China naturally wants to become a global player, little by little."
"It is trying to launch a charm offensive: after all, it knows fine well that a great many people are intimidated by its enormous economic power, and it is trying, as it were, to be a positive player at global level."
"In order to do so, it must effectively make more room for democracy and respect for human rights in its own country."
"It is not yet managing to control that tension very well, and some do not even want to control it or are themselves engaging in something that we do not think possible, which is having freedom on the one hand and a lack of political freedom on the other."
"Nevertheless, we, Europe, have an enormous amount to gain from helping China take on this new role."
"Therefore, all fellow Members are rightly saying ‘no lifting of the arms embargo’: that gives out the wrong signal."
"At the same time, however, ladies and gentlemen, let us put it in a wider perspective and make clear that we genuinely desire that in-depth dialogue with China – that goes for the Council, too – and that we also want to help with that process."
"It is fundamental that China assume a role in the world and that that role is compatible with the international legal order."
"Mr President, there are countries in the world that do not take human rights very seriously, including China, the last great Communist dictatorship on the planet."
"The lack of respect for human rights is, for me, the main reason why we should not here and now remove the European embargo on the sale of weapons to China."
"Last weekend, the Council agreed that consideration should be given to whether the embargo should be removed."
"We do not believe the time is ripe."
"It is of course true that there has been progress in China since the massacre in Tianamen Square in 1989, and it is also a fact that the political dialogue between the EU and China has improved, but there is still cause for considerable concern about the Chinese lack of understanding of human rights and of the state governed by law."
"We know that there are violations of fundamental freedoms, that torture and arbitrary imprisonments take place, that the Chinese authorities do not respect minorities and that many executions occur – more than in any other country in the world."
"We also know that China has deployed rockets pointing over the straits towards democratic Taiwan and that there is now increased tension across the Straits of Taiwan."
"Are we to close our eyes to the fact that a dictatorship – China – is threatening one of the foremost democracies in the Far East, namely Taiwan?"
"When it comes to human rights and democracy, Taiwan is exemplary, while China gives every cause for alarm."
"Are we now to be involved in helping the Chinese to rearm?"
"That, we believe, would be a really bad idea."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, from time to time, and only for a moment, Heads of State simply delude themselves, and I believe that one of their delusions is that they can simply say that they want the arms embargo on China removed."
"The arms embargo is an instrument of political pressure, and what that means is that any response to the question as to what has changed in China must be political in nature."
"China still has Tibet under military occupation; it is still threatening Taiwan; it is still failing to respect human rights."
"There is no prospect of democracy there."
"You can do business with China – so go on doing it!"
"Selling nuclear power stations to China makes no sense and is dangerous, but that is another issue, one that we will have to discuss with the German Federal Chancellor."
"What I am getting at is that it would not only be wrong to express a desire to lift the arms embargo, but that it is also wrong to say at all that there is at present any question of doing so."
"To do so would mean that we would simply be telling the Chinese, ‘You are making a wonderful job of things."
"Carry on arresting people for speaking their minds; it doesn’t bother us a bit."
"We are prepared to do any kind of business with you!’"
"There is, secondly, another point, namely President Chirac and Chancellor Schröder – two Heads of Government whom I do support in certain political situations, such as over the war in Iraq."
"The terrible thought occurs to me: has a similar strategy been used to buy partnership with China?"
"It is inconceivable that we should think it possible to buy Putin by saying nothing about Chechnya, and the Chinese by supplying them with weapons, just in order to have a common position on the Security Council."
"That would be terrible."
"Let me say, in conclusion, that President Chirac and Chancellor Schröder have said that they want the constitution, that they want to be Europeans, that they want simply to strengthen the European Parliament."
"But of course!"
"Only if Parliament agrees to it can the Council lift the arms embargo, and this is meant to be done by means of a jointly agreed code of conduct."
"What this means is that the removal of the arms embargo is neither possible nor permissible without Parliament’s consent, and I rejoice that, at present, none of the political groups want that done."
"Terrific!"
"Mr President-in-Office, it would, indeed, be lovely and important to succeed in informing the millions of people who have taken to the streets of Europe to support Chancellor Schroeder and even Jacques Chirac as symbols of the Europe of peace, that precisely Chancellor Schroeder, one of these great symbols of European peace, is proposing today to lift the embargo on arms sales to China."
"Those millions of people are not aware of this, and neither, I expect, are those who elected the Schroeder government."
"It is a proposal which, indeed, should not even be on our agenda at all; I am glad to say that the decision does not have to be taken today, but it appears to be almost implied that it will have to be taken tomorrow or the day after."
"Technical details and form aside, a decision such as this could only be taken by a Europe which has abandoned the promotion of democracy and the rule of law as points of reference in its international policy – and, therefore, in its security and defence policy – once and for all."
"The promotion of democracy and the rule of law are not points of reference for this Europe, they are not points of reference, most importantly, for the Europe which sets itself up as the Europe of peace, the Europe of Chancellor Schroeder, the Europe of Jacques Chirac; it is the Europe of shame over China, Russia and Chechnya – this is the Europe that can debate this matter."
"Mr President, it is essential that the EU engages constructively with China as the most populated country on earth and – in terms of certain purchasing parity measures – as an economy that is due to overtake my country, the United Kingdom, and perhaps even Germany in the next two decades."
"China is a vast country with a trained and productive workforce, but it is not a democracy and remains essentially an authoritarian, one-party, Communist State – although Marxism plays little part in its political or economic thinking at present."
"However, I welcome China's cooperation in the fight against international terrorism and its rapprochement with India, whose territory it still occupies, having traditionally been an ally of Pakistan, whose atom bomb it helped to build."
"China is also helping to put pressure on North Korea against that country's quest to build its own nuclear weapons."
"Nevertheless, I am critical of China's inhumane treatment of North Korean refugees, who are sent back to face torture or even execution."
"Red China, however, remains a serious threat to Taiwan, which has been a model of democracy, prosperity and good governance."
"There is an irrational fear on the part of China of Taiwan wishing to pursue a course of self-determination and independence, perhaps because the model of pluralism and democracy is what is most unwelcome to the Communist Party bosses."
"However, given China's attitude towards Taiwan, Tibet and its own dissenters – ranging from the peaceful practitioners of Falun Gong to the pro-democracy activists who were imprisoned so brutally after Tiananmen Square – I support maintaining the EU arms embargo."
"After all, the Taiwan Straits remain one of the world's most dangerous flashpoints and the USA is obliged to intervene to protect Taiwan militarily in the event of hostilities."
"Therefore, we do not want to do anything to further escalate the tensions in this region."
"– Mr President, a debate on the removal of the arms embargo on China has a natural tendency to produce crudely-drawn arguments and discussions, and, as I believe that certain Members are over-simplifying matters, I will try to introduce a few nuances into the debate."
"Right at the very start, I would like to say that I regard the removal of the arms embargo as neither advisable nor wise."
"There is no doubt in my mind that I am opposed to it."
"China, though, must be considered in a rather more subtle light than it has been from the standpoints we have adopted so far, and in this I am, for once, closer to Mr Tannock than to other Members who have spoken today."
"China is a large and – let us be frank about this – capitalist economic system with a single-party state clamped over it."
"It is trying to enable its people to have a share in the world’s growing prosperity, and the greatest danger lies in whether China will manage to maintain the political structure of a common state and to meet people’s social needs."
"The fact is that China’s biggest problem has to do not with arms but with increasing hunger and poverty in sections of its population."
"It certainly also has the major problem that it has in one country different cultures, languages and ethnic groups, and it has not so far succeeded – I might add that it is not alone in this – in giving these diverse cultures and ethnic groups the space that will alone make it possible to maintain the country’s political unity."
"So, although China does not need our weapons, it does need our sympathy and support in what is a difficult process of development."
"I would not wish major responsibility in a problematic large state like China on anyone in this House."
"That is, I think, another reason why the resolution rather misses the mark by considering the Taiwan issue in what are admittedly the right terms – of China becoming a threat – but to the exclusion of all others."
"In one respect alone I am closer to President Bush than to Mr Cohn-Bendit, and that is in the belief that he is right to warn Taiwan, too, against taking ill-advised action."
"I am not talking about whether or not such actions might be justified, morally or otherwise."
"At times when crises are brewing, there are courses of action that may perhaps be justified from an objective and abstract point of view, but can nonetheless play a part in making hostilities or a crisis situation more likely."
"It is not for this House to warn only one side against taking unilateral and perilous courses of action; rather, it should also urge the other side to be sensible and hold back, to endeavour to leave the way open to peaceful agreement."
"That, I believe, is the one important message that is, lamentably, absent from this resolution."
"Hence my conclusion that the answer to the removal of the arms embargo is ‘no’."
"China needs all the help and support we can give, but not where armaments are concerned."
"We should be urging both parties in this hotspot, China and Taiwan, to be cautious in the action they take, and reminding them that we live in times in which peaceful, rather than warlike solutions must be found."
"– Mr President, the EU must be a peace organisation and not an arms dealer."
"The EU should therefore not sell weapons at all, especially not to countries that are in danger of using them in wars."
"Given that logic, we should not, in the first place, sell weapons to the United States, but not to China either."
"My ‘no’ to arms exports to China is not only directed against China, but is the expression of a general principle."
"Everything that has been said in this House about China is true, but there are also positive things."
"For example, a dialogue has been opened with representatives of the Dalai Lama, about which the Dalai Lama himself is very hopeful."
"Such a small step is obviously not enough to change the general picture."
"It would therefore be quite wrong to remove the arms embargo against China, but do not forget that there are also other countries to which we should not sell weapons."
"– Mr President, let me start by saying that my criticisms, coming as they do from a member of the German opposition, cannot be more trenchant than those uttered in this House ten minutes ago by a Member belonging to the same party as the German foreign minister, who stated that, on this issue at least, the German Federal Chancellor was suffering from delusions."
"We are dealing here, unfortunately, with another Franco-German initiative, but not one that is intended to restore these two countries to their position as the engine of Europe in a positive sense; instead, where this issue – like others in the recent past – is concerned, it leads other Member States to suspect something that is more and more a Franco-German conspiracy rather than a Franco-German partnership."
"The manner in which Germany and France collaborate on this issue or on the Stability Pact is not, in fact, one that I regard as desirable, and it is unfortunate that, in recent times, we increasingly see these two countries acting in what is a very egotistical fashion, even though they are actually meant to be taking seriously their responsibilities to Europe as a whole."
"It has already been said – and this is where I agree with Mr Swoboda – that we have to take a very nuanced view of China."
"I was back there again only recently, and when, on the one hand, you see the economic developments, which are very dynamic, and, on the other, the willingness – behind the closed doors of conferences at any rate, but also more openly – to discuss every issue with great frankness, then it becomes apparent that people in China are thinking."
"The situation there is not set in stone; instead, particularly in the political sphere, the leadership is already endeavouring to give some thought to how, on the one hand, to maintain the country’s stability – and that is a legitimate objective – and also, on the other, to how the dynamism that is present in the economic sphere can also find a political expression, for it is in politics that little progress has as yet been made."
"Nor is the time yet ripe for anything to be removed, as what caused the arms embargo to be imposed has not yet gone away."
"We have not forgotten Tiananmen Square, nor has there been any change in the political framework conditions that led to it."
"It has also been said, on the other hand, that Taiwan is under threat – a country that is actually, from the point of view of the One China policy, itself Chinese territory."
"How can one threaten one’s own territory with rockets like these?"
"That is something to which China ought perhaps to give some thought."
"In any case, it is not Taiwan that represents a threat to China; rather, the reverse is the case."
"Both these considerations – human rights and the threat to Taiwan – should cause the Council to pause for a moment before even considering removing the arms embargo."
"To do so would send completely the wrong message."
"– Mr President, if they are not to be in breach of the principles of our European community of values, those who seek to remove the arms embargo on China must first have clear evidence of a change in the human rights situation."
"Chancellor Schröder wanted to curry favour with the Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao."
"In the hope of improving the climate for exports, he rashly added his voice to those calling for an end to the embargo, thereby pressing amateurishly ahead without consulting with other states."
"On this I am in absolute agreement with Mr Cohn-Bendit."
"He is not so much Confucius as confused!"
"Back in 1989, the embargo was a response to the savagery with which the democracy movement was put down; today, it is among the most important instruments bringing political pressure to bear in favour of change in the People’s Republic of China."
"Those who think in merely economic terms are blind in one eye."
"I can tell Mr Swoboda that Amnesty International is talking in terms of 1 500 executions carried out every year, with hundreds of thousands of people in jail, maltreated, tortured, and waiting in vain for a fair trial."
"Conditions for the Tibetans, Mongols and other minorities remain intolerable and our keeping quiet about them will do nothing to improve matters."
"Since 1999, I have been chairman of the European Parliament’s Tibet Intergroup."
"All those who have addressed us, and all those of our guests who know China well, leave us in no doubt that, where human rights are concerned, there has been hardly any progress."
"I am also thinking of Taiwan."
"For weeks, Peking has been threatening a military attack in the event of Taiwan deciding to hold a referendum on formal independence."
"I welcome the initiative taken by the Commission in scrutinising the planned sale of a German nuclear power station to China."
"The export of usable goods is subject to the European Union’s approval;"
"I am glad to see Mr Cohn-Bendit agreeing with me on this."
"Two things are necessary: one is that the Member States should maintain their restrictions on arms sales, and the other is that we should get to grips with the actual facts about the People’s Republic of China – at national level, at Community level and, it is to be hoped, eventually in early 2004, at the international level at the Human Rights Convention in Geneva."
"Mr President, I have not heard such unanimity across the Chamber on an issue in quite some time."
"It seems that it is the French and German Governments that are the main supporters of lifting the arms embargo on China, as well as the controls on exports of dual-use nuclear technology."
"Given their track record over the past year, there are grounds for suspicion of any foreign policy initiatives that originate from these governments."
"I find it very worrying that in certain areas France and Germany seem to prefer the idea of a strategic partnership with countries such as China, rather than the United States."
"I am thinking of proposals relating to the Galileo project which have military implications."
"Why is it that the European Council has decided at this time that there is any reason to re-examine the EU's arms embargo against China?"
"What particular positive developments in China have prompted this action?"
"Of course we all want to see improved relations with China, but not at the expense of our own security."
"China still has a long way to go in introducing democracy and respect for human rights and convincing us that it wishes to be a peaceable partner in the international community."
"It is premature to consider any wholesale lifting of the arms embargo."
"To conclude the debate, I have received five motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure(1)."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Mr President, on a point of order before the voting starts, I had occasion to speak on this very point last time."
"The Vice-President at the time, Mr David Martin, undertook to inquire and refer the matter to you, but since you are now in the chair I shall ask you directly."
"It is becoming increasingly the case that although a time is set for the vote, it is delayed day after day."
"It seems unreasonable and incompetent to expect people to be here on time and then not to operate."
"Although today it is only seven minutes over, we had no previous business to delay us!"
"Even if we have previous business, surely voting, which is so important in this House, should always take place punctually, with absolutely no leeway whatsoever."
"Everything else should be subjugated to it."
"I would ask you to look at this matter urgently."
"I hope that you appreciate that I too was here on time, ready to start."
"The next item is the vote."
"(1)"
"Colleagues, I should like, on your behalf, to thank the rapporteur, Mr Rothley, and Mr Gargani, the Chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, in helping us reach this moment."
"The House has voted wisely and well."
"It is now our duty to honour what we vote on – that and only that."
"Together with the Council we shall take this issue forward."
". Mr President, on 18 November this Parliament rejected by a very large majority the Commission's proposal on excise duties on petrol and diesel."
"Pursuant to Rule 68(3) of the Rules of Procedure, and after the Commission's refusal to withdraw its proposal, I am reporting back to you to say that on 2 December the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs considered the matter again and reconfirmed its previous decision to reject the proposal."
"Representing the rapporteur, Mrs Kauppi, who is unable to be here today, I reiterate our belief that this harmonisation effort is not justified either from an environmental or from a competition point of view."
"We call upon the Commission to submit a new proposal and withdraw the current one in order to have a text more in sympathy with the recently adopted energy tax directive."
"An approach that eschews absolute harmonisation, for example with a rate band with an upper and lower limit, would be a more realistic option both in terms of chances of progress in the Council, and also in terms of allowing a degree of tax competition between Member States."
"There is also a need to coordinate taxation of fuels with infrastructure charges in order to guarantee a level playing field."
"For all these reasons, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs calls upon the plenary of the European Parliament to reconfirm its rejection of the Commission's proposal on excise duties on petrol and diesel."
"The Chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs thus proposes that Parliament adopt the legislative resolution to reject the proposal for a directive."
". Mr President, in recent days, I have made one last attempt to achieve compromises, and I have offered a package deal to this end."
"Unfortunately, that was not successful, despite every effort on the part of the shadow rapporteurs, and for this I should like to thank them nevertheless."
"At all events, we can say that, whatever happens, today is a real ‘E-day’, an ‘environment day’, because now, for the first time in the history of the European Union, we are adopting legislation that gives us a legal basis for making polluters pay for the damage they cause."
"I think that that is one point we have scored."
". – In my capacity as rapporteur, I would like to make a brief statement for the benefit of Members."
"Today, we are voting on the compromise package on medicinal products legislation, a compromise influenced by a lot of different ideas from this House."
"I therefore ask Members to support Blocks 1, 2 and 3, but not under any circumstances Block 4 or parts thereof."
"If even only one amendment from Block 4 is adopted, we will have to go to conciliation, and it will not be possible to adopt the Common Position today; hence my appeal to you."
"The package we have put together with the Council is a good one, so please support the compromise."
"Mr President, thank you for having given me the floor now because, in actual fact, the three reports on which we are to vote constitute a package."
"With my fellow MEP, Mrs Müller, we have managed to obtain very sound compromises, thanks to which we are making very significant progress where pharmaceutical legislation is concerned."
"I should like to join Mrs Müller in saying that it is vital for us to vote in favour of the compromises as presented and not to vote in favour of the amendments that were not the subjects of these compromises."
"Any vote in favour of an amendment that is not a part of these compromises would bring into question the compromises at which we have arrived in conjunction with the Italian Presidency."
"I should really like to make it clear to our fellow MEPs that they should vote in favour of the compromises and not in favour of the other amendments that do not form a part of these."
". – Mr President, I would like to reiterate that the Commission fully supports the compromise package presented by the two rapporteurs, Mrs Müller and Mrs Grossetête, and accepted by the Groups."
"But following the debate last night, at the request of honourable Members, I would like to reiterate and clarify the Commission position on the amendments concerning homeopathic medicines."
"The Commission agrees with the compromise package in this field too."
"This means that we cannot accept amendments which introduce either non-defined technical concepts which aim at extending the registration procedure beyond requirements defining this simplified procedure, or which are contrary to the harmonisation sought."
"Regarding Compromise Amendment No 20, which the Commission accepts, I would like to point out the following. Originally the amendment tabled asked Member States to take due account of registrations delivered by others."
"It became evident that the common position had already foreseen in Article 39 the fact that the Community regulation procedure has to be applied to these kinds of products, so the common position has already gone beyond the objective."
"Compromise Amendment No 20 clarifies the legal situation establishing that the Community regulation procedure will apply to registered homeopathic medicines and that it should be accepted."
"This compromise package would essentially improve the common position accepted by the Council."
"That is the reason the Commission supports the proposals by Mrs Müller and Mrs Grossetête."
". Mr President, I should like to report to the House that, following the debate last night and discussions with the presidency, in the spirit of compromise reflecting our work on this portfolio, I am mandated by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy to withdraw Amendments Nos 3 and 11."
"On that basis, I understand that the Commission is in full support of all the amendments and the presidency has indicated its support."
"Therefore, I urge colleagues to vote for the rest."
"Block No 1 will effectively subsume three other amendments."
"(2)"
"(3)"
"That concludes the vote."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, yet again we have been giving our attention to the Members’ Statute, at a time when Europe has been unable to resolve the issue of the constitution, at a time when, only a few weeks ago, the European Union’s Stability Pact proved a failure, at a time when, facing economic problems in the European Union, we are trying to banish unemployment from Europe."
"At a time like this, Parliament has once again deemed it proper to devote attention to itself."
"The Members’ Statute was back on this House’s agenda, and – quite apart from the question of whether we need rules that apply from Finland to Sicily – I think it a poor show for us to again attempt to resolve the issue before the Central and Eastern European States have joined the European Union, and before new Members of this House have been able to share in reaching a decision."
"That is what I criticise, and for that reason I have voted ‘no’ to the statute question in its present form."
"Mr President, I supported the Members' Statute because we need urgent reform of our travel expenses system in time for the new Parliament next July."
"Now that we have this resolution, we can open negotiations with the Council on the Members' Statute."
"I hope that when we look at the salary level we will look again at the report of independent experts, which gave an excellent way forward for looking at the salary issue."
"Mr President, my Group asked me to give an explanation on its behalf."
"Simply and briefly it is a point which concerns paragraph 2(b)."
"As I said in the debate in the morning, we are very strongly in favour of reform of the Protocol concerning Privileges and Immunities."
"The existing rules relating to privileges and immunities are unsatisfactory."
"However, as we said in the debate leading up to the decision on 3 and 4 June, the text that was approved then is unduly extensive in the privileges and immunities it prescribes."
"So we voted against paragraph 2(b), not because we oppose reform but because it is too generous a model for reform."
"– The reasons why I voted against the Statute are as follows."
"Let me say straightaway that I think it important and right that our travel costs should be the real ones, but everyone here in this House knows that that has nothing, nothing whatever, to do with the Statute."
"We could change the link between travelling expenses and real costs tomorrow; it has nothing, nothing whatever, to do with the Statute."
"I do welcome, though, the prospect of our soon having rules on this."
"As regards the Statute, I concede that what was decided on in the summer has been improved on, particularly as regards the pensionable age."
"I still, however, cannot agree to it, as it highlights a social imbalance at a time when, right across Europe, really deep cuts are being made in social security budgets, and it is just not on for us, in this House, to again insist on a sort of Christmas present, so that German MEPs, for example, get 20% increases."
"I regard that as unacceptable."
"Nor do I think it right that we should base our calculations on the income of a judge, who, let me remind you, is permitted no other employment."
"I would have thought it more proper if we had taken the average income of all MEPs as a basis, which I would have thought would be the more appropriate approach, and I still do not think it right that MEPs should be allowed to have other sources of income while judges are not."
"I still do not think it right that we do not wait for the general standard of living to improve before doing something about that of MEPs."
"Underlying my rejection of the Statute is my belief that increases of this kind result in a social imbalance;"
"I would be getting much more in terms of salary-related payments than my counterparts in the , and that too I regard as an injustice."
"I see this as Parliament giving itself a Christmas present rather than bringing itself into line with what is being talked about by the public."
"Perhaps I may be permitted a final point, which is that I hope that further improvements will be possible in order yet to change the imbalance that has resulted from the Statute, especially its social dimension."
"I do not know what has gone wrong in the Verts/ALE Group, but the Rules of Procedure state very clearly that you are supposed to give notice of explanations of vote."
"However, Mrs McKenna, I will take your explanation of vote."
"Mr President, there are big problems with the Members' Statute."
"In the end I decided to support it, but I have major problems because the expenses issue is not separated from the salaries issue."
"A lot of people in my own country will be very put out that technically a lot of Members voted to increase their salaries by a huge amount."
"This will not go down well in the individual Member States."
".– The European Parliament's retraction on the proposals for the Members' Statute blew out the possibility of a solution to the problem during the Italian Presidency."
"Today's resolution endeavours to restore once again the possibility of resolving the problem, which is why I voted in favour of it."
"The European Parliament is exposed to public opinion; it cannot act as public prosecutor to the other Community institutions when its own house is not in order."
"With the system of travel expenses in particular, every effort must be made to improve this before the European elections."
"We would emphasise the importance of our finally getting closer to obtaining a Members’ Statute that would mean the end of the system of covert compensation that has so far existed in Parliament."
"We welcome a system through which actual travel expenses are reimbursed."
"A system involving one salary – even if this is higher than many MEPs’ present salaries – is better because it is an open system which can be scrutinised and assessed by the electorate."
"Despite this basic approach, we now wish to make it clear that we consider the salary level recommended by Parliament’s report from June 2003 to be too high and that we shall continue to press our government to argue in the Council for a more sensible salary level."
"For the reasons of principle mentioned in my speech in the course of the debate, I voted against our Assembly’s resolution which calls once again for a unified Members’ Statute."
"I should like to add that, the more progress that is made in negotiating this Statute, the greater the number of difficulties that appear, the greater the number of complexities that are invented to resolve these difficulties and the more the system proposed becomes untenable."
"In particular, it is hard to imagine how, in the name of a principle – which does not exist – of equality between MEPs, profound and very real inequalities could be created in each country."
"How, for example, could the MEP of a new Member State be paid a salary twenty times that of a member of his or her national parliament?"
"How, moreover, is such an inequality to be corrected?"
"Similar questions arise in connection with taxation: what is the rationale behind a rather well-paid Member of the European Parliament paying income tax at a rate far below that applied to his or her fellow citizens?"
"As I emphasised in the debate, the dogmatic obstinacy of certain federalist MEPs is in the process of creating a mess that will be very harmful, once again, to the image of the European Union."
"The June Movement has today chosen to vote neither in favour of, nor against, joint motion for a resolution no. RC-B5-0543/2003 on the Members’ Statute."
"The June Movement abstained from voting because Amendment No 1, which would have meant fully regulating the way in which travel expenses are reimbursed and have entailed far greater transparency, was voted down."
"The present system, involving non-transparent and tax-free reimbursement of travel expenses, together with reimbursement of general expenses, is unacceptable."
"The present draft Members’ Statute does not, however, solve the problems satisfactorily."
"It is not acceptable"
"- for Danish MEPs’ remuneration to be increased by more than 50%;"
"- for there still to be issued, alongside the reimbursement of actual travel expenses, a tax-free payment based on distance travelled and time spent on the journey;"
"- and for the reimbursement of general expenses (at present approximately DKK 26 000 per month) still to be paid out tax-free without having to be accounted for."
"Because of the very different national schemes for MEPs and the majority’s unwillingness to draw a line under tax-free schemes, it would be most appropriate to leave it to each individual Member State or to the relevant parties/movements in each individual Member State to draw up proper rules for their Members of the European Parliament."
". Although the compromise that the European Parliament is proposing to the Council introduces some amendments to its proposal of 3 and 4 June (on tax issues and on privileges and immunities, for example), it retains aspects with which we disagree, such as fixing a monthly parliamentary salary that is the same for all Members, regardless of the country they represent."
"Whether or not to establish a statute for Members of the European Parliament is not the issue. The issue is its content."
"As we have stated, the Members of this House are elected to represent national constituencies."
"Consequently, they are, and must continue to be, bound to these constituencies."
"This means that the salary of a Member of the EP must be based on the salary paid to the Members of the national parliaments of the country in which they were elected."
"By the same token, we cannot ignore the existence of very different social realities in the countries of the EU."
"Providing a parliamentary salary that is the same for all EP Members will create situations of profound inequality and disparity in various countries, such as Portugal, between the salaries earned by workers and those earned by political representatives and holders of public office."
"This would be totally incomprehensible."
"Hence our vote against the report."
"We have today voted neither in favour of, nor against, joint motion for a resolution no. RC-B5-0543/2003 on the Members’ Statute."
"The present system, involving non-transparent and tax-free reimbursement of travel expenses, together with reimbursement of general expenses, is unacceptable."
"The present draft Members’ Statute does not, however, solve the problems satisfactorily."
"It is not acceptable"
"- for Danish and Swedish MEPs’ remuneration to be increased by more than 50%;"
"- for there still to be issued, alongside the reimbursement of actual travel expenses, a tax-free payment based on distance travelled and time spent on the journey;"
"- and for the reimbursement of general expenses (at present approximately DKK 26 000 per month) still to be paid out tax-free without having to be accounted for."
"Because of the very different national schemes for MEPs and the majority’s unwillingness to draw a line under tax-free schemes, it would be most appropriate to leave it to each individual Member State or to the relevant parties/movements in each individual Member State to draw up proper rules for their Members of the European Parliament."
". It was almost twenty-five years ago now that the Members of the European Parliament were, for the first time, directly elected by the people."
"That was a milestone."
"To this day, though, there is no Act on Members’ Legal Status to regulate on one single basis the rights and duties of MEPs, and that is a disgrace, but not, admittedly, one of which this House should be ashamed."
"If anyone should be ashamed, it is the Council."
"I was first elected to this Parliament in 1994."
"Since then, I have had, time and again, the experience of seeing how the Council, when it came to the issue of a Members’ Statute, allowed us to run round in circles."
"The second attempt at one that I have experienced was this summer, and when we had at last adopted a Statute full of concessions and willingness to compromise, I thought that we were out of the woods."
"All that was needed was the Council’s approval, but the Council adopts its customary stance of nose in the air and absolute immobility."
"Shame on them!"
"I have voted against the resolution, because I cannot see why we should now throw away the Statute we have adopted and present the Council not with a law on the legal position of MEPs, but with mere pay scales, of which we cannot be other than ashamed and for which the public will laugh us to scorn."
". I am convinced that the Members’ Statute, demanded so vehemently by this House, is yet another indication of the failure of the Italian Presidency of the Council."
"The chosen solution to the issue of the taxation of MEPs’ salaries is botched and temporary, but, above all, there are no rules on the legal status of MEPs."
"Under no circumstances can I vote in its favour while the issue of immunity remains unresolved, nor can I accept the curtailment of rights that guarantee the exercise of an independent mandate, such as are accorded to our counterparts in the national and regional parliaments."
"I therefore no longer have any confidence in the Council’s will, at the present time, to bring about a single statute for MEPs, and, for that reason, I vote against the resolution RC B5-543-/2003."
". I voted against the resolution, believing as I do that this is the worst conceivable time for us to resume a debate on the Members' Statute."
"At present, the European Union has essential and fundamental tasks to deal with."
"In the immediate aftermath of a failed summit, and facing all the problems of European integration, we in this House must limit ourselves to what is essential and necessary."
"The importance of a common statute means that a solution must be sought together with the Council and without pressure of time."
"It is incredibly important quickly to bring about open, clear and unambiguous common rules."
"We have therefore chosen to vote in favour of the resolution, but not for those proposals that demand a reduced pensionable age."
"We also believe that salaries should be more in line with those of members of the Swedish Parliament and that salaries should be taxed on a national basis."
". – The introduction of astatute for the Membersof the European Parliament has been advocated for years now as a miracle cure for self-enrichment of MEPs."
"Instead of enabling Members to increase their income substantially by means of excessive benefits that are not recorded by the national tax administrations, it would make a clear-cut distinction between income and the expenses actually incurred."
"At the same time, it would bring to an end the equality of pay between MEPs and the members of national parliaments in their country."
"I actually agree with that equality of pay, although it does lead to extreme differences in income among MEPs in practice and is therefore seen as encouraging fraud."
"The lowest-paid make up for their deficiency, and the highest-paid willingly cash in too."
"Consequently, I have always supported the endeavours to bring about such a statute."
"However, earlier votes revealed that no majority support for this could be obtained without tax cuts and enormous salary increases for MEPs from a large number of Member States, including my own country, the Netherlands."
"The current proposal is based on the resolution of 3 June 2003, which I voted against for that reason."
"It does make some concessions to the Council’s objections, especially on national taxation, but these do not improve the proposal sufficiently to enable a ‘yes’ vote at present."
".The EPLP has voted today for the removal of barriers preventing a Members' Statute."
"It has also voted today for negotiations to commence on the appropriate level of remuneration for MEPs with Council."
"The basis for this should be the study carried out by the Wise Persons Group."
"Another aspect which we support is national taxation."
"All along we have supported the concept that MEPs should be treated no differently in the area of taxation from other residents in their Member States."
"Importantly we are also finishing today the reform of the whole issue of expenses."
"For too long the expenses issue has dogged the Parliament, and we now have the opportunity to put this to rest."
". – I voted in favour of the proposal because if we want a change to the present system this is it, or there will not be one."
"I voted for this proposal on the assumption that the travel expenses system will be reformed in such a way that travel expenses will be paid on the basis of actual costs incurred."
"Today, the European Parliament agreed upon a resolution that may bring to an end this year’s debate concerning MEPs’ salary, pension and travel conditions."
"With this agreement, the European Parliament has gone so far towards accommodating the Council that there is now finally the prospect of a Members’ Statute."
"I am very pleased about this outcome which means, for example, that MEPs will be obliged to account for their travel expenses."
"Parliament’s compliance is based on an agreement that all Members of the European Parliament should receive the same wages."
"The amount is a weighted average of the remuneration received by MEPs in the four largest countries."
"It corresponds to EUR 8 600, from which MEPs themselves will have to contribute to their pensions."
"In addition, it will be possible for the Member States to opt for their MEPs’ paying tax to the Member State. Finally, the pensionable age for Members of the European Parliament is to be raised from 60 to 63 years."
"This is a sensible compromise for which everyone has had to go right to the pain barrier."
"I think that the salary has been set too high, but this was the price of our having been able to bring about a compromise at all."
". We supported rejecting the Commission proposal which, in the name of combating distortions of competition in the internal market and in environmental protection and, on the basis of the ‘polluter-pays’ principle, seeks to achieve the gradual upwards harmonisation of excise duties on fuel for commercial purposes, and to separate the systems of duties on such fuel from those on fuel for private purposes."
"This proposal for a directive, which had already been rejected by the European Parliament, forms part of the strategy put forward in the White Paper ‘European Transport Policy for 2010: time to decide’, whose stated intention is to seek to redistribute the tax burden between ‘users’ and ‘taxpayers’ and to pass on the ‘real’ costs of transport to ‘users’."
"The Commission proposed ‘introducing a graduated tax on transport infrastructure use and making the tax system more consistent’ and creating within ten years, a European-level tax system that includes registration and road taxes, an ‘intelligent’ system for levying duties on infrastructures and harmonizing fuel taxation."
"It also set minimum rates of special duty on unleaded fuel and a central rate for fuel for commercial purposes."
"Given our disagreement, however, with the majority of these proposals, we supported the positions put forward to reject the Commission proposal, which is what has happened once again."
"Legislating on environmental liability is like opening a Pandora’s box, so badly is environmental damage defined and so imprecise is the scope of the legislation, particularly on the issue of biodiversity, which is already governed by two major international conventions, those of Berne and of Bonn."
"Compensation should be limited solely to the Natura 2000 areas and exclude non-profit-making activities, such as leisure pastimes, from professional activities."
"The directive does not, however, draw a distinction between these two types of activity."
"If liability is to be applied, it must be based upon objective and quantifiable criteria: the nature of the damage and its impact, the state of the environment at the time of the damage and, above all, local circumstances."
"The permit to pollute and the notion of the ‘state of scientific and technical knowledge’ must be maintained if the ‘polluter pays’ principle is to be effectively applied and not replaced by the ‘taxpayer pays’ principle."
"Liability must also exist in relation to GMOs and hydrocarbons, sensitive subjects that are excluded from the area of competence."
"More generally, what is the point of recognising the European Commission’s competence in this area when penalising environmental crime depends upon judicial cooperation and when other legal instruments such as the Council of Europe’s Lugano Convention could be used?"
". We are in the process of drafting the proposal for a directive, presented in January 2002, on environmental liability with regard to the prevention and remedying of environmental damage, which is particularly important for ensuring better environmental protection and for combating all types of pollution, setting out new principles and proposing new obligations, specifically for companies."
"This is proving to be a far from straightforward process, however, particularly in the European Parliament, where the pressure exerted by the various economic interests has made itself felt, and this is why it was the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and not the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy that negotiated this directive."
"The Council common position rejected some of the European Parliament’s proposals, only some of which have now been accepted at second reading."
"The results of the vote reveal some contradictions and weaknesses in Parliament’s final position, which rejected most of my group’s proposals, although most of the negative proposals from the Commission were also rejected."
"We will see what the final outcome is, but everything suggests that it will fall short of what is needed."
". – The ‘polluter pays’ principle is currently widely accepted."
"Does that imply, however, that those with a great deal of money are allowed to cause a great deal of pollution?"
"Furthermore, what happens if the culprit is unable to pay, or if the perpetrator is not found, or if everything is carried out according to the rules on authorisation?"
"For such time as the economy continues to be considered more important than the environment, mitigating circumstances and exceptions will always be sought."
"More must be done to render disasters involving oil tankers at sea and involving nuclear power stations practically impossible, but if such disasters occur nevertheless, the damage is vast."
"In the current situation, compulsory insurance for all economic activities is the most important weapon for preventing such disasters."
"The insurance companies, which do not like paying out large sums, will force the companies insured with them to become safer."
"It emerged from the preliminary debate that it is not just a case of an undisputed technical regime."
"Disasters involving oil and those involving nuclear power are exempted owing to insufficient international regimes."
"The right wing is saying that compulsory insurance is not customary practice, will become prohibitively expensive, and gives rise to excessive bureaucracy."
"The alternative would be that no one would pay for cleaning up and restoration in the event of environmental disasters, or that this would be paid for out of taxes."
"I support all attempts to tighten up this Directive."
". I welcome the work that has been undertaken in an area that is of increasing concern to European citizens; namely, environmental protection and the liability of economic operators for damage done to the environment."
"I therefore believe that making operators adopt the necessary measures to prevent imminent threats of environmental damage and to establish compensation mechanisms for damage caused is justified, necessary and useful."
"Furthermore, I agree with the distinction that is made between some high-risk commercial activities on the one hand, for which all environmental damage is covered and to which objective liability applies and, on the other, commercial activities other than those referred to, in which only damage caused to protected species and natural habitats will be covered in the event of proven intent or negligence on the part of the operator."
"The balanced and realistic solutions that we are able to provide in this field will help to attain the objective of preventing and remedying environmental damage and protect the economic and competitive interests of the companies in question, and also constitute the right way of attaining the objectives declared by the Community to achieve sustainable growth and development."
"The European Parliament has today voted on a proposal for a directive aimed at standardising the rules that apply to environmental liability in the EU."
"The overarching principle must be that ‘the polluter pays’."
"The idea is that companies and other actors throughout the EU must be subject to the same legislation when it comes to their obligations to prevent, attend to and pay for the environmental damage for which they are responsible."
"I have chosen to follow a more environmentally friendly line than the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and have therefore voted, for example, for stricter requirements regarding nuclear pollution (Amendment No 42) and the issue of genetically modified organisms, or GMOs (Amendments Nos 43 and 44)."
"In spite of Amendments Nos 42 and 44 having won a majority of votes, the required 314 votes were not achieved and the amendments were thus rejected."
".On amendments which were submitted by the Green Party, I would like to make the following explanation for my vote against."
"Where amendments proposed incorporating GMO and nuclear issues inside the scope of the directive, I voted against. This is because nuclear liability covered by the Vienna and Paris Conventions is currently being reviewed."
"Any attempt here would be presumptuous as to that review's outcome."
"On GMOs it is clear that liability still has to be worked out, as legislation dealing with GMOs has only just come on to the statute books."
"Let us see how that works first."
"All else undermines conventions or existing law."
".– The recommendation on a code for medicinal products is extremely important in an area to which European citizens are highly sensitive but which is ruled by the profiteering interests of the large companies."
"On this basis, I voted in favour of all the amendments which aim to:"
"- supervise the market independently of the pharmaceutical industry;"
"- protect the public from medicinal products which have expired;"
"- reduce the period of commercial secrecy demanded by the large pharmaceutical companies, the result of which is to prevent cheaper drugs from being marketed;"
"- limit advertising of medicinal products;"
"- set up databases independently of the pharmaceutical companies."
"The Grossetête report on the introduction of a Community code relating to medicinal products for human use is basically intended to protect the interests of the pharmaceutical industry."
"It is disgusting that it is the big pharmaceutical trusts’ hunger for profit that has the last word in an area in which priority should be given to public health, because protection of the monopoly on patents, which ensures this industry’s profits while sending the prices of medicines soaring, has the drastic effect of denying hundreds of thousands of human beings access to those medicines."
"Although we have supported the amendments in favour of better labelling or informing the public about the effects of medicines, we have, on the other hand, voted against the amendments protecting the monopoly of pharmaceutical laboratories."
"In our view, public health and the interests of patients are much more important than freedom of trade and shareholders’ profits."
". The agreement that has just been reached in Parliament was based on a misguided Commission proposal, which viewed the matter in exclusively commercial terms and which sought to review the process of legislating on medicines, with the basic aim of increasing the short-tern competitiveness of the pharmaceutical industry."
"This position was immediately contested by various social, consumer, family and mutual organisations from various countries, all fighting for a responsible policy that will serve public health and consumer protection."
"Consequently, at first reading, Parliament was able to make substantial changes to the Commission proposals, which the Council only accepted in part."
"At second reading, some of the original proposals were accepted and whilst the compromise that has been voted on today in the European Parliament does not accept all the proposals that we put forward, it significantly improves the Council position, specifically as regards defining generic medicines, as regards the request for a distinction to be made between advertising and information and as regards the invitation to the Commission to undertake a study of current practices in the field of information, with the aim of improving quality."
". – The compromise is a step forward for the competitiveness of the pharmaceutical industry, the knowledge-based economy and the availability of medicinal products in the EU."
"Dossier protection for pharmaceutical products in the EU varies from six to ten years."
"The result is that the supply and price of medicinal products varies considerably among the Member States."
"The ‘8 + 2 + 1’ compromise involves eight years’ dossier protection, plus two years for generic medicinal products, to put the dossier in order, followed by market access, and then one year’s extra protection for the innovative industry if a medicinal product also has a therapeutic effect for other illnesses; and results in greater price competition, an improved supply of medicinal products and a boost to the knowledge-based economy."
"The Council has failed by omitting to include homeopathic medicinal products in the compromise package."
"As a result, these medicinal products remain a legal grey area, and homeopathic medicinal products will continue to circulate illegally on the market."
"I therefore call on the European Commission to present a proposal as quickly as possible regulating the registration of homeopathic medicinal products at European level; only then will the European market in medicinal products be complete."
"Homeopathic medicinal products represent an important alternative for many people."
"I, too, rank among those who have a great deal of confidence in the therapeutic effects of these medicinal products."
". The highest degree of public health protection in the Union is a concept enshrined in the current Article 152 of the EC Treaty."
"I welcome the efforts made by all institutional and private operators to improve the content of the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use."
"The amendments mainly concern the definition of medicinal products, generic medicinal products and organic medicinal products which, in my view, is aimed at meeting the ever-greater demands of the European citizens and the need to provide a more reliable framework for conditions for marketing medicinal products for human use."
"Lastly, as I said about the other report by Mrs Grossetête, we must consider reasonable protection (in the form of a set period of time) for the rights of pharmaceutical products, specifically those that have new therapeutic indications, which provide patients with substantial clinical benefits compared to existing therapeutic indications, in order to achieve the balance suggested by the rapporteur (although not optimistic, she is at least realistic) between competitiveness, research, health system needs and the development of generic medicines."
"The overall compromise that was reached with the Council under the Italian Presidency, including on the Agency covered by the Müller report, is extremely important."
"We have just expressed our opinion on the revision of pharmaceutical legislation."
"The modified directive will allow a greater degree of harmonisation between the Member States when it comes to the rules governing medicines."
"It may increase the effectiveness with which the centralised and decentralised procedures operate."
"We want the Member States to ensure, however, that preference is given to homeopathic medicines manufactured and marketed in the Community."
"We have voted in favour of the amendments that could resolve a number of problems caused by the legal vacuum in which certain homeopathic medicines still exist."
"Not only do these medicines, used by more than a hundred million Europeans, not have side effects, but they also enable the health services to make savings."
"We are definitely keen to preserve those homeopathic medicines that meet the demand from our countries’ citizens."
"We have also come out in favour of developing Europe’s generic pharmaceutical industry, for, if we want to preserve our social protection, we have to make savings, and generic medicines help us do that."
".I commend the rapporteur for her tremendous work on this vital subject."
"The common position as drafted presents a major problem for my Member State, Ireland, regarding Article 67 on prescription-only medicines for veterinary purposes."
"This is why I retabled the relevant amendment from first reading, which we overwhelmingly adopted first time round."
"It is essential that subsidiarity prevail and that each Member State be free to decide which medicines will require prescriptions."
"This is the current situation and has proved reliable in terms of protecting public health."
"My amendment would allow Member States this discretion, while carefully supervising the authorisation of appropriate dispensers of the medicines."
"It would mean that the merchant-based system of licensing and control in Ireland would be allowed to continue."
"This system delivers the highest standards of food safety and traceability."
"But it avoids unnecessary cost and bureaucracy for farmers and animal owners."
". I welcome the efforts that have been made to establish a Community code for veterinary medicines."
"Guaranteeing a high level of public health protection in the European Union necessarily requires general provisions to be adopted on placing these veterinary medicines on the market."
"There is unfortunately no shortage of reasons for greater vigilance to be required for products made available to healthcare professionals."
"Care over the precision and reliability of information on medicinal products is becoming increasingly important, due to greater consumer awareness."
"I therefore believe we would do very well to insist on a clearer separation between ‘information on medicinal products’ and the ‘advertising of medicinal products’."
"Lastly, I agree with the idea that reasonable timescales must be set for protecting the rights of pharmaceutical products, because this alone – on a reasonable basis, of course, which I believe has been achieved as a result of the European Parliament’s action – will ensure the ongoing interest of the sector’s industries in pursuing and even stepping up their study and technological research efforts to find new and improved products."
"I have voted in favour of Amendments Nos 20-23, which were, however, rejected."
"I did so because there is an obvious risk of what are at present counted as food supplements being redefined in future as medicines."
"This would make them less accessible in a situation in which many people supplement their food intake with food supplements in order to feel better and keep healthy."
"The directive could therefore have a serious effect on prices in the event of food supplements being redefined as medicines."
"Higher costs for the individual consumer might make food supplements too expensive to buy."
"The result would be higher sickness rates and increasing costs to society."
".I thank the rapporteur for his hard work on this important matter."
"Traditional herbal medicines have been used in our societies from the earliest times."
"In more recent years, production and sale of these products have become more structured and commercialised."
"There has been an increasing awareness that modern medicines do not always provide relief for all possible conditions and many people have found herbal medicines to be an important element of their health regime."
"I believe that we as legislators have a duty first and foremost to ensure the highest standards of public health protection."
"The provision of medicines, herbal or otherwise, cannot take place in an unregulated environment."
"This would be irresponsible."
"However, we must pay due regard to long-established practices in an industry that has been largely self-regulating in many countries."
"There are many products available through health food stores which have been categorised as foods or food supplements and not medicines, even though they may have therapeutic qualities."
"But we must remember that all foods which form part of a balanced diet can have a positive health effect."
"What we must avoid is imposing restrictive legislation that will hamper free trade and competition and cause damage to a thriving health store sector."
"The operation of this sector can be carefully monitored through appropriate national legislation."
". I supported this recommendation for second reading which, by retabling those Parliamentary amendments that were adopted at previous reading and by improving the text of the common position adopted by the Council, better serves the aim of harmonising national legislation in the field of measuring instruments."
"The increasing complexity of today’s economies and the need to ensure fair trade require a minimum level of accuracy that must be guaranteed by means of legislative requirements."
"This demand is, in the context of a common market such as the European Union’s, more than justified."
"This view is damaged by the Council common position’s containing an ‘optionality clause’, which would allow Member States to decide what instruments must be subject to regulation, thereby encouraging the retention of a dual system consisting of a regulated part and an unregulated part."
"I fully agree with the rapporteur when he states that ‘if intra-Community trade considerations are taken into account, then national legislation should notbe incompatible with each other, nor with EC legislation’."
"Consequently, as the rapporteur points out, only by making this clause meet certain general requirements and by introducing a transitional period in which Member States can phase out this clause will we be able to achieve the harmonisation we wish to see."
". I know that road safety is a high-priority task for the European Union, I recognise that this report represents a step towards achieving this Community objective and consequently voted in favour of the report currently before us."
"I therefore agree with adopting most of the measures that were proposed and with applying them to minibuses, buses and coaches and to light, medium and heavy-duty vehicles."
"I agree with the rapporteur’s view, however, that banning side-facing seats in certain vehicles is excessive."
"The fundamental issue is that these seats have not been proven to be unsafe in all the vehicle types in question."
"It is true that the Commission submitted a study, but this study does not justify a ban of this nature, because it was confined to examining accidents that occurred in only one category of vehicles – minibuses – and was based on parameters that only apply to this type of vehicle."
"Furthermore, the data on M3-category coaches which belong to the classes III or B, do not suggest any specific risk that would justify a total ban."
"I therefore feel that the European Commission’s conclusions are, in this last regard, over-hasty."
". Wearing a safety belt has advantages, mainly that of preventing people from being thrown from vehicles."
"Various road accident studies conclude, incidentally, that many passengers die precisely as a result of being projected from the vehicle whereas those who remain inside the vehicle generally survive."
"We could, therefore, legitimately consider the use of seatbelts to be socially beneficial, because this contributes significantly to reducing the number of deaths and injuries in the event of an accident."
"It is also important to remember that this report adopts a Commission proposal that should be seen in the context of amendments to 1974, 1976 and 1977 Council directives on enhancing road safety."
"We can reasonably predict that the Commission proposals contained in this set of measures will bring about positive results."
"At a time, however, when the road mortality rate remains high, safety measures for all vehicles must be stepped up – not only for light vehicles (category M1), but also for minibuses and coaches (categories M2 and M3) and light and heavy trucks (categories N1, N2 and N3)."
"Road safety must be a priority."
"For all of these reasons, I voted in favour."
". Greater transport safety, in light of the very high number of fatalities every year, has been one of the European Union’s priorities, and has led to various European Parliament reports and to a White Paper."
"I believe that by extending the obligatory use of seatbelts, the Commission proposal, which the rapporteur also endorses, contributes to greater passenger safety and I therefore supported this report."
"We are talking, in particular, about minibuses, coaches and light, medium and heavy-duty trucks."
"This measure does nothing more than minimise the effects of road accidents, however, and I recommend that investment be made in other, genuinely preventive, measures, as a more effective way of reducing the mortality rate on roads, by reducing the number of accidents."
"I propose, for example, that we give a powerful commitment to school and civic education, to promoting a culture of responsibility and respect, to improving roads and motorways, which are becoming increasingly congested, and to technological improvements to cars and to all vehicles."
"Another suggestion, which I have advocated for a long time, is to invest in developing the rail sector, which is an undoubtedly safer form of transport than road transport and which could provide a truly sustainable alternative to a road sector which is increasingly saturated."
".I abstained because I am chairman of the Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art in the UK."
". Although I am aware of the problems inherent in this issue, not least in terms of international coordination and of proving ownership, I believe that this is a positive proposal because it will ensure the full return, wherever possible, of looted cultural goods."
"In this regard, there clearly exists legal uncertainty, which is abused today by people who appropriate these goods and traffic illegally in them, leaving their legitimate owners without legal protection."
"A typical situation involves countless items plundered during World War II, many of which have still not been recovered by their owners or the owners’ successors."
"In this difficult balancing act between various interests, account must also be taken of rights acquired by third parties who have purchased items in good faith."
"I therefore share the rapporteur’s position on the need to address the complexity of the underlying moral and ethical issue and on the need for a legal and institutional framework that is fairer to those asking for goods to be returned, to the current owners, to state bodies and to not-for-profit organisations."
"Coordination has clear advantages over the haphazard approach that has prevailed to date, and I welcome in particular the idea of establishing a common cataloguing system, creating a centralised database and opening up public and private archives to investigation, which will facilitate greater transparency and more effective monitoring of the movements of such goods."
"I voted in favour of the report."
".– The resolution on the Commission’s work programme for 2004 has very severe things to say about the Eurostat affair and its consequences, and these I entirely endorse, but the fact is that nobody is explaining why there was no response from the Commission for such a long period of time."
"Not only is it necessary to lance the boil of Eurostat; it will also be necessary, in future, to make OLAF more independent and more capable of functioning, to improve the transmission of internal information, to treat as a matter of urgency the reform of the Commission’s accounting system, and to put an end to both the culture of secrecy and the negligent attitude to financial control."
"These requirements are made all the more urgent by the constant revelations of other frauds, for example, the price-fixing by insiders in agricultural management committees, or, more recently, the ‘Blue Dragon 2000’ affair in relation to the use of Community funds in Catalonia."
"Aberrations of this sort are not unconnected with the Commission’s generally arrogant attitude towards the Member States."
"One single cause underlies all this behaviour, namely, the Commission’s belief in itself as the sole possessor of a superior truth."
"It is regrettable that the draft European constitution encourages it in this belief, whereas it ought to have been made into a subordinate body."
".– This is a resolution that not only fails to question any of the European Union’s fundamental pillars and policies – its neoliberal capitalist policies, federalism, its increasing militarism – and fails to condemn the harmful consequences of these for the workers and communities in the various countries it actually confirms these guidelines and priorities, and masks their true nature by introducing some social concerns."
"One example is the resolution’s insistence on the need for the so-called ‘European constitution’."
"It is reluctant to enter into the debate on the forthcoming financial perspectives (from 2006 onwards) – and this is simply astounding - on the grounds that the European elections are due to be held soon."
"It welcomes the militarisation of the EU."
"It does not question the policies of liberalisation – it simply refers to more careful consideration of their ‘possible consequences’."
"It rejects the proposal for an amendment that proposed a re-evaluation of the Commission’s mandate for the WTO."
"In short, it gives the Commission yet another role."
"There is no analysis of the worsening economic and social situation in the various EU countries or any criticism of the policies that have caused this situation."
"If the truth be told, we could expect nothing else from the political forces that decide, in the EP, in the Commission and in the various governments, on EU policies."
"Mr President, on Côte d'Ivoire, we tabled an amendment today."
"It is deplorable that this Parliament did not support that amendment."
"It is completely unacceptable that, in relation to fisheries agreements, EU fishing vessels take priority over the rights of people in other countries."
"This is a war-torn country."
"We believe that the agreement should be suspended until the conflict is solved."
"It is completely unacceptable to let EU vessels continue fishing undisturbed regardless of the fact that there is a conflict there."
".– The role of foreign forces is particularly evident in the military conflicts which are tearing the Côte d'Ivoire apart, with tens of thousands of innocent victims."
"At the same time, the European Union has turned this country into an experimental laboratory to test its ‘crisis management’ policy which, in essence, is a policy of imposing its imperialist intentions."
"The European Union has no business in Côte d'Ivoire."
"The French troops should withdraw immediately and the problem should be dealt with within the framework of the UN and the African Union."
"We MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the resolution, not only because it fails to name the guilty parties, but also because it welcomes the interventionist role of the EU."
"These positions turn any positive elements which the resolution contains into nothing more than a wish list."
". – Even though it is impossible to disagree with the condemnation of the concept of ‘’ and of the political murders committed in its name, we have not voted to approve this report."
"On the one hand, it glosses over the culpability of successive French governments, which, following a long period of colonial oppression, supported Houphouët-Boigny’s dictatorship and then the authoritarian regime of his successor Bédié, who, in the course of his struggle for power with his rivals, devised the rabble-rousing concept of ‘."
"Even today, the French army maintains a presence in Côte d’Ivoire to protect, not the people, but French capitalist interests."
"In any case, what is meant by ‘the restoration of the state’s authority’ if no means are provided to put a stop to ‘poverty, the unequal distribution of wealth, social injustice, violations of human rights, and the oppression of minorities…’,which the report itself sees as destabilising influences and as having been factors in bringing about the present conflicts?"
"As for what are claimed to be peacekeeping forces, for example those of ECOWAS, previous experience in Sierra Leone and Liberia has demonstrated that, in general, they did nothing other than add one more armed gang to those that are already preying on the population."
"Using our votes to endorse such a hypocritical document would have served only to enable Members of the European Parliament to appease their consciences."
". – From the very outset, the joint resolution adopts a paternalistic tone in its assessment that the conflict in Côte d'Ivoire ‘cannot be attributed solely to the ethnic factor’ – which, in any case, attaches value to the factor in question."
"Is it not, though, the neo-liberalisation of the Ivorian economy, the reduced prices for raw materials and the consequent impoverishment of the people, the way in which multinational companies openly set Ivorian neo-colonial factions against each other, that have enabled speeches about ‘’ to find an audience, and facilitated ?"
"The joint resolution has nothing to say about the need to withdraw the French peacekeeping troops; the historic links between the army, French businesses, and the political class in Côte d'Ivoire and the neighbouring states mean that the French army and foreign office cannot be regarded as neutral, so the involvement of other actors needs to be encouraged."
"This at once weakens many of the points in the Linas-Marcoussis agreement."
"The best policy for preventing conflicts is to eradicate their causes, and, in this instance, those who started the fires are no good at putting them out."
"There is a need to get away from the profoundly anti-democratic, neo-colonialist way of thinking in order to move towards another form of cooperation between Europe and Africa."
"I therefore abstained from voting on a resolution that does not get to grips with these problems."
". – Once again, this House has responded to the disastrous situation in Cote d’Ivoire by adopting a mediocre resolution which does not distinguish between the prime cause of the situation and factors of secondary importance."
"The prime cause is a combination of ethnically-based forces, openly racist (whether their racism be intertribal, anti-white, or anti-French), engaged in dismantling the stability and prosperity that they inherited."
"The armed robberies committed a fortnight ago in Abidjan, by militiamen calling themselves ‘patriots’, the victims being representatives of humanitarian NGOs that are doing remarkable work, especially for the benefit of children, and diplomatic representatives, are made all the more shocking and unacceptable by their being carried out with utter impunity and under the complacent eyes of the forces of order."
"The double game that the government is playing must be denounced in unequivocal terms: there was nothing spontaneous about these events, which were surreptitiously organised by cronies of President Gbagbo or by the President himself, whose mastery of doubletalk is unsurpassed."
"These ‘young patriots’ are armed, funded and used by a government which, although lawful, is failing to perform its functions."
"In view of the scale of robberies such as these, France and the European Union must, as a matter of urgency, start to talk tough and establish a clear link between aid and respect for rights, or else they will give an impression of indifference or complicity."
"That concludes the explanations of vote."
"(4)"
"– Mr President, over the weekend of 6-7 December 2003, the number of innocent victims of the criminal invasion of Afghanistan by the American armed forces was increased by a further fifteen children, murdered during bombings by the occupying forces."
"Since the beginning of the invasion of Afghanistan, thousands of children and civilians have lost their lives, the pretext being to oust the Taliban but the real objective being to occupy Afghanistan."
"We also have a similar but even worse situation as a result of the illegal and barbaric invasion of Iraq by American and British forces."
"Nonetheless, while the European Parliament has shown particular sensitivity about the deaths among the invaders, observing one minute's silence in their memory, it is indifferent to the countless victims they have caused."
"Mr President, I should like to ask the Bureau to invite the House, during the next plenary, to observe one minute's silence in memory of the children and the thousands of other civilians who lost their lives during the above invasions."
"The Presidency has taken note of your proposal and will communicate it to the competent authorities for their consideration."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0435/2003) by Mrs Sommer, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the widespread introduction and interoperability of electronic road toll systems in the Community [COM(2003) 132 – C5-0190/2003 – 2003/0081(COD)]."
". – Let me start by warmly thanking my fellow-Members of this House for their very constructive cooperation, especially the shadow rapporteurs, to whom many thanks."
"The proposal that the Commission put before us was indeed a very ambitious one, with much promised by a forward-looking new technology based on satellite navigation and mobile communications."
"By 2012 at the latest, according to the proposal, the Member States were to be required to use this technology for the charging of tolls, which would have meant the abolition of all the other technical systems currently in existence, which are based on short-range microwave technology."
"This was meant to achieve technical interoperability, which was the actual object of the legislation."
"It is also the right one."
"In a common internal market, it is not acceptable for technical barriers to put the brakes on the flow of traffic and hence on the transport of goods."
"Incompatibility between national toll systems could have no other result; it creates problems for international road traffic and interferes with the smooth functioning of the internal market."
"The legislative proposal also aims at contractual interoperability; one contract for each user, and valid throughout Europe, would certainly be a good thing."
"I might mention that this is also an ambitious goal in view of the continuing need for a great deal of harmonisation within the EU, whether in the fiscal, administrative or legal spheres."
"I was unable, however, as this House’s rapporteur, to go along with the Commission proposal as it relates to technical interoperability."
"Why is this so?"
"The problem we face is that the new toll technology that the Commission favours, and which is currently being developed only in Germany, does not yet work."
"Technology that does not work does not exist in real terms, so can legislators prescribe as mandatory something that does not exist?"
"Is it, in any case, any legislator’s task to prescribe one technology or another?"
"No, I do not believe that it is."
"As the majority of my fellow-Members share my view that it is for the market to decide what specific technologies should be used, we have agreed not to follow the Commission on this point."
"We want to take a more technology-neutral approach."
"We take the view that the actual objective – the technical interoperability of the various systems – has to be achieved."
"We have been told by the users – the operating companies in the various Member States in which electronic toll-charging systems are in use – that this can be done."
"By the present proposal, as now amended, we insist on this; technical interoperability must be achieved, and what this ultimately means is that the technology currently in use must be changed only as and when it cannot be enabled to communicate with other systems of technology."
"We also see it as important that subsidiarity should be safeguarded."
"The basic decision on whether or not to charge a toll, on what vehicles and what stretches or types of road, must remain a matter for the Member States."
"I also think it is important that I should take this opportunity to point out that data protection must be treated as a matter of the highest priority."
"We do not want drivers to end up having everything known about them."
"Let me add that, in all our debates, I repeatedly stressed my view that satellite technology is extraordinarily important."
"I am convinced that we are doing the right thing in developing Galileo, the European satellite system."
"In order to put this conviction on record, I have now, at first reading, tabled an amendment drafted in stronger terms."
"I would emphasise that it was my esteemed colleague Mrs Langenhagen who originally tabled this amendment in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, where it struck me as too rigorous to be able to command a majority."
"As regards tomorrow’s vote in the plenary, though, I am working on the assumption that this House will endorse this unequivocal vote in favour of Europe having its own satellite navigation system, one that will make us Europeans independent of others."
"This, again, I ask you to support."
"Let me conclude by asking you to believe me when I say that for me, as a German rapporteur, it has not – heaven knows – been an easy matter to propose this course of action to you."
"The original draft from the Commission would eventually have given German industry an enormous opportunity; it could have marketed the new and innovative toll-charging technology the length and breadth of Europe."
"This new technology is fantastic."
"Not only – I am convinced – is it the only technical solution that can be regarded as suitable to German conditions, but it also has many other potential uses over and beyond simply collecting tolls."
"Let me reiterate, though, that a technology that does not exist in real terms cannot be made mandatory by law."
"It is a source of bitter anguish to me that the amateurish approach adopted by the German Federal Government, particularly when negotiating the contracts to introduce toll-charging technology, has resulted in such a debacle, one that leaves us, at European level, no solution other than the one I have now proposed to you."
". – The message of the statistics is plain, especially where freight traffic across the Alps is concerned."
"In Switzerland, 66% of freight is transported by rail and 30% by road; in the EU, the proportions are reversed and the difference even more starkly pronounced."
"What this means is that, politically speaking, the Swiss are doing something that we in Europe, in the European Union, cannot manage to do."
"They fix the heavy traffic levy at such a level that all external costs are completely internalised, so that the costs of road surfaces, accidents and environmental damage by noise and air pollution are all covered."
"Of this revenue, 80% is spent on the alternative; on building base tunnels, on measures for protection from railway noise and on improvements to rail services."
"In technological matters, too, the Swiss, in little Switzerland, are years ahead of the EU."
"The Swiss have a system, one that works well, with microwave technology, to be combined in future with digital tachographs."
"The question is: why can we not manage that in the EU?"
"The proposal for the Eurovignette again lays down a maximum, one that is so low that nobody can seriously believe that it offers any proper incentive to use rail rather than road; nor, indeed, are the Member States allowed to spend most of this money on the alternative."
"What this means is that this is a half-hearted policy, and we see its results when we consider the statistics on climate change, accidents and so on."
"In much the same way as the German transport ministry, the Commission has allowed itself to be pressed into the service of two big players and wants to force upon us satellite technology that is not yet fully developed."
"I think that we who sit on the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, as well as on the other, would be doing well to bring the Commission back a bit nearer to earthbound reality and to demand neutrality in matters of technology."
"By way of conclusion, I want to say something about the effect that distorted competition between road and rail has on society."
"After this House had adopted, after only one reading, Mr Markov’s directive on driving hours and rest periods, Mr Berlusconi and his government did not even think it necessary to put it on the Council’s agenda."
"That, I think, is quite simply a scandal."
"How can we in Europe make progress on the social and environmental fronts when such significant directives are not allowed to make progress at Council level?"
"I thank the honourable Member."
"The President is tolerant towards rapporteurs, but you have exceeded your speaking time by fifty percent and your fellow Members will complain."
"I would be grateful if you would conform to the specified time."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to thank you for your support for our initiative on the interoperability of electronic road toll systems, which is an essential element in the European policy on charging for infrastructures and on the management of transport demand."
"This Directive appears amongst the proposals in the White Paper on transport policy and, clearly, it is a preliminary step to establishing the new Eurovignette system and to facilitating the payment by users of the costs of the use of road infrastructures."
"The Directive has the following three objectives: firstly, the interoperability of electronic road toll systems; secondly, the establishment of a European electronic road toll system; and, thirdly, the introduction of satellite technology."
"The principle of interoperability allows us to remove the obstacles standing in the way of creating the internal market in electronic tolls and therefore to prevent barriers; it allows us to extend electronic tolls more widely and restrict congestion at payment points."
"The European electronic road toll service we are proposing, like the interoperability of systems, responds to genuine need for users, in particular lorry drivers, who want an electronic means of payment as soon as possible, a single one for the whole of the network."
"The service we are proposing, based on the principle of a single contract, offers both users and operators the protection of a clear legal document which can be used in the event of a dispute."
"It is a question of implementing in this field what already exists, for example, in the fields of mobile telephones and bank card systems."
"With regard to the migration of the current electronic toll systems, based on microwave systems, to satellite technology, I will say that this is the only solution for the future which allows us to respond to the various needs of the European Union’s charging policy and which will furthermore allow us to considerably improve the quality of road transport, thanks to the establishment of new telematic services and new possibilities, particularly security systems, such as speed restrictors, anti-collision devices, the monitoring of the traffic in dangerous goods, information for travellers – in accordance with their position – on the situation on the different roads and on the fluidity of traffic at different points etc."
"Mr President, the lack of a firm commitment in favour of satellite technology would not be coherent with the decisive policy being maintained by this Commission and this Parliament in particular, as well as the Council and the European Union as a whole, in favour of the Galileo system."
"I would like to say that numerous Member States – with the notable exceptions of Germany and Italy – wish to continue using microwave systems in parallel with satellite systems."
"This desire, which is understandable in view of the investments already made, can be dealt with by integrating a firm recommendation on the solution for the satellites – rather than obtaining the full and closed commitment – which allows this to become a reality in the medium term."
"This is also accepted by the Council."
"I am going to listen to the rest of the debate, but I hope that, thanks to the work of the rapporteur, Mrs Sommer, and the co-rapporteur, Mr Turmes, and thanks to the work of the Council, we can adopt it at first reading – which I would insist is extremely important – in order the facilitate the use of toll systems on roads in the future."
"Mr President, today we were not going to talk about the ‘Eurovignette Directive’, but I would like to say to Mr Turmes that the working group on transport has already met on several occasions with a view to making progress on the debate on this complex Directive, and we are trying to achieve as successful a result as the one I expect with the ‘Electronic Toll Directive’, in other words that, at first reading – before the end, therefore, of Parliament's current mandate – Parliament and the Council can adopt it."
"– Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Renate Sommer, on the work which she carried out on her report."
"Of course, her work is so good that I believe that there will be agreement with the Council right from the first reading, which makes today's debate less interesting."
"But, in all events, this does not mean that we should not recall that Mrs Sommer worked in a very good and systematic manner and managed to make the Commission's initial proposal acceptable to almost all the members of our committee."
"At the same time, she agreed with the Council that we would proceed very quickly on what was necessary, in other words the interoperability of toll systems at European level."
"We agree with the Commission proposal in principle, because it makes life easier for users, that is, drivers, who will have fewer difficulties in cross-border transport with this approach."
"We simply have a few objections – and I am glad that both the Commission and the Council understand them – which focus on two points."
"First, when will this new toll concept start to be applied?"
"We propose that the timetable be postponed from 2005 to 2007 for buses and lorries, because we consider that two years are needed so that everyone who has to adapt can adapt and the system can start operating."
"Secondly, will the new satellite positioning system be applied exclusively or not? This system caused a great many problems when it started to be applied in Germany."
"I think that it does the rapporteur credit that she demonstrates a truly European perception of this specific issue; in other words, she does not want to impose the German system exclusively and she proposes, with all her fellow Members, that this decision be taken in agreement with the relevant sector, the Member States and the other agencies involved, so that we really can be sure that the systems will be interoperable and efficient for everyone."
"Commissioner, Mr President, first of all I should like to pay my deepest respects to Mrs Sommer, for the quality of the work that we were able to carry out together – thanks to her willingness to listen and also her flexibility on all those occasions where we may have had differences of opinion – which I hope has resulted in our having a very good text even at first reading, a text which I hope will be final."
"I believe that in the final analysis this directive is very important, on the one hand because its purpose is to make life easier for all those road-transport operators who of course pass through toll stations and who often need to change the system or method of payment, but also because it is a directive which is very much open to the prospects of future technology, in particular as regards the implementation of the Galileo system."
"We in the PSE Group believe that this directive was initially a little inflexible and very restricting for the motorway-transport sector."
"In effect, it required that sector to ensure, very rapidly, the interoperability of current microwave systems, in other words to invest very heavily, only to switch very quickly to another system two years later."
"No doubt it was unacceptable to demand such a double effort from the sector, and I welcome the fact that we were able to agree on Amendment No 48, by Mrs Sommer, which strongly recommends Galileo and advocates waiting for an intermediate report by the Commission in order to determine the conditions under which we shall implement the switch."
"Nevertheless, we are very keen on the satellite positioning system and we believe that that is where the future lies, not only for tolls, but for a multitude of other services."
"Secondly, we believe that we have given preference to the interoperability of systems, in other words most of the amendments that we have tabled, whether it is Amendment No 11 submitted by us or Amendment No 46 submitted by Mrs Sommer, are essentially aimed, not necessarily at having a unified system, but at making systems interoperable, and we believe that in the short term that is what should be required."
"In other words, we also have to ensure that certain microwave systems can be interoperable with GPM/GPRS technology."
"We have also reviewed the timetable."
"I think that the timetable proposed by the Commission was quite simply unrealistic, because it did not take into account the time needed for the legislative work and the fact that we were unable to require that the European electronic toll system be brought into line so rapidly, that is, by 1 January 2005."
"Finally, as far as the PSE Group is concerned, we have proposed, at the request of the City of London – which does not seem to be particularly Socialist – which is following this debate closely, to restrict the scope slightly and to make provision for a transitional phase for local toll systems."
"London, in fact, has just implemented its own system."
"It is a very promising experiment and I do not think that we ought to restrict it too much."
"By contrast, we are fiercely – that is no doubt too strong a word – opposed to the amendments tabled by our Italian fellow Members, namely Amendments Nos 19, 23, 26, 27 and 29, which aim to propose a system of contractual rules rather than a European electronic toll system."
"We believe that there must be a European electronic toll system."
"It is clearer from the legal point of view, and it is also more stable, simpler and easier to understand."
"We shall therefore oppose these Italian proposals."
"By contrast, we are entirely in agreement with Amendment No 39 which seeks to protect privacy, since we are proposing a switch to Galileo."
"It seems to us that these precautions are necessary."
"Finally, we shall approve and support Amendment No 40 tabled by the Verts/ALE Group, because we believe that a toll cannot amount to nothing more than a tax or an additional charge."
"Nor can a toll be simply a means of covering the depreciation of our road infrastructure."
"A toll must also be a transport-policy tool, and must be able to guarantee modal transfer and cross-financing, so as to encourage people to switch to other alternative modes of transport in future."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by praising the rapporteur for a really good piece of work."
"At the moment, we see how more and more EU countries are introducing road tolls, often backed by different technical systems."
"This is one of the main points I believe we should emphasise, namely that we must not focus exclusively upon one technical system, such as satellite navigation, but, on the contrary, permit different systems that are interoperable."
"It is enough to look at the situation in Germany, which has come down unilaterally in favour of a particular system which is patently not operating as intended."
"That is not an example we should follow at EU level."
"In connection with the German system, there was also another problem, namely that there were not enough boxes available, with the result that hauliers in different countries did not have the opportunity to have these boxes installed."
"There is also something else we must avoid in the future."
"I think that, in order to be focused upon its users, the system must also ensure, at a purely technical level, that hauliers and their drivers only have to install a single box in each vehicle."
"This would ease the administrative burden for the transport companies, and it would also mean greater road safety, for drivers would only have to concentrate on one piece of equipment."
"It is also important that users be guaranteed access to a coherent network through a single contract relating to the overall network of roads involving tolls."
"Together, these are all aspects it is very important to bear in mind in connection with the reading of this report."
"I therefore hope we obtain an agreement that puts users in the driving seat. I also hope you have noticed that I have left a little time for those who, unlike myself, have exceeded their speaking time."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I have to say again that I do not agree with the Commissioner, and that this report is indeed very much about the Eurovignette, among other things."
"The fact is that the introduction of a Eurovignette is dependent on the interoperability of toll systems, which means that the technology must be available, and work, before we can start charging for the Eurovignette, and we all know how urgently we need the money."
"We know that there is a considerable shortfall of funds in the railway sector."
"We saw, indeed, in our most recent debates on the necessary size of the European Union’s budgets, that there is in this sector a need for both revenue and for costs to be apportioned realistically, in other words, that railways, which have to pay their way, must, as regards costs, be put on an equal footing with roads, and that HGVs and other freight traffic must also pay to use roads."
"So we unreservedly back Mrs Sommer as regards the guidelines she has laid down and endorse her statement that we need a solution that is not dependent on technology."
"The aim is that the technology that is used should be capable of being used anywhere, and soon."
"That is what we are aiming for, and it is a very good thing that Parliament is sticking to this line."
"Thank you, Mrs Sommer: we need a practicable solution, and we are right behind you."
"The introduction of the actual instrument that we need – the Eurovignette, an instrument of policy that this admittedly highly technical report is seeking to bring about – is absolutely dependent on a practicable solution being found."
"Speaking, then, as a representative of a government that has shown how not to do it, I can say that the Greens – and I am absolutely of one mind with the German Greens on this – see practicability as the decisive factor in a solution."
"Let me warn you, Commissioner, against going all-out for big technology that does not always work, and neglecting the other practical aspects."
"I believe that Mrs Sommer’s report imposes the right conditions and shows it has to be done."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to make use of the opportunity afforded by the discussion of this report to underline the distinction that should continue to be drawn between the harmonisation of toll collection systems and the uniform collection of tolls as tax."
"I am, on the one hand, referring to the technical aspects that are being discussed and whereby it is intended to achieve interoperability of electronic toll collection systems across the Union."
"Nobody in their right mind will be opposed to this."
"It does, however, strike me that this report steers clear of a few important political issues that have arisen during the discussion of this topic, and so a more comprehensive discussion would have been desirable."
"I would particularly emphasise the fact that it should remain up to the Member States themselves to assess the desirability of a toll system for lorries and passenger cars."
"It seems rather logical to me that in a peripheral or insular state, such as Portugal, or Malta, which is due to accede in the near future, the economic and political considerations there are different from those in, for example, Flanders, which, being situated between Germany, France, the Netherlands and Great Britain, forms the EU’s central traffic intersection."
"The Flemish motorways are at risk of being oversaturated by the exponential increase in freight traffic."
"In order to stimulate transport by rail and sea, for example, Flanders should be able to use criteria that are different from those of other Member States, if it wanted to introduce toll collections for freight traffic tomorrow, because it collects no tolls at present."
"The same applies to toll collections on passenger transport, whereby so many different factors, including tourism, traffic density, air pollution, economic structures, and so on, can play a role in determining whether or not such toll collections are desirable."
"Every government should retain the right to weigh up for itself whether the already heavily taxed car drivers – and we are talking about working people who keep the wheels of industry oiled – should be taxed even more."
"Today, Europe may harmonise the technical aspects of – and I should like to drive this point home – toll systems."
"When it comes to making political and economic decisions in this respect, this Parliament and the Commission would do well to show a little more respect for the subsidiarity principle, to which often only lip service is paid."
"Mr President, firstly I would like to add my congratulations to those that have already been made to the rapporteur, who has done an excellent job in revising some of the more unrealistic parts of the proposal."
"However, there are for me a number of concerns which still remain and which still need further clarification."
"One of my main concerns centred on the familiar subject of subsidarity, already mentioned by the previous speaker."
"In this particular case, I do not believe that the EU should be able to foist road pricing upon the UK, or any other EU country for that matter, and I am therefore pleased to see an amendment guaranteeing the subsidiarity principle in this report."
"Thus it is now clear that the proposal should not imply the mandatory EU-wide introduction of toll systems."
"Such a move would doubtless mean, for example, that the UK Government, which is currently considering road pricing, would simply have passed the buck for such an unpopular move on to the European Union."
"I am also pleased to see that we are to let the markets dictate what technology, if any, should be used."
"The notion that a satellite technology system would be our sole system is to me quite ridiculous."
"Indeed, it is the proposal to use satellite technology which irks me most."
"I have argued several times in committee that civil liberties issues that accompany this particular type of technology are a grave threat to people's everyday lives."
"We all know that, improperly used, satellite tracking is just another form of Big Brother."
"There is also the not insubstantial cost to business and individuals, who presumably would have to pay for the installation of such technology."
"On a more positive note, the committee's decision to put back the Commission's implementation dates was very much welcome."
"The original request was both highly illogical and unrealistic."
"But regrettably, unless the issues to which I have referred are fully addressed, in particular the reference to the use of satellite systems, I will be unable to support the rapporteur in her overall proposal."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to start by congratulating Mrs Sommer on her very thorough and in-depth work, although I admit that I would have preferred a report that stuck closer to what the Commission had proposed."
"I believe that the Commission proposal was – or is – bolder and more forward-looking, albeit somewhat more risky."
"Unfortunately, I have to add, the Commission’s staff have perhaps been insufficiently energetic or enthusiastic in pleading the technical merits of this proposal."
"We can certainly live with what Mrs Sommer has put together and the Committee have adopted, but I would like to point out that it would actually do the European’s image some good if it were to move towards the most modern technology, not just because the technology is the most up-to-date, but because it is highly flexible."
"Advocates of a toll system, at any rate, know how important tolls can be in regulating traffic flow and diverting traffic from overstretched or environmentally vulnerable areas to other routes."
"They know that a high degree of flexibility is needed, one that can be achieved only by means of satellite technology, which requires less in the way of infrastructure than if a toll system uses microwave technology."
"I will concede that the bad experiences that the Germans are currently having have not been much help in achieving acceptance of this principle."
"That is one reason why Mrs Sommer, who may indeed have been more in favour of such a system, could not plead its cause, as she always had one eye on the press reports from Germany and could not go any further."
"I will address my concluding remarks to the Commission, which will perhaps report to one of the forthcoming meetings of the Committee on Regional Policy Transport and Tourism on what is happening about Galileo and the satellite system."
"I started by describing the Commission proposal as bolder but rather more risky – the latter insofar as we are dependent on a satellite system, Galileo in particular."
"It appears to me that there will be major problems with using the satellite-based system in Europe, for I hear that the Americans are bringing certain pressure to bear – we are having separate and specific talks with them – concerning the American influence on the system, which is being made somewhat less precise, and can, if it comes to that, even be switched off."
"I do not know whether the Commissioner wants to say something about this at the end of this debate or whether she will be able, when next the opportunity arises, to report to the committee on the actual state of play in this area."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, I should like first of all to thank Mrs Sommer for the huge amount of work that has been done."
"I should like to revisit the objective of this directive, which is, of course, the interoperability of electronic toll collection systems."
"It is, however, abundantly clear that the real objective goes deeper than this, namely the internalisation of the external environmental costs."
"Amendments have been tabled to that effect."
"After all, the key problems surrounding traffic still exist."
"Now, more than four years after I entered this House, those discussions are still going on."
"The problems are obvious: the environment, noise, emissions, congestion, lack of safety – I could go on in this vein for some time."
"These problems are inextricably linked to economic growth."
"Nearly all transport economists are in agreement that the use of tolls to restrict and influence traffic is the only way to tackle that problem."
"Today’s headlines in the Netherlands read: ‘Tolls at different levels help counter tailbacks’."
"This is the theory, but the heart of the problem, does, of course, lie to some extent with the Council of Ministers."
"At the beginning of this month, we received the report from the Council of Ministers that the ministers and transport ministers, at all levels, are hopelessly undecided about collection on a per-kilometre basis."
"I heard the proposals from Mrs Peijs, formerly an MEP, and currently Transport Minister in the Netherlands, which are tantamount to ‘flat-rate collection’."
"What we need is collection based on price, location, and type of vehicle and on a whole list of other things."
"This requires modern technology."
"We nonetheless share the rapporteur’s view that, at present, we should not simply, , ditch such things as microwave communication."
"That is taking matters too far."
"I also think that we are taking matters one step too far by using this so-called Galileo technology."
"Why do we insist on doing this?"
"GSM and GPS technology already exists, and GPS2 is only around the corner."
"The discussion surrounding Galileo is sufficiently known; we have had it here too."
"What we are about to receive now, is a sort of truck system, which I do not regard as strictly necessary."
"If we look at the examples in Switzerland, and at the , and so on, we conclude that we require an abundance of forward-looking technology."
"In my opinion, we should not only have Galileo, but also perhaps GSM."
"It should also be compatible, as we have agreed before."
"We would make a great deal of progress with this, and we hope that we can solve this future problem."
"I urge the transport ministers in any case to speak out about the way in which we use the money, whether we transfer money or not, what we collect for, for example, improving rail systems and so on, in other words ‘cross pricing’."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Sommer, whom I would like to thank for your work, I feel that our debates would sometimes be simpler if we were a little more with the order of business."
"I agree that this proposal for a directive will serve to simplify and, therefore, to some extent to promote the widespread use of systems of charging by means of tolls, rights of use and other means, but the subject of the directive is not so much charging as the interoperability of the different systems."
"For us, this was a goal which really was indispensable, in that only by guaranteeing interoperability can barriers to trade and potential distortions of the internal market be eliminated."
"In this sense, what we are doing is not supporting exploitative or technological monopolies but establishing the indispensable need for interoperability."
"I have no objection to resolute investment in pioneering technologies or the satellite sector as set out by the rapporteur."
"I have listened on a number of occasions to objections relating to the ‘Big Brother’ risk."
"I am no advocate of ‘Big Brother’, but, quite frankly, I would not like it whatever country it came from."
"It would not be right for any of us to be totally indifferent to Mr Bush’s ‘Big Brother’ and to be concerned solely about the European ‘Big Brother’, although, clearly, if I have to choose between them, I would choose the European branch of the family."
"One last point: the interoperability obligation must apply to contractual regulations too."
"We have to make things simpler for users and taxpayers too, with clear rules which make contractual relationships and regulations applying to individual operators flexible and open to common use by all operators."
"Legal, fiscal and other barriers make the obligatory reference to a single-contract system more complex."
"Mr President, the British Labour MEPs fully support the polluter pays principle and, with this in mind, believe that the cost of motoring in general should better reflect the real costs to society and, in particular, the environment."
"This can be best achieved by the introduction, where appropriate and where there is local support, of charging schemes."
"Congestion charging plays a key role in combating congestion, pollution and global warming."
"The successful and popular Central London charging scheme is an example of this new approach and represents the most ambitious urban road pricing scheme in Europe."
"Other towns and cities in the UK are pursuing similar initiatives."
"For lorries, Labour in the UK advocates the introduction of a lorry user charge, which is to be introduced in 2006 and, incidentally, is strongly supported by the main haulage-trade associations."
"Therefore, whilst we fully support the principle of interoperability of toll systems, it is essential that these pioneering British initiatives are not in any way prejudiced."
"We therefore support EU action to agree minimum technical standards to permit interoperability of tolling technology, so as to avoid vehicle owners having to install a number of separate units, with obvious consequences regarding cost and inconvenience."
"However, it would be wrong to prescribe the type of technology."
"We therefore welcome the Sommer report and would like to thank the rapporteur for her work, which fully addresses these concerns, seeking compatibility rather than rigidly prescribing the type of technology, which should rightly be left to the market or, under the principle of subsidiarity, to Member States."
"One area where there could be clarification is the role of regional and local authorities, and we urge Members to support Amendment No 45, which makes it clear that is the appropriate level for decision-making in some cases."
"We also advocate support for Amendment No 44, which seeks to clarify that onboard equipment is not compulsory."
"Finally, let us all make it clear that if we adopt this report tomorrow we are not forcing Member State or local authority to charge motorists or hauliers."
"We are reasonably and sensibly seeking to ensure compatibility between schemes."
"Mr President, Commissioner, first of all, I wish to congratulate Mrs Sommer on the excellent report she has presented and which I fully support."
"Like the rapporteur, I believe that the Commission proposal must contribute to the smoother operation of the internal market."
"From the users’ point of view, then, the directive could facilitate toll charging in the various Member States, eliminating waiting times and consequently increasing capacities for infrastructure use."
"The current system, specifically as regards international freight hauliers, who might be obliged to acquire separate devices, each with its own contract and to install them in their vehicles, makes no sense at all."
"I wish, however, to make a few observations on some points that I feel are relevant and to which, I believe, this House must pay particular attention."
"My first point concerns the need to make it perfectly clear that the directive does not affect Member States’ freedom to decide on their own system of infrastructure charging for roads."
"The directive only covers the charging system and does not include road-charging policy as such."
"Furthermore, and as regards the timetable for interoperability, I share the rapporteur’s view that this should start on 1 January 2007, because this date would guarantee sufficient and necessary time for the industry and those managing infrastructures to define and install equipment that meets the new standards."
"Lastly, I wish to emphasise that the directive must not ignore essential elements on which its success depends. These are: creating awareness-raising activities for users as regards technological developments, implementing legal procedures for monitoring and preventing fraud, analysing types of compensation for investments that have been made or which are being made by operators in parallel technological, financial or commercial processes whose viability is threatened by the requirement to switch to the new system."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, having removed the structural defect in the Commission proposal, by which I mean the requirement that systems be interoperable before they are abolished, the report points in a direction with which we can all agree, and for that thanks are due to the rapporteur."
"Our essential need is for a toll system that is compatible right across Europe and built to a standard that will last into the future."
"Europe has, since the 1990s, seen the introduction of a multitude of different toll systems, all stitched together in a patchwork, and there would be many more patches were it not for this directive."
"The directive is intended to make it possible, in future, to get right across Europe with one technological item and one contract, and what that means is that the systems will have to be compatible by 2007."
"Looking further ahead, it recommends the introduction of a satellite-based toll system and, at the same time, calls on the Commission to submit, by 2009, a strategy for the conversion of the services."
"That was what our group had demanded, and I am glad that we have the rapporteur’s backing in this."
"Why are we recommending a satellite-based toll system?"
"We do so because it has the potential to add value to our transport policy."
"If I might use a rather laboured analogy, I do not buy a typewriter and then a computer if I am going to be putting my documents on the Internet."
"A satellite-based toll system also promises more for the future, firstly, because it can – provided that the political will is present – provide comprehensive and cross-border coverage of vehicles, and, secondly, because – as my colleague Mr Swoboda said – it provides a basis on which future traffic flows can be directed and on which different modes of transport can be logistically interlinked."
"Thirdly, it will be possible to use it in combination with mobile communications technology as a means towards introducing other services, such as, for example, rapid help in the event of accidents, local hazard warnings and the tracking of dangerous goods, to name but a few."
"Perhaps the Commission should have put greater emphasis on these technical considerations."
"I would be happy if we could complete this directive within the life of this Parliament; after first reading would be best of all."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have, in Europe, been talking for over twenty years in terms of what we call the new approach."
"Now we have another buzzword: the European Union is no longer to regulate every detail of everything, but it is to concentrate primarily on the interoperability of systems."
"Unfortunately, though, we often do not adhere to this principle, and that is the problem in this instance, but not with the directive itself, of which there has already been much criticism."
"The Commission has proposed a system for the future, admittedly one whose target date is a long way in the distance."
"As the Commissioner said, the only thing is that it probably will not work, and that is not what we want."
"We need workable systems – note the plural – that must be in place, that must work, and must be interoperable."
"I have nothing against satellite technology, and there is much to be said for it, but not when it is like this."
"Is the collapse in Germany not enough for us?"
"What we need right now is technological neutrality, and we will carry on needing it for a number of years."
"Looked at from that angle, we must warmly thank our rapporteur, Mrs Sommer, for, at an early stage – which was the right one – steering the committee’s discussions in the direction that we need, concentrating on the need to guarantee interoperability, above all, too, on making things simpler for the user, and on ensuring that the system can work."
"That leads me also to warmly thank Mr Turmes, who was right to warn us against losing our grip on reality when dealing with the topic of tolls and toll systems."
"When he started speaking, it almost sounded as if he were already talking about ecopoints, which are the next item on the agenda, but I can agree with him on that and also on what he has said on this item for discussion: we should not get airborne over this."
"Let us ensure that there are workable systems for our transport system as a whole, or else we may end up organising some things better, but we will be wrecking many more."
"Mr President, as my colleague Mr Watts has said, we very much support the principle of interoperability of road charging schemes across Europe, but I particularly want to talk about London."
"As an MEP representing London, I obviously have concerns about the way that this report may affect the very successful congestion charge scheme that has been operating in London for the past year or so."
"We do not want to jeopardise that scheme in any way and we now have enough assurances from the Commission that our concerns will be taken into account."
"However, there are two things I still want to talk about."
"One is that, at the moment, the London scheme does not use microwave technology, but may well move towards doing that."
"This would require onboard units and will bring the scheme very much under this directive."
"If we are then required to move to some kind of satellite system, that really would cause enormous problems, because satellite systems are not designed for urban environments and there would be difficulties of visibility – of actually seeing traffic in the way that is required."
"There is also the matter of barriers and, obviously, a city requires a barrier-free environment."
"So, if we move to satellite technology there could be very real technical problems in operating it, not only in London but also in other urban environments which may introduce similar schemes."
"So we are extremely concerned about this and the effects that this directive might have on what is still a new scheme in London but one that has been extremely successful."
"The London congestion charge has reduced significantly the amount of traffic going into the centre, with the obvious benefits for the environment, etc. Therefore, I hope we will get the assurances that we are seeking."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, road tolls are never popular, especially if one is paying them oneself, but they are a fact of life in today’s Europe all the same."
"They are necessary."
"It is just a question of how we can minimise the bother they cause and the costs that result."
"Various systems have now been introduced at local and national level, but they are not compatible."
"Obviously, to avoid problems, they have to be harmonised."
"The excellent aim of this Commission proposal is that each and everyone should have just one contract and every vehicle just one box, for the internal market to function properly."
"This is only reasonable."
"I agree with Mrs Sommer that the interoperability of road tolls is the objective, rather than the means of achieving it."
"I would disagree somewhat with the Commission: in my opinion, we need to be more flexible as far as local authorities are concerned, because then good, viable schemes already in operation would not have to be scrapped just because satellite systems are being adopted too rapidly."
"The fact that the systems should be mutually functional is the goal, not that they should work using microwaves or any other waves."
"That is why it is sufficient that general requirements should be determined to achieve the basic object of the directive, which is the interoperability of the systems."
"That is crucial."
"A dynamic Europe needs road transport."
"An ever more affluent Europe needs mobility."
"Good though it might be that we standardise these systems, we must also make sure that we keep costs at a reasonable level and do not voluntarily place ourselves in a straitjacket."
"– Thank you, Mr President;"
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to thank the rapporteur for the work she has done and also the willingness to engage in dialogue that she has constantly demonstrated while dealing with a portfolio that certainly was not an easy one."
"It is of course tempting to talk about tolls as if they were quite self-explanatory, for there are so many aspects to them."
"The regulation they provide can benefit the environment; they can promote safety; they also produce income, and one can of course have exciting discussions about what is to be done with it."
"I believe, though, that we would be ill-advised to confuse the two issues, as we will have the opportunity to discuss the first of them later on, so let us concentrate on the technology."
"Past experience has taught us that discussing this is extremely useful."
"We have ourselves seen the chaos that can result if each country insists on using its own recipe for technology, and Toll Collect in Germany was a good example of that."
"I do not believe that monopolies provide the answer in this area; we should simply aim to have good technology, and I believe that the Commission proposal and what the rapporteur has suggested are going the right way about achieving this."
"The ‘one contract per user’ principle is, I believe, desirable and will remain so."
"Unlike Mrs Honeyball and Mr Watts, I do not live in London, but at a distance of seven kilometres from two countries, and I can tell you that it would be a nightmare for HGV drivers among others if they had to reckon on needing to install in their vehicles a different monitoring system for each country."
"That is not on, and I believe that we should, in future, outlaw it."
"Secondly, the technology should not be too precisely specified, but should, quite simply, be reliable, efficient and compatible; in other words, its interoperability must be guaranteed."
"Past experience has shown us what we have coming to us if these criteria are not met."
"In conclusion, then, I hope that, whatever system is introduced, we will not repeat the experience we have had only recently."
"Haulage operators sacrificed thousands of working hours in installing systems, only for a country and a region to then decide to do without them."
"There is neither point nor purpose to such an exercise, which, I believe, completely fails to achieve something that I regard as a very good thing."
"– Mr President, the Commission proposal deserves Parliament’s support."
"It should be our mission to encourage the taking of still greater steps, but the committee’s report is a disappointment as far as that is concerned."
"Firstly, the committee considers the issue from many angles but does not question the fact that the system only applies to commercial transport."
"Secondly, the committee still seems to think that road tolls should cover the costs of road maintenance."
"Thirdly, with the approach the committee is proposing the EU will not achieve sufficient lift-off as far as sustainable development is concerned."
"I now want to go into rather more detail regarding these three factors."
"In the adoption of road toll systems one has to be wary of a situation where an increase in private transport completely cancels out the benefit of a reduction in commercial transport."
"The only sustainable solution is for the system to apply to all road transport in the same way right from the start."
"This solution is not unfair to private motorists because satellite positioning equipment is rapidly becoming more and more common in cars."
"There will be a significant proportion of them by 2008 when the European Galileo system becomes operational."
"It is essential to take the external costs of traffic into account so that with any road toll imposed the marginal cost matches the ceiling amount charged."
"In this way traffic would not have to pay the present external cost, but one based on a new balanced charge that reflects the volume of traffic."
"What should therefore be regarded as the prime objective is that the volume of traffic on a route or in a zone where charges apply is at an optimal level at different times and that what constitutes that optimal level is determined by market mechanisms."
"In my view these conditions will be met most easily with satellite positioning systems and that is why we should venture to agree, as the Commission has proposed, to adopt this technology promptly as a basis for a European system."
"In this way bringing technology onto the market will also mean large-scale benefits that transport companies above all will enjoy in terms of decreasing costs."
"I imagine people are muttering to themselves about the inadequacy of legislative powers."
"I would remind them, however, of the ever greater part traffic plays as a producer of carbon dioxide emissions."
"Although the car industry, with EU support, has done and is doing important work to develop low emission vehicles there is good reason to introduce road toll systems specifically to reduce emissions."
"I refer to Article 174 of the Treaty on European Union."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, I agree with the rapporteur that it is not the legislator’s task to impose on the market a particular technology to the exclusion of all others, but, at the end of the day, our interest is in being able, one day, to use the best of the toll charging systems on offer in Europe."
"Microwave technology is in competition with satellite positioning and mobile communications, and important amendments now indicate its advantages in comparison with other systems."
"To be sure, there are parallel systems over stretches of road, and perhaps not only for a transitional period, but the simple fact is that progressive conversion to satellite positioning and mobile communications technology offers a more realistic prospect of achieving interoperability and hence guaranteeing the absence of problems with road traffic by means of a working system of toll collection and without excessively expensive investments in infrastructure."
"We have already heard how, in the sphere of satellite positioning the European satellite navigation system Galileo, which is currently under construction, will, from 2008 onwards, provide information of superior quality to that provided by the present-day GPS and will be ideally suited to telematics services in road traffic."
"This is about using the opportunities opened up to us by Galileo in the area of toll charging."
"Not in any way, though, is this about using toll-collecting technology as a means of justifying the extension of Galileo."
"Let us not make the mistake of taking the disaster that befell the introduction of German lorry tolls as a reason not to give toll charging by satellite a chance."
"That would be to throw the baby out with the bathwater."
"It does not follow that there has to be repetition of the financial failures, bad luck and accidents that attended the introduction of the German HGV tolls, so let us keep our cool."
"As I have said, I do not favour the mandatory introduction of satellite-based toll charging systems, but I do have confidence that, at the end of the day, the best system will prevail on the market, for that is what is demanded by the interests of the matter in hand."
". – Mr President, I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Sommer, for the wonderful work she has done, and express my gratitude for the discussions and progress which have resulted from the joint work of the three institutions with a view to achieving approval at first reading, because I believe that the objections we had in relation to some of the points which had been adopted in the first report of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism have been entirely altered by means of certain compromise amendments which are acceptable to the Commission and which I also believe will be acceptable to the Council when the time comes."
"I would like to point out that tomorrow, with the ratification by this plenary of the rapporteur’s suggestions, we may see the approval by the Council of Parliament’s proposal, which – I would insist – the Commission could accept in this form."
"Furthermore, I would like to reply briefly to some of the concerns expressed by the honourable Members."
"Firstly, with regard to the issue of subsidiarity, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to tell you that this is guaranteed."
"What we are essentially proposing is a single legal contract, which allows for a payment for the use of an infrastructure, wherever that use takes place, at the place of origin, from the user's current account."
"In other words, for example, just as the charges for the use of a mobile phone or a credit card in any part of the European Union are subsequently charged to our bank accounts, we are trying to create a similar situation for road tolls: that the use of an infrastructure in a third country is charged to our bank account."
"This will have to be done by means of contracts and with sufficient guarantees, as in the sectors I have mentioned as examples."
"In order to be able to do that not only do we need a single contract but also we need to make progress in order to take full advantage of these conditions in relation to the interoperability and compatibility of systems."
"I must say that, despite the fact that Mrs Sommer and certain other speakers have said that it is premature to commit ourselves now to a system – such as the satellite system, which has not been fully tested – and that I believe we could perhaps have made more progress, the final result of the debate we have held is positive."
"I also believe that a strong recommendation for the future in favour of the Galileo system sends an appropriate message to the whole sector which is going to invest, which is investing or intends to implement the Galileo system and, therefore, we are providing support for the Galileo system – which is a European system – with the necessary flexibility so that each country can, nevertheless, take the corresponding measures, provided that they are compatible and interoperable, although there may possibly be other solutions in the event that there are, for example, problems relating to investments, the repayment of investments, etc."
"To reply very briefly to the question from Mr Swoboda on the negotiations with the United States, I would like to take this opportunity to say that they are moving ahead very positively."
"In recent times, in relation to the problem of overlapping of frequencies, we have now fully resolved – in a way which is satisfactory to both parties – the overlapping of code M of the American GPS – which is the maximum security code – with our own signal – the closed security signal, reserved for public authorities within the Galileo system – and we have found formulae which have in no way prejudiced the quality of the Galileo system and which at the same time offer the security guarantees called for by the United States."
"It remains for us to resolve the overlapping which occurs – according to the Americans – between our open signal and one of their signals."
"We have made it very clear that what we cannot accept is the United States’ initial proposal – which means moving from 1 5 1 5 (which is what we would like) to 1 1 (the Americans’ preference) – because we believe the quality of our service would be greatly reduced."
"Furthermore, we believe that on 1 5 we do not create security problems for the American security system."
"In any event, we are bringing these discussions to an end, but I hope, ladies and gentlemen, that no greater difficulties arise and that we will have a complete solution, since almost all the issues have practically been resolved, something I am extremely happy about."
"To this we should add the interest expressed by countries such as China, India, Brazil and other third countries in participating in this project."
"The next issue I would like to mention very briefly is the case of London, although we could consider other cities."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the field in which we demand interoperability and compatibility does not apply to the London toll, amongst other reasons, firstly, because it is a local area, which does not fall within our competences and above all because in London no equipment is installed."
"Furthermore, it is pointed out that it would not be applied in cases in which the intended objective implies an excessive or unbalanced cost."
"Mr President, I will end by saying that, for the sake of conciseness and in order to ensure precision in an area of a highly technical nature, we believe that we should partially revise the wording – not the substance – of Amendments Nos 2, 14, 18 and 32."
"Apart from that, Mr President, it only remains for me to thank Mrs Sommer for her wonderful work and the honourable Members for your cooperation and to sum up by saying that this is the technological system which later on will allow us to appropriately apply the Eurovignette Directive."
"Today we are not talking about tolls as such, but of methods for charging tolls more simply, which create fewer problems for the users and which facilitate the operation of the internal market."
"Thank you, Madam Commissioner and Vice-President."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"The next item is the report (A5-0475/2003) by Mr Paolo Costa on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council regulation establishing a transitional points system applicable to heavy goods vehicles travelling through Austria for 2004 within the framework of a sustainable transport policy (PE-CONS 3689/2003 – C5-0562/2003 – 2001/0310(COD))."
". – Mr President, the rapporteur, Mr Paolo Costa, has asked me to deputise for him because the agenda of the session has changed and he had to be in Italy."
"The conciliation procedure for the Costa report on lorries in transit through Austria was extremely difficult and demoralising, if you like, for all of us who were involved, because this is an arrangement which concerns a specific Member State, namely Austria."
"There were Members, Austrian members, who – quite understandably in my opinion – had every reason to have an acute awareness of the issues we were debating, because the Austrian people had, and continue to have, a particular awareness of this specific issue, which was why, moreover, the relevant protocol was drawn up when Austria acceded to the European Union in 1995."
"However, these provisions have expired, which is why the European Parliament took the view even at first reading that 2006 should be the last year during which there should be specific arrangements for Austria, especially as there has been an improvement as regards environmental protection, which has also been recorded in the statistics given to us by the Commission."
"As you know, there were differences of opinion between Parliament and the Council."
"On the one hand, Parliament maintained that the measures granting Austria beneficial treatment should be limited solely to the Alpine area, while on the other hand the Council maintained that they should apply to the whole of Austria."
"And then, as regards the lorries which should or should not pass through, Parliament again took the view that more lorries should pass through."
"The views of the two institutions moved closer together during the conciliation procedure."
"We accepted the Council's view that the special measures should apply to the whole of the Austrian state, while the Council moved closer to Parliament's view, meaning that some of the lorries which the Council proposed should not pass through or should pass through with quotas, will now pass through freely; this was the logic behind Parliament's proposals and it only concerns some, not all, of the lorries."
"Finally, there was one issue, in that the number of lorries subject to quotas was limited, that is, how many eco-points should be available, and on this point Parliament, in a demonstration of solidarity with Austria and our honourable Austrian friends, called for the total number of eco-points to be limited by a considerable percentage."
"Finally, this opinion on the part of Parliament was accepted by the Council and that is how we arrived at the result of the conciliation."
"Our honourable Austrian friends voted against it because they considered the measures excessively strict for Austria, while there were other honourable Members, such as Mr Ferber from Bavaria, who considered that the result of the conciliation was excessively lenient for Austria and he therefore voted against it as well."
"I have to say, both as a member of the conciliation committee and as representative of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, that the result was balanced, the agreement which we reached was ultimately a good agreement and this is, if you like, also proven by the fact that the various directly interested parties voted against it, some because they considered the measures lenient and others because they considered them strict."
"In all events, after such protracted and difficult negotiations, I cannot but recommend today to all the honourable Members, Mr President, that they vote in favour of the result which we achieved in the conciliation procedure, because these measures must apply until the cut-off date in 2006."
"If, in the meantime, there is progress on the Eurovignette, the relevant agreement will also apply in the case of Austria."
"Anyway, from 2006 onwards, the same will also apply to Austria as applies to the other European countries, the basic reason being that, according to the statistics at least, there has been an improvement in the environmental indicators, to which improvements in the lorry fleet have made a decisive contribution."
"So there has been progress in the environmental performance of the lorries which pass through Austria."
"Mr President, we the Group of the European People's Party will vote by a large majority in favour of the result of the conciliation procedure."
"I am, of course, aware that some members are not happy."
"To our honourable Austrian friends in particular, I want to say that we took very serious account of their comments and of the comments of the Austrian Government, which fought a very hard battle to support the Austrian positions."
"However, we could go no further. The same applies to the honourable Members from the other political groups."
"We could not move any closer to the Austrian positions, because then we would have had problems with Members from other representations."
"So we have a good result, as good as it could be and, for that reason, I think that it will be approved at the vote by a large majority of Members."
"Let me point out to you, Mr Martin, that I am obliged by Rule 123 of the Rules of Procedure to call you to order."
"I will also point out to you that, should you repeat your actions and thus oblige me to do so again, a note will be made to that effect in the Minutes of the sitting."
"If this warning is of no effect, then I will, with regret, have to order you from the Chamber, so I ask you to desist from your disorderly conduct."
"– Mr President, I did it because I was, until this morning, on the list of speakers, and was then ‘deselected’ by the parliamentary business manager of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, thus being deprived of the right to speak."
"For the time that I would have spoken, I wanted to show, symbolically at any rate, what an independent in this House can stand for, even when someone from his own group prevents him from speaking."
"I do, though, thank you for your understanding, Mr President."
"Mr Martin, that is of course a matter for your group alone, and has nothing to do with this House."
"Where that is concerned, you will have to call your group’s management to order."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to thank Parliament and the Conciliation Committee for the work they have done on the proposed extension of the ecopoints system."
"I would like in particular to thank Mr Imbeni and the rapporteur, Mr Costa, as well as the Council, for the efforts they have made over all this time in order to find a solution to the problem, holding discussions with the Council in order to reach an agreement."
"I would like to say very clearly, so that there may be no doubt, that the Commission supports this compromise."
"I know that the Austrian authorities and Members believe it to be insufficient, and I understand that there may be particular sensitivity, since it is true that we are talking about transit via Austria."
"But I would like to say once again, ladies and gentlemen, that this compromise improves the conditions for traffic via Austria, for the simple reason that Protocol 9 of the Act of Accession of Austria to the European Union lays down, in Article 11(5), that, at the end of a series of extensions – all of which have been completed – the Community acquis in its entirety will be applicable."
"The last of these extensions has already been adopted and expires on the 31st of this month."
"Therefore, if this compromise is not approved, the principles of free movement would dictate that all the lorries which travel within the rest of the European Union would also be able to travel within Austria."
"We are all aware of the special sensitivity of this issue and we have all made an effort to achieve it."
"I would insist once again that I believe that the Austrian authorities, Members of Parliament, and also, very possibly, citizens – since this is an issue which the whole of Austria is very sensitive to – would have liked even greater protection, but I believe that by means of this transitional system we are managing to maintain, despite everything, a situation of privilege – let us make this very clear – for the sake of Austria’s environmental protection."
"Effectively, we are prohibiting the transit of the most polluting lorries through that country; lorries which, nevertheless, can travel – and are going to continue to travel – throughout the rest of the European Union."
"In other words, we are diverting the most polluting lorries to other routes and only allowing the cleanest lorries to cross Austria."
"I believe this is an example of European solidarity which, although it may seem to you insufficient, I would insist is a very important step, because we are continuing to maintain the system of points which, as well as removing the most polluting lorries, also restricts the traffic of lorries with an intermediate level of pollution, so that only the most modern and efficient lorries can travel freely through Austria."
"I would therefore insist that all the most polluting and least efficient lorries will be travelling throughout the rest of the European Union."
"It is crucial that Parliament votes for it today, since the current system expires on 31 December."
"Nevertheless, operators will stop having ecopoints from 1 January 2004 and it is therefore necessary to adopt a decision with regard to the immediate application of the future provisional points system and allow the circulation of lorries in transit through Austria in a clear and decisive manner, with those limitations which, once again, I am pointing out."
"I am well aware that this is not the solution; that the solution must be sought by means of the extremely urgent adoption of the Eurovignette system."
"Today we have adopted the system of electronic road tolls, which comprises the technical elements which will facilitate the establishment of a Eurovignette system and, if we all manage to agree and show flexibility, we could adopt the Eurovignette over the next three or four months, with this same Parliament and this same Commission, during the Irish Presidency."
"We in the Commission are going to make every necessary effort to achieve this objective, and I hope that Mr Cocilovo and this Parliament will continue working as it has done up till now in order to achieve it."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I feel that what Mr Hatzidakis said, not least on behalf of the rapporteur, has clearly explained the technical content of this difficult conciliation and I feel that the Commissioner’s words, with which I agree, have clearly illustrated the political content of this extremely complex, extremely complicated decision, which it is difficult to describe in any other way."
"Taking on board the difficulties – which we understand although we cannot justify the demands – of the Austrian people, we have decided to grant another privilege – because that is what it is, as the Commissioner said – and extend it to a particularly sensitive area such as the Alpine region and to the entire Austrian territory – making it a twofold privilege – and, rather than limiting it to 2004 and then maybe seeing what to do in 2005-2006, we have automatically extended it to 2006."
"This is the subject of the agreement that we are now ready to support, fully aware that we are going beyond the call of duty."
"We also believe, however, that, for the good and the preservation of the very sense of European Community, it is right that we make this sacrifice."
"Any other objections would therefore be inappropriate."
"Overall, a compromise has been achieved, which is excellent and the best compromise possible for it strikes a balance between the right to mobility and respect for the environment: it takes a gradual approach, it punishes what might be called the improper behaviour of those who fail to renew their HGV fleets while rewarding those who do behave properly, with due respect for the specific conditions and sensitivity of a region."
"If anyone wants to pull out ofthis compromise, they are free to do so, but they would, without a doubt, be making a mistake: this is the best decision that could have been made and it must therefore be supported."
"Mr President, I feel that Mr Hatzidakis’ joke about the laborious nature of the task for all the Members of Parliament is the most concise, and also the best description of the work that has been carried out."
"It was a difficult task in that we were working on a temporary basis with a Council that was often careless, heedless and given to putting off addressing or resolving issues until the last minute."
"In conciliation, a balance was struck which made sense to all the institutions."
"It is a balance between two requirements, which I would like to set out: on the one hand, the need to ensure the free movement of goods and compliance with Treaty, and, on the other – something to which Parliament, just like Austria, attaches great importance – the need to protect the environment and people’s health."
"That means striving for sustainable development which, to address the problem earlier on in the process of pollution, must be achieved through intermodality, the development of rail tunnels and favouring rail transport over lorries."
"In its wisdom, Parliament steered clear of simplistic solutions which certain elements with extreme views advocated in the debate: those defending carriers, on the one hand, and those defending the environment and health, on the other."
"That is not the way things are as Mr Lisi said too."
"The conciliation conclusions appear to highlight a number of points which give great consideration to the needs of Austria, first and foremost the fact that the last extension, which was set to end definitively at 31 December 2003, has been superseded by another extension which will take us up to the end of 2006."
"The Commissioner pointed out that, while the most polluting lorries will continue to circulate throughout Europe, Austria will be preserved from a situation which other countries continue to suffer."
"As Austria has requested, the application of this regulation and of the ecopoint system has been extended to the whole of the country of Austria, not just the Alpine passes; above all, the option of quotas, decided on at the proposal of the Commission, which has done an excellent job, is the option which comes closest to meeting Austria’s demands."
"The Commission is to be commended for its work and Parliament is to be commended for the balance it has displayed in performing this difficult task."
"We are told that Austria wishes to stop benefiting from the exception made for it thus far."
"We hope that this does not happen and that due consideration is given to the excellent quality of Parliament’s work."
"For these reasons, after two years of work, I can inform you that our group will vote for the conclusions reached in conciliation."
"– Mr President, it was not easy to reach agreement on the ecopoints."
"I should like to thank my fellow MEP, Mr Costa, for his efforts in this area and also his predecessor as Chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, Mr Caveri, who has also worked hard on this."
"Indeed, a great deal of energy went into striking a compromise and into changing the transitional system that was put in place upon Austria’s accession, to a more general system."
"No matter how much I appreciate Austria’s specific problems and the way in which that country is trying to find an answer to them, I do believe that it is impossible for any one Member State to have a permanent derogation in this field."
"It is clear, though, that there should be a balance between general environmental problems and the geographic situation in Austria on the one hand, and the free movement of goods, on the other."
"I do not believe that the balance between those two elements is easy."
"We could peddle very fine theories on this subject, but in practice, after all, tough decisions sometimes need to be taken."
"I think it extremely important that we should also take a long-term view and try to draft a regulation for traffic across the Alps in general."
"We should also examine this problem in the context of the Cocilovo report on the Eurovignette."
"In any case, we regard the agreement that was reached in conciliation as an acceptable one."
"My group will endorse it."
"I am slightly worried, though, by the statements that the Austrian minister made following conciliation."
"I think that statements of that kind are more likely to complicate matters than to contribute to a solution."
"– Mr President, we now have a result from the Conciliation Committee concerning transit through Austria."
"I am speaking on behalf of my group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left."
"The group is opposed to this compromise because it would mean a general deterioration of the environment."
"As I myself read the proposal, however, it is a useful compromise in which Parliament has had a very large proportion of its wishes met."
"An acceptable balance has been found between consideration for the environment and respect for the free exchange of goods."
"The proposal means that the ecopoint system can continue throughout 2004, with the option of extending it both in 2005 and 2006."
"By that time, we shall hopefully at long last have achieved an overall system of road tolls for the whole of the EU."
"Before we reach that point, however, there are still a number of problems of which both opponents and supporters of the compromise are required to take account with regard to Austria."
"If we are finally to get to grips with the problem of pollution, we have to think along different, and new, lines."
"We must move transported goods off the roads and onto the railways."
"As matters appear right now, there is not much to indicate that there is sufficient will to increase capacity but, as with everything else in the world, you do not get something for nothing."
"This means that the Austrians are obliged to concentrate upon railway capacity through Austria."
"As I say, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left is opposed to the proposal by the Conciliation Committee, but I personally shall vote in favour of it."
"I should also like to say to the fellow MEP of mine who put on a demonstration in this House that I think it splendid that he has already begun his election campaign, but he would do better to conduct his demonstration at home in Austria instead of here in Parliament, in which case he and his vacuous demonstration would not, of course, be photographed, however."
"Thank you, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in Austria the Conciliation Committee’s decision was received with anger and dismay by the government, Parliament, the entire population, by all parties and all the media."
"There can be no talk of electioneering here."
"I believe we could fill the empty chairs in this room thousands of times over today with people wanting to tell you of their anger and consternation."
"It is the first time in the Union’s legal history that the vital interests of a Member State have been treated in this way."
"Many of you speak of forbearance – think about the word: Austria is treated with forbearance, privileges are granted, prerogatives are extended."
"Many of you who speak in such terms seem to believe we built the Alps out of spite and we filled our countryside with the continent’s most sensitive plants so that we can stir up national hysteria."
"What people in Austria feel is that there is a tremendous danger, and it does not involve only Austrian interests."
"It is the danger that the right to the free movement of goods, with which we all agree, is becoming a religious right violating the human right to health and protection of the environment and that we are only taking accompanying measures but not guaranteeing people their basic right to health and environment."
"I will not comment further on this never-ending story with its pitiful outcome."
"But what you are doing today, Mr President, is raising a question of legal policy."
"You are turning an environmental conflict, an ecological disaster, into a legal conflict that is unique in history."
"Austria does not want that solution."
"Nobody wants it."
"Do you really want to force this regulation on us against this country’s will, a regulation that is eyewash, camouflage, and which Austria will not enforce?"
"Is that really your intention?"
"– Mr President, after that inspired effort by one of our Austrian MEPs, I should get back to earth, although I do understand the sentiments involved."
"On 31 December next, the exceptional ecopoints agreement expires."
"Much of our time this year has been taken up by the question of whether, and if so, how, this system should be followed up."
"The report at first and second reading clearly addressed this issue."
"Parliament wanted nothing but a transitional system from the current ecopoints system to a situation in which foreign lorries would also gain free transit through Austria."
"This, however, did not appear to be what Austria had in mind."
"The Council initially went along with this."
"Now that we have reached the end of conciliation, it looks like the Council and Parliament are essentially in agreement after all."
"The compromise embraces a regime in which the most polluting vehicles are barred and clean ones encouraged, while the available number of points are deducted annually."
"This is a realistic balance in the light of the conflict between the need to protect the Alpine region – which is indeed vulnerable – and the principle of the free movement of goods – which is, after all, a reality in the European Union."
"That is why we were bitterly disappointed when Austria announced its intention to abolish the ecopoints system as of 1 January 2004."
"In this debate, I should like to make three appeals."
"First of all, to Austria, that it may realise the long-standing mutual hostilities its attitude could possibly bring about."
"Unnecessary internal irritation is far from constructive."
"Secondly, I should like to urge the Commission to carefully monitor the admissibility of potential Austrian actions which may jeopardise the free movement of goods."
"Thirdly, I should like to call on my fellow MEPs to review the Eurovignette directive without delay."
"In its new form, it could provide an answer to the current gridlock."
"I am pleased with the compromise that has been struck with the Council, and we therefore warmly support it."
"Mr President, tomorrow we shall be voting on a report that no longer deals with the original problem, namely the reduction of atmospheric pollutants by means of a qualitative and quantitative restriction on transit traffic through Austria."
"The outcome of the Conciliation Committee is that far more ecopoints are available for vehicles remaining in the ecopoint system than are actually required."
"The upshot is that this system in effect no longer sets any limits on transit traffic through Austria and is quite simply pointless."
"Moreover, Austria is required to introduce an expensive counting system that is virtually unfeasible technically and brings only expense and no ecological benefits."
"In view of this, the fact that the arrangement will apply for three years and not only for the Alpine passes but for the whole of Austria is completely irrelevant."
"To agree to this arrangement would be sheer and utter nonsense and in the end will damage the standing of this House."
"I therefore ask you to reject the report tomorrow."
"It would land on the list of senseless decisions and that list is already long enough."
"With every yes vote on this report we, the European Parliament, will be making ourselves a mockery six months before the elections."
"The discussion and resolution on the Costa report is a black day for one Member State, namely Austria."
"Our country and its citizens are being ridden over roughshod in the most literal sense of the word, regardless."
"But it is not a black day only for Austria; with this subject the European Parliament, too, is playing with its reputation and is gambling it away here as a representative of citizens and environmental interests, playing into the hands of the noise and exhaust lobby."
"It was after all the European Parliament that amended the Commission’s original legislative proposal by a large majority and pushed its position through."
"The outcome of the conciliation procedure is that there are no more controls on transit traffic through Austria."
"There are no more limits on the environmental damage and no more protection for the local people."
"‘Road clear for free lorries’ is the order of the day."
"If, as some have said, that is a concession for Austria, I can only say: God save us from friends like that!"
"Under these circumstances, there is no question but that the Austrians will reject this proposed regulation."
"We ask those of our fellow Members who are concerned for the European Parliament’s reputation as an institution that is close to the citizens and friendly to the environment to support us in this."
"However the vote goes, the problems will not be solved."
"The Republic of Austria sees great difficulties in implementing what is to apply in future and the citizens will find the new rules hard to live with."
"I can see one positive aspect to this whole development: next year we shall be debating the infrastructure charging directive here."
"It will apply for the whole of Austria."
"It will no longer be about special favours for one country and its citizens."
"Then we shall see how this Parliament and its Members will vote: as friends of the citizens and the environment or the way the noise and exhaust lobby wants."
"Europe’s voters will express their gratitude on 13 June."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I stand here as an Austrian Member of Parliament, but above all as someone who has always stood up for the environment and as a Vienna city councillor with responsibility for transport who believed that economic and traffic growth should not come at the expense of the environment and health."
"Perhaps we have sometimes presented the transit rules as an Austrian privilege or a special arrangement for Austria."
"It was a special arrangement, but one with a particular pioneering function for Europe as a whole."
"This transit rule has brought about a change in the heavy goods vehicle fleet in the whole of Europe."
"It has been modernised, it has been made, if you like, more ecological, that is more friendly to the environment."
"That is the very thing that is now being prematurely ended."
"The rapporteur, who is unfortunately not present – it is interesting that this is the second time we have discussed the ecopoint system here without the rapporteur present; his predecessor was not present either; which shows how seriously it is sometimes taken – at least at one stage made a proposal that still gave an incentive to change."
"But then it disappeared again."
"The ‘transitional system’ we now have no longer contains any incentive to change over from more environmentally harmful to more environmentally friendly lorries."
"And that is the greatest drawback, the biggest problem we in Austria have with this system."
"Reference is always being made to the infrastructure charging directive."
"But I can already hear the arguments over that directive."
"If we look at Mr Cocilovo’s proposal, it is clear that he does not even want what the Commission is proposing."
"We are put off from one proposal to the next."
"Rather than do that, we should make a general rule."
"I am grateful for the rule, but I do not think it is sufficient."
"But when this Parliament and certain groups and certain Members in particular cut it back even more and do not want even to accept the Commission’s proposal for a minor diversion from road to rail, then in my opinion there is no longer much point to it."
"That is my position."
"To conclude, I am asking my fellow Members to reject it tomorrow because it is a sham."
"I ask my fellow Members to really think again and to say No to a solution that is only pretending to be one."
"Austria needs a real solution and that is not what we have here."
"I hope we shall get more support over the infrastructure charging directive than we have had in this case."
"– Mr President, although progress has been made in the negotiations, I certainly do not think that it is enough."
"We asked for protection for the entire Austrian region, and that has been accepted."
"The amendment concerning the most polluting lorries – for environmentally-friendly lorries do not exist – has been adopted."
"That is a ."
"Noise aspects have not been taken into consideration."
"In short, we are left with a raft of problems."
"I have pointed out before, right through this procedure – first reading, second reading, previous debates – that we are being faced with a problem of a democratic nature, a point also made by my neighbour."
"It is for this reason that Austria regards the regulation as unacceptable."
"Austria has consequently noted that, in the next couple of years, partly caused by the accession countries, transport through Austria could well double, if not quadruple."
"Ultimately, it decided unilaterally to abolish the ecopoints system on 31 December."
"As this confronts us with the question of what we will do next, I would ask the Commissioner how she sees things developing in the Council on 22 December."
"After all, if Austria stands by its view, I do not know what we should do with this decision."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, points in life are generally good things, but these points are unfortunately incongruous."
"Our esteemed fellow Member, Mr Swoboda, just said that Austria wants more."
"All my sympathies are with the Austrians but, ladies and gentlemen, we are not in Vienna, in the Austrian parliament: we are in the European Parliament!"
"Can we ask ourselves the question as to whether Europe wants more?"
"Of course we can."
"If I had been born in a valley in Austria the problem would look just like it does from your point of view."
"But if we look at Europe as a whole, goods nevertheless travel between southern Europe and northern Europe."
"If they do not go the direct route, and if they do not go the cheapest possible route, they find their own route going some other way."
"Journeys become longer, there is more wear and tear to the roads, and there is more pollution."
"We have to accept that within the EU we must adhere to common rules, although it might be trendy – and I fully understand this – to hide protectionism behind ecopoints, but we must see the wood and not just the trees."
"We must see the bigger picture, as the saying goes, because if we transport goods in Europe the expensive way, so that pollution increases, who will pay?"
"It is always the end consumer that pays, that European earning just EUR 1 000 a month."
"What should the solution be?"
"A switch to lorries that generate as little pollution as possible, and obviously, if possible, increased used of the railways."
"We know in practice that they do not have sufficient capacity, but we shall do our best."
"We should have tax concessions to switch to the most modern lorries, but it is not appropriate to go one’s own way when we are building a common Europe."
"We must see that the overall benefit is one the private European citizen can share."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, why was it so difficult to reach an agreement?"
"Because we were faced with the task of finding a solution for a country that has not itself played a constructive part in the process."
"We have known what Austria does not want since the first reading here in the European Parliament on the Council decisions."
"To this day I do not know what Austria does want."
"I only know that again they do not want the compromise."
"So I ask for your understanding when I say that we have dealt with the matter quite seriously."
"How can we find a continuation of the ecopoint system that does justice to Austria’s legitimate interests if Austria does not take part in the decision-making process?"
"I can only say that I and my group agree with this compromise, even if the newspapers and the Parliament’s Minutes and press releases said I voted against it – I only voted against the number of points because I thought 6.9 million was rather too low."
"The Commission also had other calculations, but I was unable to get my way in the parliamentary delegation."
"I am therefore naturally for the compromise that was reached."
"When Mr Swoboda says we succeeded in introducing modern technology into Europe, he is right except for one country."
"I would like to reiterate that here at this point: because of the ecopoint system the lorries on the roads in southern Germany and northern Italy are more modern than the ones the Republic of Austria itself has licensed in its own country because it does not use the ecopoint system."
"Austria could have set a good example here with national rules."
"The directive on the introduction of Euro 3 and Euro 4 made provision for this, for using tax incentives to encourage modernisation of the HGV fleet."
"Then much of what has been said to us so emotionally today would have been easier to believe."
"I hope that the compromise will be given a large majority here tomorrow."
"After eight years of heated debate, a solution to the ecopoints issue is, at last, on the horizon."
"Indeed, the conciliation conclusions must be welcomed as restoring the balance in a situation whereby an instrument is being applied in Austria that holds back HGVs, which can travel freely everywhere else, including in the Alpine regions of France and Italy, without being subject to environmental tolls."
"I repeat: including in the Alpine regions, and here, I am addressing the Austrian Member who talked as if the Alps were an exclusively Austrian concern."
"Yet our problems are the same as those of which Austria complains and the environmental damage is the same."
"We are all in favour of protecting our mountains and countries from an excessive amount of HGV traffic, but it is not by moving the cause of pollution elsewhere that the problem can be solved."
"Nor is it any consolation that the environmental damage is paid for by extremely high tolls, the effect of which is to bring transport companies, especially the smallest and weakest, to their knees."
"Indeed, the amount of damage does not change, irrespective of the tolls."
"I agree with Mr Lisi: this solution is the best possible compromise and it ought to satisfy Austria too."
"It may be, however, that Austria had become too used to the situation, or, perhaps, not used to it enough, depending on which way you look at it."
"What, then, should we do at this juncture?"
"We need to start work resolutely on the trans-European networks, first and foremost the Brenner base tunnel and the high-speed four-track update of the Munich-Verona rail corridor, in order to provide a genuine rail alternative to road transport."
"However, we need to make things very clear to the companies managing intermodality."
"It is true that intermodality is currently being implemented in a fairly satisfactory way, but its prices, timetables and services need to be genuinely competitive and attractive – or rather, convincing – so as to draw all the traffic from the roads onto the railways."
"– Mr President, whilst I naturally sympathise with the position of Austria and the Austrian MEPs, I consider the free movement of persons and goods one of the European Union’s most important achievements."
"Upon accepting membership, Austria obtained a derogation which was due to lapse on 31 December of this year."
"By way of exception to the derogation, the Council and Parliament agreed in the conciliation meeting to extend the arrangement until the end of 2006."
"Against the background of the principle of free movement, this is not a wise decision."
"However, given the circumstances in Austria, I consider it to be an acceptable compromise between the principle of free movement and the protection of environmental interests."
"Indeed, I support the idea that there should always be room for sustainable transport."
"During the most recent conciliation meeting, Austria’s Transport Minister dampened my delight at the agreement."
"I consider refusing to carry out a freshly taken democratic decision to be wrong."
"Meanwhile, judging from the press reports with regard to last weekend’s European Council, this emotional statement appears to have become the Austrian Government’s position."
"Although I urge acceptance of the compromise that has been reached, I wonder what will be the implications of this decision, which is to be taken democratically."
"I should like to hear from the Commission in what way free transit through Austria can be guaranteed within the provisions of the agreement reached in the compromise on environmental pollution, if the Austrian Government chooses to ignore this agreement and assumes it can regulate the issue as it sees fit."
"Does the Commission see any scope for convincing the Austrian Government at this stage of the benefit of the agreement reached, one that, in any event, encourages the use of cleaner vehicles for transit?"
"Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, I would again like to straighten out something that has been said here."
"When I look at the Austrian Member who spoke of a basic right to health that we are all trampling under foot, yes, ladies and gentlemen, then I would like to call for an immediate stop to night journeys by freight trains, because people’s health is affected when railway trains travel through cities and villages at night making a tremendous amount of noise."
"Or I would call on the Austrians to close all their skiing areas, because I can assure you I can find enough experts to show you that what you are doing in tourism in skiing areas is bad for human health and the environment."
"You must be careful not to exaggerate with what you say."
"We are always looking at balanced legal situations where there is one legal asset and another legal asset and we have to find a balance between them."
"I believe that this compromise, which we have reached after long discussions, is a balanced solution."
"Because the compromise bans the transit of the dirtiest lorries; if the compromise is not adopted, then not only Greek lorries, which funnily enough you want to allow and which are the dirtiest on the road, but all dirty lorries will be able to drive through Austria."
"That is just an example to say, firstly, that your own position is not as glorious as it seems and, secondly, that this compromise does have advantages."
"My final comment is that one must always be careful what high horse one gets up on."
"Remember that in 1994 the Heads of State or Government called for the construction of the Brenner base tunnel as one of the 14 priority projects."
"Up until a year ago, your own Austrian planning envisaged that the Brenner base tunnel should be completed in 2021."
"And in response to pressure from this Parliament and others, Austria has now decided to bring forward the construction of the Brenner base tunnel to 2012."
"People who claim justice is on their side should be careful and consider whether they are really the saints they think they are."
". – Mr President, firstly, Mr Swoboda is correct to say that the system of ecopoints will benefit everybody, since it will speed up the modernisation of the lorry fleet; secondly, it is being maintained, although not in the way the honourable Member would like."
"Therefore, because a system of ecopoints is being maintained, which means special protection for the whole of Austrian territory – which is very significant – I would ask the honourable Members to support this proposal, and remind them that in the codecision procedure it is not the Commission which negotiates or acts, but this Parliament and the Council."
"The Commission's only capacity is to try to facilitate an agreement."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 am."
"The next item on the agenda is the report (A5-0464/2003) by Mr Lisi on behalf of the Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council regulation establishing common rules on compensation and assistance to passengers in the event of denied boarding and of cancellation or long delay of flights and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 295/91 (PE-CONS 3676/2003 – C5-0518/2003 – 2001/0305(COD))."
". Mr President, Commissioner, this Commission proposal on compensation and assistance to passengers in the event of denied boarding and of cancellation or long delay of flights has, at last – it is to be hoped – come to the end of its journey."
"Before going any further, I have to say that I believe conciliation has yielded the best possible outcome, given the fact that the process has been just as difficult and complex as that we have just been discussing."
"I will now summarise the key points of this conciliation, which focused on what had not been resolved at first and second readings, but I would also like to stress the essential and fairly simple concept underpinning this compromise: in other words, we have to consider the rights of air transport passengers as part of a more general context, as part of the whole system of air transport."
"A system in which all the players on the field, including control authorities, management authorities, airlines and the passengers themselves, are interdependent."
"Thus, the best way of guaranteeing effective passenger rights is to ensure the smooth running of this system: to make sure that none of the rules we want to introduce hampers this extremely sensitive, large-scale mechanism."
"As the Members will remember, the Commission’s initial proposal gave rise to huge numbers of concerns."
"Parliament attempted to address them by adopting 40 amendments."
"Then came a Council common position, which we immediately realised had improved the text, in particular as regards the then thorny issue of the amount of compensation, although other points which Parliament had raised had not been followed up."
"What were the most important of these points?"
"They were those which concerned procedures for implementing the various levels of assistance to passengers in the event of cancellation or long delay of flights."
"Now, as regards these two points, long delay and cancellation of flights, I believe that the result we have achieved reflects to a great extent what the best airlines already offer to passengers voluntarily and only introduces one new element, namely the certainty of these rights for passengers, certainty which is not limited, even though extraordinary circumstances are not excluded."
"Indeed, we convinced the Council, and Parliament is pleased to have achieved this, that there is just one message we have to send out: ‘Dear passenger, we cannot guarantee you many rights, we can only guarantee you a few, but those which we guarantee are certain, they are not subject to conditions’."
"It would, indeed, be a mistake and counterproductive to raise expectations and then see these rights denied and these expectations crushed by the behaviour of airlines."
"I am talking about even the most basic rights such as, for example, the right to be able to have a drink, to be able to make a telephone call, to be able to contact friends or relatives."
"We have therefore produced a mechanism which introduces a tier-system for services which have to be provided to passengers, and, most importantly, a full range: from minimum service – on-the-spot assistance in airports in the event of cancellation of flights or excessive delays of over five hours – to some sort of compensation for damages, specifically financial compensation, which is the highest level of protection we have provided."
"I feel it is important to mention the agreement on mutual right of redress: this was an important point of the conciliation text because it allows, for instance, tour operators who have to comply with these regulations to claim from the air carrier operating the service where the air carrier is responsible for the provision of bad service."
"As you know, the other points are of minor importance, such as, for example, coherence with everything we had introduced at first reading."
"I will end, Mr President, by thanking all those who have helped to achieve this result, which I feel is to be supported, despite the pressure in recent hours from a number of lobbies who are doing everything they can to stop the text being adopted."
". – Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate Parliament’s delegation in the Conciliation Committee and in particular it chairperson, Mrs Cederschiöld, and the rapporteur, Mr Lisi, on the wonderful work they have done on such a complicated issue."
"This Regulation is intended to reduce the frequency with which two entirely unacceptable practices take place in the field of transport, which seriously prejudice passengers, who sometimes feel – we feel – as if we are treated as luggage, rather than people, or citizens, or consumers with rights."
"One of these practices consists of passengers with perfectly valid tickets, who fulfil all their conditions, not being allowed to fly when the time comes to use it."
"The other practice consists of a flight being suspended by an air company, despite the passenger holding a perfectly valid ticket, in other words a contract with that company, not for external or extraordinary reasons preventing the flight – such as fog, for example – but for commercial reasons such as, for example – and I imagine that this has not just happened to me and that some of the honourable Members will have been in the same situation – there being few passengers for that flight."
"The provisions being proposed here are intended to establish compensation which will mean that air companies do not have incentives and are dissuaded from carrying out these practices and furthermore to restrict as far as possible the inconveniences and problems caused for passengers and citizens who find themselves in these situations."
"I am not going to go into details, because the rapporteur, Mr Lisi, has explained them very well."
"I hope that, with the entry into force of the Regulation, there will be a drastic reduction in the number of passengers prevented from flying and that, if this happens, that thanks to the use of the auction system or volunteer system – which is implemented with this system – there will be few difficulties and problems for citizens."
"I know that some of the honourable Members are concerned, and also that representatives of certain airlines have talked at length with some of you, in defence of their legitimate interests."
"I understand this concern, but I would like to say to you that companies are now clearly getting through the rough patch they have suffered over recent years."
"Nobody has greater responsibility and greater concern for the economic success of our air companies than the Commission."
"In this regard, we have implemented over all these years a series of measures aimed at supporting, sustaining and defending our air companies within Europe and outside of it."
"I would remind you of one of these measures: the ‘Single Sky’ initiative, which is going to mean a reduction in costs and better rotation of the fleet, the authorisation of alliances, the combating of distortions in competition conditions – specifically, the issue of support for our air companies in the face of anti-competitive or predatory practices on the part of third countries – and the support we have given them in relation to issues such as insurance when there have been difficulties in the past."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is clear that we are dealing with European air companies and defending their interests, which is what we must do: now we are specifically negotiating agreements with the United States, so that we may have a United States-European Union common transatlantic aviation zone."
"That is not all, however, because we must also defend the rights of passengers, of citizens."
"And that is what we are going to support and strengthen through these measures."
"I would also like to say that serious and responsible companies are already applying the majority of these measures on a voluntary basis."
"Mr President, I hope that tomorrow this Parliament will support the result of this conciliation, and I would like once again to thank the chairperson, Mrs Cederschiöld, and the rapporteur, Mr Lisi."
"– Mr President, I think that we all agree that the passenger, by which I mean the person who has planned to travel by aeroplane and who goes to the airport, only to be told that he cannot fly or that his flight is severely delayed, so that his trip makes no sense, should have some basic protection."
"That is why all of us, from the beginning, focussing on the consumer's interests, said that this view should be supported."
"On the other hand, we also looked at the interests of the airlines, especially in this critical period which we are going through in the air transport sector and, for this reason, the European Parliament was in favour, from the outset, of balanced measures which, on the one hand, would serve the consumer without, on the other hand, damaging the airlines and their competitiveness."
"Our rapporteur, Mr Giorgio Lisi, who has done an excellent job, which was ultimately crowned with success during the conciliation procedure, also personally took this line."
"I personally was in favour, including during the conciliation procedure, and I shall also vote in favour of the result of the agreement with the Council tomorrow, because I think that, without damaging the airlines, it provides a good framework within which to protect the consumer, the passenger."
"I know that certain airlines continue to have some objections."
"I have taken them into account, but I do not agree with them."
"I think they are exaggerating, I think that the agreement we have is a good agreement and that we should accept it as it stands."
"One thousand and fifty passengers are denied boarding in Europe every year despite having a valid ticket in their pockets."
"Flight cancellations and delays are also increasing, especially in the tourist season."
"That is not in the consumer’s interests."
"My group therefore welcomes the regulation."
"It will give us a uniform European legal framework, probably from 2005."
"I am sure we have succeeded in achieving a fair balance between the interests of consumers and carriers."
"The excessive level of compensation sought by the Commission has been cut back to a realistic amount."
"The reference to extraordinary circumstances reduces carriers’ responsibility to a reasonable level."
"I therefore anticipate that the Council will follow Parliament in agreeing to the outcome of conciliation."
"This represents an advance over the existing arrangements because we now have a list of benefits to which passengers are legally entitled, not just in cases of overbooking as before, but also when flights are cancelled or delayed."
"At the heart of the improvement are the compensation payments, which are twice as high as was hitherto the norm in Europe under the voluntary arrangements."
"For example, if I get to Tegel before finding out that my flight from Berlin to Mallorca has been cancelled, I not only get my ticket replaced, but I also get EUR 400 compensation."
"I get the same amount if I am left behind because of overbooking."
"This also places a measure of pressure on airlines to be more sensitive in their use of the overbooking system, necessary as it is."
"Of course, we also hope that greater efforts will be made to reduce delays and the occasional abusive cancellation of flights when they are not quite full."
"One side effect of the regulation will be to reduce the gap in the terms of competition between budget and traditional airlines."
"We are now setting standards for passenger rights in aviation which sooner or later ought to apply for other modes of transport as well."
"Mr President, we have, then, finally obtained a compromise proposal concerning compensation for air passengers, and we in the European Parliament, in particular, should be pleased about this proposal."
"Of Europe’s assemblies, ours is probably the one whose Members travel most as part of our daily work."
"We are therefore only too well aware of overbooked, delayed flights and poor service, as well as the resultant frustration."
"I therefore believe that the proposal, involving limits upon delays and compensation in the event of cancellations, would put pressure upon the airlines, which would thus be given a clear incentive to tighten up on departures and get their planes away on time, to the benefit of passengers."
"It would also hopefully lead to more sensible departure times and clear compensation for passengers whenever they do not leave on time."
"Details of the compensation payable by the airlines must, however, be publicly available so that people can see clearly what it amounts to."
"There is, however, a problem I fear may arise. In connection with the legislation, the principle, which is also to apply to package trips, has been introduced of refunding air tickets."
"That is something I can, of course, only welcome since it places European consumers in a better position."
"The problem is just that it can often be difficult to discover the correct price of an airline ticket that is part of a package trip."
"I am certain, however, that this is something that can easily be solved in practice, as and when the problem arises."
"In general, I am, as I say, well satisfied with the proposal by the Conciliation Committee and hope and expect it to be adopted."
"Mr President, my Group very much welcomes this report."
"The proposal is important because improving the conditions and criteria under which passengers should be reimbursed and assisted in the event of being denied boarding, cancellation or long delays is something that must be welcomed."
"We must also take account of cases of cancellation or long delays due to valid technical reasons for safety."
"We do not want to create a situation where airlines will decide to fly regardless of what the outcome will be."
"Nevertheless there have been many cases where passengers have been denied boarding because of overbooking – something which many in this Parliament will have experienced regarding some airlines in Europe – and people have been left high and dry, whether it be in Brussels or somewhere else."
"A constituent of mine bought a flight online with the notorious Ryanair but when they went to collect the ticket they were denied access because they had an international student ID card and were refused boarding on the grounds that it was out of date."
"So they used a national student ID card which was valid but this was refused."
"So there is a major problem of what actually constitutes acceptable ID."
"This person paid quite a lot of money for the ticket; it was not one of those tickets costing a couple of euro, it was quite expensive."
"So how much are airlines making on this?"
"Another constituent got as far as London where he was then refused boarding on a continuing flight out of London to Europe."
"Airlines need to take responsibility for their passengers."
"They cannot be allowed to get away with treating passengers like this any longer."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the Conciliation Committee and Mr Lisi for the agreement that we reached."
"This regulation will, I hope, encourage airlines and travel companies to curtail their normal practices."
"I also welcome the reference that the regulation makes to sanctions, which have to be effective, proportionate and dissuasive."
"In this respect, air passengers should receive compensation, an alternative flight, and assistance appropriate to the inconvenience suffered, and they should be offered these things as quickly as possible, which is not always the case at present."
"The extension of air passengers’ rights to include all types of flight is a welcome innovation."
"Thus passengers on scheduled flights, which represent only half of the market, and those on non-scheduled flights, particularly on package tours, will be able to assert their rights in the same way."
"As the Commission Stated in its White Paper, ‘European transport policy for 2010: time to decide’, its objective is to refocus that policy on the basis of citizens’ demands and needs."
"They may lose business, be prevented from attending funerals and so on. Members of this Parliament who frequently have to use air transport in order to travel between Brussels, Strasbourg and their own regions are particularly aware of such inconvenience and of the resulting loss of time."
"Furthermore, as Vice-Chairman of the ‘Handicap’ Intergroup, I am glad that Article 11 refers to giving priority treatment to persons with reduced mobility."
"However, the list could have been extended to cover people travelling with young children."
"As for the exemptions in the case of strikes, the required periods of notice should make it possible for airlines to react in good time and to remain subject to the constraints of this regulation."
"I also welcome the provision concerning the obligation to inform passengers concerning their rights, by means of a notice in easily legible characters displayed in the check-in area, giving special attention – more explicit than that laid down in the regulation – to providing information, by appropriate means, for blind or partially sighted persons."
"Such passenger-protection schemes should be extended to cover other modes of transport."
"Finally, it would appear fundamentally necessary for airlines to seek to ensure, in advance, that they offer a high-quality service to their passengers, so that the latter no longer have to suffer any inconvenience."
"I hope that the Members of this House will support this agreement, which seeks to respect the rights of passengers so that the practices in question occur as rarely as possible."
"Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, since rapporteur Lisi has already given us an excellent explanation of the compromise, I would simply like to deal in my address with a few rumours or arguments."
"Some Member States have recently been having doubts about the compromise, thinking it places too heavy a burden on the airlines."
"But that cannot be the case at all."
"The European Parliament has clearly reduced the rates of compensation in the airlines’ favour."
"The European Parliament has introduced clear rules for cases of so that airlines do not have to act if they are not responsible for the circumstances leading to a cancellation or overbooking."
"The Parliament has even put back the entry into force for 12 months because we take the airlines’ particular and difficult economic situation seriously."
"So these entire arrangements will not come into force until 2005."
"If the transport industry, be it the tourism sector or some other one, is now voicing doubts about this compromise, then I have to say that it is more than unfair and not at all acceptable."
"Many governments need to think whether they want to risk being shown by us as a Parliament to be clearly hostile to the consumer if they take this line in the Council."
"European elections are looming, should the Council wish to take this subject up."
"May I make one further remark in conclusion?"
"The budget airlines, who did not take any of this at all seriously at first, are now coming and saying that these levels of compensation are far too high."
"If a budget airline offers a flight for EUR 50, then it is still obliged to make the flight, despite the low price."
"Because the rights of the citizen who wants to go somewhere at a particular time, be it for business or tourism, have been violated and he must be compensated if he is left standing or can only fly a day later."
"Even budget airlines must compensate their passengers."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating the Commissioner for bringing forward this proposal and our rapporteur, Mr Liese, for bringing forward this report."
"I could also thank Mr Jarzembowski for saying many of the things I was going to say, which is a rare thing indeed."
"I agree with him completely, for example, that it is a nonsense to say that the airlines will not cope."
"Let us be honest: air travel will double in Europe in the next 30 years, so it is not as if the airlines cannot afford to provide a glass of water and a biscuit if there is a delay."
"That is the sort of basic standard we should expect in the future, if this goes through."
"I welcome many of the features."
"For example, for too long passengers have suffered when airlines have cancelled or delayed flights for purely commercial reasons."
"I hope that will end."
"At last airlines will be forced to provide passengers with the food and refreshments they deserve, with the dignity and respect they deserve."
"I hope that all this will mean that the days of commercial cancellations and lengthy delays will be over."
"This is a great breakthrough for all airline passengers and also for the airlines, because it will not affect good airlines which look after their passengers."
"In conclusion, this deal could have been even better had colleagues on that side of the House stood firmer in conciliation."
"That was not to be."
"To misquote Neil Armstrong: it may not be a giant leap for mankind, but it is an important first step."
"Finally, I want to remind the Commissioner that we look forward to receiving similar rules for international rail, ferry and coach journeys soon."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I totally agree with Mr Watts: we deserve more than a biscuit and a glass of water."
"In the last 30 years I have been flying round the world an average of twice a week, which is perhaps more than many others here in this House."
"I cannot in general agree with the statement made by many of my fellow Members that air passengers are being treated badly."
"We deserve rights but should we cram as many Christmas presents as possible into this package?"
"Because, ladies and gentlemen, what do the airlines do for money?"
"They operate using the money they receive from us, the passengers."
"Would it not be better to solve these problem situations through greater competition, broken monopolies and reduced regulation?"
"We cannot provide passengers with better service by increasing legislation and putting a strain on the airlines, because even today’s system works excellently in the countries which apply it."
"We live in a world of open competition and this will only mean that third countries will have the competitive edge."
"The European consumer deserves as many options as possible and the cheapest tickets possible."
"More red tape of this sort will not help the situation."
"With regard to interlining, I would say that if a British Airways flight from Tokyo arrives at Helsinki and Finnair goes on from there to Oulu and this onward flight is cancelled due to bad weather, it is unfair if Finnair has to pay the whole cost of the ticket."
"I truly believe that an air passenger’s rights must be protected, but air passengers and airlines go hand in hand and, at the end of the day, their interests cannot be separated."
"Increased fares may easily be awaiting us at the end of the runway."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating the Commission on this initiative and acknowledge the excellent work Mr Lisi has done by means of the different parliamentary process we have seen."
"I do not believe that anybody disputes the importance of the air sector, but I am from a country for which the air sector is of great strategic importance."
"I believe that those countries with a high level of tourism have a greater interest than anybody in the air sector being more solvent and having greater capacity, since vital elements of development depend on it in numerous European countries."
"But it is true that this is perfectly compatible with passengers being compensated for the harm done to them."
"What is the harm done to a passenger when they are delayed?"
"Is it simply that they are made to wait two, three or four hours in the departure hall?"
"When there is an overbooking, what harm is done to the passenger?"
"It would be very difficult to evaluate that harm, but I am absolutely certain that it is a harm which goes much further than the compensation which we are establishing here, at times without any possible comparison."
"We must therefore deal with it."
"I believe that this Parliament has carried out a very important and interesting exercise with this report."
"I would therefore like to thank Mr Lisi for the care he has taken."
"Parliament has moderated – and even reduced, in some cases – the proposals presented to us by the Commission and the Council."
"We have taken account of the objective interests and the survival of companies, which does credit to this Parliament and, naturally, it seems to me absolutely essential that we stop classifying many of the specious arguments that companies frequently give passengers as ‘extraordinary circumstances’."
"I believe we have begun an interesting process."
"Let us hope that it is extended to other forms of transport and that we go further in this direction."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Lisi."
"It goes without saying that I, along with my colleagues, expect passengers travelling on European airlines to be treated in a fair and respectful manner."
"I also firmly believe that if their travel plans are disrupted and it is the fault of the airline, then that airline should take full responsibility."
"Sadly this regulation, in its present state, will badly damage our airline industry and, in particular, our regional and low-cost carriers, thereby threatening jobs and reducing the opportunities the consumer has come to expect in terms of choice and a competitive level of airfares."
"It is therefore with regret that I will be unable to support this regulation, for the following reasons."
"First, in the final draft of Article 6, referring to delays, the regulation is seriously flawed."
"The exclusion of extraordinary circumstances places an unacceptable financial burden on the carrier."
"Situations such as industrial disputes, air traffic delays, adverse weather conditions and possible terrorist threats cannot be foreseen by any airline."
"Therefore to include full reimbursement, as well as a return flight to the first point of departure, is wholly unacceptable."
"To suggest that the airlines will be able to obtain compensation from third party providers is a myth."
"Maybe they will apply to heaven if it is a weather problem."
"Secondly, referring to Article 5 on cancellations, I echo my previous points."
"The impact of this regulation has taken no account of Parliament's support in strengthening our regional airports."
"Nor has the Commission thought through the impact on charter carriers, which often have only one or two flights a week to particular destinations."
"In conclusion, at the beginning of this process I criticised the Commission on its ill-timed, badly drafted proposal."
"It ignored the new voluntary commitment and failed to provide a financial impact assessment."
"An extra GBP 1 billion of costs for the airlines will not benefit passengers but will penalise them by increasing the price of tickets and reducing choice."
"The irony is that none of these rules would apply to third country airlines flying into the EU."
"If the Commission wanted to give our business away to the rest of the world, then it has done a jolly good job."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we shall of course be voting in favour of this regulation."
"We believe that we have come up with a more or less balanced text, compared with an initial proposal which seemed to us to contain a certain number of risks."
"It is clear that passengers’ rights are sacred."
"All too often the airlines treat them very lightly, whether it is a matter of looking after their passengers or of providing them with information."
"It is also clear that the practice of overbooking has in many cases revealed its limitations and proved that it is used as a commercial tool."
"We have even seen cases where planes did not take off because they were not full, which is absolutely inadmissible for someone who has signed a sale or purchase contract as part of the process of obtaining a ticket."
"I believe that the text we have come up with is balanced overall."
"On the one hand, it tries to ensure that the practice of overbooking does not constitute a purely commercial practice but is restricted to a flexibility practice."
"We are aware that overbooking will never be reduced to zero by the airlines, because that is how they manage imponderables."
"There are some of us here in this House who often travel by air, and many of us benefit from overbooking practices when we arrive late or when things do not go according to plan and we have trouble getting to the airport."
"I do not think, therefore, that we ought to make a big issue of it."
"Moreover, the compensation scheme must be fair and equitable, and it must not be too complicated if we are to avoid endless disputes, and above all it should not be an incentive to airlines to take risks with safety."
"We must not go too far: we must not end up with a situation in which airlines are determined to take off at any price, even if there is a technical incident, because it would otherwise cost them too much to provide compensation for passengers."
"I hope that we have achieved this sort of balance in this report."
"I hope so but I am not altogether sure."
"Nevertheless, we shall be giving it our support."
"Mr President, it may be worthwhile just to reflect for one moment on why it was thought necessary to introduce legislation to make compensation a legal right for those air passengers who face cancellation and delay through no fault of their own."
"It was thought necessary because some airlines had got into a very bad habit of cancelling flights at the last minute, overbooking flights, inflicting delay because of inefficient operational practices and then, to add insult to injury, they treated their victims – their passengers – with total disdain and little or no sympathy."
"Members may wish to dwell on the fact that a voluntary code of practice did exist with the more reliable airlines."
"However, the refusal of the so-called low-cost carriers to sign up to this voluntary agreement and the low levels of compensation given to the victims meant action on a more formal basis was required."
"The pendulum had to swing back in favour of the consumer to a more reasonable, balanced position."
"The proposal before us is a first step in ensuring that the travelling public are protected when transport operators fail to live up to their promises and obligations."
"I look forward to similar schemes being introduced with other modes, particularly ferries and so-called high-speed ships."
"What we have before us today is not perfect."
"I regret that the Council of Ministers insisted on charter flights being included."
"I also regret the removal of extraordinary circumstances in the delay section, but welcome the exemption of rotor operators, the levels of compensation agreed and the inclusion of the low-cost carriers."
"This proposal is not perfect: it poses many questions in regard to existing legislation and highlights areas where existing legislation is inadequate."
"I cite the package travel directive as one example."
"But we must recognise that at last consumers and the travelling public are being given rights that they deserve, backed up with compensation when airlines fail in their promises."
"Over recent months I have been subjected to every kind of doom-and-gloom scenario from some airlines and even certain Members of Parliament."
"But remember this: if the airlines do not cancel or overbook, if they run the services they advertise on time and stick to their contract with the travelling public, then this proposal will not cost them one euro."
"It becomes expensive to airlines when they fail to deliver – and what is wrong with that?"
"Mr President, I welcome this regulation."
"As others have already mentioned, it is not a perfect solution, but it is necessary at this time."
"We would not need a regulation of this kind if it were not for the fact that every year in Europe over 500 000 passengers are affected by cancellations and the denial of boarding."
"It is important that the European Parliament and the Commission are seen to be serving the public of Europe."
"This regulation demonstrates the added value that the European Union can provide in terms of rights for European citizens."
"It is probably true to say that every single Member of this House has had some experience of the kinds of problems faced by ordinary passengers and it is good that we are now dealing with this issue."
". – Mr President, it is not realistic to expect perfection, but I believe that this is a step forward in terms of the protection of passengers’ rights and I hope that Parliament can support this initiative tomorrow."
"I would like to thank all the Members who have worked on it, in particular the rapporteur, Mr Lisi, and Mrs Cederschiöld."
"Thank you very much, Mrs de Palacio."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday, at 11.30 a.m."
"The next item is Question Time (B5-0416/2003)."
"The following questions are addressed to the Commission"
"What is the Commission doing to persuade the Turkish Government that, before it can dream of joining the Union, it must stamp down on the huge flow of Afghan heroin which Turkish drug barons smuggle into the Union, using the very latest technology and techniques, in order to make money for themselves and to ruin the lives of young European citizens?"
". – Mr President, honourable Member, the European Commission shares your concern about drugs passing through Turkey."
"The Association Agreement with Turkey provides for institutions allowing the Commission to monitor very closely whether Turkey is adopting and implementing Community measures on organised crime and drugs and how it is doing so."
"Negotiations are also currently taking place for observer status for Turkey in the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction."
"I think Turkey will be given that observer status next year."
"Work will begin on 1 January 2004 under a partnership arrangement to set up a national contact point for the European Information Network on Drugs and Drug Addiction and to encourage the development and implementation of a national strategy on drugs."
"The Commission also believes that a small Dublin Group should be set up in Ankara as quickly as possible."
"I am pleased to be able to tell you that Turkey has made and is making great efforts to prevent drug trafficking."
"Turkey is actively involved in international measures to prevent the channelling of heroin from Afghanistan into the European Union."
"By the very nature of things, honourable Member, I cannot tell you anything about the nature of those measures here, because some of them involve operations by the secret services."
"I can only say that the information available to the Commission shows that Turkey is cooperating fully and that the undertone in your question is unjustified."
"In 2002, the Turkish authorities seized 2 124 kg of heroin."
"That was less than in previous years."
"The reason for this is that the international drug traffickers have changed their routes as a result of the strict controls in Turkey."
"In 2003, the Turkish customs introduced the latest systems at three border crossings, allowing vehicles passing through those crossings to be checked by scanners."
"This has resulted in the discovery of large quantities of smuggled drugs."
"When it comes to international cooperation, the Turkish customs authorities hold monthly meetings with drugs liaison officers who are sent to Turkey."
"It goes without saying that in its cooperation with Turkey the Commission presses for full compliance with all agreements and provisions relating to the fight against drugs."
"That was a very full and helpful reply, Commissioner."
"In relation to your comment that you could not necessarily infer the issues in my question, I should like to point out that I was directly quoting the head of a police intelligence service in London, who was commenting on the effects of Turkish heroin in the UK."
"As a supplementary, I should like to ask you about the 'small Dublin group' to be set up in Ankara."
"In your own words, could you define that term for me?"
". – Honourable Member, I asked this very same question when I came to deal with your question."
"I am therefore in the happy position of being able to give you a very precise answer."
"First, you need to know what a Dublin Group is."
"The Dublin Group is the grouping of industrialised nations, that is all the EU Member States, the USA, Canada and Australia, which coordinates initiatives to combat drugs and drug trafficking."
"In cooperation with third countries who do not belong to this Dublin Group, this group deploys ‘mini Dublin Groups’ with a regional coverage, so a mini Dublin Group in Ankara would mean that the members of the Dublin Group and Turkey cooperate in these matters in Turkey itself."
"In recent years the Commission has adopted a number of sports-related decisions concerning policy, competition and areas of responsibility."
"In most cases the particular nature of competitive sport has been taken into account and the resulting outcomes have been found to be satisfactory in the eyes of Community law."
"In view of the importance of such decisions and the doctrine to which they have given rise, does the Commission not think that, before its term of office comes to a close, it should draw up a Communication on the way in which the rules on competition and areas of responsibility apply to sport, so that those rules can be used to provide guidance in future cases and to assist sports organisations in drafting their own regulations?"
". – Honourable Member, the Commission is not at present planning a communication on the application of the competition rules in sport."
"The Commission believes that the established practice of action on a case by case basis, which now goes back several years, provides sound guidance as to when and to what extent the competition rules apply."
"The international sporting bodies that are primarily responsible for regulating sport are generally aware of these rules in any case."
"The competition rules of the EC Treaty apply only for economic activities in connection with sport; they do not of course apply for genuine sporting activities."
"There are borderline cases and there may also be borderline cases where it is hard to make the distinction between economic and non-economic activities."
"But those problems are best dealt with on a case by case basis because account can then be taken of the particular nature of the sport in question."
"Commissioner, thank you for your reply."
"I would like to ask you whether you believe that the fact that the Commission has over recent years had to adopt this series of decisions relating to sport in the field of policy and competition highlights even more clearly – if that is possible – the need to include an article on sport in the future European Union Treaty."
". – That, honourable Member, is an interesting reference to the current debate about the constitution."
"The Commission can in fact well imagine special attention being paid to sport in the proposed constitution."
"However, if I rightly understand the discussion that has taken place about it in the Convention and in public, the issue is not so much the question of the application of competition rules but rather whether the European institutions can also be given a ‘soft’ competence in the realm of sport."
"Coming back to the issue of competition policy, the Commission does not for the future rule out a definition that would then be embodied in a communication."
"But for the present I can only repeat our position that we believe it is better for all concerned that doubtful cases should be decided as they arise in the light of decisions already taken."
"As the author is not present, Question No 27 lapses."
"During the accession negotiations with the applicant countries did the Commission hold talks with representatives of ethnic groups and minorities in those countries, and does it intend to meet them again during the final months leading up to the accession?"
"– Honourable Member, I am very grateful to you for this question because it in fact touches on a very, very important aspect of the whole accession process."
"And I can inform you that the question of human rights and thus of respect for and protection of minorities have been key elements for the opening of accession negotiations since the introduction of the accession process by the Copenhagen European Council over 10 years ago."
"I would like to say again expressly here that fulfilment of the Copenhagen political criteria is a prerequisite for the commencement and conclusion of negotiations with applicant countries, and we define this as meaning that applicants must be fully developed democracies, that the rule of law must be fully developed, that human rights must be fully respected and minorities must be protected in accordance with the European standard for minorities."
"The Commission has always followed developments affecting minorities in all applicant countries closely for the pre-accession strategies and the Europe agreements."
"The regular reports on progress in the applicant countries have dealt with this question in detail every year, and they have not only reported on improvements and advances, but have also, as you know, always been very clear about shortcomings."
"All this has been possible because we have been and are in permanent contact with the parties involved in the process, including the representatives of ethnic groups and minorities."
"Apart from the Commission services’ regular contacts through EU delegations visiting a country or administrative centre, the Commission has sponsored or taken part in many committees and seminars on various questions affecting minorities."
"These contacts will continue to be cultivated in the months ahead even after accession."
"I would like to assure you that the Commission has always cultivated close contacts with minorities and their representatives or the relevant non-governmental organisations in Europe and will naturally continue to do so."
"I have just one question concerning the group of countries that will now be acceding on 1 May."
"Will you until 1 May still be the point of contact for any minority representatives in those accession countries who still wish to raise a concern before then?"
"Is that still within your field of competence?"
"That is one question, and the second question is, who will be the point of contact in the Commission following accession?"
". – This question gives me an opportunity to make that clear because it is obvious that not everyone has understood it yet."
"My competence for relations with the accession countries is complete and undivided up until 1 May 2004."
"That therefore means that anything that still has to be discussed with those countries passes through me and if minority representatives want talks or if something still needs to be raised with the governments in this area I am naturally willing to do so."
"Quite by chance, I met with the representatives of the German minority in Poland in Wroclaw only a few days ago."
"So if there should be any concerns I am ready to do so."
"After 1 May – after accession – the commissioners will be responsible for the areas of falling within their portfolios."
"So in the matter of the protection of minorities I think my colleague Mr Vittorino will be taking over after 1 May 2004 and if I know him he will certainly be very committed to seeing that the rights of minorities are safeguarded everywhere."
"– Commissioner, you know that our party, the Communist Party of Greece, has raised the problem of the rights of the Russian-speaking minority in the Baltic States on numerous occasions."
"The situation is unacceptable."
"One third of the population in two of these three states does not have the right to be a citizen or, of course, to take part in the referendum on the accession of these countries to the European Union, and has no opportunity to study at university in their language and a series of other things."
"We have had no satisfactory answer from you or from the European Union in general and I really cannot understand how it is that you can show such sensitivity, for example, to the rights of Albanian speakers in Kosovo and can bomb Kosovo and bomb Serbia; how you can talk about the rights of a few opponents of the establishment in Cuba and have not the slightest interest in the policies, which I have no hesitation in calling dreamed-up neo-fascist policies, of the governments of the Baltic states."
"It is, in my opinion, an example of gross hypocrisy."
"– The Commission does not agree with you, honourable Member."
"Like the Council of Europe and the OSCE, the Commission is of the opinion that the Baltic states meet the human rights standards completely and that the treatment of minorities in those countries is also fully in line with European standards."
"Social workers and organisations monitoring the Czech Republic have raised the alarm over the large-scale sex trade in the border region between the Czech Republic and Germany."
"Among other details, there have been shocking reports of children being sold for sexual exploitation."
"With this in mind, I wonder if the Commission is discussing this problem or making special demands on the Czech Republic in connection with the accession negotiations?"
"Are there any EU projects which would specifically support the victims of the sex trade in the Czech Republic?"
". – Honourable Member, this is a particularly serious and painful topic and, as you know, the Commission has been intensively concerned with it for years."
"I would like to make one preliminary remark. My personal strategy in this connection has always been that one must be very careful about dramatic insinuations or dramatic accusations."
"And I have to note to my horror – I have to say I really am horrified – that the publications of some non-governmental organisations, which are made with the best of intentions and draw attention to serious problems, have resulted in dramatic and sensational reporting in the media, especially in those countries bordering on the Czech Republic, with dire consequences."
"They have resulted in a flood of sex tourists, who now go to these border areas because they have seen on television that children are reportedly offered for prostitution there, and they are now asking for children."
"And I am very concerned that this sensational reporting is creating a demand for which, ultimately, a supply will be forthcoming even if there was no supply at all before."
"We must therefore be extremely cautious and extremely sensitive when dealing with this question."
"I am sure you agree with me."
"This problem is not simply a question that lies within the sole competence of the Czech authorities and has nothing to do with us; it is a problem that belongs in the realm of police and judicial cooperation and, I am firmly convinced, also in the area of respect for human rights."
"The Commission has repeatedly urged the Czech authorities to take the necessary action in the light of this."
"In the 2002 progress report, the Commission notes that the Czech Government has taken important steps to combat the trade in human beings."
"These included in particular improving the legal framework with an amendment to the penal code in 2002."
"That change in the law widened the definition of trade and also extended it to children."
"An accelerated amendment to the code of criminal procedure has also ensured that proceedings in child abuse cases are simplified and speeded up."
"Back in the year 2000, the Czech Government adopted a national plan to combat the commercial sexual abuse of children and in 2003 a wide-ranging national plan to combat the trade in human beings for purposes of sexual exploitation."
"The implementation of these plans is kept under constant review."
"The Commission has come to the conclusion that the situation in the Czech Republic, especially along the borders between the Czech Republic and Germany and between the Czech Republic and Austria, continues to give cause for concern."
"In the light of the most recent reports from non-governmental organisations, the Commission is encouraging the Czech authorities to take further steps."
"The Czech authorities are responsible for taking all necessary measures to prevent the trade in human beings and child prostitution."
"In my opinion, the most important thing at the moment is to use effective surveillance to gain an overview of the actual situation."
"That would also make it easier to track down and prosecute offenders."
"This will require quite close cooperation between the competent police forces, both internally and across the borders."
"I must particularly emphasise this cross-border aspect because, as I am sure you know, honourable Member, the clients do not come from the Czech Republic."
"The clients come from neighbouring countries that have been members of the European Union for a long time."
"The Commission is in close contact with both the Czech and the German and Austrian authorities in order to obtain precise information about the situation on the spot and to be able to respond to new developments."
"Regrettably, the financing rules under which we have to operate do not allow direct assistance to be given to the victims of human trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation."
"But the Commission does make substantial amounts of money available for fighting organised crime and the trade in human beings through the PHARE programme."
"The Czech Republic has received EUR 5.5 million for this purpose in the last four years."
"Further assistance will be granted for this purpose after accession from the financial assistance instrument known as the ‘transitional facility’."
"In addition, since the year 2000 Czech non-governmental organisations have taken part in five projects under the Community’s Daphne programme with the aim of preventing violence against children, young persons and women, including violence in the form of sexual exploitation."
"Non-governmental organisations from the Czech Republic will also be able to apply for similar funding from the Daphne programme for the years 2004 – 2008."
"– Mr President, thank you, Commissioner, for your answer."
"As the voluntary organisations say, there is every cause for feeling very concerned about the trade in women and children in the border region between Germany and the Czech Republic, but also in other parts of Europe."
"This is a major and common problem which also exists in the regions bordering on the other countries that share a frontier with the present and the enlarged EU but that are not members of the EU."
"I live in northern Sweden, and we have this problem in the region of the Barents Sea."
"Unlike the Commissioner, I do not believe that the media reports cause the trade to increase. I believe, rather, that it is a question of poverty and of the subordination of women."
"This promotes the trade in women and children."
"We must work on an extremely broad front."
"I also believe that legal prostitution promotes the trade in women and children."
"I therefore want to see those who buy sex criminalised."
"I think that this would be a sound way of proceeding."
"I hear that the Commission and the Commissioner are taking this issue very seriously, and I think this is important."
"I also wish to draw attention to the Daphne programme."
"Does the Commissioner believe that the police in the EU countries and the candidate countries are cooperating sufficiently well in order to get to grips with this large problem?"
"Is there progress when it comes to police cooperation?"
". – Two brief comments, honourable Member."
"I think we should not misunderstand one another."
"I did not say that the media are exaggerating things."
"I did say that in the specific case of information about the situation in the Czech border areas sensational reporting has resulted in demand for child prostitution becoming really visible."
"I meant that as an appeal to the media to show a measure of restraint in their reporting."
"I fully agree with you that it is essentially a problem of the poverty that is a consequence of the transition and that this problem is by no means confined to the Czech Republic but that there are still far worse situations in Europe."
"I was in Moldova a few days ago, and there the problem is much more shocking in extent and is quite clearly a consequence of the bitter poverty in which the people there live, so the strategy of increasing the chances for economic prosperity for the countries in transition within Europe is quite certainly a right one."
"The other is better cooperation in the field of police and justice."
"Now so far as the specific problem in the Czech Republic is concerned, I can tell you from my contacts with the German and Austrian Governments and also from direct contacts on the spot, with police stations in Bavaria, for example, that our assessment is that cooperation with the Czech police and the Czech judiciary now satisfies the requirements."
"There were times when this cooperation was not sufficiently developed."
"My Question 54, which is due to be taken later though I suspect we will not reach it, is closely related to this."
"In the UK, the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children has produced compelling evidence that shows that paedophiles are moving from one Member State of the European Union to another to take advantage of differences in the law."
"For example, in the UK there is a register for child-sex offenders."
"We find that people who would not be able to work with children in the UK move to other Member States of the Union in order to take advantage of the lack of such a register."
"In light of what the Commissioner has said about the need for greater judicial and police cooperation, would the Commission consider taking an initiative to create a European-wide sex offenders register, so that these people can be monitored?"
". – I do not know, honourable Member."
"I do not know because that is a question that is definitely not within my field of competence and I would not like to anticipate my colleague who is competent in this matter and who has prepared to answer this question but who will be giving his answer at a later point in this question time."
"Please understand that I do not have the competence to answer your question."
"Is the Commission aware of the continued use of caged beds in four accession countries, Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia and Slovenia?"
"This practice involves the locking into caged beds, sometimes for weeks and months at a time, of elderly people with dementia and others of all ages with a mental health or behavioural problem."
"It is widely seen, both internationally and within the countries concerned, as a human rights abuse and an archaic method of containment and restraint."
"It is not used in any EU Member States or in any other accession country."
"Will the Commission welcome moves in the four countries to review and reduce the use of caged beds and work with them to agree a timetabled phasing out of all such beds?"
". – May I on this question too make a brief political preliminary remark?"
"I am sometimes slightly surprised that the Commission is asked questions that give the impression that we are responsible for all possible circumstances in the future Member States, as though we had powers in areas where there is definitely no Community competence."
"We are dealing here with a question where we do not even know what the situation is in the Member States."
"All the same, we have been able to do something, because the Copenhagen criteria do apply for the future Member States and the Copenhagen criteria help us to take action in such matters."
"But then we must always treat them as human rights matters."
"I had to say that first."
"So far as the problem of caged beds is concerned, which you raise in your question, the an international organisation for the promotion and protection of the rights of people with mental disabilities, presented a report to the European Parliament on 17 June."
"You know that, of course."
"That report points out that caged beds are still used to restrain people with mental disabilities in four accession countries, namely the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia and Slovenia."
"On the strength of that report’s findings, the Commission immediately contacted the countries concerned in order to investigate the present situation precisely and called on the authorities of the countries concerned to inform the Commission of the existing circumstances."
"The Commission then received the information requested and it appears that the situation has already improved by comparison with the report simply as a result of the Commission’s enquiry."
"The Slovenian authorities informed us that caged beds are no longer used in Slovenia."
"In Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Hungary they are still used in a very few exceptional cases and strict guidelines must be followed."
"The countries concerned have however conceded that efforts to introduce more modern methods of psychiatric care may for the present be hampered by insufficient staff resources."
"The Commission has information that the Slovak Government has taken relevant measures and is at present working on a plan to phase out caged beds."
"The Czech Government has assured the Commission that it is investigating the matter in detail in order to provide us with more precise information about the occasional use of caged beds."
"In Hungary the number of caged beds has already fallen steadily."
"The very few establishments where such beds are used are regularly monitored and ways are being sought that will allow these terrible beds to be abolished."
"If I may make a brief assessment, I think we are faced here with a phenomenon that gives us a glimpse into the sometimes horrifying past of psychiatry and that we really must be shocked at what we see."
"I am sure we all agree that such methods have no place in modern psychiatry."
"The Commission will therefore be using every means at its disposal to pursue this matter further and we shall not cease until the last caged bed has vanished from each of these countries."
"Mr President, I wholeheartedly welcome the Commissioner's last statement, which is absolutely right."
"There is no place for caged beds or anything like them in a modern psychiatric service."
"I was astonished by his opening political statement."
"If he does not know, I can tell him that there are no caged beds in any existing Member State."
"There are no caged beds in any other accession country apart from these four."
"They are a legacy of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and so the only other country that could have had them in the past was Austria, and that is no longer the case."
"I recently spoke at a conference in the senate in Prague when this issue was being debated."
"One of the speakers was a young man called Michael, a 29-year-old who had been put in one of these caged beds for a week, unable to get out."
"Not surprisingly his health suffered."
"They are caged in the sense of there being iron bars or nets."
"There are safety consequences, because people have died in these beds."
"As the Commissioner said, it is a human rights issue."
"That is why it is an accession issue."
"That is why, when we looked at Slovenia, we incorporated a question about their new mental health legislation in our report of two years ago."
"That is why I very much welcome the pressure that the Commissioner is putting on these countries."
"Hungary has already responded;"
"Slovenia is now responding; the Czech Republic not yet; and for Slovakia we wait to see."
"– Mr Dunn, I am happy to admit that the Commission cannot know everything."
"Unfortunately there is no that would allow us to gather accurate information from the current Member States."
"However, I am happy to follow up your comments."
"What is more, I believe that our assessments coincide."
"If you receive information about individual or recurring cases of this kind, please do not hesitate to contact me directly and in person."
"I have no problem picking up the telephone in such cases and contacting the relevant Head of Government himself in order to explain what we expect from him and his country."
"As regards the Czech Republic, I had an opportunity to speak to the relevant members of the government just a few days ago in the course of a visit to Prague."
"I expect an answer from Prague very soon, and that will point the way forward."
"I agree with Mr Bowis."
"This is a human rights issue and the European Union has certain possibilities open to it."
"There are provisions in the Nice Treaty meaning that once these countries are full Member States of the EU, they can be sanctioned."
"Austria, for example, was sanctioned by the European Union although it did not actually breach human rights: in fact a political party was elected with which most of us could not agree."
"So the accession countries have to be warned about the possibility of sanctions being imposed on them if they continue to violate human rights."
"It will speed up the process of getting rid of this unsatisfactory situation."
"I would like to remind the honourable Members that this is Question Time, and not a time for opinions or clarifications."
"I say this to all of you, so that you may bear it mind, naturally."
"– As I understand it, Mrs McKenna’s political statement contains a question as to what I think of it."
"It is one that I am happy to answer."
"I agree with you, Mrs McKenna."
"I agree with you except on one point: the European Union has never implemented sanctions against Austria."
"This must be made very clear."
"It was the Member States, acting as sovereign states, who introduced restrictions on bilateral relations."
"The EU as such never imposed any sanctions on Austria."
"Like you, I believe that we cannot allow double standards on human rights in the European Union."
"This means that if we deal with a matter as a human rights issue, it will be treated as such across the board."
"Consequently, if we identify human rights abuses relating to psychiatric treatment, we have to address the issue in all Member States, both new and old."
"Obviously, this can still be done after accession, since the relevant Treaty provisions will remain in force – the provisions that refer to the need to obey and respect the fundamental values on which the European Union is built."
"There is no doubt that these values include respect for human rights."
"It is known that the Commission is closely following developments in Cyprus, with particular regard to the 'elections' to be held in Northern Cyprus on 14 December."
"Earlier this month, the Commission stated that, although a solution to the Cyprus problem is now not a formal condition for the opening of accession negotiations with Turkey, the problem nevertheless constituted it a serious obstacle."
"What is the Commission's assessment of the outcome of the 'elections' in Northern Cyprus?"
"What are the next steps that the Commission plans to take in order to provide a solution to the Cyprus problem under the current circumstances?"
"How do the latest developments in Cyprus influence the issue of Turkey's application for accession?"
"– Mrs Zorba, let me start by saying that no state in the world other than Turkey recognises the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, and I have no plans to change the situation."
"The elections held last Sunday therefore have to be seen as a political move which will have repercussions that could certainly be significant for us."
"The Commission’s initial response is that, three days after the elections, there is still potential for achieving a fair, lasting and viable solution to the conflict in Cyprus by 1 May 2004."
"The Commission continues to urge all parties to use the Annan Plan as a basis for seeking a comprehensive solution to the Cyprus problem."
"As to how this relates to Turkey’s application for membership, the Commission made it clear in the strategy paper published in early November that it does see a political correlation."
"The Commission also noted that failure to find a solution could seriously impede Turkey’s efforts to join the EU."
"Last weekend the European Council responded positively to the Commission’s suggestion that the two be linked politically."
"However, unlike the Commission, the Council did not choose the form of a warning, but rather a reward, indicating that a solution to the Cyprus question would appreciably assist Turkey’s efforts to join the European Union."
"Of course, the underlying message still remains the same and shows the Turkish Government that not only the Commission but also all 15 Member States together with the 10 incoming States consider the two subjects politically related, without wishing to create a new condition or a new requirement."
"Looking ahead to the next steps, the Commission is willing to contribute anything that will help reach a settlement rapidly and to prepare the measures needed for the speedy adoption of Community law in the northern part of the island."
"Let me remind you that, in the event of a solution being found, the Commission has offered to organise an international donor conference in order to find international funds to help correct the economic and social imbalances in the northern part of the island."
"I also want to emphasise that the European Union is willing to accommodate the terms of a solution in Community law and the Union has already earmarked EUR 206 million in aid for northern Cyprus to be made available when a settlement has been agreed."
"To close, let me say that I fervently hope that the Turkish Government in Ankara will understand that it is in their own interest and to their advantage to support the current move to resume the discussions on Cyprus and to use the window of opportunity while it is still open."
"That window of opportunity is limited, but it is still available."
"However one looks at it, it would be better if Cyprus’ accession on 1 May were agreed on the basis of a political solution to the conflict."
"– Commissioner, of course I absolutely agree with your position that these are political processes and I should like to ask you about the most recent statement by Mr Giul, who said that Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot side are preparing a compromise on the island which will be published next week."
"These are recent statements, made yesterday or today."
"I should therefore like to ask if you know any more about this compromise to which he refers and I should also like to ask you about the statement made by Mr Erdogan, who said that no one can turn a blind eye to the will of the people and that the voters wanted to turn the page."
"That is how he addressed the results."
"In your opinion, does this constitute acknowledgment of the victory of the opposition in northern Cyprus and do you think this marks a change in Ankara's position?"
"Finally, I should like to raise another issue: there was a team of observers from the law faculty of the University of Oslo, which sent an announcement today, saying that what they saw was the production of voters to increase support for the governing parties during the last elections."
"I should like to ask you to comment on this issue."
"– Mrs Zorba, the Foreign Minister of Turkey was in Brussels a few days ago."
"I had a long talk with him."
"He did not tell me what might be contained in the compromise his government is currently seeking with the Turkish Cypriots."
"Having spoken to him, however, I had the impression – and he went on to state this publicly, as did Prime Minister Erdogan – that, following the elections in Northern Cyprus, the time may be ripe for relaunching discussions on the basis of the Annan Plan."
"I hope they will continue to think along these lines."
"I regard Prime Minister Erdogan’s statement, which you also quoted, as a positive signal."
"I can endorse this statement and say that this election clearly and unequivocally demonstrates the will of genuine Turkish Cypriots, namely those who actually live in Cyprus."
"It shows that they want both a solution to the conflict based on the UN plan and also to accede to the European Union."
"It would be wise and appropriate to respect the clear will of the majority of the population."
"Thirdly, on the subject of the election observers and their findings, I can tell you that even before the elections I received regular updates from them regarding what they saw."
"On several occasions before the elections I publicly highlighted the manipulation of the electoral registers and also asked the Turkish Government to ensure that this was rectified."
"I have no doubt that the number of voters in this election was in fact artificially inflated, with the intention of manipulating the results."
"Thank you very much for your cooperation this afternoon, Mr Verhaugen."
"There is a point of order."
"I would ask you to make sure it is a point of order, Mr Posselt, since we cannot debate political issues during Question Time."
"– Something happened yesterday which does not belong in the Minutes, where it would merely be out of place, but rather in the full session report."
"I must take advantage of you being here again."
"Yesterday I addressed a question to the Italian President-in-Office of the Council and received an answer."
"I then asked a follow-on question."
"In the full session report, you will remember, I asked whether he was saying yes or no, and his answer was no."
"This ‘no’ does not appear in the full session report, although I recorded it on tape myself."
"What is more, the full session report repeats the second part of his written reply, distorting the overall sense of the question time."
"I would therefore ask, since I am sure you still remember this whole yes and no business yesterday, that the records be corrected."
"You are absolutely right, Mr Posselt."
"I remember the question perfectly well and the answer was a definite ‘no’."
"I will take the appropriate measures so that this is recorded, because the Minutes must reflect what happens in the Chamber, and not other answers which would have been given if this had not been done."
"In agreement with you, I will take the appropriate measures."
"With the ongoing debate and controversy surrounding the issue of whether it is appropriate for the EU's Framework Programme to decide to allow funding of embryonic stem cell research, what kind of a budget does the Commission envisage for research using embryonic stem cells?"
"How many embryos could be destroyed in this process?"
"In which Member States are these embryos?"
"Why does the Commission support research on embryonic stem cells when it has been proved that adult stem cells constitute a sound scientific alternative?"
". – The decisions on the Fifth and Sixth Framework Programmes for Community research and their respective specific programmes do not make any provision for the allocation of a budget specifically devoted to embryonic stem cell research."
"As regards the Fifth Framework Programme, there are two research projects which include activities in which it is planned to use human embryonic stem cell lines."
"As for the Sixth Framework Programme, on the one hand no project has to date received funding for this type of research and, on the other hand, only one project involving an aspect of research using a line of human embryonic stem cells is a possible contender for selection following the initial call for proposals."
"All the cell lines in question are existing lines and were created without the use of Community funding and outside the European Union."
"The Commission does not have any other information, particularly as regards the quantity of human embryos that might be used in Member States for obtaining stem cells."
"Those Member States who authorise and regulate the use of human embryos for obtaining stem cells are currently Belgium, Denmark, Spain, Finland, France, Greece, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom."
"Decisions on the Fifth and Sixth Framework Programmes and their respective specific programmes authorise the financing of research into stem cells of any origin."
"The European Parliament, in its resolution of 19 November this year, came out in favour of Community funding for research activities using both embryonic stem cells and adult stem cells."
"Once this funding has been decided, it would be useful to have a breakdown in the way I requested, because it is very important, considering that in some Member States embryonic stem cell research is forbidden, yet some of those countries – for example, Germany – will be the main funders of this kind of research."
"In the interests of openness and transparency, there should be a clear breakdown and a clear outline of how much is going where and what the results are."
". – I am sure Mr Busquin would be more able to reply in more detail, but I shall make a general remark on how the Community research budget functions."
"We do not fix issues of that sort beforehand: calls for tender are made, thematic priorities are set, assessments from independent experts are received."
"On the basis of this evaluation, projects are selected."
"The kind of breakdown you mention is not normally done in Community research projects, but I can forward your remarks to Commissioner Busquin."
"Several Members have requested the floor for supplementary questions, and furthermore they are all sitting together."
"The first two to request the floor were Mr Purvis and Mr Rübig."
"Mr Posselt had also requested the floor, but you will be aware that only two can speak."
"I am going to use chronological order, I have no other way; if any of you is willing not to put a question, then the other two may do so."
"I should like to ask the Commissioner whether he could confirm that the moratorium on research into using embryonic stem cells is about to be lifted, and that the Commission will be prepared to consider, and potentially fund, applications for research involving embryonic stem cells on the basis of Parliament's resolution of 19 November 2003, which he mentioned."
". – This is an extremely sensitive dossier, which my colleague Mr Busquin has handled with great sensitivity and expertise, so I will be very careful with my replies."
"According to the prepared replies, there are two parts here."
"I shall continue in French."
". – In accordance with that moratorium, research is permitted only on human embryonic stem cells which have been stored in banks or isolated in the form of cultures."
"This moratorium is equivalent to a policy agreement between the Council and the Commission and has no legal value."
"It comes to an end on 31 December 2003 and after that, in the absence of any new legislative text, the Commission is legally obliged to implement the Sixth Framework Programme which authorises this kind of research."
"It will do so, particularly since it has received a very strong political signal from Parliament, which is in favour of this type of research."
"– Commissioner, it is not only Parliament that is divided over this issue, but also the Council."
"There are even divergences in the criminal law provisions in different Member States."
"Let me therefore ask once again: given that the Council cannot agree on this extremely important matter, and given that there is a blocking minority, can the Commission not decide to set the subject aside until the Council has reached agreement?"
"That is my first question."
"My second question is whether you know why Commissioner Busquin never takes part in question time debates on this subject."
"It is not the first time this has happened."
"Perhaps this second question, Mr Posselt, should be communicated to Mr Busquin in any event."
". – Mr Busquin is very strongly present in the European Parliament and all Community institutions."
"I personally have witnessed a great number of debates on this particular issue in which he personally had invested a great deal."
"I undertake to give the honourable Member a reply on this issue later on this week."
"I want to ensure we are precise when we are talking about sensitive legal issues."
"Thank you very much for your cooperation, Mr Liikanen."
"At the beginning of November 2003, the Belgian Federal Minister for Mobility advocated a European ban on night flights."
"He considers it out of the question for Belgium to ban night flights unilaterally because this could have severe repercussions on employment in Belgium due to potential relocation."
"A ban would have less serious repercussions in this respect if it applied throughout the EU."
"Will the Commission draft and submit to the Council and Parliament for debate a proposal for a regulation or directive banning all night flights within the EU, thus enabling hundreds of thousands of people in Europe to sleep undisturbed? If not, why not?"
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission does not intend to present a proposal on the prohibition of night flights at Community level, for various reasons."
"Firstly, the situation with regard to acoustic pollution is not the same in all European airports."
"Some have to confront the negative impact of noise emissions – being located in residential areas and given the density of traffic – circumstances which do not arise in other airports, or to a lesser extent."
"Bearing in mind that the introduction of the prohibition of night flights has repercussions for the economy and employment, we must carefully consider the balance between the various elements, which obliges us to carry out a case-by-case cost-benefit study for each airport, before imposing such a prohibition."
"Secondly, unilateral measures may isolate Europe from the international aviation network; the night-time closure of all European Union airports may constitute a serious obstacle to the normal functioning of that international network."
"In many cases, it is inevitable that flights take place at night, particularly inter-continental flights, in view of the existence of different international time zones and types of cargo."
"The Commission is monitoring noise problems, however, and their impact on citizens living close to airports."
"The Commission therefore has insisted systematically, within the international context of the ICAO, that decisions should be adopted allowing us to provide solutions to deal with the specific needs of the Union in relation to noise at airports."
"On the basis of the decision adopted at the thirty-third assembly of the ICAO in 2001, which establishes the framework for introducing restrictions, including those of night flights, the Commission presented a proposed Directive, which was adopted in March 2002."
"By means of a preliminary analysis and consultation procedure, this Directive allows for the imposition of prohibitions of night flights in Community airports in which it is justified in accordance with objective criteria."
"– Commissioner, I wonder where you live when you stay in Brussels; probably not in the northern part of the city."
"I imagine that you stay in a place where night flights are few and far between, for otherwise your response would be different."
"Do you realise that if there is no general European ban on night flights, this will result in competition between airports and in competition with a downward effect, where the acceptance of noise will be exchanged for jobs?"
"Do you realise that in that way, you contribute towards an economy where the volume and pace of work increases constantly, to the detriment of the quality of life?"
"The standards of the World Health Organisation are crystal clear: night noise leads to more irritability and to depression."
"Could I ask you, Commissioner, to review your intervention, and may I invite you to spend an evening, or a night, with me in the northern part of Brussels, so that you can see for yourself what those people have to put up with day and night?"
". – Mr Staes, I live in an area of Brussels which is very pleasant – as is the whole of Brussels – very lovely, close to a wonderful park, and I have a railway track passing by my house and therefore a series of trains pass each night."
"So I would like to ask you, are we going to prohibit trains from passing because they make noise and wake me up?"
"In my case, since you are interested, I must say that I occasionally hear a train and on occasions they have woken me up, because I do not always sleep sufficiently deeply."
"Mr Staes, I must also tell you that when I bought the house the railway track was already there."
"Secondly, as I have said, we are aware of the problem of noise and international rules have been agreed within the International Civil Aviation Organisation to produce analyses and studies, to consider what solutions are available in order to reduce the acoustic impact in inhabited areas close to airports and to resolve them."
"It is true that one of the possibilities is to suspend nocturnal flights."
"That possibility exists and there are several airports in Europe which are doing so."
"Thirdly, what you are asking, Mr Staes, is that, as well as suspending flights and in order to continue enjoying that tranquillity, airports should close."
"But there are airports which do not have these problems, because nobody is living nearby, because they are more isolated, because they have different routes."
"You are asking, for example, that they should close in the north of Finland in order not to create problems for workers in Brussels."
"Mr Staes, I am not going to propose that."
"Amongst other things because, if I did, it would be a comparative advantage. And competition in Europe is based on a series of values and one of them is this."
"And that is not unfair competition."
"They are quite simply different situations."
"And if Brussels has problems, it must adapt to these situations and, possibly, suspend night flights, but what you cannot ask is for the suspension of night flights in Athens because there are problems in Brussels."
"Perhaps UPS flies to Athens."
"If this is the case, what can I do about it?"
"I could give you several examples of comparative advantage of other types."
"And that is how competition works."
"I am sorry, Mr Staes, but it will not be me who presents that proposal."
"I must inform you that several Members have requested the floor."
"The first two to request the floor were undoubtedly Mr Alavanos and Mr Rübig."
"Furthermore, the Rules of Procedure advise giving the floor to Members of a different political group and nationality to the questioner."
"– Commissioner, obviously you anticipated my question and referred to Athens airport."
"I have listened to your opinion in general on night flights and I agree, and to your opinion on railway lines, which indeed cannot be moved."
"When aeroplanes, however, in order to save a few minutes' flying time or a few litres of fuel, fly over residential areas, instead of turning in to land over the sea, which is exactly what happens at Athens International Airport, thereby disturbing residential areas with hundreds of thousands of residents, what happens then?"
"As far as I know, the European Commission should already have received a complaint on this subject about Athens International Airport and I should like to ask you what happens in this case."
". – Mr Alavanos, what you have just said is absolutely right."
"That is another story, however."
"It is a question of seeking routes which reduce impact and, where necessary, to impose obligations on air companies in order to reduce the impact."
"If necessary, this must go as far as prohibiting flights;"
"I am not saying that flights must not be prohibited."
"And I do not know whether it will be necessary to prohibit nocturnal flights in Athens as well."
"Population, possible solutions, sound levels, and other issues indicate whether or not nocturnal flights have to be prohibited, but not the fact that they have to be prohibited in Brussels."
"In other words, we cannot prohibit them in Athens because they have to be prohibited in Brussels."
"That is what the Commission is not prepared to support."
"What you have said is absolutely right, however."
"Routes and flight paths are extremely important, as well as ways of taking off and, as you say quite rightly, it is true that sometimes, when trying to save fuel, much more noise is produced than is necessary in normal conditions."
"This management is the responsibility of the airports."
"– Commissioner, let me start by saying that I sleep particularly well in Brussels – I am not sure why that is."
"I want to speak, though, as a member of the delegation for relations between the European Union and Switzerland, and we have a problem with night flight restrictions and Zürich airport."
"What is your view on the way in which flights between southern Germany and Zürich have developed, and how will the legal situation evolve in years to come?"
"The fact is there are numerous complaints, meaning on the one hand that aeroplanes are not supposed to approach over Zürich, while the Germans do not want them either."
"As a result, at the moment there is a ban on approach routes over southern Germany, which in turn has led to an increased number of flight approaches over the city of Zürich."
"I would therefore be interested to hear how the European Union, and in particular the Commission, expects this problem to develop in future."
". – Last week we replied to this request, which had been made by the German Government, to implement certain types of restriction."
"They are restrictions on nocturnal flights to Zurich and, quite simply, in accordance with the existing agreements between Switzerland and the European Union in the field of transport and air transport, specifically, and in accordance with the rules of the ICAO and others, they are correct and compatible."
"That was our reply a few days ago."
"The implementation of the Coal Plan in 1998 has seen the Minero Siderúgica de Ponferrada SA (MSP) company receive millions of euros in subsidies, supposedly to create jobs and establish alternative industries."
"Five years on, unemployment has soared (over 1500 jobs lost) and no industries have been established to compensate by creating new jobs."
"The subsidies are supposed to allow MSP to achieve market competitiveness by 2005, and diversify the district’s economy."
"However, what has actually happened is that the subsidies have been diverted to companies which contribute nothing to the local economy."
"Virtually all underground mining operations have been closed down, so that a major part of coal production now comes from the opencast Fonfria and Feixolin mines."
"These two mines, those finished and those which it is intended to open, mean the destruction of the Laciana Valley (an acknowledged World Biosphere Reserve, Special Bird Protection Area and Site of Community Interest)."
"If what is at stake is maintaining a ‘strategic coal reserve’ for emergencies, does the Commission not believe that it would be reasonable to leave easily accessible and exploitable coal seams untouched, the very seams being used for this opencast mining – and maintain the prerequisite underground coal mining for present needs, which is capable of generating employment?"
"– Mr President, the Commission has received broad support for the proposals in the Green Paper ‘Towards a European strategy for the security of energy supply’, in relation to maintaining access to Community reserves of soft coal and maintaining a basic level of production to this effect."
"In accordance with this idea, the Commission has proposed and the Council has approved – with the prior opinion of the European Parliament – Council Regulation (EC) No 1407/2002 of 23 July 2002, on state aid to the coal industry."
"The objectives included in this regulation differ from those mentioned by the honourable Member in relation to the company ."
"Coal companies which receive state aid have always been obliged to pursue economic viability."
"Furthermore, an important innovation in the new Council Regulation is that the contribution of autochthonous coal to the objective of energy security must be carried out within the framework of sustainable development."
"The Commission therefore believes that both opencast and subterranean mines can respect the principles of sustainable development in so far as they comply with Community legislation."
"Mrs de Palacio, for months now I have sometimes had difficulty following your arguments, and that is still the case as regards your reply on the subject of coal."
"You say that we should continue opencast mining in Europe because there is a supply problem."
"There are no shortages on the world coal market."
"There has been no fluctuation in prices for decades, and there has never been any pressure on Europe, which has no difficulty in obtaining coal."
"This shows that you do not have any objective criteria."
"The ‘percentage of imports’ criterion cannot be regarded as a threat to our security of supply."
"We are much more seriously threatened by, for example, computer viruses."
"To come back to this particular Spanish case, we have the impression that in the region concerned, Mr Victorino Alonso, who is the boss of the various undertakings, is misusing the money that Europe gives him, because he is using the money to improve the competitiveness of his undertakings, whereas it is money that ought to be used to preserve jobs in the region."
"Mr Turmes, I would ask you to put supplementary questions."
"I have already said this today."
"The Rules of Procedure provide for other opportunities for statements and debates."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that Mr Turmes is talking about something different, otherwise I do not understand."
"The aid for coal is not European aid, because Europe gives nothing to , but it is aid from the Spanish national government, not from Europe."
"The Commission and the European Union, at Community level, do not fund aid to the coal sector."
"Mr Turmes must be talking about national aid received by that company within the framework of the restructuring plan for coal presented by Spain."
"I would also say to Mr Turmes that the Commission has no record of the things you are talking about."
"What are the forecasts for the implementation of the high speed rail link between Galicia and Portugal from Ferrol to Lisbon?"
"In what year is the work expected to be completed?"
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the lines mentioned in the oral question are part of the priority project no 8, multimodal axis Portugal-Spain-rest of Europe, included in the Commission’s Decision of 1996 on the Community guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network."
"The growth initiative has also considered that the cross-border Vigo-Oporto line fulfilled the conditions for being included on the so-called ‘quick start list’ for which, as the honourable Members are aware, as well as being part of the trans-European networks, it must have a cross-border component and work on it must begin immediately, that is to say, in the next three years (2004-2006)."
"During the period 2000-2006 the Cohesion Fund is financing the Miño line, to the north of Oporto."
"The decisions relating to the granting of total aid of EUR 87 million for the Nine-Braga-Lousada-Nine lines will be adopted in the coming days."
"Since 1987, studies on the Galician Atlantic Ferrol-Portuguese border railway line have received Community aid, which in 2003 amounted to a total of almost EUR 6 million."
"For the period 2004-2006 it is intended to allocate another EUR 5 million to fund studies on this rail axis, in response to a new request from the Spanish authorities."
"With regard to the Spanish railway line between Ferrol and the Portuguese border, several technical studies have been completed and many are still in the process of being produced."
"Work has already begun to the north of Vigo."
"According to the information received from the national authorities – Portuguese and Spanish – the Vigo-La Coruña line is expected to enter into service in 2007 and the Vigo-Oporto link in 2009, and the La Coruña-Ferrol line, which would complete the section of the line in Spanish territory, would be ready and operational from 2010."
"In its appeal concerning the implementation by Greece of Regulation (EEC) 3577/92(1) and in particular Article 3, paragraph 2, the Commission states that the right of the host state to regulate the manning of vessels carrying out cabotage is restricted to the deck and engine-room crew."
"However in its reply to my question P-3616/97(2) it had adopted a completely different position: 'Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) 3577/92 dealing with manning covers all aspects relating to the crew (...)"
"In particular, when assessing the number of jobs involved in the passenger and ferry services and cruise activities, the cabin crew and catering personnel have been taken into account as part of the crew.'"
"Will the Commission say why and by what procedure it changed its position and no longer considers cabin crew and catering personnel as part of the crew covered by Article 3, paragraph 2, of the Regulation?"
"Is it unaware of the safety problems which will be caused by the existence of mixed crews on passenger ships and car ferries, particularly in view of the tragic accidents that have occurred in the European Union, and does it assume responsibility for this?"
"Does it intend to support the principle of the 'host state' particularly with regard to cruise ships?"
". – The Commission understands that the honourable Member is referring to an issue which is before the Court of Justice relating, amongst other things, to the conditions applicable to the crew laid down in Greek legislation for ships which carry out cabotage services."
"In the request relating to this issue the Commission made no distinction between the rules applicable to deck crew and those applicable to engine-room crew."
"The rules on crews are applicable to the crew of the ship as a whole."
"What the Commission reproaches the Greek state for in relation to this issue is the application of the rules of the host state for cruise ships for which Regulation (EEC) No 3577/92 lays down the application of the rules of the flag State."
"The application of the rules on the crew of the host state for island cabotage is intended solely for regular services."
"Furthermore, in this case as well, the applicable national rules may not contravene the principle of free provision of services."
"Therefore, any requirement imposed by national legislation with regard to the crew may not introduce restrictions which are not justified by urgent reasons of general interest and the restrictions must be proportionate to the intended objective."
"Within this context, the Commission would point out that the SOLAS and STCW Conventions – ratified by all the States of the Union – contain rules with regard to crews of ships, the objective of which is precisely safety at sea."
"As it pointed out in its recent communication on the interpretation of Regulation (EEC) No 3577/92, the Commission believes that, with regard to the rules in the field of safety and training, any condition which goes further than the rules contained in those Conventions would constitute a disproportionate restriction of the free provision of services."
"– Mr President, I think that there is a contradiction in the Commission's positions and I shall ask a question so that the Commissioner can resolve my doubt: apart from the question of cruise ships, I should like to ask the Commissioner, in relation to other passenger ships, if she believes that the host state can regulate the manning of cabotage vessels not just for the deck and engine crew, but also for the cabin crew and catering personnel."
"In other words, are the rights of the host state the same when it comes to the deck and engine crew and the cabin crew and catering personnel?"
". – Mr President, this issue is before the Court, and the situation is that, on 1 January, the special transitional period which Greece has enjoyed will also come to an end, in application of the Directive in force, and, therefore, it will not be possible to discriminate in any way."
"Furthermore, Mr Alavanos, we are talking about the crew as a whole."
"In any event, the Court will inform us of all the elements and will put an end to our doubts, if we have any."
"Thank you very much for your cooperation with Parliament this evening, Mrs de Palacio."
"Since the time allotted to Questions to the Commission has elapsed, Questions Nos 37 to 72 will be replied to in writing.(3)"
"That concludes Questions to the Commission."
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0457/2003) from the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the Council common position with a view to adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the promotion of cogeneration based on a useful heat demand in the internal energy market and amending Directive 92/42/EEC (10345/2/2003 – C5-0444/2003 – 2002/0185(COD)) (Rapporteur: Norbert Glante)."
"– Commissioner, a very good evening to you."
"I was in my seat in good time for the start."
"This evening’s debate, which we are holding in the cosy circle of insiders, revolves around a technology – cogeneration – which is a recognised environmental tool."
"Cogeneration can be used in many different ways, from district heating, mainly in northern Europe, to production plants, as in the ceramics and paper industries in other countries."
"Cogeneration, involves the simultaneous production of electricity and heat in what is usually an energy-saving process."
"This directive focuses primarily on high-efficiency cogeneration, namely processes which offer energy savings of at least 10%."
"This is one of the main reasons why cogeneration is used as a means of increasing energy efficiency and why it contributes to greater security of supply."
"Last month’s blackouts have demonstrated that we need to do something to improve security of supply."
"I would like to start by commenting on the way the Council deals with Parliament."
"This directive has been under discussion since September 2002 – nearly 18 months."
"The first reading in Parliament was very controversial."
"The second reading was much more consensus-oriented."
"Unfortunately, the Council common position accepted very few of the amendments proposed by this House."
"During the second reading, the Council again showed little flexibility and openness to our demands."
"As I see it, the Council adopted a ‘no can do’ position from the outset and we were repeatedly told that there was no scope for going beyond the common position."
"In my view, there were times when the way in which the negotiations were conducted was closer to a consultation procedure than to codecision."
"The compromise solutions were eventually adopted not because I as rapporteur was completely happy with the result, but rather because the Council put pressure on Parliament – there being no longer enough time for a conciliation procedure if the Council was to keep to schedule."
"More pressure was applied through the statements made by a number of delegations in the Council questioning the need for a directive promoting cogeneration, and making it clear that the directive would be blocked if Parliament requested anything beyond this support."
"Let me now tell you what I think merits praise in this directive."
"The aim of the directive is to promote cogeneration technologies, which can help to improve energy efficiency and security of supply."
"Cogeneration is now on the European Union’s energy policy agenda."
"The directive means the Union now has a policy on cogeneration."
"Europe has a harmonised definition of cogeneration, meaning that there is now a common understanding of what cogeneration is."
"Classification as high-efficiency cogeneration is determined using a two-stage process as defined in Annexes II and III of the directive."
"Firstly, cogenerated electricity is calculated using the Prothermo method as described in Annex II."
"Based on this method and taking into account the results from a CEN/CENELEC workshop currently in progress, the Commission is to devise a standard calculation for cogenerated electricity and the necessary guidelines for using it."
"Secondly, in order to qualify as high efficiency cogeneration, the process must provide energy savings of at least 10%, as laid down in Annex III."
"The Commission will provide harmonised reference values for calculating the energy savings."
"This was an important step forward and an important demand on Parliament’s part."
"The order in which Annexes II and III are applied has not been harmonised."
"The alternative calculation methods will therefore remain valid, and these will, if necessary, be harmonised in a new draft Commission directive."
"A standard procedure for issuing certificates of origin has already been provided, which is important for cross-border trade and therefore for the single market."
"The Member States are required to compile statistical data about national generation of electricity and heat using cogeneration."
"The Member States also have to assess the potential for using cogeneration and inform the Commission of their conclusions."
"The Commission is required to evaluate these reports and, if necessary, submit an action plan for developing cogeneration in the EU."
"National instruments and financial support should focus on primary energy savings."
"Legal and other barriers are to be removed."
"The directive establishes a definition of and a special status for micro-cogeneration."
"Under this directive, micro-cogeneration refers to installations with a maximum capacity of 50kWe."
"Micro-cogeneration operators may use certified values for calculation purposes, thus reducing their administrative burden."
"Member States can facilitate access to the grid for small installations and micro-cogeneration operators."
"Obviously we would have liked to see more on this subject."
"So what does not appear in the directive that we would have liked to see included?"
"There are no targets set for the EU or individual Member States, no special assistance, and insufficient support for micro-cogeneration installations, which unfortunately means there is no assistance for increasing market penetration over the next few years."
"There are no practical measures aimed at increasing cogeneration as a proportion of total electricity generation in Europe, and grid access for cogenerated electricity is not adequately regulated in terms of support measures."
"At the moment, existing calculation methods have not been harmonised – in fact, alternative methods are valid until 2010."
"Cogeneration powered by nuclear energy has not been excluded from the scope of the directive."
"The European Parliament would undoubtedly have wished for a more ambitious directive."
"But at least this directive establishes a common understanding of cogeneration and lays a foundation for the promotion of cogeneration in Europe."
"The course has been set for harmonising calculation methods for cogenerated electricity and primary energy savings."
"The Member States are going to have to consider the technology, because they have to evaluate the national generation capacities and potential then report to the Commission. The Commission is required to present an action plan for developing cogeneration if there is no increase in cogeneration usage."
"This places cogeneration policy on the agenda at EU level, which represents a great success for the European Union."
"Let me close by challenging the Member States to report on the national potential for extending cogeneration as soon as possible, to make use of that potential, and to remove any and all barriers to increasing the share of cogeneration."
"I also say to the Commission that we need a new directive on European support schemes and total harmonisation of the energy market as soon as possible."
"As I conclude, let me thank my co-rapporteurs, the shadow rapporteurs, all those colleagues who have contributed, and also the Commission."
"I think we worked well together."
"In our discussions I repeatedly emphasised my understanding of a compromise as a solution that is slightly painful to all sides."
"I hope everyone has suffered to the same degree, and I hope that when we adopt the compromise amendments tomorrow we will have a reasonable directive."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to say it is a great satisfaction to me to think that we are on the point of completing the process of adopting the Directive on the promotion of cogeneration."
"In this regard, I would like in particular to thank the rapporteur, Mr Glante, and also the other shadow rapporteurs and the other MEPs responsible, who have worked intensively on this Directive which is so important to Europe's energy policy and, at the same time, so technically complex in many cases."
"The directive on the promotion of cogeneration is a step forward, which is intended to help to resolve the problems faced by our energy sector in Europe, such as the need to save energy and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions."
"High efficiency cogeneration means greater efficiency, since it implies energy savings and therefore reductions in emissions."
"We are also considering cogeneration with renewable energy sources, at a time when this helps us to increase the security of supply and to reduce the vulnerability relating to the transport of electricity, sometimes across long distances; in fact, cogeneration normally means greater proximity between the production of electricity and the demand for it and therefore brings generation closer to consumption."
"It also means greater flexibility in the energy supply, since, I would insist, cogeneration can be carried out on the basis of any fuel, including renewable energy sources."
"The European industry has been demanding a regulation of this type for a long time; it follows our work very closely and I believe that everybody considers what we can achieve tonight and tomorrow, in the vote, to be a good agreement – earlier Mr Glante said that ‘it does a little harm to everyone’, perhaps that is partly why it is a good agreement."
"There is an extremely important point, which Mr Glante has pointed out, which is that in cogeneration they are different concepts, which are hidden depending on the different countries."
"Thanks to this discussion we are converging these different concepts, leading us to something which appears essential: that cogeneration is genuine cogeneration and means an improvement in the true global energy balance."
"The establishment of objectives in relation to the promotion of cogeneration has been one of the fundamental issues in the debate between the Council and Parliament, and I believe that ensuring that the Member States are prepared to determine and notify their potentials is a very important step forward, and is the correct one."
"These reports will have to be published and subjected to examination by all the parties involved, and I have no doubt that the viable potentials will be followed by the measures necessary to implement and utilise the potential of cogeneration for energy efficiency."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament’s amendments have clearly improved not just the initial Directive, which we had presented to Parliament and the Council, but also the common position and, in particular, on this point which the rapporteur referred to, microgeneration, a new and promising technology."
"I am delighted by Parliament’s initiatives to insist on this issue and to provide the modifications which allow it to be included directly into our Directive."
"Parliament has also contributed to other improvements to the common position, such as the authorisation of the committee responsible for the complex technical details and adapting the thresholds of technical development, and I would like to thank them once again for the work they have done, which has demonstrated once again the seriousness and skill of this Parliament, even when we are dealing with and discussing enormously technical issues, as in this case."
"I congratulate you on the wonderfully high quality of your work."
"I would like once again to thank the rapporteur, Mr Glante, all the shadow rapporteurs and the other participants in these debates for their contributions."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, let me start by thanking you for your kind words acknowledging Parliament’s efforts."
"We know that it is not only engineers who sit in Parliament but also good, elected politicians who seek to make the best of each proposal."
"In particular, I would like to thank Mr Glante and also Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca, who have been very involved in this discussion."
"I think we have learnt a great deal over the past few months about the technology involved, and eventually concluded that, at the end of the day, this is still a political decision."
"I would also like to express my thanks for the compromise solution, which received substantial support from our colleagues."
"I think our colleagues’ work represents an even greater achievement given the complexity of the subject matter they had to get to grips with."
"The way the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has voted indicates that this directive will be approved tomorrow."
"I think it is a good thing that we have avoided a conciliation procedure."
"Perhaps we could have included a few more items that way, but I consider that the main points of our general approach are already present."
"We wanted to play it safe and make sure we had a directive since, particularly next year, when the internal market comes out of the budgets, the directive will clearly be very important for establishing a level playing field for all market players from the outset."
"That is also why the relevant definitions were very important."
"Our aim is to improve the security of our energy supply."
"Obviously we can make use of micro-cogeneration, for a start."
"We want to see lots of market players, who will improve the security of energy supply but will also increase energy efficiency and above all – I think this was the really decisive factor – will improve grid security."
"The blackouts have taught us all that there is often a great difference between the electricity traded and that which is actually supplied, and consequently that we need a lot of points in the grid to provide grid stability."
"Residential users then have an opportunity later on to recover part of their energy bill as electricity supply."
"Micro-cogeneration provides an opportunity for householders to obtain more efficient and cheaper energy along with greater energy security from the energy industry as domestic users."
"This benefits both the public sector and domestic consumers, and we are here to work for the good of our citizens."
"I believe that lower energy bills will result in a healthier bank balance for every citizen."
"A standard definition of cogeneration is essential."
"I think that the most important point is actually our declaration that we will accept different calculation methods, notably the CEN proposal, which we await with great interest."
"We have Prothermo as a basis, but the Commission should also carefully examine our proposals for calculating net electricity."
"This sets a standard that will, in future, be very important for everyone."
"Another particularly important element is the equal weighting given to producers’ own consumption of cogenerated electricity and electricity fed into the grid, and therefore to mechanical and other plants which do not feed into the grid."
"Energy is very important in this support system."
"I think we have achieved the best possible result."
"No one got everything, but I think this optimum solution will also allow us to show how important Europe is, including in our elections next year."
"– Mr President, I thank the rapporteur, Mr Glante, for what was a considerable task."
"Increased CHP is one of the best means to improve the efficiency of the energy economy and reduce greenhouse gases that result from this sort of generation."
"Let us combat emissions with science, efficiency and moderation."
"We in Finland have a lot of good things to say about cogeneration."
"We are pioneers in this field."
"Cogeneration now accounts for a third of the electricity produced in Finland."
"I support the directive, as it will provide an impetus for increased generation of this type throughout Europe."
"The Union really must set an example in this area."
"It is to be hoped that initiatives of this kind will also be adopted by our new neighbours as speedily as possible, so that production might also be increased in this way in the Union’s neighbouring regions."
"In our national strategy this path has almost reached its end and district heating plants and industrial sites have on the whole already exploited cogeneration."
"Our energy economy is very diverse, versatile and efficient."
"The price of electricity should be lowered, and on that point I agree with the previous speaker."
"We realise that it is important that it should remain within the powers of decision of the Member States as to what means are used to increase common targets."
"We are out of step with one another within the Union in this regard."
"I would like to mention one detail."
"I am in favour of the Council’s support for the amendment in the report which states that it would be the Commission’s task to assess the effects of a harmonised calculation method and propose further action to promote harmonisation."
"I support this approach because it must be the long-term aim to harmonise definitions employed in national objectives."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, I too want to thank Mr Glante, on behalf of my party, for producing a very creditable report."
"He has done a lot of work to promote this idea, listened to the various parties and achieved a good end result."
"I heartily support cogeneration, which is an environmental and energy policy instrument for increasing energy efficiency and improving the security of energy supplies."
"As Mr Paasilinna just said, we in Finland have good things to say about cogeneration."
"Producing a directive to apply to the Union as a whole is a difficult process, because the directive is a technically demanding one and circumstances and practices vary greatly between the Member States."
"Our group supports the compromises drafted by the rapporteur and hopes the directive will now speedily move forward."
"In my opinion it is important that this issue should be taken forward, albeit one step at a time."
"The EU is very dependent on imports of energy."
"This creates uncertainty, and rising import ratios increase the risk of supplies being interrupted."
"It is essential to increase the share of cogeneration."
"This directive can create a framework for increased cogeneration."
"The Member States must jointly approve the defined criteria whereby binding targets may be achieved."
"Experience has shown that if targets are not binding on Member States, progress is slow."
"The potential for cogeneration can be optimised when the various operators are aware of the opportunities that are available to exploit the technology and find compatible systems."
"Accordingly, it is particularly important that there is cooperation between different operators and that they can exchange information on good practices."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, we have added another floor to the building of the Union’s energy policy which the Commission – and in particular Vice-President de Palacio – have been promoting since the beginning of this legislative period."
"The well-known cornerstones of this energy policy are security of supply, reducing our energy bill and the preservation of the environment."
"Cogeneration is a very valuable instrument in terms of fulfilling these objectives and therefore this directive was timely and necessary."
"We have seen clearly during this discussion and the production of this important legislative initiative that sometimes two interests, two sectors, are in clear conflict."
"In this case, the two interests to be harmonised were that of those who produce heat and that of those who use heat in an industrial process."
"These two interests in conflict were represented curiously by two physical parameters: the energy efficiency of the installation and the saving of primary energy."
"What we have done through our work together has been to try to ultimately achieve a balanced approach which establishes the foundations for the promotion of cogeneration, dealing objectively with all the interests involved in this significant activity."
"I believe, Mr President, that we have achieved this thanks to the excellent work of the rapporteur, Mr Glante, and of the various Members who have contributed to this objective and ultimately we have demonstrated that consensus does not always spoil things, but there are occasions when consensus, in the end, achieves a result which today we can all celebrate."
"I would therefore like to end, Mr President, by expressing my satisfaction with this achievement."
"We have undoubtedly taken a step forward in relation to this energy policy which we all share and let us hope that this directive will soon result in a harmonised method and a unified model for promoting cogeneration which allows us to achieve the objectives which we have all been pursuing for some time."
"– Mr President, to complete the picture, let me say that the Council sent a letter to the Secretariat and to me, so the formalities have been observed."
"The Council has acknowledged our compromise."
"I had an opportunity to speak yesterday about the report by Mr Chichester."
"At that time we had not received any letter."
"So we have made some progress."
"I now want to make sure that it is clear to those concerned what CHP really means."
"It means Christmas Holiday Package."
"I think we all deserve a pat on the back, and I wish you a merry Christmas."
"– Mr President, this issue has been debated in many forums and I thank the rapporteur for his considerable input with regard to this matter, which is essentially connected with the workings of the internal market and cogeneration and which will hopefully now be brought to a conclusion."
"With the latest compromise proposals the directive has indeed progressed in the right direction."
"It is good that no national targets are being set: the approach is positive and encouraging."
"CHP should be promoted, as it is an efficient and natural way to produce electricity and heat."
"It is also important that financial support for CHP should not be restricted to electric power plants generating less than 50 megawatts."
"We should oppose the financial support proposed for small-scale CHP, for example by providing them with a free connection to the grid and guaranteeing prices."
"This would distort competition in the open electricity market which we are trying right now to create within the EU."
"Small-scale CHP should be supported in other ways, optionally, without distorting competition, and where CHP is a cost-effective technology."
"Biomass should become a more frequent option as a fuel in cogeneration."
"It would be a way of furthering the realisation of targets related to the use of renewables and reducing emissions."
"Talks on emissions trading might result in the special financial support for cogeneration proving to be superfluous."
"It is expected that emissions trading will in any case lead to a rise in energy prices, putting a strain on users in the market as a result."
"It is important to promote cogeneration, as it is a good solution both economically and environmentally."
"The agreed compromise proposals now constitute a step forward with regard to this issue."
". – Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you all for your speeches."
"I would like to point out that, as Alejo Vidal-Quadras has quite rightly pointed out, through this definition we have managed to combine and include within the concept of cogeneration the two types of cogeneration which furthermore are usually divided in accordance with European geography; that which pursues energy efficiency in an industrial process and that which pursues it in the field of the production of heat essentially associated with the task of heating in communities."
"In the end, we have produced this global definition, we have a positive energy balance, which means that, by means of cogeneration, these results are achieved with less consumption of energy than would be required by the production of these two activities separately."
"That is what we are aiming for: greater overall energy efficiency."
"On this occasion consensus – as the honourable Member said a moment ago – brings positive results."
"I believe that achieving a good consensus means combining, overcoming, rather than watering down or weakening, and, as in this case, we are building and strengthening the support for this series of measures which, together, throughout this time have made up a European energy policy."
"There still remains as a possible outstanding issue, the nuclear security package, on which I hope Parliament will soon give its opinion; then we will have the package presented the other day by the Council, the new energy package, which will be the third package following the gas and electricity packages, in order to guarantee greater security in this supply in a liberalised market and in order to deal with the reality of enlargement."
"This is the final plenary session of this year, the final new year of this legislature."
"There will be another legislature and I hope that all of you will be sitting here – if you wish to be – but I believe it is important to assess what we have done."
"We have moved on from statements on energy efficiency, cogeneration, the use of renewable energy sources – which were often wonderful and full of goodwill, but mere statements nonetheless – to taking measures with specific objectives in order to promote energy efficiency, cogeneration and the use of renewable energy sources in different areas and in different applications."
"We have also worked in other areas, such as security of supply and effective operation of the market, issues which raise problems in relation to this vital element of energy, not to mention issues such as security in the nuclear field, which I referred to a moment ago."
"I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the honourable Members for their work and cooperation throughout all this time, in particular, on this directive, which is complex, but which I believe will have very positive effects, and I wish you a happy Christmas and all the best for 2004."
"Thank you, Commissioner, and Christmas greetings to you."
"That concludes the debate."
"The vote will be at 11.30 a.m. tomorrow."
"The next item is the report (A5-0431/2003) by Jürgen Zimmerling, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council extending and amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1659/98 on decentralised cooperation (COM(2003) 413 – C5-0319/2003 – 2003/0156(COD))."
". – Mr President, firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Zimmerling, for his work on this regulation and especially for the efforts he made to conclude the legislative process at first reading."
"The objective of our proposal is primarily to extend the legal basis for the decentralised cooperation budget line for an additional period of three years."
"This will ensure the continuity of the budget line until the end of 2006 when the new financial perspectives will be established."
"It will also give time for a more thorough discussion with all concerned partners on the role of the budget line and its financial allocation."
"The outcome of this discussion should provide the basis for a revision of the strategic guidelines for the decentralised cooperation instrument in a longer-term perspective."
"The latest evaluation of the implementation of this budget line which was sent to Parliament in July insisted on the strong added value of the concept of decentralised cooperation as a complementary tool for the actions implemented under the national indicative programmes in favour of the local civil society."
"The proposed amendments by the Committee on Development are mainly intended to clarify the eligibility of some decentralised cooperation agents to ensure better coherence with the comitology used and to guarantee better reporting on the implementation of actions financed under this budget line."
"The Commission is happy to agree with all these amendments."
"They reflect well the fruitful discussions between the rapporteur, the Council working group and the Commission services."
"The sole exception would be Amendment No 5 concerning the increase of the financial allocation from EUR 18 million to 36 million."
"I understand Parliament's concerns that greater emphasis should be given to strengthening the role of local actors, and in particular southern civil society, in development cooperation."
"We are making a considerable effort in this direction."
"However, as I explained in the letter I sent to Parliament two weeks ago, it is not necessary to seek additional funds specifically for decentralised cooperation on this budget line, as it is clear from our proposal that the financing proposed is to be used primarily in situations of difficult partnership."
"In other areas the geographical instruments may be used."
"I need to confirm here that the Commission, fully supported on this by the Council, cannot accept the proposed increase in the budget."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we are considering a regulation which expires at the end of the year."
"The role of this report is to provide a successor."
"We want to continue with the existing and worthwhile provisions in 2004-06, and in order for the legal basis to allow a seamless transition we want to try to succeed on the first reading, together with the Council and the Commission."
"We seem to have been successful so far, in that all the amendments proposed today are, on the whole, very worthy of support."
"We have sought to put the emphasis on the initiatives and stakeholders in the decentralised cooperation in the developing countries themselves rather than those in the European Union."
"The wording of Amendment No 10 is now the result of a compromise proposed by Mr Sauquillo Pérez del Arco and myself, and now states, among other things, that independent establishments are also included."
"We have adopted the wording used in Recital 11 on the status of churches and ideological groups in the Annex to the Treaty of Amsterdam to ensure that the ministers could accept it without any difficulties."
"The Commissioner has already said that Amendment No 5 is the real sticking point."
"Everything else has also been agreed in the Committee on Development and Cooperation."
"Amendment No 5 provides for an increase from EUR 18 million to EUR 36 million."
"I have to say that while obviously I would like to see such an increase, given the current situation I do not think this report and the new regulation are the appropriate place for demanding one. It would undoubtedly mean – as the Council has made very clear – that no solution would be agreed at first reading."
"For that reason, I would prefer to stick with the EUR 18 million, as per the proposal, and then set a higher figure in the new negotiations for 2007 onwards."
"Mr President, I would like firstly to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Zimmerling, on his work, which has allowed us to reach a consensus on a good regulation on decentralised cooperation, which is necessary to the process of modernising Community development policy."
"And this consensus has been reached not just in Parliament, but at interinstitutional level, which means that, as soon as possible and for the next three years, we will have a renewed legal basis for implementing this policy."
"Decentralised cooperation, that is to say, the participation of non-state actors and sub-state bodies – both of the European countries and of the receiving countries – is a necessary condition for a participative development which responds to the needs and initiatives of the population to which cooperation is ultimately directed."
"It is an added factor in the democratisation of developing societies, since by means of decentralised cooperation the social fabric is strengthened, and it is also a proven element in the effectiveness of aid and a factor in making the concept of appropriation of development processes a reality."
"Development cooperation ceased some time ago to be solely bilateral or multilateral and governmental or non-governmental."
"The Group of the Party of European Socialists therefore enthusiastically supports increasingly improved decentralised cooperation."
"Let us accept therefore that – from the point of view of sustainable and participative local development – neither those people in Europe who believe that this approach may be used to encourage movements outside of the States nor the authorities of the receiving countries who are afraid of losing control over the aid which they consider to be their own are right."
"Decentralised cooperation looks more towards the actors than towards economic resources or the sectoral contents of cooperation."
"With regard to economic resources – mentioned by the rapporteur – we have given up our initial desire for greater allocation of funds for the sake of the interinstitutional agreement, but we have a commitment from the Commission to maintain adequate execution of the programme and we believe, however, that the decentralised cooperation line must continue to increase and not be a minor budget line from which funds can be taken in order to fill other gaps."
"At the moment we have EUR 9 million for the first year and EUR 6 million for the two following years in line B7-6002, without prejudice to the fact that resources from geographical lines can benefit decentralised cooperation actions."
"We do not believe this to be satisfactory – we would like to have more – but, for the sake of consensus, we can reach this agreement."
"Since we are talking about a transversal line, it has no sectoral limits and we in the Group of the Party of European Socialists have tried to open it up to the greatest possible number of beneficiaries, so that social organisation is effectively promoted."
"It is made explicit that local public powers are also considered municipal authorities and we are happy with the extension of the Regulation and the modifications which have been introduced, bearing in mind the references to the Gemelli, Carrilho and Howitt reports and we hope that the Commission will henceforth comply with the time periods for assessment and presentation of results established by Parliament so that we can analyse the effectiveness of this instrument in terms of development."
"Mr President, for the Greens, decentralised cooperation is an essential element of cooperation and development policy."
"In fact, it is one of the only constituents of that policy which guarantees the real use of funds by the nations of the South."
"Mr Zimmerling’s report is a step in the right direction, in that he has created a real instrument which guarantees the participation of citizens in developing countries."
"The Howitt report had already opened up some interesting lines of action, and this new report improves even further the collaboration with non-governmental organisations."
"We welcome the development of the list of potential partners."
"It is particularly important to us that account should be taken of the organisations of the indigenous populations."
"They are in many cases minorities and suffer opposition from the public authorities, which more often than not represent authoritarian powers."
"As far as those who are actually involved are concerned, however, the question of the churches gives rise to problems."
"Although it seems obvious to everyone that charitable organisations, including those of a religious nature, can benefit from funds for decentralised cooperation, on the other hand it seems inconceivable to me that the European Union should, under this heading, be funding the churches themselves, since by definition their aim is proselytisation."
"Are we going to finance Catholic churches or Protestant chapels in Moslem countries, or the building of mosques in Christian countries?"
"We discussed this with the rapporteur, who seemed to have understood the problem that was raised."
"The fact that this viewpoint was retained before the vote in committee may have looked like an oversight."
"Now, however, when the Committee on Development and Cooperation has rejected this word, and by a large majority, its re-insertion through the intervention of the Council Presidency, which has used a version of the Treaty of Amsterdam – minus its philosophical elements – leaves me somewhat puzzled as to the final objective of this text."
"In the absence of any clarification on this point, we shall not be able to vote in favour of this report."
"I would therefore strongly urge my fellow Members to return to the amendment adopted at the committee stage, whereby the list was restricted to charitable organisations."
"It is vital that as many representatives of civil society as possible can make their opinions known, and can have recourse to funding which is independent of their state authorities, so as to strengthen the independence of social movements which are campaigning for sustainable development, for human rights and for social rights, for democratisation or for cultural pluralism."
"This is why we are asking that the overall funding should be increased from EUR 18 million to EUR 36 million."
"This appears to us to be vitally important if all those involved are to take part in the debate."
"In other words, it is not enough to create a good policy: it is even more important to provide it with adequate financial resources."
"– Mr President, the best way of providing development aid is by doing justice to the local context in developing countries."
"It stands to reason that there needs to be consultation with local parties."
"The instrument of decentralised cooperation, however, has raised a few questions."
"First of all, the separate budget line; a line for decentralised cooperation is an experiment of recent years."
"The assessment that the Commission has commissioned shows no trace of effective implementation."
"It is therefore unreasonable to persist with a separate budget line."
"Unfortunately, I cannot find this consideration in the report."
"The selection of projects, in particular, is problematic."
"A transparent framework is required within which the delegations select the right projects."
"The criteria for this selection should be sound and their application insightful."
"According to the assessment report, however, the selection process is not transparent at all."
"Moreover, follow-up and assessment are inadequate; in fact, according to the assessment report, they are absent."
"Whilst the Commission’s delegations appreciate the instrument’s flexibility, the lack of transparency and assessment cause me to conclude that its flexibility is excessive."
"Finally, the Commission has proposed an increase in the budget; the Zimmerling report goes further and proposes a huge increase, but neither the Commission document nor the report adduce convincing arguments for this increase."
"In short, there is no reason for great faith in the correctness of the approach adopted."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, decentralised cooperation should be seen as one element of sustainable development, which values the role of local operators, provides incentives for consolidating civil society and promotes partners, not only ."
"We must give our full support to the Commission proposal examined in the report."
"I must emphasise, however, that the issue of decentralised cooperation should be addressed more consistently."
"For example, this proposal should have been presented some time ago."
"I must point out that, at the time of the first extension, when I was asked to draw up a report, the presentation was already extremely late."
"Issues relating to the financial framework must be emphasised: predicting an increase undoubtedly sends out a positive message, perhaps the only one possible, but is still far from adequate, mainly because we cannot confine ourselves to making funds available."
"We must also make a more serious effort to increase understanding of this type of aid, so that it is not always the same people who benefit from it, such as those who, as a result of having better connections, are better positioned to have the necessary information and explanations."
"Whether or not more candidates are put forward depends largely on us, on the way in which we disseminate information, on our making the application processes less bureaucratic."
"The Commission delegations could give some support at the stage of submitting applications."
"I wish, lastly, to congratulate Mr Zimmerling on the work he has undertaken and to support the amendments that have been tabled, in particular those concerned with extending the range of potential beneficiaries – and here I would underline all those that I mentioned – and with strengthening networks operating in the field of human rights and democratisation processes."
". – Mr President, may I begin by expressing my appreciation of the political signals that have been expressed in these different contributions."
"I agree with everybody who has said that this is an important and interesting area of activity."
"I also appreciate the realistic and constructive reaction to the need to keep to the budget level, which is necessary to move it forward."
"I would make one additional remark, namely, that when we look at volume and this activity, the big show is the funding of non-State actors in ACP countries starting up now."
"In general, the average money available is between 5 and 10% of the country envelope, when we look at the whole group of ACP countries."
"This is for funding local NGOs, non-State actors and civil society in a broad sense."
"The idea is that the decision-making here will mainly be in the hands of our head of delegation there."
"That is truly decentralised cooperation."
"What we have here is a budget line managed out of Brussels which we decentralised cooperation – a somewhat bureaucratic approach reflecting a time when we did not have the Cotonou agreement's new dimension of directly funding partners in civil society in those 78 countries."
"That is not to say that this budget line and this instrument are becoming irrelevant, because they cover the whole geography, not only the ACP countries."
"However, it underscores that the actual activity as such is something which has more to it than what we are discussing here."
"So I see this budget line and the regulation and handling of it by Parliament as a way of clarifying the intentions."
"However, there is – like the iceberg – something bigger below the surface of this budget line, and it is important to keep that in mind."
"Let me again thank you for a constructive reaction by Parliament."
"That concludes the debate."
"The vote will be at 11.30 a.m tomorrow."
"The next item is the report (A5-0447/2003) by Olga Zrihen, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on promoting gender equality in development cooperation (COM(2003) 465 – C5-0367/2003 – 2003/0176(COD))."
". – Mr President, firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Zrihen, for the excellent cooperation and for all her efforts to secure adoption at first reading."
"I sincerely hope this is still a reality."
"Our proposal for a regulation on promoting gender equality in development cooperation is very important in providing a clear political goal and in emphasising that the achievement of gender equality is crucial for development in general."
"Since the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action of the Fourth World Conference on Women in 1995, global improvement has been made in terms of promoting gender equality in developing countries."
"In particular, progress has been made in putting in place a comprehensive gender mainstreaming strategy within the general framework of EU development cooperation."
"However, even if the process is on track in setting the priorities, much remains to be done in terms of delivering results, such as improving the conditions of women in developing countries within a definite time perspective."
"Therefore a more comprehensive strategic approach is needed to support the present implementation strategy."
"In particular this regulation gives a stronger orientation that will make the process clearer and more visible and will make it easier to activate the necessary change to promote gender equality in development cooperation, building up a strong link to the achievement of the UN millennium development goals."
"We all know that promoting gender equality is a long-term process."
"Certainly it has taken a long time to get where we are, so that is the sad proof of the reality that this is long-term."
"It is therefore vital that the catalytic and strategic role played by the present regulation is reinforced."
"In fact there is a need for this regulation to fund innovative actions which are cost-effective and have the potential to be replicated in other areas or scaled up using other funding sources."
"This is the real key to understanding the purpose of this regulation."
"Parliament originally proposed to raise the budget of this regulation but I believe this is not the solution we are looking for."
"As I explained in a letter to the chairmen of the Committee on Budgets, the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities and the Committee on Development and Cooperation and to the rapporteur, we cannot meet the relatively small increase."
"The resources are simply not there."
"We made great efforts earlier this year in the fight against the major poverty-related diseases and in promoting sexual and reproductive health."
"It is simply not possible to find any more money."
"In any case, as a proposed amendment to the recitals makes clear, it is the whole of Community development-related funding which should contribute towards gender equality as a cross-cutting issue."
"I need therefore to confirm to you that the Commission, fully supported by the Council, cannot accept the proposed increase in the budget."
"I hope that this is also the response we will see tonight from Parliament."
"I am convinced that by supporting this regulation Parliament will allow us to fund operations and agencies working to reach the international development targets to promote gender equality and empower women and contribute to poverty reduction."
"The existence of this special budget line and regulation makes a lot of sense because this is where we find the inspiration and the impetus to inject a sense of direction into the mainstreaming effort, but we will never be able to do what needs to be done on the gender issue by a special budget line."
"That is the reality and I appreciate the understanding of the proportions and the mechanisms of how to do this."
"I hope that will be reflected in the way Parliament reacts."
"I hope that we can do this in one reading in Parliament."
"I would regret it very much if we could not."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to point out to you that this report seems to me to be absolutely fundamental."
"It is fundamental because one of the prime objectives of the European Union’s development policy is to encourage the eradication of poverty in the developing countries."
"In the same way, we believe that the consolidation of democracy and of the rule of law, as well as respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, are objectives that we should strive to achieve."
"We should be deluding ourselves, however, if we were to believe that the battle against poverty can be fought without the aid of women."
"Women are the pillars of society, particularly of the societies with which we are concerned here."
"At the same time, it has to be said that, along with children, they are among the most vulnerable people when it comes to disease, poverty, illiteracy and war."
"For this reason, all the strategies that we implement and all the projects that we want to develop must make it possible to contribute towards the emancipation and action of women in every field and in every country."
"Women must participate in a very practical way in the development of their country, because each woman is a potential agent of success, change and development."
"The report that we are discussing today is, I hope, one of the fundamental steps in this approach to cooperation, because it makes provision for a number of measures to promote, to develop and to support practical projects in this area."
"It is important that they should be practical."
"What we want this regulation to be is a catalyst, a driving force for gender-equality initiatives, capitalising on pilot initiatives, defining good practices and providing information about them."
"It covers the period from 2004 to 2006."
"It seems essential to us, therefore, that by January the regulation can start to be applied so that calls for tender can be issued for the projects."
"I believe that there are hundreds of people out there who are waiting for our decision and, if we equivocate, the consequences will be damaging to all those involved locally who want to participate and act, in practical terms, in order to achieve equality of opportunity."
"In this report, it seemed to me vital to consider, before anything else, access by women of all ages to all resources and services such as health, education, training and infrastructures."
"We should also note that women are excluded from participation, access and control in all sectors."
"As a woman, but above all as a democrat, I hope to be able to encourage such participation in all the countries concerned."
"I also hope that the main beneficiaries of our aid will be the local agents and women’s organisations who work tirelessly in order to bring about a change in mentality in favour of gender equality."
"In everything we say, however, and in everything we hope for, there is always the budgetary aspect."
"For this regulation, the European Commission has given us EUR 9 million."
"Perhaps that is not very much to us, but it represents a veritable fortune for those involved at the coalface, enabling them to undertake specific projects."
"Nevertheless, we wanted to ask for EUR 11 million, because it seems to us that an additional EUR 2 million is not very much."
"However, as Commissioner Nielson has just explained, it seems that this is impossible."
"I therefore accepted the report at first reading, with the support of my fellow Members, in order to encourage practical action, in other words in order to get this regulation adopted as rapidly as possible, in fact tomorrow, so that it will be in force in January 2004."
"It seems, however, that that is not the view of other political groups."
"It seems that we shall have to go in to battle again, because we might be able to scrape together a few more pennies and that is what counts at the coalface."
"I should like, however, to ask all those who are due to speak in the debate that we shall be holding in this House tomorrow to give due thought to the fact that in doing so we are taking on a clear and precise responsibility to start a second reading procedure and that we do not know how long that procedure will take."
"I also think that all the organisations which are affected by our failure to reach agreement are entitled to expect from us, and from the Council and the Commission, mature behaviour and a practical indication of our desire to see these objectives attained."
"As far as I am concerned, if I still have any decision-making powers as the rapporteur, I would argue once again that this text should enter into force in January 2004."
"Whatever happens, if the negotiations that we shall be holding this evening and tomorrow make it necessary for us, at any given moment, to reconsider our position, I can only regret it, but in that case I shall immediately seek a meeting with the Council and the Commission so that we can reach agreement as quickly as possible."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union sets great store by equal rights for men and women and also by development cooperation policy."
"We are all familiar with the poignant examples: the Nigerian woman, Amina Lawal, who was going to be stoned while her lover got off scot-free; women who, simply because they are women, have no access to loans to set up small businesses; girls who continue to be denied education because as women, they will not need it anyway and they can meanwhile help out in the home."
"A great deal remains left to be done."
"We incorporate it in every regulation, but ‘paper is patient’ and it is difficult to implement it."
"Especially in the delegations, expertise is required in this area."
"I think it is somewhat disappointing that the Commission, during the review of the regulation – which lapses at the end of 2003 – presented a proposal that seeks only to act as a catalyst."
"From reports of the results of previous actions, it transpired, in fact, that these were not very impressive, while moreover, the planned budget is only partly being used."
"I do not want to go into the reasons for this, but I hope that this new approach, which the Commission supports, will be more effective."
"Commissioner, the budget for this regulation is small, too small according to my committee, even if the Commission wants the objectives to be achieved by synergy and other actions and programmes."
"I would therefore underline the fact that it is essential to have experts on the ground."
"That costs money."
"Surely, we should be able to find the money?"
"This requires training and refresher training, as I heard from Peru’s delegation only last week."
"However, constant requests are being made for the more effective regulation of these matters elsewhere too."
"Three years is not long, but it would be good if we could say: ‘Look, progress is being made, more women have a prospect of a say in the political, social and economic spheres; more girls are allowed schooling and women are also entitled to good health.’"
"Commissioner, I am making an urgent appeal to you."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, Article 3 of the Treaty sets out the European Community’s desire to ban all forms of inequality and to promote equality between men and women."
"The Council has mentioned gender equality as the basis for development cooperation."
"In Beijing, a 10-point action programme on this has been adopted and has been signed by all countries."
"The situation still leaves a great deal to be desired, not least in the area of development cooperation."
"Of the approximately 1.5 billion people who live under the poverty line, 70% are women."
"Not only are they lacking financial resources, but also, in most cases they have to go without social rights, such as the right to proper food, drinking water, education, health care and fundamental human rights."
"Since the Council has defined gender mainstreaming as the guiding principle for development cooperation policy, disappointingly little has actually happened."
"That is why I welcome the action programme."
"It should give gender equality in development cooperation policy an extra shot in the arm."
"Reference has already been made, in this House’s debates and documents, to the link between poverty and gender inequality."
"The countries where there is great inequality between men and women are also the poorest."
"There is less poverty in countries where inequality between men and women is not so pronounced."
"The success rate of development projects in the fields of health care, literacy schemes and agriculture, for example, appears higher if women are involved."
"Investing in girls appears to lead to lower child mortality and mortality among women, offers higher food safety and means an improvement in the fight against poverty."
"This is not, unfortunately, common knowledge, and so I was pleased with the publication of research by UNICEF on 11 December last, which clearly underlined this."
"The report, in fact, states that without measures to get more girls into schools, it will be impossible to achieve the millennium objectives."
"It is apparent that more girls attending school not only benefits them, but also boys and their countries."
"The report describes that gender discrimination stops developments in their tracks."
"The report also describes that, barring a few exceptions, the industrialised countries and international financial institutions have failed to make good their own promises."
"Hence my support for the action programme which aims to promote analysis and integration of the gender aspect in the priority areas of Community development cooperation, horizontal integration of the gender aspect in projects and programmes, and the advancement of gender capacity in the European Community itself."
"These are three important points, particularly the last one: a change of mentality is needed, not least in the bodies of the European Union itself."
"In the light of the urgency and opportunities, I am backing the amendment to increase the budget from EUR 9 million to EUR 11 million."
"I sincerely hope that the Commission will be able to agree to this."
"Mr President, it has become a custom in this House for us to talk about equality between men and women during night sessions."
"It does not matter, but it is a reality which is nonetheless curious to say the least."
"I would like it if we could talk about equality between men and women one afternoon as well."
"The policy of equality between men and women is one of the best allies in the European Union’s commitment to combat poverty."
"We have said this endless times during these night sessions, and almost all of us sitting here are convinced of it."
"It is a question of making it a reality in the budget as well."
"Since the nineties we have made a lot of progress with regard to these policies, but we have not yet achieved the desired results."
"We all know this as well."
"As the Commission's document argues, it is necessary to explore new avenues and, above all, to achieve the effective application of the measures we approve at national level, which is where we face the greatest difficulties."
"While in 2001, in the action programme, we stressed the need to integrate the gender factor, that is, to consider, to draw up and to evaluate objectives in a manner which is inclusive of women, we now have to supplement that strategy by creating a solid basis for this policy linked to the millennium development objectives."
"As we always reiterate, it is necessary to intensify the political message with regard to the promotion of equality between men and women, both within the Union and, above all, in the developing countries."
"Poverty, illiteracy, disease, unemployment, lack of autonomy, dependency, and the violation of the most fundamental rights, are a reality for the majority of women in the developing world."
"The gender perspective, specific policies, increasing awareness and support for the public and private capacities of the developing countries, so that they can take the initiative of promoting equality between men and women, are some of the measures essential to progress on this strategy."
"Cross-border and regional cooperation, the promotion of a complementary policy and programmes relating, for example, to reproductive and sexual health, which are currently being seriously jeopardised by religion-based conservative policies, are essential conditions for the achievement of our objectives."
"The regulation we are debating today will undoubtedly contribute to improving our action."
"It has clearly been improved during its parliamentary phase, since we have insisted on key issues, such as the participation of women's organisations on the ground, which are the real protagonists in terms of the progress of their communities; also, control and access by women to training and health services and decision-making processes."
"It is necessary to stress the need for technical assistance, including evaluation of the impact on equality in areas such as education, training and the media."
"Combating AIDS and violence against women and giving women power are still outstanding debts."
"It is necessary and urgent to adopt this regulation without excessively extending the time limits."
"It is therefore necessary to reach a compromise so that the application of this regulation may be effective from January 2004."
"That is what I wish to call for now."
"– Mr President, I wish to take the opportunity of talking about girls’ education, for without girls’ education there is no equality for women."
"Our fellow MEP, Mrs Martens, also mentioned that UNICEF’s report, ‘The State of the World's Children, 2004’, published last week, really does make frightening reading."
"We give pledge after pledge, for example in the millennium declaration."
"Following the UN Special Session on Children, we undertook to reduce the difference between girls and boys where illiteracy is concerned and to giving girls good access to education."
"We have had the fast track initiatives within the World Bank’s Development Committee, but what is happening?"
"Today, we know that more than 120 million children have no schooling."
"Fifteen per cent of all boys and 21% of all girls do not go to school."
"In South-East Asia and in the countries south of the Sahara, the situation is particularly painful."
"Under the World Bank’s fast track initiatives, the developed countries approved a USD 326 million funding plan last year, but, to date, only USD 207 million has been given by way of appropriations."
"This means a funding deficit of nearly USD 118 million in a year and a half."
"We have not fulfilled our pledges."
"It is we in the developed countries who have not done our part."
"The developing countries have put forward their plans and done what they should have done."
"Among the EU countries, Italy allocates only 0.3% and Germany only 2.1% of their aid budgets to development."
"It is really only the Netherlands that has fulfilled its pledges to the world’s children."
"How will matters stand after all the declarations and, in particular, following the UN Special Session on Children, at which young people themselves were present and demanded the right to education?"
"The sums concerned are, after all, small in comparison with those entailed in many other pledges."
"I believe that the EU and the Commission combined should get their act together and fulfil their pledges made, for example, within the World Bank."
"Mr President, in relation to promoting gender equality in developing countries, it is clear that poverty is one of the issues that has to be tackled."
"Women and children are worst affected by poverty, but women are the ones at the coalface who can truly make the difference."
"It is quite incredible to hear the Commission here today begrudging a measly EUR 2 million."
"The Commissioner talks about the Council and the Commission – both male-dominated – deciding that they think that the EUR 2 million extra is not acceptable."
"They are hoping to browbeat this Parliament into accepting what two male-dominated institutions have decided."
"It is incredible when you consider that even EUR 11 million is absolute crumbs when you look at the overall budget, and yet you want this Parliament, even on first reading, to give up on that extra 2 million."
"It is completely unacceptable."
"I hope that Parliament tomorrow will vote an increase, as the committee did, from EUR 9 million to EUR 11 million."
"If you want to promote gender equality you have to be willing to go that extra distance to ensure that you are truly committed to it."
"If you say you begrudge EUR 2 million and that you cannot find EUR 2 million in the budget to increase this budget line, it is absolutely unacceptable; and I hope that Parliament will send a strong message to the Commission and to the Council that this is no longer acceptable."
"We talk about gender equality in the European Union, but we have to prove this by saying that we are willing to pay for promoting it in developing countries, to pay for supporting women in developing countries who in many cases have been persecuted and who are the ones who have been pushing to try and progress gender equality and also to alleviate poverty."
"The money there is well deserved and you cannot begrudge this EUR 2 million."
"– Mr President, the efficiency of development aid remains a problem."
"Moreover, it is a fact that misplaced feelings of guilt about our colonial past have made discussion of this problem taboo, a taboo in which, fortunately, cracks are starting to appear."
"An increasing number of observers, and those involved at the sharp end, take a critical view of the way in which development aid is generally organised."
"The resources used often do not reach their destination."
"Simply donating money is, moreover, not always the answer."
"Quite the opposite, there are other factors that help determine success."
"I am thinking, for example, of the presence of a free market economy and of freedom full stop."
"Gender equality, the topic of this report, is a very important element in this."
"It is stated, with good reason, that discrimination against women forms a barrier to sustainable and effective development."
"So it is indeed the case that we should concentrate on better education, training and participation, both economically and politically speaking."
"In this respect, the Commission provides for, , ‘support in terms of the analysis and improvement of statistics according to gender, age, development and distribution of methodologies, guidelines, gender impact reports, thematic studies, indicators and other operational instruments’."
"This is all undoubtedly useful and necessary, but we should ensure that we do not lose sight of a number of essential facts."
"Many developing countries are being plagued by archaic cultural patterns to which the disadvantaged position of women is directly attributable."
"In that respect, it is astonishing that neither the Zrihen report, nor the Commission’s own, should make any reference to Islam at all."
"In the Islamic world, women are, as it were, structurally inferior, and it makes no sense whatsoever to tiptoe around this unpleasant fact."
"As long as people refuse to accept this, this regulation will at best be a source of employment for gender experts and other development workers from Europe, but nothing more than that."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as everyone knows, the main aim of the European Union’s development cooperation policy is to combat and ultimately eradicate poverty."
"Consequently, the specific measures intended to promote equality between men and women, women’s independence and their role in the economic, social and environmental spheres make significant contributions as well as being a matter of fairness."
"This is because it is most frequently women and children who are the victims of poverty."
"The progress that has already been made as a result of adopting a global strategy to mainstream the gender perspective in development cooperation should be acknowledged and underlined, but much remains to be done."
"There are aspects that are crucial to gender equality and women’s independence and it is to these that particular attention must be paid, with particular emphasis on areas such as health, education, training, access to economic and social activities, and also access to employment and to infrastructures and participation in decision-making processes."
"The projects must be in line with reality and to achieve this we must have data and statistics that are broken down by gender, which will enable us to evaluate actions before they are selected and once they have been undertaken."
"We must highlight the crucial role of organisations working in the field, taking account of their direct and more extensive knowledge of the real needs and of the means needed to undertake actions."
"Another point that I would underline is the need to create partnerships."
"The key actors, including regional authorities, should form networks in order to exchange experience, and good practice so as to define actions better and to achieve better participation in their implementation."
"To conclude, I wish to emphasise that promoting gender equality in development cooperation for the 2004-2006 period must be given a budget that matches the needs."
"I understand the reasons that the Commission has put forward in this debate and by the rapporteur, whom I congratulate, but, taking account of the measures that still need to be implemented and the efforts that still need to be made, the corresponding budget line must be increased to EUR 11 million."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by thanking the rapporteur for producing this report."
"The European Union has declared gender equality to be one of its key objectives, and I think it is extremely important that this priority be factored into development cooperation."
"It is still predominantly women and girls who can neither read nor write and who are discriminated against in education."
"Education, however, is the key to escaping from the vicious cycle of poverty and illness."
"Anyone unable to read and write has no chance in our computer– and Internet-dominated world."
"Whatever happens, it is essential that in promoting equal opportunities, we ensure that all women benefit, regardless of age."
"The report concentrates primarily on strengthening existing local organisations, because they have the experts on the ground, the experts on the underlying structures, who know what is really needed there."
"Women are indispensable in all rural areas and essential to further development in the regions."
"As previous speakers have already pointed out, women in developing countries are often given a passive role in projects and planning processes."
"This means they do not have enough input into projects, and consequently less attention is given to the needs of women."
"Women therefore need to be included as active participants in local planning processes, so that they can actively shape their environment and so they can also take on new challenges with 100% commitment."
"As has already been said, the financial framework for implementing this regulation needs to contain the EUR 11 million, in order to introduce efficient measures that will also have an effect when implemented."
"I therefore ask Parliament to approve these EUR 11 million tomorrow."
"Gender mainstreaming may well be over-used as a term, and perhaps seems to have worn thin at times, but it is still a fundamental concept which must be applied to all policy areas."
". – Mr President, not with pleasure but with some regret, I will start by saying that Mrs McKenna's choice of language is disappointing."
"I do not accept that the Commission is male-dominated."
"This is outside the scope of how we work professionally in this field."
"This is not nice, and it is also factually wrong."
"We do things in this area which are not normally or not always labelled as gender activity."
"We are engaged in land reform issues and changing legislation in many countries without describing this as gender action."
"However, it is extremely important to devise modern legislation that creates equal rights on land ownership and, for a country like Kenya which decided to go for free primary education in one big step, to provide budget support that makes it possible for girls to benefit from that opening."
"The budget support of EUR 50 million for Kenya was not labelled gender support but, in reality, this is hard-core, big-money, gender-relevant policies."
"This is mainstreaming."
"I must insist that this is where the big battle is being fought."
"I could understand the discussion here if this was about the distinction between 9 and 200 million euros, rather than about the distinction between 9 and 11 million euros."
"Then I would see some sort of logic in what has been said here tonight."
"But the budget line on this specific activity is a catalyst for moving forward good new ideas, innovative approaches, etc., to inspire the more general work on mainstreaming."
"That is why it is a mistake to move the money level as such up and down."
"I would very much regret it if Parliament did not act on this issue in a manner that will create a smooth and rapid decision-making process."
"It is a mistake to think that the attitude and the sincerity of the fight for gender equality is reflected in a choice between 9 or 11 million euros."
"We must be judged by our general work and we are relatively confident of that judgement."
"Mr President, no personal offence to the Commissioner – as male Commissioners go, he is probably one of the more progressive concerning gender equality."
"But the reality is that both the Commission and the Council are male-dominated."
"When we look at the numbers, both are basically dominated by men."
"If we had more equality both in the Commission and in the Council in relation to the number of women, things would be a bit different."
"This is not a personal attack on you, Commissioner."
"In relation to women's issues you are better than some of our Commissioners, including Mr Pádraig Flynn, who was here a few years ago!"
"The reality is nevertheless that the Commission and Council are male-dominated."
"We shall treat that as an olive branch."
"That concludes the debate."
"The vote will be at 11.30 a.m. tomorrow."
"The next item is the report (A5-0465/2003) by Friedrich-Wilhelm Graefe zu Baringdorf, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the coexistence of genetically modified crops and conventional and organic crops (2003/2098(INI))."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, this is an own-initiative report tabled by Parliament at the request of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"It is therefore not a response to a legislative proposal from the Commission."
"Rather, we feel that this matter requires action and that is why we have taken the trouble to draft this report."
"The report represents a compromise achieved through cooperation by all groups and one that has been adopted with overwhelming support by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"At this point, I would like to thank each of my co-rapporteurs: Mrs Schierhuber, Mrs Scheele, Mr Olsson, and Mr Garot."
"We have all sought to allow objectivity to rule while working on this Parliamentary task."
"Let me emphasise once again that this report does not ask whether genetic modification should be allowed."
"It focuses on coexistence."
"It has already been decided, in consultation with this House, that genetically modified organisms will exist and will be released."
"The question we are considering here is how there can be cooperation, coexistence, and freedom of choice both for farmers and for consumers, for that will become the issue if we release genetically modified organisms in plants or animals."
"Nature does often tend towards exchange – it will not make any allowances for genetically modified organisms."
"So, rather than concentrating on the fact that very soon there will be a release of genetically modified plants and animals, we now need to ensure there are GMO-free plants and animals to allow freedom of choice."
"That is what this report is about."
"We need to make sure that all procedures are clarified before they are implemented."
"The Commission has not put forward any legislative proposals to this end – instead guidelines have been proposed."
"We are now trying to implement those guidelines, as stated in the report."
"We call on the Commission to investigate the technical requirements, to consult scientific experts, and also to address the question of potential liability."
"The fact is that, while industry is perfectly entitled to make money, it cannot be allowed to do so if, lower down the chain, farmers are suing one another."
"There must be clarity."
"The reactions to this legislation indicate that some regions want to declare themselves GM-free, because they are concerned about the possibility of contamination between small plots – this relates to Article 26 of the release directive, introduced as a result of Parliament’s efforts, which states farmers must have the right to establish a GMO-free region provided they have established that food and feed with over 0.9% contamination will be labelled as genetically modified."
"All those who want to operate on the market – not just the organic holdings, which are legally required to be GM-free, but also large sections of conventional agriculture – see this as part of their market."
"They are fully entitled to do so."
"Everyone has to make their own choice on this matter, and we have to ensure that they can do so."
"This is why we are now proposing regulation for liability."
"I hope that a large majority in this House will approve this report tomorrow, that the Commission will then meet our expectations and that these questions about coexistence will be dealt with using the codecision procedure, as happened with the legislation on genetic modification."
"This will allow us to be included and use our expert knowledge – which is evident in this report – to come up with reasonable legislation that does not allow coexistence to become a Trojan horse."
"We do not want to fund ourselves a couple of years down the line concluding with regret that our approach has not worked."
"We need to guarantee the long-term nature of coexistence and freedom of choice for farmers and consumers."
"I hope that the Commission will take our work seriously and that we will soon have a legislative proposal on this subject for this House to discuss."
"One last thought: a key factor in this area is whether non-GM seed lines remain free of genetically modified organisms."
"There is no doubt that genetically modified seed will exist."
"We have legislation on the subject."
"However, we also need to ensure that GM-free seed exists."
"This, then, is the crux for coexistence."
"Our report places great emphasis on this point."
". – Mr President, I would like to start by apologising as I see from the timetable that I have been allocated two and a half minutes, but in fact I have a prepared statement which is somewhat more thorough."
"Not having known this in advance, I feel obliged to go for substance rather than time management."
"Firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, and the Members of Parliament who have contributed to this own-initiative report."
"The Commission welcomes this report as a timely contribution to the discussion on coexistence."
"I fully share the opinion that coexistence is a highly important issue that needs to be addressed in a transparent and open-minded way."
"With the new GMO authorisation procedure and the legislation on traceability and labelling, the European Union has created a comprehensive regulatory framework that should clear the way for the introduction of GMOs in agriculture."
"By establishing the conditions for coexistence we must ensure that farmers who want to use conventional and organic farming methods should be able to do so."
"The report comes at a time when several Member States are in the process of preparing national and regional approaches to coexistence."
"It also comes at a time when the Commission is seeking to further clarify how it can best engage with the Member States in supporting this process, following the publication of the Commission recommendation on guidelines for coexistence last July."
"While the Commission welcomes the own-initiative report as a valuable overall contribution to the discussion in terms of the individual statements and recommendations put forward, there are only a few we can wholeheartedly endorse."
"I shall comment briefly on some of them."
"Concerning thresholds for seeds, we would agree that information on the presence of GMOs in seeds is necessary for the proper implementation of the GMO legislation, especially regarding labelling and traceability."
"However, the thresholds apply only to adventitious traces of authorised GMOs that have undergone extensive environmental and health-risk assessment."
"They are not meant to be a risk management tool."
"We also recognise the importance and urgency of defining thresholds for the adventitious presence of GMOs in seed lots of non-GM varieties and we are currently working on a proposal."
"In doing so, we are basing ourselves on sound scientific advice building on the preparatory work that has been carried out over the last two years."
"I am pleased to see that the report has replaced a previous draft text recommending a 0.1% threshold for seeds by a new text that takes account of scientific assessments regarding practical applicability."
"The Commission has always been of the opinion that thresholds should be feasible and practicable in a GMO environment."
"It has always insisted on the fact that sound scientific advice was needed in order to set thresholds."
"Regarding the request for uniform and binding rules for coexistence at Community level, we are not convinced that this would be a feasible solution."
"Given the diversity that characterises European agriculture, we believe that it would be impossible to establish uniform rules that can be applied across the board."
"A 'one size fits all' approach is not appropriate."
"Scientists have repeatedly supported the subsidiarity-based approach, also at the preliminary hearing on coexistence organised in September 2003."
"Member States also increasingly see this as the appropriate way forward."
"Moreover, with the insertion of an Article on coexistence into Directive 2001/18/EC at the request of the European Parliament, Member States now have the possibility to adopt measures for coexistence."
"With this clause for national coexistence measures in place and the Commission guidelines available, we believe that the framework for national solutions to coexistence is sufficiently elaborated."
"Coexistence cannot be a reason to further delay the authorisation of new GMOs."
"I do not share the opinion expressed in the report that Member States should be obliged to put in place legislation to ensure coexistence."
"On the contrary, we should leave it up to them to explore the use of different policy instruments, including voluntary agreements and soft-law approaches and to choose the combination of instruments and depth of regulation that best suits them under their specific conditions."
"On the question of who should be responsible for implementing the necessary measures we are in complete agreement."
"In fact, the Commission guidelines state that the farmers who introduce a new production type should bear this responsibility."
"This principle is mutual, although at the beginning it will mainly concern farmers who want to grow GMOs."
"Regarding liability, I have difficulty understanding why Community-wide civil liability rules should be necessary."
"The question of liability cannot be dealt with in isolation."
"Liability is conditioned by the overall approach to coexistence taken by the Member State."
"It should therefore be addressed as an integral part of the package of national coexistence measures."
"A general levy on GM seeds and feed, to cover administrative expenditures, as well as the testing and monitoring costs associated with GMO legislation, would not be compatible with the principle of the common market."
"As a general principle, the marketing of products that are authorised under Community legislation and found safe for human health and the environment, should not be restricted or impeded by the Member States."
"Of course taxation is here to stay – we tax many things in terms of economic activity as a whole, and so, logically, I would say that this discussion is not so strange."
"The report asks the Commission to establish legally-binding definitions of the terms 'adventitious' and 'technically unavoidable'."
"Our legislation is clear on this: operators must be in a position to show that they have tried to avoid the presence of GMOs."
"Concerning the issue of cross-border effects, the Commission could agree that this needs to be further examined."
"We will reflect on how this can be done and what contribution the Commission can make."
"We can also establish whether drawing up a public register of national strategies and best practices with cross-border impacts would be useful."
"As regards GMO-free zones, we have a different view."
"We strongly feel that a blanket ban of all types of GMOs from a region is not possible, unless it is on a voluntary basis."
"The regional restriction of certain types of GMOs needs to be scientifically justified on a crop-by-crop basis and should only be a last resort if farm-level management measures are insufficient."
"The Commission agrees that more research is needed on coexistence."
"It therefore supports scientific studies conducted by the joint research centre and under the sixth framework programme for Community research."
"These studies will cover cost analysis, good farming practices for coexistence and liability issues."
"However, a comprehensive report covering all economic aspects of coexistence under the different cost conditions in the EU will only be possible once the Member States have more practical experience."
"The Commission will ensure a coordination role and facilitate the exchange of information concerning best practices and concrete experiences with coexistence among Member States, including cross-border aspects."
"Based on this collection of data it will report to the European Parliament and the Council in two years' time."
"The Commission will then, if appropriate, also make an assessment of possible and necessary steps to take."
"I am pleased to have had the opportunity to give this thorough response."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, nearly six months have passed since the question of coexistence last played a leading role in this House."
"Back then we were discussing the regulation on genetically modified food and feed."
"I was the rapporteur, and we had to battle with the Commission and certain Member States in order to secure the flexibility in the form of Article 26a."
"We were successful, and I congratulate Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, whose own-initiative report on the subject sends another important political signal from this House."
"I think it is incredibly important that we now call on the Member States to make use of and give shape to that flexibility which we in Parliament fought for on their behalf."
"However, I also agree with Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf that it will be necessary to establish European regulations on coexistence."
"I do not understand how the Commission can say it is able to authorise this centrally, and has the competence to do so, when it does not know the answers to the questions raised by coexistence."
"Another reason that I think Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf’s own-initiative report is incredibly important is that very soon there will be a vote on the Seed Directive under the comitology procedure, which, unfortunately, leaves Parliament out of it."
"I also think that the section in which we state that the pollution value for seeds is determined by the proximity value is extremely important."
"We should not reproach ourselves: the threshold value we agreed – 0.9% – is very hard to maintain, even if we do not require absolute seed purity."
"Consequently I hope that tomorrow this House will be able to send this important political signal."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, for genuinely taking the initiative in producing this own-initiative report on coexistence, and for successfully bringing together all points of view in one report."
"The fact is that opinions on coexistence vary from one country to the next, and even within my group we cannot agree on the subject."
"Let us be clear: it was a long time now that the question stopped being about whether we say ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to genetic engineering."
"The rapporteur has said that."
"That question has long been decided."
"We need to look ahead and are already discussing how there can be coexistence between GM and non-GM crops, and how to ensure that all parties can operate side by side without anyone being disadvantaged."
"Coexistence ought to guarantee freedom of choice for farmers and consumers, and clear rules need to be created for the benefit of all European farmers, allowing each to make an independent choice about which different farming methods to use, and ensuring those methods can coexist without generating problems."
"After intensive cross-party and internal discussions, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Affairs has reached a compromise and has approved a report containing specific, clear demands."
"Our own-initiative report calls for comprehensive regulation at Community level, since the guidelines proposed by the Commission are a collection of non-binding recommendations."
"We therefore expect the Commission, where policy is determined at Community level, as in the case of agricultural policy, to provide a common regulatory framework."
"Another important feature in our report is the call for the Commission to submit a proposal for Community-wide liability and insurance."
"Provision must be made in advance to cover the possibility of adventitious contamination, rather than simply leaving the farmers to sort it out between themselves, and the devil take the hindmost."
"There is no way the question of liability should be left to the farmers to resolve."
"In addition, GMO contamination in seed must be established using technically viable and accurate threshold values, in order to ensure that agricultural production complies with the existing labelling threshold of 0.9% for food."
"This subject has already been addressed by Mrs Scheele."
"An own-initiative report is one way in which Parliament can send a clear political signal."
"If we now water down the demands and comments made by the Committee on Agriculture and unwrap the existing package, our demands will no longer be clear."
"Instead, we will have a hotchpotch of vague statements without any clear shape."
"As MEPs, we need to ask ourselves whether we really want to send out a political signal with no actual content."
"I therefore join the rapporteur in hoping that this own-initiative report will be adopted tomorrow with a genuinely convincing majority, since it has already received so much support in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Affairs."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, we are not concerned here with the continued existence, or otherwise, of genetically modified organisms."
"I am among those who believe that neither humanity as a whole nor its merely European component can do without this knowledge and technology."
"It is, however, very important that we apply the precautionary and ‘polluter pays’ principles and that we respect people’s anxiety faced with something new."
"We must therefore be able to label GMOs and provide proper information about them."
"We have had, and still have, different views on the point at issue, but I nonetheless wish to congratulate Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf on this report."
"We have substantially been able to agree upon an attitude to be adopted by the European Parliament, and I hope that this will give a signal to the Commission and the Council."
"I think that the report is very well balanced, but I have some comments to make."
"I am disappointed when I hear the Commissioner so positively come out against paragraph 3 on common rules."
"The wind does in actual fact blow across national borders."
"It is not sensible to have one rule apply on one side of a national border and another rule on the other side."
"We are concerned here with life and with what life consists of."
"If we wish to achieve something by what we are doing, we must have common rules."
"Think about it in the Commission before you make any over-hasty decisions."
"I am able, however, to go some way towards agreeing with the Commission when it comes to paragraph 9."
"I believe it would be dangerous to continue with a moratorium if we do not get what we want."
"I actually agree with paragraph 9, but I consider that it perhaps goes a little too far."
"I am not prepared to vote in favour of that paragraph."
"It is the only paragraph in the report about which I take a different view."
"When it comes to regional renunciation, the Commissioner says that it can only become a reality if it is voluntary."
"In my simplicity, I had imagined that democratic decisions were always voluntary."
"Does that not, then, mean that there can be no cause for concern?"
"I believe that a region or country is entitled to say ‘we do not want this’."
"We cannot compel people to use a technology if they do not wish to do so, even if I consider the technology to be a sound one."
"It is very important that we give out this signal and that we can be in relative agreement tomorrow when we take a decision."
"We certainly have different views on the continued existence, or otherwise, of genetically modified organisms, but we wish to be cautious."
"We now wish to come up with a proposal on how to arrange for coexistence, and this with a view to our being credible in the eyes of all those who have to live on the food that is produced in either one way or another."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the fundamental issue we are addressing here is whether coexistence between genetically modified crops and conventional and organic crops is truly possible."
"Unless we find a practical and precise answer to this question, there can be no basis for the much-vaunted freedom of choice."
"Farmers who produce conventional and organic crops will have no choice and consumers will have no choice if genetically modified crops affect conventional and organic crops."
"We must not allow our hand to be forced by a powerful lobby consisting of an increasingly limited group of huge multinationals that market genetically modified crops and which seek to control agriculture and food production against the wishes of European farmers and consumers who, in countless opinion polls, have already expressed their reservations and even fear about genetically modified organisms."
"I therefore welcome this own-initiative report by Parliament, which is all the more important because the Commission itself was delaying this debate. The report also opens the way for the moratorium that has existed since 1998 to be lifted."
"As a matter of fact, this is a demand that I myself made in a joint-initiative resolution with members of my group in March 2003."
"Everyone is aware of the inherent risks of contamination from the release of GMOs into the environment."
"Scientific studies on cross-pollination and the dissemination of GMOs are still too limited for us to have a precise and reliable evaluation of all the consequences."
"Throughout this debate, however, bearing in mind the opinions presented at the parliamentary hearing, the conclusion we are bound to reach is that contamination cannot really be avoided in the large-scale presence of genetically modified crops, with consequences ranging from the loss of biodiversity to economic damage to conventional and organic farming."
"Consequently, despite the risk of dissemination varying according to the type of genetically modified crop, their management cannot be efficiently and viably contained."
"A farm that opts for a genetically modified crop cannot then revert to conventional or organic farming."
"Our experiences with animal disease, specifically BSE and Foot-and-Mouth disease should serve as warnings of the problems of reliability and cost that will face the monitoring systems that are put in place."
"Consequently, as the rapporteur states in his report – on which I congratulate him – the most effective and economic way of ensuring coexistence is the renunciation, whether voluntary or restricted at regional level, of GMO cultivation."
"Furthermore, the Community provisions established cannot jeopardise every Member State’s right to ban genetically modified crops throughout their territory or in geographically limited areas."
"What is obvious in this entire process is that, if coexistence is not possible, the moratorium should remain in place in order to observe the precautionary principle."
"We should consequently support at least item 9 of this report and I personally hope that Parliament will tomorrow adopt the report in its entirety."
"Mr President, I have added two amendments to the report."
"These would entail the Member States being instructed (paragraph 7 a [new]) or recommended (paragraph 7 b [new]) to introduce a levy on GMO seed and GMO feed."
"The revenue would cover day-to-day administration and the testing of farmers’ organically farmed and non-GMO conventional land."
"The revenue would also compensate for damage caused by GMO pollution which occurs despite correct practice on the part of GMO farmers."
"I would emphasise that the damage occurring despite correct practice must also be covered by the polluter and not by the public authorities via taxes paid by innocent citizens."
"It must, however, be possible for a Member State to be exempted if a decision to that effect is taken at a public national parliamentary sitting in the Member State concerned and is presented by the Head of Government to an EU Council meeting."
"In this way, the Member States’ sovereignty would be guaranteed, at the same time as its being possible for a grassroots-based environmental campaign to achieve results across borders."
"Mr President, taking into account the extent of the various problems posed by GMOs, on which there are no obvious and convincing scientific conclusions, the issue of the coexistence of GMO production and non-GMO production should be thought of as a long-term issue and not as a temporary situation which we have to manage while we wait for GMO production to assert itself as the dominant, or even exclusive, method of crop production."
"It is conventional farming and organic farming which are the rule, and GMO production which is the exception under observation, and not the other way round."
"We need to ask questions, not about the viability of non-GMO production, but about the precautions to be taken to protect that production from contamination by GMOs."
"The rapporteur is right to emphasise the proven insufficiency of our knowledge in a series of crucial areas, which should encourage us, admittedly, to continue the research, but also to behave with great caution."
"We are looking here at cross-fertilisation (outcrossing), overwintering of seed, soil concentration, resistance, diffusion and dissemination."
"We must be extremely vigilant in order to avoid a situation in which the provisions adopted on authorisation, traceability and labelling are circumvented by other provisions, on coexistence, which are too vague, uncertain or unclear, thereby creating a which would sweep away all those precautionary provisions."
"Let us be careful not to place our farmers in the position of sorcerer’s apprentices, to which public opinion would undoubtedly attribute the negative consequences of any generalised dissemination of GMOs."
"They have already sacrificed much, with animal meal and Gaucho insecticide."
"Let us ensure, therefore, that we do not make the continued use of traditional crop production methods so complicated that farmers will be driven to abandon them in favour of GMO production."
"It is up to the person who introduces a high-risk crop to assume responsibility for all the consequences of that risk."
"It is the person who takes the risk of possible contamination who must bear the costs of preventing and managing that risk to other crops and to the users of those crops, and who alone must shoulder the responsibility for having taken that risk."
"This question of how to manage the coexistence of the various production methods is set to become an issue of vital importance in regional planning."
"It must be possible to have the freedom to choose specific guidelines at national or regional level."
"If, for example, elected representatives, farmers and others involved at regional level in a certain area want that area to be GMO-free, they must be able to decide that in complete freedom, without the Commission putting obstacles in their path in the name of heaven knows what distortion of competition which may be to a greater or lesser extent imaginary."
"Therefore, Mr President, we shall be voting in favour of this initiative report, which asks some valid questions on a subject which is vitally important to our society."
"– Mr President, first of all, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on having drafted an excellent report by way of good cooperation, the urgent need for which is evident from the Commissioner’s reaction."
"He did indeed note that it is a topical subject, but is, at the same time, increasingly pushing the responsibility away from the Commission."
"This responsibility is said to lie with the Member States and others."
"However, this is a subject for action at Community level."
"Commissioner, Parliament is on your side and, in the discussion about the European Constitution too, it would be very beneficial if the Commission and Parliament could reach sound agreements in good cooperation."
"Something else struck me in the Commissioner’s reaction."
"He mentioned organic farming."
"But, Commissioner, the European Union’s own knowledge centre has calculated that in the event of the uncontrolled use of this genetic technology, also in traditional farming, costs would rise from 1 to 41% depending on the crop, because we have no idea how the consumer will react."
"This is also why, before we obtain further legislation, we should examine the implications more closely, not only on the farm but also in the sale of the products."
"How does the consumer react?"
"We know too little about this."
"It is essential that we should acquire this very piece of knowledge before we can launch into using this technology in Europe."
"Not only do we need to know what the impact on organic farming is, but also on traditional farming, and also how the consumers will react to this."
"After all, we have a House with a common agricultural policy that boasts many regional products and a large diversity in Europe, greater than anywhere in the world."
"This means that the risks involved in using this technology will also be greater than anywhere in the world."
"This means that we need Community policy in this area more than ever."
"In the light of Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf’s sterling report, I would ask the Commission, in its capacity as an important European institution, to accept this task with renewed dynamism and table sound proposals following thorough research, in order to achieve truly sound legislation."
"– Mr President, today's debate clearly shows how the pressure exerted by Bush last summer is being fleshed out."
"Not only for the movement of genetically modified organisms, but also for their free cultivation in the European Union."
"I should like to state from the outset our categorical opposition to the cultivation of genetically modified products and to point out for the umpteenth time the hypocrisy of the Commission which, at a time when it is implementing the reform of the CAP, supposedly with the basic principle of improving the quality of agricultural produce in order to guarantee healthy and safe food, environmental protection etc., it is, on the other hand, promoting the cultivation of modified products."
"The most typical example of its hypocrisy is tobacco for which, on the pretext of protecting public health and sustainable development, subsidies are being slashed in a bid to abolish the crop definitively."
"Recently, Mr Michael Meacher, the minister for the environment in the first Blair government, made a statement, which was published in the British newspaper , in which he said he could not see how the Blair government could responsibly issue licences for modified crops. All the evidence from research has proven negative and this position on the part of Mr Meacher is particularly significant in that in 1999 – while he was minister – he started up extensive trial crops of genetically modified plants."
"Of the 210 fields cultivated, half were modified and half were conventional. The results of the research are particularly revelatory of the possible risks to the environment and consumer health."
"Even the basic argument of the multinational companies which produce genetically modified seed, mainly in the USA, has proven to be trite."
"During the course of the trials, which lasted several years, not only was there no reduction in the need for insecticides, but also the special insecticides required for the genetically modified crops proved to be more harmful than those required for conventional crops."
"Research has shown that modified rape, maize and sugar beet plants damage the flora and fauna far more than conventional crops."
"In addition, the Nobel prizewinner Professor Sherwood Rowland, has typically remarked that, as soon as modified organisms are released into the environment and it is ascertained that they are damaging the environment, it is impossible to stop their harmful effect."
"Modified organisms will continue, constantly multiplying, to wreak havoc as weapons of mass environmental destruction."
"The objective of the report by the European Parliament is essentially to get the idea across that genetically modified organisms can coexist with conventional and ecological products, raising certain questions concerning the preconditions and arrangements for coexistence, while it knows full well that numerous studies point out that it is exceptionally difficult, impossible if you like, to protect against contamination when these crops coexist."
"As for hypocritically citing the 'polluter pays' principle, I do not understand, on the one hand, what calculations can be used to evaluate either the possible environmental cost and the damage to consumer health while I fear, on the other hand, that they will ultimately heap the blame indirectly, if not clearly, on the producers themselves."
"Finally, Mr President, the European Parliament has just one obligation European farmers, consumers and the environment – to say a categorical and overall ‘no’ to the cultivation of modified crops."
"Only thus could it fulfil its role, by allowing pressure from the USA, the objective of which is to serve the interests of its multinationals, so that they can amass profits at the expense of the peoples' health and the environment, to fall on stony ground."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, we would like to commend you for working so hard on this subject."
"As you have heard, we do not agree with you, but had you already shared our views, we would not have had to compile this report."
"This debate is just beginning, and I hope we will see a genuinely positive process between the Commission and Parliament."
"Please pass this on to those colleagues who deal with this area."
"That concludes the debate."
"The vote will be at 11.30 a.m. tomorrow."
"The next item is the report (A5-0459/2003) by Struan Stevenson, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the conclusion of an agreement in the form of an exchange of letters extending to the period 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004 the validity of the protocol setting fishing opportunities and a financial contribution as provided for in the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Côte d'Ivoire on fishing off the coast of Côte d'Ivoire (COM(2003) 556 – C5-0458/2003 – 2003/0219(CNS))."
". – Mr President, I would like to thank the honourable Member for this report on the extension for one year of the fisheries protocol to the agreement between the Community and Côte d'Ivoire."
"I am happy to note that you support the spirit of this proposal, since the Commission – for political and social reasons – has had to proceed with an extension instead of a renewal of the protocol."
"Unfortunately, due to the difficult political situation in the autumn 2002 and spring 2003, it was not possible to proceed with negotiations."
"The protocol is important for the EU fishing industry, which fishes and uses the port of Abidjan to land their catches from the whole region and not only from Ivorian waters."
"This, in turn, is an advantage for Côte d'Ivoire."
"The protocol also supports scientific research, which is essential for ensuring the sustainability of the fisheries and for building up capacity to administer this in the country."
"Because of the previous protocol, European businesses have made investments in Côte d'Ivoire."
"There are now three tuna canneries in the port of Abidjan which process tuna for the European market."
"They generate over 30 000 local jobs."
"The one-year extension of the protocol provides fishing possibilities for 71 tuna vessels and some demersal fishing as well."
"The targeted measures remain the same and represent 71% of the financial contribution out of an overall contribution that is also kept at the previous level – EUR 957 500."
"Considering the good level of utilisation of the tuna fisheries on the one hand, and the ministry's use of targeted measures to ensure sustainable fisheries, the Commission considers the extension to be good value for money. This is true for both sides."
"Obviously, one cannot be fully satisfied with the fact that this extension, which has been in operation since 1 July 2003, was only presented to this Parliament on 23 September."
"One reason for this delay was that the letter of extension was signed by Ivorian Fisheries Minister only on 16 May 2003."
"However, I would add, in all honesty and fairness, that these delays are never the result of one of the partners alone."
"I express my regret for the delay."
"If I were a Member of this House I would look at this with some scepticism."
"However, I am happy to know that on 24 November you received an evaluation report on the implementation of the protocol, which answers some of your requests for future negotiations on the renewal of the protocol."
"The report submitted is a study assessing the fish stocks and the application of the protocol up to August 2003."
"Concerning Amendments Nos 1 and 2, the Commission fully shares the concern to keep Parliament informed on various aspects of the implementation of the protocol."
"However, the Commission already forwards this kind of information, in line with the current interinstitutional arrangements and, in particular, with the framework agreement between the Commission and Parliament of 5 July 2000."
"Therefore, the Commission considers that these two amendments are not necessary."
"Concerning Amendment No 3, the agreement, according to Article 13 thereof, shall be renewable for additional periods of 3 years, unless notice of termination is given in writing by either of the parties."
"However, the protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and the financial contribution is only valid for three years and will have to be renewed after that period."
"If the amendment refers to the renewal of the protocol and not of the agreement as such, the amendment goes against the principles regarding the nature of the protocols to the fisheries agreements."
"Since the protocols are annexed to the framework agreements, their periodical renewal does not require any new directive for negotiations."
"Concerning Amendment No 4, considering the importance of the fisheries agreement for Côte d'Ivoire – in terms of the 30 000 jobs generated by EU canneries in Abidjan, and the fact that the financial contribution goes mainly to scientific research, control and surveillance – not extending the agreement would be a disaster for the country."
"It would also be a serious problem for EU fishermen and the investments made in Côte d'Ivoire."
"Failing to extend the agreement would mean isolating Côte d'Ivoire."
"This is not the sign the EU wants to give to a country which is struggling to find a way back to peace."
". Mr President, I should like to thank the Commissioner for his very fulsome presentation."
"One of the great pleasures of chairing the Committee on Fisheries is having to come here late at night to address an empty chamber on international fisheries agreements with far flung corners of the globe."
"This is no exception."
"However, this evening's debate on Côte d'Ivoire has been provoked, not on the usual matters relating to third-country fisheries agreements, but by the Verts/ALE and ELDR groups, who have expressed quite legitimate concerns over the current civil war in that country, and their fears that Community funding should not be sent to a zone of conflict lest it pour petrol on the flames."
"As the House will know, the main rebel army in Côte d'Ivoire, who call themselves the New Forces, signed a French-brokered peace deal with Prime Minister Seydou Diarra last January."
"Sadly, this peace pact partially crumbled in September when the New Forces walked out of the government, accusing President Laurent Gbagbo of hoarding power and refusing to implement the conditions of the peace pact."
"Meanwhile, President Gbagbo has announced his intention to liberate rebel-held zones in the North and West of the country should the New Forces refuse to disarm."
"That is the position of Côte d'Ivoire today."
"It is against this rather unfavourable background that my report on the Commission's proposal seeks to extend the current fisheries agreement between the Community and Côte d'Ivoire for a further year, although the period actually commenced last July – as Commissioner Nielson pointed out – before the Parliament had even been consulted."
"The Commissioner said that Members of Parliament would find that this was disagreeable, and that is indeed the case."
"Being bounced into these again and again by the Commission is extremely disagreeable."
"Indeed in this case, payment to Côte d'Ivoire is due on 31 December 2003."
"So there is therefore a considerable need for urgency in settling this matter."
"It is regrettable that the Fisheries Committee was forced into this position once again."
"I trust, however, the Commission appreciates the efforts we have made to accelerate the process in order that this contract can be honoured in time."
"This agreement will be the sixth successive protocol between the EU and Ivory Coast."
"We first entered into a fisheries partnership with them in 1990 and have continued on an amicable basis ever since."
"However, inevitably – as Commissioner Nielson said – the political instability in the region resulted in our inability to take up some of the demersal fishing opportunities which we had negotiated in 2002."
"However, as the situation stabilised, it was possible for this fishery to resume again."
"Tuna fishing, which is the other major resource covered by this agreement, was never affected by the civil war and, in terms of the uptake of opportunities negotiated under the agreement, we have continued at a level of around 85%."
"As Commissioner Nielson pointed out, there are 71 licences available for tuna vessels, although as always in these partnership agreements, over 70% of the financial compensation goes to targeted actions ensuring the continuation of a sustainable fishery and underpinning conservation measures, scientific research and control and surveillance."
"These funds are closely monitored by the Commission to ensure compliance with the objectives of the protocol."
"In the absence of this agreement, we could not guarantee that a sustainable fishery would continue."
"Indeed we could see a complete free-for-all with IUU fishing causing the complete plunder of the stocks and the collapse of the fishery."
"It is important for those who oppose the renewal of this contract to understand the implications of their opposition."
"Commissioner Nielson highlighted that there are three large tuna canneries in Abidjan, funded by EU investment."
"Indeed, Abidjan is the focus for much of the tuna landings in West Africa and if, as the Verts/ALE and ELDR Groups suggest, we pull out of this agreement, 5000 direct jobs – and up to 30 000 indirect jobs – would disappear."
"Such an outcome would have catastrophic consequences for the social situation in Côte d'Ivoire and would seriously destabilise the country, plunging it into further conflict."
"So, I appeal to the Verts/ALE and ELDR Groups to think again and withdraw their amendments which would only make a bad situation worse."
"– Mr President, like the chairman of our Committee on Fisheries, I too have the privilege of speaking late this evening and I have the special privilege of acting on behalf of my coordinator, Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna."
"I should like to concur with what the chairman of the Committee on Fisheries has said, also in relation to the very difficult issue that is being discussed there."
"If you consider the situation in those coastal strips with much domestic unrest and wars, it remains to be seen to what extent we, once the situation has improved, can also employ fisheries policy to improve the situation in the country itself."
"Provided the money we invest in the fisheries agreements is well spent, Europe could play a greater role on that score too."
"On behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I am disappointed about the amendments on this subject tabled by the Liberal Group."
"I would have preferred to see more of a social component in them, and I back anything that can improve the situation in the African countries in relation to fisheries agreements."
"However, it is essential for all aspects to be discussed in depth."
"Once again, though, I wish to concur with the words of the chairman of the Committee on Fisheries."
"I have also noticed that these are widely supported, and I would ask the Commission on the one hand, for an all-out effort for the African countries, including a wise spending plan of the money from the fisheries agreements, but on the other, we consider it essential for the social components also to be taken into consideration."
"I am therefore looking forward to the Commission’s reaction, as well as Parliament’s."
"Mr President, today we in this Parliament have adopted a resolution on the Union's role in the prevention of conflicts in Africa, and in particular, in the application of the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement in Ivory Coast."
"In this resolution the European Parliament calls on all the conflicting parties to scrupulously apply the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement."
"The European Union has a responsibility in terms of preventing conflicts, and its various policies aimed at promoting commercial relations between Europe and developing countries represent a form of preventing this type of conflict."
"Commercial and human relations bring peoples closer together, contribute to their development and the development of their different economic sectors."
"My group therefore supports the fisheries agreement, because commercial agreements and relations between peoples promote peace and, in the case of fisheries agreements, also the development of the fisheries sector in the developing countries."
"We therefore support this report by Mr Stevenson in favour of a one-year extension of the current protocol, with the amendments approved by the Committee on Fisheries."
"Ivory Coast is a country at civil war which we must help so that it can achieve peace and economic progress."
"We Socialists therefore believe that the message we are sending through the extension of this fisheries agreement is a positive one."
"The war is not a reason to put an end to a fisheries agreement."
"If we did that it would be absurd and would increase the suffering of that country, and the same thinking would lead us to suspend imports of its products, such as coffee, cocoa or palm oil and, also, to suspend emerging oil operations and not to buy any more of its diamonds, its manganese, its iron, its cobalt, bauxite or copper."
"Why is there this insistence on putting an end to commercial fisheries agreements which bring the European Union closer to the developing countries and then to promote exports from those countries of agricultural products, for example, and also minerals, oil or gas?"
"Despite the war, the execution of the quotas allocated by the agreement, as in the case of tuna, has been good, and the level of catches of demersal species is improving."
"We in the Socialist Group believe that this agreement is of great benefit to the port of Abidjan, which is the largest tuna-fishing base in West Africa, where catches are the raw material for a large local processing industry which is a key element in Ivory Coast’s development."
"I believe that this is a good agreement illustrating how, in the case of a country which is faced with serious difficulties, fisheries agreements can operate well for both parties, the European Union and the developing country which is signing it with us."
"Mr President, since I first raised this question it has been interesting to see, in terms of language, how the approach of Members of Parliament and the Commission has actually changed."
"The Commission came to the Committee on Fisheries and said 'We have no way of negotiating a new agreement so we shall just extend it for another year'."
"Members indicated that the aim of this was to allow EU vessels to continue fishing despite the conflict."
"You are now actually trying to give the impression that this is somehow about helping the people in Côte d'Ivoire: the reality is that this is about helping ourselves."
"This is a country that is virtually in a state of civil war."
"It is impossible for the government to guarantee control and surveillance – in fact these were never satisfactory, even during peace time."
"What happens now is that the EU fleets can do what they like with no supervision whatsoever."
"The Commission actually promised a different approach to third-country agreements and this does not bode well."
"With respect to Côte d'Ivoire, the Commission has itself noted that the country faces serious problems in the control and surveillance of its waters."
"The state of monitoring is described as a major constraint."
"The Commission also noted that no information was actually received on the catches of surface long-liners and freeze trawlers."
"The Commission has also stated that, under the current terms of its third-country agreements, including the one with Côte d'Ivoire, it is impossible to know whether the money intended for the so-called targeted actions such as control and enforcement is, in fact, spent in the appropriate manner."
"We have said that this money should be placed in a separate budget."
"When it comes to the tuna canneries, look at where the main profits are going: there is complete hypocrisy here."
"This is a country in a state of conflict and it looks like the EU's approach is to allow our fleets to continue undisturbed, despite the fact that there is a conflict going on."
"This is the worst example ever of a fisheries agreement, and the Commission has to live up to its commitments and its promise to take a different approach to fisheries agreements where that is in the interest of the third country rather than in the interest of the European Union's over-capacity."
". – Mr President, I disagree with the claim that this is the worst fisheries agreement that we have."
"The fact is, unfortunately, that there are many worse agreements than this one."
"We are in the process of renewing and modernising these agreements, making them more relevant and increasing the focus on social development."
"The old generation of these agreements, however, really deserves a black mark, and it is thus extremely important to change this situation."
"This is happening on a country-by-country basis."
"The current conflict in Côte d'Ivoire is not a very good background for stopping this agreement."
"We should be wary of politicising the matter by using the agreement to put pressure on the Government to achieve peace and reconciliation."
"It is very difficult to pressurise the opposition in this way."
"As regards surveillance and the management of maritime resources, this conflict has not really taken place at sea, so I find it rather artificial to link the problems in the country with the continuation of this agreement."
"We are trying to do useful things in Côte d'Ivoire, and at the same time we are putting pressure on all sides to arrive at a compromise."
"If we start politicising this activity we will be sending the wrong signals to those involved."
"I would thus urge Parliament to stop this."
"Mrs McKenna made some very relevant points, however."
"There is a process under way to increase the focus on development in these fisheries agreements."
"That concludes the debate."
"The vote will be at 11.30 a.m. tomorrow."

"Mr President, since this is the season of good will, could you use the good offices of the presidency of Parliament to resolve a situation which has occurred in London?"
"I understand that the UK Independence Party, that august organisation, has locked out all the staff from the European Parliament office in London."
"At this time of the year we do not want to see more people on the streets."
"Could the President intervene to try and resolve the problem of those poor people stranded on the streets?"
"Mr Miller, although my initial suspicion is that all this has nothing to do with the agenda, I can quite understand your desire to see it in the Minutes, so that is where it now is."
"The next item is the report (A5-0451/2003) by Mrs Aaltonen on behalf of the Committee on Petitions on petition 842/2001 concerning the effects of discriminatory treatment afforded to persons with Multiple Sclerosis, within the European Union (2003/2173 (INI))."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, dear guests, on the last plenary day of the European Year of People with Disabilities, I am very grateful to be able to present to you, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, the report I have drawn up concerning the effects of discriminatory treatment afforded to persons with multiple sclerosis in the European Union."
"The background to this report is a petition by a young English woman two years ago and I am happy to be able to say that Louise McVay is at this moment sitting in the visitor’s gallery, observing what her determination and courage led to."
"Louise found out she had MS and was bitterly disappointed to learn that she simply had not been allowed to benefit from life enhancing medication."
"In her country, as elsewhere in Europe, people are accorded unequal status regarding the availability of medication and rehabilitation just because of where they live."
"Louise wrote to the President of the European Parliament, who redirected her letter to the Committee on Petitions."
"There are more than 400 000 MS sufferers in the European Union, and as one of them I myself started work in Parliament and the Committee on Petitions in the spring of this year, just at the time Louise’s petition came up for discussion."
"I was given the task of drafting this report, whose objective it is to shed further light on concrete ways of improving the lives of MS sufferers throughout the EU."
"MS affects young people at a time in their lives when study, the pursuit of a career and starting a family are important issues."
"Two out of three sufferers are women."
"The report shows just how much obtaining a diagnosis and treatment vary within the European Union."
"This disparity in acquiring the best possible medication and therapy violates people’s fundamental right to healthcare."
"I believe that with better levels of cooperation and the full support of all the Union’s institutions, above all and most obviously Parliament, health ministers will be able to concentrate resources more effectively on support for people with this disease."
"I believe that the disease’s erratic and unpredictable nature should be taken into account in such a way that sufferers are not so vulnerable with regard to keeping their jobs as well as their social environment."
"At the moment MS is an incurable illness and anyone diagnosed with it cannot just psychologically adapt to a change in their life."
"This disease puts a great strain on both the sufferer and his or her family, also financially."
"In connection with this I have tabled Amendment No 3 at Louise McVay’s request."
"Because her symptoms varied so much it was thought she did not meet the requirements which would entitle her to medical services."
"The report proposes a number of measures for international cooperation and research and it is hoped that the Commission will contribute to the realisation of these."
"The report urges the next meeting of health ministers of the Member States to include a debate on these requests in its agenda, and I hope that Parliament will be informed about the decisions taken and proposals for action."
"I have also tabled two amendments on the need to adhere to the precautionary principle, especially in the handling of toxic chemicals."
"The matter arose when in Scotland they suspected there was a link between TBT and MS. It is in any case known that this substance affects the central nervous system."
"Although my report specifically focuses on MS and its particular features, there are also a number of other similar illnesses, and, having discussed the matter with my colleague, I have decided to put forward another oral amendment to include a mention of these."
"In my country, Finland, there are just 6 000 MS sufferers, but each of us have many associates among the hundreds of thousands in the EU that share the same fate."
"Those of us the new precious drugs agree with feel a sense of solidarity with all those whose illness has progressed to the stage where they have become disabled."
"We could strive more to improve conditions for everyone."
"I hope that this, the first of my reports, will be read carefully by those at the level of responsibility for healthcare in the Member States."
"After all the political and constitutional controversies this week Parliament can show that we also listen to the citizen here, and not just the President-in-Office of the Council."
"It is good that people believe that Parliament exists for human expectations and requests for help and that it is not just a lot of buildings in an asphalt jungle in some country in central Europe."
"It would appear that the request by the public and which is mentioned in my report is now to be implemented, as Commissioner Diamantopoulou mentioned at the beginning of December that the Commission intends to propose a special directive to guarantee the rights of the disabled."
". Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Commission, I warmly welcome your report."
"It provides an extensive survey of the complex and complicated issue of multiple sclerosis and sheds light on a broad spectrum of related issues on which further action is needed, and I welcome those affected by them who are present with us today."
"I can understand the frustration of those who have to live with this illness."
"The health care available can vary widely, as can the way in which they are treated by their neighbours from day to day."
"It is bad enough to have to face being diagnosed with an illness as serious as this one, but it is even worse to realise that, although there is help to which you are entitled, you cannot access it, or that an employer is not prepared to take reasonable steps to enable you to carry on an active working life."
"I would therefore like to thank the petitioner, Mrs McVay, for raising these issues and, likewise, the rapporteur, Mrs Aaltonen, for drafting such a comprehensive report in order to deal with them."
"Although it lies within the competence of the Member States to ensure that health care is provided and to organise it, this does not mean that we at the European level have no contribution to make to dealing with the problems that this report raises."
"Many of the differences in provision in Europe could be adjusted simply by exchanging information and best practice."
"In order to make it easier to cooperate in this general area, the Commission has brought together health ministers, patients, staff from the health services and providers of services to them, as well as insurers, to join in a high-level process of reflection on patient mobility and developments in health provision in the European Union."
"At the concluding session at the beginning of last week, agreement was reached on a report containing 19 recommendations for action on a variety of issues, including the exchange of information and best practice."
"This would facilitate the promotion of ideas such as the development of European reference centres, which could in their turn develop professional excellence and training that would benefit both patients and those who work in the health field."
"The Commission is planning to issue a communication in March 2004, which will submit proposals for responses to these recommendations."
"Mrs Aaltonen also discusses the problem of discrimination against people with multiple sclerosis."
"Multiple sclerosis is regarded as a disability under Directive 2000/78 prohibiting discrimination on the grounds of age, a disability, religion or belief, or of sexual orientation."
"Sufferers from multiple sclerosis are thereby protected from discrimination in the workplace on the grounds of this illness."
"Employers must take reasonable steps to enable disabled employees to do their jobs."
"The Commission has mounted a wide information campaign in all the Member States to accompany this legislation and to inform employers and workers of these rights."
"Furthermore, the Commission intends to hold, in early 2004, a public consultation on its future strategy to combat discrimination, which may also include the adoption of anti-discrimination legislation outside the spheres of work and employment."
"The report lays stress, moreover, on the need for greater scientific knowledge about multiple sclerosis."
"At the European level, the Research Framework Programmes are making a contribution to this."
"Projects in these areas are already being promoted under the Fifth Research Framework Programme, and the topic of neuro-immune dysfunction can also be included in future invitations to tender under the current Sixth Framework Programme."
"We may note, in conclusion, that the report calls on individual states and the European level to raise awareness of multiple sclerosis."
"As has already been said, the problem of inequality in health provision is primarily a matter for which the Member States must accept responsibility, but I very much hope that they will take note of this report and of today’s debate."
"As far as the Commission is concerned, I have named a number of areas in which action at the European level can help to raise the issues we have mentioned."
"Let me close by again praising the outstanding work that the rapporteur has done in drafting this wide-ranging and useful report, which will itself help to make society more aware of multiple sclerosis and of the problems associated with it."
". Mr President, I wish to join with others in congratulating Louise McVay for a tremendous achievement in bringing this issue this far, and my thanks for excellent cooperation to our rapporteur, Mrs Aaltonen."
"Indeed, I pay credit to Louise's local constituency MEPs, Mrs Read and Mr Whitehead, who have followed this through the parliamentary process."
"This debate, resolution and report is a historic landmark for 400 000 people with multiple sclerosis in Europe."
"It will lead to concrete action."
"Just as resolutions of this Parliament on the rights of people with autism and on the recognition of sign language for deaf people have meant real achievements, I believe that will be true from today onwards for people with multiple sclerosis."
"I am very pleased that the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has produced an opinion to contribute its authorship to this report, because within seven years, 50% of people with multiple sclerosis lose their jobs, even though they want to work and are capable of working."
"This is not just about access to appropriate health care, it is the fact that getting access to that health care could make a huge difference to people's working, social and personal lives."
"I would like to thank the Multiple Sclerosis Society of the United Kingdom."
"Sarah Philips, its chair, is also with us in the public gallery."
"Because of their campaigning, a new scheme was introduced in 2002, which means that 3 000 more people with multiple sclerosis now benefit from the latest and most effective treatments in the United Kingdom, my own Member State."
"It is truly an achievement of disabled people working and campaigning together, and one that we, in common with our colleagues in the European Multiple Sclerosis Platform, want to see spread throughout Europe."
"We talk about people suffering from MS. I understand why we use that language."
"But we do not want disabled people to be seen as victims, we want them to be seen as achievers like Louise McVay, whose achievements we celebrate in this European Year of Disabled People."
"Mr President, I would like to add my thanks to Louise McVay, to the rapporteur, and also to my two colleagues from the region, Mr Helmer who is here today and will be speaking later on, and to Mr Heaton Harris who also followed this matter very closely."
"I am sure many of us know somebody who has suffered from, or has, multiple sclerosis, and I take Mr Howitt's last point."
"But let us start by remembering, as the Commissioner said, that health is not an EU issue."
"It is something we can help with, but we must not be deluded into thinking that it is a power of ours."
"Indeed it is not even a Member State issue."
"The British Government in its devolution has devolved health to Scotland, because often the best remedies are found close to home."
"Indeed, if we are going to apply the precautionary principle anywhere it should be applied to the extension of EU legislation into areas that are best dealt with locally."
"Having said that, I welcome this report which has many positive things in it."
"Firstly the code of best practice, and secondly closer international scientific collaboration."
"Having said that things are often best done at local level, many things can also be done at a European, or even a wider level."
"We should not forget the centres of research excellence, particularly in the United States, and we should seek as wide a collaboration as we can."
"Insofar as the EU can assist in that, through the research programmes etc., we certainly should."
"Clearly, as the report says, we should involve service users in the research."
"Things need to be done with the cooperation of people, not for them."
"As such, we in this Group also support strongly the call for a Europe-wide study to be undertaken, clearly in cooperation with the WHO, because we want to spread the knowledge and gather the knowledge as widely as possible."
"We welcome, as the report says, the comparative evaluation being undertaken by the European Multiple Sclerosis Centre."
"All of these are good and positive things."
"Turning to the problem of drugs – and this is a problem because, in British terms, where you live can affect what you get – we can produce the information but we cannot direct people how to spend their medical resources, and I am pleased to say that this report does not say that."
"But people who have MS clearly must be encouraged to play a full part in the community and such discrimination as exists within the community cannot be allowed to stand."
"One of the things we have to be constantly on the lookout for is giving people a fair deal and making it possible for them to play a full part in the community, as full a part as any of us."
"I would like to talk about two of the amendments on introducing this precautionary principle."
"They are unnecessary and divisive."
"The chemicals directive and chemicals policy is the subject of a separate effort within this House."
"If you are going to apply the precautionary principle to toxic chemicals, let us look at it in the context of the chemicals directive."
"Maybe we should also consider that some people might talk about applying the precautionary principle to new treatments."
"The precautionary principle is a separate subject and accordingly our Group cannot support Amendments 1 or 2."
"This has nothing to do with us not wanting the best treatment for sufferers from MS, it has to do with sheer common sense and dealing with things in the appropriate place."
"I close by saying that I welcome this report."
"I commend all the people who have contributed to it and we look forward to supporting it."
"– Mr President, it is customary for speakers to thank the rapporteur, but I want, today, to break this rule by thanking the petitioner, Mrs Louise McVay, for submitting this petition and thereby drawing attention not only to her own plight but also to the immense difficulties faced by MS sufferers in the EU, and the unequal treatment they receive."
"Even though the Commission’s initial response has nothing encouraging to say about this petition, I am very glad that the Committee on Petitions has taken the initiative in producing this report and, yet again, taken very seriously something that is of concern to the European public;"
"I am convinced that Mrs Aaltonen’s report will prompt changes that will improve the quality of life for MS sufferers in the European Union."
"Just how urgently needed that is is demonstrated by the considerable qualitative differences between the responses by the health ministries of the Member States to treatments and therapies for people suffering from MS, which also show that sufferers from MS are not yet treated with the consideration that they urgently need."
"This report is an initial assessment, and the conclusions to which it comes are important ones, reflecting, among other things, the demands made by the German MS Association, which celebrated its 50th anniversary in November."
"I see it as being of the utmost importance that the needs of young people with MS should be considered and taken into account, as well as that those affected by it should be enabled, as far as possible and for as long as possible, to work and enjoy equal rights in the sphere of employment."
"Our rapporteur, Mrs Aaltonen, herself demonstrates that, with the right therapy and treatment, people with MS can lead active lives in the world of work and in society at large."
"The Group of the Party of European Socialists, to which I belong, endorses all the amendments tabled by the rapporteur and the report as a whole."
"The various tragic effects of the disease, which affect the lives of sufferers and their families, compel people with MS to engage in a lifelong struggle against a disease that is still incurable and whose progress is unpredictable."
"The EU must play a strategic role in improving equal access to therapies and treatments, by calling on the Member States to coordinate their actions, including in research, and by facilitating access to the best practice in treatment and rehabilitation."
"Sufferers from MS in the future Member States will benefit from this."
"Mr President, as has already been stated, there are 400 000 multiple sclerosis sufferers across the whole of the European Union, but it has taken only one today to get this debate, a remarkable young women who has already been mentioned, Louise McVay, who is in the gallery at the moment."
"It demonstrates what tenacity can achieve."
"I am also pleased that it is on the agenda during the European Year of People with Disabilities."
"I join others in congratulating the rapporteur for such a wide-ranging report."
"It talks about equal access to health care."
"There are differences within Member States and across the whole of the European Union."
"Some drugs like beta interferon, which can help some MS sufferers, are not widely available."
"Multiple sclerosis research should also be covered in the seventh framework directive."
"I am very disappointed – a lot of people are – that the sixth framework directive is not living up to the commitment that was made to mainstream disability issues."
"We must also ensure that young disabled people – that includes people with MS – do not end up being cared for alongside elderly people."
"That is why we must work towards independent living and why it is so important that the employment directive is fully implemented in all Member States."
"I am sorry to say that the deadline of 3 December this year has been missed by many Member States."
"We must take this opportunity now to ensure that does not continue, and we must get a specific disability directive."
"I was very pleased that the Commissioner mentioned that in her speech in Rome closing the European Year."
"Let us hope that we now get that timetable."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to thank Mrs Aaltonen for her wonderful work, approved unanimously in the Committee on Petitions."
"I hope it will also be approved unanimously in this House."
"It is important that we deal with these health problems, in response to this citizen’s petition, relating to the discriminatory treatment of patients with multiple sclerosis."
"We are aware that many chronic long-term illnesses do not receive satisfactory attention, and the treatment offered to these people is currently insufficient."
"This report contains proposals for resolving the situation of people suffering from multiple sclerosis in all the member countries, not only therapeutically, but also by proposing effective services to deal with the other needs suffered by these patients, as well as their integration into society, applying effective therapies and treatments which modify their illness."
"It provides these patients with useful information and support, things which are very important to them."
"I will illustrate what I have said by means of an example."
"In the Spanish State there are 40 000 people suffering from multiple sclerosis."
"Some are as courageous and constant as Mrs Louise McVay, and I would give the example of Martí i Pol, a Catalan writer who died recently and managed to overcome and live with his illness thanks to the solidarity and help of everybody around him, not just family, but the whole of society in general, his people and his region."
"It is an absolute priority to dedicate funds to research programmes aimed at finding a solution to this disease, in all the Member States."
"The GUE/NGL Group supports the report in its entirety, as well as those amendments which we believe will provide solutions for alleviating this disease."
"Furthermore, I would like to stress the importance of the Committee on Petitions, which maintains relations with the citizens and makes it possible, by means of their petitions, in some cases to produce reports like this one aimed at improving aspects of their daily lives."
"I would like once again to express my gratitude for this valuable report, which we hope will have effective results in the Member States, by means of the proposals which the Commission will undoubtedly make."
"Mr President, I would like to add my congratulations to the rapporteur and most especially to the petitioner, Louise McVay, on her initiative and determination in getting this matter to the European Parliament."
"It takes resolve to get a matter on the floor of the European Parliament, and for someone suffering from the ravages of this disease, it shows outstanding strength of will."
"I am also pleased that it is the European Parliament's petitions procedure that has enabled that to happen."
"Allow me to tell a personal story."
"About ten years ago, my sister-in-law, married to my twin brother, invited me to their home for the weekend."
"She asked me to look at my twin brother."
"He did not appear to be standing quite correctly – something was wrong with his balance."
"She said that it was my job to convince him to go to a doctor."
"I did that job and the early stages of MS were first of all diagnosed."
"That subsequently was proven not to be the case: he had a related disease, called ataxia nervosa."
"In two horrible years he was confined to a wheelchair and finally the disease killed him."
"In one respect he was very fortunate: he had a great employer."
"I will name them: Shell UK."
"They paid for treatment, a chauffeur to drive him to and from work and for a personal assistant to operate his computer and to push his wheelchair."
"They had the sense, the decency and the foresight and, I suppose, the resources to treat a disabled person as a real person."
"That is all that anybody asks and that is what this report asks."
"I have told this story for two reasons."
"Firstly, to remind all of us who are fit and active today that tomorrow we could find ourselves in a wheelchair."
"If that happens as a result of an accident, often compensation is paid."
"If it happens as a result of disease, there is no insurance or compensation and you are in the hands of society – people like you and me."
"Secondly, for some diseases there is no treatment – or it is only patchily available – and there is very limited research."
"Further research is needed and we must be prepared to encourage and support that research as requested in this report."
"Louise is right: if there is therapy that helps, for example beta interferons, then it must be made available to all sufferers."
"I am particularly grateful to the rapporteur for putting forward the oral amendments that would allow the pressure from this petition to be used to help not just the hundreds of thousands of sufferers from multiple sclerosis, but also sufferers from other similar mobility-impairment and neuro-degenerative diseases, who need help too."
"We must learn from each other and we must learn to help Louise and the hundreds of thousands like her."
"Mr President, I too want to congratulate Louise McVay and indeed the rapporteur, Mrs Aaltonen, for bringing forward this report from the Committee on Petitions."
"There is a clear need, based on the information that has been provided to us, for the European Union to become engaged in seeking to develop best practice across the European Union to ensure that the people of Europe have adequate access to services, therapies, drugs and indeed aftercare, and that they are not discriminated against in relation to employment."
"There is also a need for a Europe-wide epidemiological study which should be financed by the European Union, and that should be done as a matter of urgency."
"There is also a need for a new directive on disability rights which would guarantee that people who suffer from conditions of this kind are not discriminated against in accessing jobs."
"It is one thing to be in a job and have this condition, but if you have the condition it is virtually impossible to access a job subsequently."
"These are matters strictly speaking within the competence of the Member States but it is clear that as a Union and as a Parliament we have an obligation to seek to ensure that European citizens are treated properly. It is estimated that something like 400 000 people in Europe have this condition."
"In Ireland, for instance, there are around 500 000 people with neurological conditions of various kinds."
"I do not at know offhand how many of those are MS patients, but a recent study has shown that there is a 2:1 gap in terms of the number of consultants necessary to provide treatment, care and appointments for people with conditions of this kind."
"There are clearly large gaps in our services and we have an obligation to try and close those gaps."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I am not among those who usually thank rapporteurs for no reason, but now there is genuinely cause for saying thank you."
"It is a special pleasure for me, who have had the privilege of knowing Mrs Aaltonen for a long time, to congratulate her on her first report here in the European Parliament."
"She is a positive person who has fought many important political battles for young people, women and, now, the handicapped."
"It is a privilege for the European Parliament to have access to her knowledge, energy and experience."
"These qualities have really been of value in the preparation of the report."
"I am also grateful for the fact that Mrs Aaaltonen has taken account of my proposal concerning the issues of genetics."
"Pentti Tienari, a senior lecturer in experimental neurology in Finland, has researched into these matters, and the fact is, unfortunately, that there is a background of genetic factors."
"The Vikings are suspected of having spread the disease because it mainly occurs in Orkney and Shetland and also in the area around the River Kyro in Finland."
"The disease also exists where Germanic peoples have been on the move."
"I hope that continuing research will also take account of this genetic factor."
"I also wish to say that the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, which is usually scrupulous about the issue of subsidiarity, will for the most part approve all these amendments."
"It is said that the Member States must cooperate, and I believe it is important for the Member States to cooperate in order to arrive at binding standards."
"It may be possible for this to happen outside the structure of the EU, for example through cooperation between ministers in the framework of the Council of Europe."
"It is there that we should produce binding recommendations on health care."
"We ought to have a precise division between the EU’s and the Member States’ respective areas of competence."
"– Mr President, at the end of the European Year for People with Disabilities it is particularly significant that this Parliament should be examining a concrete case and dealing with the discrimination to which people with multiple sclerosis are subject. This inflammatory disease of the central nervous system and nerve fibres gradually develops lesions that prevent the nerves from functioning, causing generalised and unpredictable disability."
"I congratulate the rapporteur on the work she has done and hope that the Commission and the Member States will commit themselves more to solving the countless problems that people affected by this disease have to face – taking account of this report and the work done by organisations representing multiple sclerosis sufferers – in their fight for equality of access to treatment and services and in defence of their dignity."
"It is calculated that there are more than 400 000 such citizens in the various countries of the European Union, as has already been mentioned."
"A greater commitment to research into this disease is required, specifically within the next research framework programme since, unfortunately, it has not been included in the current one, as has also been mentioned here."
"We also need effective measures against discrimination in health care and the elimination of all barriers and obstacles that hinder equality of access to goods and services, as well as greater attention to employment and respect for personal dignity."
"While I support this report and its proposals on this concrete issue, however, I feel I must underline the need to situate these measures within the more global context of the fight to eliminate discrimination against people with disabilities."
"As this year, which has brought disability problems to the forefront, comes to an end, it is necessary to make the commitment that all European Union institutions will stand firm in their fight against discrimination."
"I point especially to the need for a Community policy on disability and for giving top priority in the various Community policies to matters relating to discrimination against and the human rights of people with disabilities."
"Only in this way will there be effective social inclusion."
"What is required is a proposal for a directive based on Article 13 of the Treaty to fight discrimination based on disability."
"This new directive must prevent new barriers from being raised and stipulate that the existing barriers that people with disabilities have to face must be eliminated throughout the European Union."
"It would be good if this could happen in the short term, but we know that that will only be possible if the Member States make a great effort to adopt the necessary concrete, particularly financial measures, which have been affected by the irrational criteria of the Stability Pact and the resulting budget cuts, as has happened in Portugal."
"Promoting the integration of people with disabilities also requires the proper transposal of the Council directive setting out a legal framework for equality of treatment in matters of employment and work."
"I also affirm my support for the United Nations Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities."
"I therefore hope, Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, that this report and this debate will be an important contribution in the fight against discrimination towards people with disabilities and that the Commission and the Member States will take it into due consideration."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, from time to time a certain impetus is needed in order for an issue to be considered, and, in this case, Mrs Louise McVay has provided it."
"In this case, and in those like it, we see again and again how much cold-heartedness there is in this European Union of ours – of the need for which I am thoroughly convinced, and for which we are all working together."
"After all, it takes a certain optimism not to resort to the criticism, which is to some extent stereotypical, that Europe is only for those who are fast, big, rich, healthy and strong, but instead to believe that this Europe is there also for the vulnerable members of society, for those who are slow and cannot keep up the pace – and here I am not talking about ‘core Europe’, but about individuals who are slower and cannot keep up – for the sick, for the little people."
"We have no problems with travel."
"We move money, goods and cars from one Member State to another."
"We use them; we have a single drivers’ licence and a single set of road traffic regulations."
"Where common action in social matters is concerned, though, or common action in the cultural sphere, it is unfortunate that this Europe cannot demonstrate the rhythm and speed that it already possesses in other spheres, and for which we are grateful."
"It would surely make sense for us to be as quick about things in the social and cultural spheres as we are elsewhere."
"Members – among whom I particularly want to thank Mrs Aaltonen, the rapporteur – have already spoken at length about the need for, and importance of, measures to deal with multiple sclerosis."
"I therefore want to draw particular attention to the incongruousness of our having such a need to catch up in the social sphere."
"There is no single entitlement card for the disabled, Commissioner; a disabled person who lives in Germany cannot go to France, nor a disabled person from Italy to Germany and have his status, which is a disadvantage, recognised, not even when it comes to getting a parking space, let alone a seat on public transport and other similar things beside."
"This is where we urgently need to make up for lost time."
"I believe – indeed, I am convinced – that it is not enough to do no more than say ‘we have no responsibility for this’."
"We must do far more here, and be more consistent in doing it."
"I hope that this debate will make us more aware of these matters too."
"Mr President, my honourable friend mentioned that 400 000 people in the European Union suffer from multiple sclerosis. Most of them are women, in a ratio of 2 to 3."
"With current scientific resources, diagnosis is made at an early stage and, with suitable treatment, the advance of the disease can be controlled or slowed down and the quality of life of sufferers improved substantially."
"We know on the basis of the Union Treaty, that the Community applies policies and actions with the aim of safeguarding a high level of health protection."
"However, in order for this sort of thing to be feasible, one of the preconditions is equal access for citizens to health services and equal provision of all efficient means."
"Hence, the argument that dealing with the consequences of this particular disease comes under the jurisdiction of the Member States does not stand up and should not exist."
"What is needed, as quickly as possible, is a new epidemiological study, at European level and in collaboration with the WHO, so that the extent of the problem can be seen from the data collected and the need for intensive research and international cooperation can be highlighted."
"The report by the Committee on Petitions is revelatory and enlightening and, of course, it is clear that I totally agree with the proposal to establish a code of best practices, because this will result in our defining uniform methods of treatment and rehabilitation activities."
"Similarly, I absolutely agree with the view that the health authorities in the Member States must promote self-help programmes among patients with multiple sclerosis which, together with the application of special working conditions, will constitute two important factors in maintaining good mental health which, as we know, is significantly impaired by the very nature of the illness."
"Finally, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur and Mrs Louise McVayn, who has demonstrated to us that one person who fights can obtain results for many people."
"Mr President, I would also like to welcome my constituent, Louise McVay, from Loughborough in the East Midlands, who is in the gallery."
"She has been a tireless campaigner for MS sufferers and I commend her courage and her hard work."
"I would also like to thank Mrs Aaltonen for her excellent work on this report."
"MS is the most common form of disability affecting young adults in the EU, and two-thirds of sufferers are women."
"Of the 400 000 sufferers in the EU, 85 000 are in my own country, the United Kingdom."
"MS demands our attention."
"This report proposes the very best kind of European cooperation."
"It recognises that the EU has no competence to determine the health policies of Member States, still less to set their budgets or spending priorities for Member States' health services."
"That is as it should be."
"What the EU can and should do is to offer the exchange of best practice, to benchmark performance, to encourage uniformly high standards of care."
"It has another vital role and that is in the area of medical research."
"As spokesman for my Conservative delegation on research, I share the view of Ms Lynne that we should like to see chronic diseases more strongly prioritised in the EU's framework research programmes."
"While it is fashionable to concentrate on newly emerging diseases, we cannot afford to lose sight of familiar problems which affect huge numbers of patients."
"We still do not have a full understanding of the causes of MS and we should not rest until this problem is solved."
"Certainly we have much to do in my own country, the UK."
"Our Labour Government has failed to address the problem of the postcode lottery, which means that the levels of care and availability of drugs can vary from street to street."
"I was first alerted to this problem for MS sufferers in the UK during our 2001 general election campaign when one of our Conservative candidates was approached by a young lady in Nottingham, Mrs Peel, who had just been diagnosed with the disease."
"Mrs Peel, who was pregnant at the time, was alarmed to find that she was being denied therapies and treatment by the local health authority simply because of where she lived."
"I was very pleased that the Conservative spokesman on health at that time, Dr Liam Fox, was able to visit Mrs Peel personally to listen to her case."
"I would also like to commend the European MS Platform for their campaigning work."
"I was glad to support their European MS Awareness Day in the European Parliament in Brussels in June of last year."
"Such events are invaluable in briefing Members on the issues surrounding the disease and the problems faced by sufferers."
"As we come to the end of the European Year of People with Disabilities, we must focus on the needs of MS patients and the research-based opportunities to accelerate the development of more effective treatments."
"Mr President, I thank Mrs Aaltonen, the rapporteur, and Louise McVay, who brought the petition leading to this report on multiple sclerosis."
"Mr Whitehead, one of Louise's East Midlands MEPs, has had to leave to take part in a vote on another vital health matter, and he sends his apologies."
"MS affects people in different ways: some days can be good, some days can be bad."
"However, it is a deteriorating condition with no cause and no cure."
"I became involved in working on the issue after meeting an active group of Scottish MS patients."
"They contacted me, told me of the impact the disease has on their daily lives, and made me aware that Scotland has the highest rate of MS in the world."
"I have since sponsored the first European MS Awareness Seminar, held in the European Parliament, and set up Parliament's MS interest group."
"Primarily the petition before us tries to raise awareness of access to not only medicines but also to the treatment of patients with MS. It is quite fitting that, as we end the 2003 European Year for People with Disabilities, we reflect on what we can positively do to help people with MS."
"No discrimination at the workplace would be a good start."
"A number of people I have spoken with have lost their jobs because their employer was not flexible or understanding about MS. That is why implementing an EU directive on equal treatment in employment is so important."
"Access to medicines and new treatments is essential."
"It is timely that just yesterday this Parliament voted in a new pharmaceutical package that hopefully will lead not only to more innovation but also to better access to cheaper medicines."
"I am glad that some British hospitals have now introduced MS nurses."
"Many people working in the medical field do not know how to treat patients with MS. I had no idea that a needle in the skin could perhaps inflict unbearable pain on someone with MS. Better recognition and understanding of MS is needed."
"MS patients deserve better."
"I thank Louise again for bringing this before us today."
". Mr President, I wish to thank everyone for their speeches and support."
"I would like to inform all those who were of the opinion that this was solely the responsibility of the Member States that I have been in contact with the health ministers for all the Member States and in a sense they have already committed themselves in quite a different way to this report, having allowed themselves to be involved in producing it."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m."
"The next item is the Commission’s statement on the World Summit on the Information Society (first phase: Geneva, 10-12 December 2003)."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the first phase of the World Summit on the Information Society took place in Geneva from 10 to 12 December this year."
"The Summit was attended by around 11 000 participants and can be regarded as a multilateral success to which the European Union contributed substantially."
"On 12 December, the delegates adopted a Declaration of Principles and Plan of Action."
"These documents now form the basis for a common concept of the information society in all United Nations member states, largely inspired by the European policy of an Information Society for All."
"The contributions made by the European Union to the various phases of the Summit preparatory process were, in every case, coordinated European positions which were developed by the Commission in collaboration with the Member States and the presidency, and were always presented in the negotiations by the Chairperson of the relevant Council on behalf of the EU-15 plus 10."
"The Summit has enabled major progress to be achieved in several areas."
"For the first time, the importance of the information society as a driving force for social and economic development was recognised at a World Summit."
"The key role played by legal and regulatory frameworks that promote competition and enable a better range of services to be provided to all citizens was recognised."
"The importance of solidarity in the context of combating the digital divide was recognised, along with the role of information and communications technologies (ICT) for advancing the internationally agreed development goals defined in the United Nations’ Millennium Declaration."
"In the field of Internet Government, that is, the future administrative and regulatory structures governing the Internet, a working group was set up under the aegis of the UN Secretary-General."
"It is open to all participants and its remit is to discuss various options which will then be presented at the second phase of the Summit in Tunis."
"On all other points which were still open at the start of the most recent negotiations at the beginning of December, satisfactory results were achieved as well."
"This applies especially to the paragraphs on human rights, free access to information and the media."
"It also applies to the points on intellectual property, Open Source Software and the security of networks and information."
"With regard to funding, the text accepted by all participants recognises the desire of some countries to establish a voluntary Digital Solidarity Fund and the desire of others to undertake an evaluation of existing funding mechanisms and carry out a study on the efficiency and feasibility of such a fund."
"This work will be undertaken over the course of next year by a Task Force under the aegis of the Secretary-General of the United Nations."
"The Commission will follow up the outcomes of this World Summit and incorporate them into its own policies, especially in the development policy field."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by welcoming Mrs Schreyer, speaking on behalf of Mr Liikanen, and thank her very much for taking the opportunity to report back to us so soon on the Geneva Summit."
"I was privileged to be there as part of a small group of colleagues from Parliament."
"I want to congratulate both the Commission and the Italian presidency for the very active role they took."
"I am sorry the Italian presidency is not here today, but I had a chance to meet the Italian minister and his team, who played a crucial role in negotiating what was a very well-balanced declaration and action plan."
"I would like to pick up on some of the lessons that I learned."
"As far as the European Parliament was concerned, the STOA unit, Parliament's Scientific and Technological Options Assessment group – which had led the initiative to be represented there – had its own stand, in conjunction with the Commission."
"We were also represented at a very important earlier conference about the role of science in the information society, so there was no doubt at all about our engagement with the process."
"The most important thing we must reflect on is that we do not just have a political declaration, we also have an action plan and we have two years in which to make some real demonstrable progress before this summit reconvenes in Tunis."
"In the context of these complex multilateral discussions, that is not a very long time."
"We have a big challenge to show that we in the European Union and the Member States are taking seriously the need to apply and extend the benefits of information and communications technology to the developing world."
"As Mrs Schreyer said in the statement, the application of those tools to economic, social, health, educational and a whole range of other developments is extremely important."
"For me, one of the crucial lessons from Geneva – where so many developing countries showed us how they were applying information technology – is that we must develop expertise in those countries to enable them to develop projects on the ground that respond to their own particular needs, because every country starts from a different position in terms of infrastructure, economic development, learning capacity, etc. We are not looking for a one-size-fits-all solution, we are looking to disseminate our expertise."
"One of my particular pleas is that we focus our attention where we really can help, which is on extending and encouraging research and development capability in the developing world."
"We want a stronger network of computer scientists and specialists working in universities and technology institutes who are linked together by a global research network."
"In that way they can develop their own solutions, and also draw on a much wider learning-community to help them develop the tools that they want – the standard applications, the other ideas – and they can exchange their work with each other."
"The European Union has invested in the world's largest research network and we are already seeing it spread worldwide."
"We had the welcome news in Geneva that South Africa, for example, wants to join that network."
"So we can set an example."
"My final point concerns our engagement as parliamentarians."
"It was disappointing that the summit declaration did not make any reference to parliamentary engagement at all."
"I spoke at a meeting of the Inter-Parliamentary Union with parliamentarians from many countries all over the world."
"There was disappointment that we are not more fully engaged but a determination that we should be better engaged in the next stage of the process."
"I would like to see us – perhaps with assistance from Member States and the Commission – develop a proper electronic parliament focusing on these issues, so that when we go to Tunis – and I hope that more colleagues will join us for that – we will be able to engage in the political debate."
"This is an area where Europe has so much to offer, but the whole engagement needs to be stepped up and integrated with an overall development policy."
"Mr President, the debate on the information society and globalisation may not prevent globalisation from happening and/or facilitate it; nonetheless, it helps us to decode the terms and conditions under which it comes about."
"Besides, this is our basic role as Members of the European Parliament: to identify the political components, the clashes, and to make provision for solutions to the economic and social problems which are caused."
"European citizens are waiting for answers for the dynamic procedures which have a dramatic influence on their life in the twenty-first century."
"The International Telecommunications Union took the initiative for this first world summit on the information society held in Geneva, but the UN put its stamp on it, giving mainly developing countries the chance to claim equal opportunities for their citizens and to demand a fairer information society."
"Creating a solidarity fund is, in my opinion, the basic demand."
"Internet access and mobile telephone communication requirements need to be met by 2010, so that the most remote communities in developing world villages can have real access."
"The action plan is very important for this objective."
"Of course, alongside everything discussed in Geneva, we expect other important initiatives to continue, such as the World Mass Media Observatory being promoted and the new European Security Agency due to start up at the beginning of 2004."
"These are necessary tools in dealing with the new conditions."
"However, there is also a whole series of issues which need to be answered."
"Electronic democracy is perhaps the core issue."
"At the same time, however, we are also interested in the issues of education, health, intellectual property, security, human rights and economic and social practices."
"All these require their own operating framework within the digital environment."
"And the answers are not always easy."
"That is why the European Union needs to monitor closely and be able to be present with its opinions."
"I am sorry the debate is being held so long after the summit, but we must act efficiently in the future if we are to be able to express our opinion at it."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to thank you and my esteemed fellow MEP, Mr Harbour, for their reports to this House."
"It is, however, slightly ironical that the best information about what happened at the summit has appeared on the radical party’s web sites."
"The EU’s own web sites have contained extremely little information about this summit."
"What kind of information society do we live in?"
"It is good that a summit should have been held because international cooperation is required where Internet security is concerned."
"We believe we achieved something to combat spam when we adopted the directive on privacy protection in electronic communications, but we have got nowhere."
"As I say, international cooperation is needed."
"It was good that the final document contained regulations on free competition, values, methods and the neutrality of technology, which showed that success is being achieved in Europe in creating an information society."
"As is usual in the case of international conferences, the action plan and the final document contain many sound pledges concerning how this is to be developed and how we can help the developing countries."
"An interminable number of international summits have now taken place at which we have given pledges concerning, for example, education for all and the fast track initiative within the World Bank to help children and, above all, girls to benefit from an education."
"In spite of this, nothing is happening."
"Regarding the fast track initiative within the World Bank, the developed countries have not even been able to comply with their modest pledge of slightly more than USD 300 million."
"After no more than a year and a half, we are over USD 100 million in arrears."
"When will the developing countries stop believing in what is said in these international forums?"
"Before this summit, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party stated that we cannot see Tunisia being a host country for the follow-up conference as long as it violates freedom of expression."
"In that respect, we are disappointed in the outcome."
"Mr President, at a time when two-thirds of the world's population are suffering from poverty, hunger and disease, the fact that the UN organised a world summit in Geneva on the information society sounds somewhat strange."
"One wonders if perhaps the ultimate objective of the debate was none other than to increase the sales and profits of the information technology monopolies, in other words IBM for computers, Microsoft for software and the telecommunications companies."
"Under the weight of these contradictions, it is not at all strange that the summit did not result in anything specific."
"Not only the proclamation of principles but also the action plan which were adopted are simple wish lists."
"The objective of the possibility of Internet access for half the world's population by 2015 and the objective of their all having access to radio and television by then are not supported by any measures."
"Similarly, the questions of economic aid or regulatory issues for the Internet were not addressed."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the problem which we have to solve is not how some people, at a time when they have nothing to eat, will plant themselves down in front of a screen and stab away furiously at a keyboard."
"The problem is the prosperity of mankind and the to that is peace."
"However, this problem will not be solved as long as the monopolies exploit the wealth of our planet for their own benefit, as long as they control information technology, as long as the imperialists massacre our fellow human beings."
"It will be solved through the fight of the peoples for radical, revolutionary social change."
"Mr President, Commissioner Schreyer, an initiative for a World Summit on the Information Society is a good initiative."
"Information society means freedom, freedom of information, freedom of circulation of information, and it is there that we have a problem: a free information society that meets in Tunis to discuss the freedom of the information society is like sending a small child into a cage of lions to learn how to eat."
"We really must, indeed, be aware that Internet surfers are arrested in Tunisia, that people who use the Internet and who use the information society for the freedom that it offers are imprisoned in Tunisia."
"We are, therefore, going to be involved in a second world summit in Tunisia, but it is likely that by the time we arrive, the President, Mr Ben Ali, will have imprisoned a further two or three hundred Internet surfers to protect the information society from those making use of the freedom that it offers."
"I truly believe that if we do not protest – and by ‘we’ I mean the UN in this case, and the European Union – then that will be the sign that we are making a wrong move."
"In that case, why should we not go to China?"
"All Internet surfers are imprisoned there too."
"We sell arms to the Chinese and, while we are at it, we organise a major international conference on freedom of information in China."
"Why not?"
"Let us be logical."
"We will make the journey directly from Tunisia to China where we will shout to the people: ‘eat and be quiet, but above all do not make use of freedom of information; furthermore, this is why we want to have a major meeting in China."
"Moreover, this event, organised at the initiative of the UN, is partly distinguished by some Member States’ repression of NGOs."
"This is the case, for example, where Reporters without Borders is concerned, an organisation fighting for freedom of information."
"Following a request from Iran, signed by a large number of countries, Reporters without Borders was excluded from the NGOs recognised by the UN."
"You will see, therefore, that a commendable initiative for freedom and the information society is not enough; there also needs to be consistency."
"For example, the European Parliament has fought to obtain a directive on the patentability of software that is radically different from the directive proposed by the Commission."
"We know what it means to fight to defend intellectual property and, if we want to be consistent in the process of setting up the information society, then we must fight for freedom and the protection of intellectual property."
"That means that when we organise something such as the Geneva Summit, it has to be more than just alargemarket enabling Microsoft or others to take over new markets throughout the world."
"The freedom of the information society does not mean ."
"That cannot work."
"In this respect too, we must, clearly, take advantage of the framework offered by a multilateral organisation to develop regulations that, rightly, ensure equality for those entering, and those already within, the market."
"To conclude, Mr President, Commissioner Schreyer, the European Union cannot simply attend this type of event: it should also intervene."
"So, when we are keeping quiet, when we cannot find the words, is when it is an issue of protecting the freedom of the information society."
"The information society is not simply a market."
"The information society also means setting up democracy and freedom."
"Mr President, I would first like to address the Member who complained about the fact that the European Parliament did not adopt a position before the Summit, and refer her to the spokesmen of the Groups in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy who did not deem this issue worthy of being debated in the Chamber before the Summit."
"Secondly, I would like to point out that the political statement on the Summit, after months of negotiations, fortunately includes a reference to freedom of expression."
"Countries such as China, Cuba and other communist regimes – and I would like to apologise here to Mr Alyssandrakis, who believes that poverty is the root of all evil, but perhaps the lack of freedom also plays a role – tried, unsuccessfully, to delete this reference from the UN texts."
"The current problem is that we have an action plan for the next two years on the basis of which tens of billions will be channelled to developing countries in order to develop the information society."
"Commissioner Schreyer, I believe that the European Commission should keep a watchful eye on the way these funds are used, by making their use dependent on their opening up and taking specific steps regarding the free market, democracy and fundamental rights."
"Otherwise, we risk continuing doing what we are currently doing: with our money, with public and private money, we are creating and financing software systems that allow dictatorial regimes and, increasingly, our countries too to censure, filter and prevent access to the information society."
"That is not the only thing: there is also a problem of the free market."
"In developing countries, the companies that run the Internet and telecommunications are generally corrupt monopolies or oligopolies that use corruption to restrict individuals’ opportunities to access the Internet and the information society."
"If, as we are doing, we are preparing to spend huge sums on these countries, let us make sure that these sums also go towards developing democracy and human rights."
"Let us make sure we raise the issue of Tunisia where a summit will take place which will be chaired, as the World Organisation Against Torture reminded us, by General Ammar, that is to say, the person formerly in charge of torture in the Tunisian regime."
"I would also like to advise Members against picking and choosing, which would leave some having to deal with awkward issues whilst others allow themselves the luxury of only speaking about plans, cooperation and the market, which we also favour and we want to promote, but not to the detriment of freedom and law."
"Commissioner, honourable Members, I would like to start by thanking Mr Harbour very warmly for leading the initiative, together with STOA, Parliament's Scientific and Technological Options Assessment group, to ensure that the European Parliament could participate in this World Summit."
"We all know that in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, we have promoted the Internet and the liberalisation of telecommunications in Europe very intensively."
"Europe has taken on a leading role in the world here."
"I think that we must also make our contribution to the globalised process, and this contribution naturally means promoting free competition first and foremost."
"In my view, it is the Internet, above all, that will finally enable family companies and small and medium enterprises to participate in world trade as well."
"We have learned that in ‘customer to customer’ services in particular – that is, business to consumer and business to business – the Internet opens up totally new opportunities."
"Through -bay and other systems, there are now platforms where even micro-enterprises can market their products using services on the world market."
"We have international payment systems such as credit cards, and firms that handle financial transfers."
"We have international logistics companies that transport goods around the world."
"Due to the pressure from imports from many countries of the world – I am thinking, for example, of China, which is currently showing an 8% growth rate, compared with just 1% growth in Europe – Europe has a massive demand here."
"We must therefore do all we can to ensure that our companies establish a higher international export profile."
"It is here that a conference like this can offer opportunities to boost our involvement."
"It also demonstrates yet again that there is an urgent need for a WTO Parliamentary Assembly."
"I see that the UN and civil society are now participating on these issues as well."
"Yet we – the legislative – are not involved to an adequate extent in this area."
"I think that for the future, it will be essential for us to participate in these international frameworks and ensure that the infrastructure we need for our small and medium enterprises in Europe is established. I therefore welcome the fact that the European Parliament will have a stronger Committee on External Trade in its next parliamentary term."
"Ultimately, we also need many more small and medium enterprises and family enterprises around the globe."
"We must therefore form partnerships between small enterprises around the world, offer them platforms and provide support to our 18 million – soon to be 22 million – SMEs, which employ two-thirds of Europe’s workers, so they can become global players and through them, we become successful in the global market."
"Mr President, my fellow Members have already pointed out, and it has become apparent indirectly, how difficult the negotiations were in Geneva."
"The World Summit on the Information Society demonstrated yet again that international negotiations, regardless of the framework in which they take place – whether it be the WTO or the UN – have become extremely complex."
"MrRübig’s appeal is quite right: we need more parliamentary involvement."
"That will not necessarily simplify the process, but it will at least demonstrate more clearly and tangibly the desire of citizens to be represented properly through a legitimate voice."
"In Geneva, it became apparent how such complex negotiations – in this instance, on the issue of how a global information society should be developed – can be shaped by the various actors."
"As a rule, these continue to be the governments, of course, and it is governments which draft the laws and have to negotiate at international level."
"In this instance, however, a great many companies and what has come to be known as ‘civil society’ were also involved."
"We must not forget that the Summit in Geneva nearly collapsed."
"It was extremely difficult to bring the negotiations to a conclusion at all."
"Anyone who reads the text and the compromise – and I would recommend it to everyone – can see how difficult it was to produce this compromise."
"I suspect that it will only be in Tunis that we recognise that we have a document before us that we can take back home and defend with some measure of credibility."
"Let me mention the most important issues that are at stake. Firstly, there is the issue of financing."
"Mr Cappato has mentioned that in the EU, we must proceed very cautiously when it comes to participating financially. We must consider which governments we are indirectly supporting, as they will have their own ideas on what constitutes an information society."
"Secondly, there is the issue of human rights. Here, the key issue is again freedom of information or constraints on access to the Internet."
"Naturally, there are many other issues as well. Cyber-security is one aspect that the European Union in particular has put on the agenda, and one where I hope we will be able to make a contribution through our own agency which we are currently setting up."
"Then there is the issue of Internet Governance, which is still unresolved."
"That is a sorry story even here in Europe."
"We have not even managed to launch our EU top level domain name successfully in the European arena."
"Finally, there are the issues of intellectual property rights and how open source can be developed."
"I felt it was important simply to mention these points."
"I hope that next year, we can address this topic again, and that this House will adopt a resolution on the matter before Tunis."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this Commission Communication on the World Summit on the information society raises more questions than answers."
"It is clearly good to analyse at world level what is perhaps the best expression of globalisation, that is, a society which, at the beginning of the twenty-first century, is most characterised by our treatment and dissemination of information."
"The Commissioner has given us an excessively brief description of the results of the World Summit and we must therefore consider the issue on two levels."
"Firstly, within the European Union itself, given that making progress on and the use of the technologies on which the information society is based are absolutely essential to achieving the Lisbon objectives and turning the European Union into the most economically and socially advanced society by 2010."
"And secondly, at external level, where there are a series of elements which have been mentioned, such as intellectual property, free access to communications, security of information, digital solidarity, the use of the information society to rebalance the differing levels in the least-favoured societies, etc."
"I would say simply, in summary, that this World Summit has served to promote much more intensive action within the European institutions and also, obviously, to stimulate debate before the next World Summit takes place and to assess the issues raised here."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is extremely positive and gratifying that the Commission – as my fellow Members have already recognised in today’s debate – contributed to the World Summit on the Information Society and that it will continue to make a major contribution on this issue."
"This is especially gratifying given that in other areas – let me cite some examples from my sphere of interest: the Alpine Convention – has mystifyingly absolved itself of much of its responsibility and has thus contributed to the stasis and paralysis of this initiative."
"Hopefully, the Commission will reconsider its position here."
"On the issue of the information society, I believe that the right to network access should not only be understood as facilitating access. It should also mean promoting access, especially in outlying regions, in regions with a geographical disadvantage, that is, also in mountainous regions."
"The population here, which is at a disadvantage from the outset – in terms of the type of settlement, the distribution of settlements, and their remote location – should also have the opportunity to gain network access under preferential conditions."
"That means that a differentiated approach must be taken to the conurbations, on the one hand, and the sparsely populated regions, on the other."
"I would like to draw your attention to an initiative adopted by the Free State of Bavaria some years ago."
"This was a very interesting campaign and initiative which aimed to open up opportunities across the board."
"Unfortunately, these opportunities were considered to violate competition rules."
"However, I think that a rather more lenient approach should be adopted to the issue of competition if there are objective criteria necessitating other solutions."
"I think that the information society must undoubtedly take greater account of various other issues, such as data protection, privacy and certainly the protection of intellectual property as well."
"These are aspects that have not been considered to an adequate extent in the past due to the novel character of the medium."
"I hope that this ground can be made up in practice as well."
"Mr President, like Mr Harbour I would like to thank the Commission for such a positive input into the world summit, and also Mr Harbour himself for pursuing this issue so doggedly."
"This is an extremely important initiative that goes right to the very heart of the societal change that is engulfing our world at the moment."
"This is because technological change comes with something else: it comes with a huge transformation in the values and norms of our society and a huge transformation of our global economy."
"Therefore the way in which we deal with this issue politically is of vital importance."
"The vast array of opportunities and threats raised by the information age are too various to mention in my three minutes so I shall draw some examples from my own constituency in the north-east of England."
"My own region has turned itself around in the last 30 years."
"It was once on the scrap heap of the Industrial Revolution and it is now poised to take advantage of the information age we are so speedily, but ambiguously, chasing."
"This age requires sound infrastructure, sound technical capacity, knowledge and content."
"Yet regions in our Union such as my own, let alone regions of developing countries, could be adversely affected or simply miss out on the benefits of the information age because these benefits are so unevenly distributed."
"Because my region is seriously disadvantaged in educational terms and because our infrastructure is not yet up to the task, there is a huge way to go for us in order to be able to benefit from it enormously."
"I welcome both the summit and the action plan as a wake-up call to our governments."
"Universal access, widespread development of broadband and skilled development are fundamental to successful transition."
"But we must be aware that, while it is correct to have global aspirations, we have serious work to do in our own back yard."
"If we are all to participate in this particular game, we must create an even playing field."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, the development of the information society has been the greatest step forward the world has seen in the last 10 years."
"It has completely revolutionised the management, transfer and use of information."
"While thousands of pages of printed paper and huge libraries and archives used to be needed for the storage of information, now the same quantity of information is stored on Internet websites and computer discs."
"Transfer of information used to mean a journey to the archives, copying documents and posting them off."
"Now the same data can be browsed on a computer from your own office or study."
"Sending information used to mean putting it in the post and waiting around for it to arrive; now email gets to where it is going in different parts of the world in seconds."
"There are no limits to knowledge-based development."
"The EU has taken this into account in many different ways, including the Information Society for All Programme."
"That is why the EU’s development strategy to make our continent the world’s most competitive knowledge-based economy is absolutely the right one."
"There are nevertheless a few conditions attached to this development."
"A properly balanced information society cannot develop if it is merely market-driven."
"Society has to be involved in developing and building the infrastructure."
"We have to ensure that the less well-off, the young and those at risk of exclusion are able to use these services."
"Regionally we have to make sure that the networks also extend to the sparsely populated and peripheral regions."
"Proper use must be made of the EU’s Structural Funds."
"At the same time the monopolies have to be broken."
"Internet connections must be made reasonably priced by also opening up the last kilometre of connectivity to real competition."
"We should also be able to prevent the cartelisation and monopolisation of software and applications."
"Abuse is a separate problem."
"Sending spam and deliberately creating disorder and malfunctions must be made punishable."
"The development of the information society provides great opportunities to enhance spiritual, intellectual and material well-being."
"Accordingly, greater attention must be paid to this work."
"Mr President, the European Parliament recently adopted the own initiative report which I drafted on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities on the position of women in the new information society."
"I particularly welcome the fact that the proclamation made at the Geneva summit included the need to promote the incorporation of the gender equality dimension, in other words gender mainstreaming, in the information society."
"Nonetheless, the proper development of new technologies is not safeguarded by the introduction of legislative and regulatory measures alone because, as we know, the financial resources available are very limited."
"What needed to be pointed out with greater emphasis in Geneva was the need to renew the codes of conduct governing the use and development of the information society."
"In other words, we are talking about digital democracy."
"The participation of women in it may be very important, because women are in a position to promote a different ethical dimension based on the different system of values which characterises them."
"Unfortunately, so far, in the public debate on the development and consequences of new technologies, interest has focussed mainly on the economic repercussions, ignoring the analysis which examines the issues of democracy and the gender dimension, with the result that questions of technology are erroneously interpreted as ‘neuter’ democracy and gender."
"The lack of access to new technologies and digital illiteracy are increasingly developing into new forms of social exclusion from which women are directly at risk."
"The report which I drafted on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities lists the reasons which perpetuate this situation, such as social stereotypes and cultural prejudices, which limit women's options and raise barriers to their careers, resulting in more general adverse consequences on the economy from the non-rational use of human resources."
"Unfortunately, the summit avoided analysing in depth the social reasons which lead to the perpetuation of this phenomenon."
"I hope that the United Nations world summit on the information society will contribute to the public debate on the sort of information society we want."
"I would like to make a point of order: this was a debate without a text, but in actual fact there is a text, a text which raises the issue of the second phase of the World Summit on the Information Society, and presents the fact that it is taking place in Tunisia as an opportunity, not as a sign of the end of the information society."
"The text is not the text that could have been debated in the plenary if the groups had wanted it to be: it is the text of a written statement on the need to make the second phase of the Summit an opportunity to promote freedom and democracy, a statement signed by Mr Cohn-Bendit and myself, and I invite every Member to sign it."
"Mr Cappato, I have noted your comments."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m."
". The World Summit on the Information Society in Geneva has barely featured on the European Parliament’s agenda beyond the insider interests of a small number of Members."
"Unfortunately, as a result, Parliament and, indeed, the other institutions were hardly represented – beyond the official statements by the Member States and the Commission – as active participants."
"The evaluation of the Geneva Summit and the ensuing implementation measures must now be geared towards the second phase of the Summit in Tunis in November 2005."
"For the first time at one of the major UN conferences, civil society groups were included as partners, and this proved very beneficial."
"The presentation by the developing countries, with multifaceted initiatives to overcome the digital divide, was impressive."
"Surprisingly, the ACP Council of Ministers produced an ACP/EU common position for signature."
"The basis for an implementation strategy, which I called for in my 2001 general report and which is long overdue, and which must focus on the social benefits for all sections of the population, has therefore finally been established."
"This must include the right to freedom of opinion."
"The Declaration of Principles and Plan of Action must be evaluated by the Commission and Parliament in terms of their implementability."
"At the same time, the remaining contentious issues must be resolved before Tunis, including how the Digital Solidarity Fund demanded by Senegal can developed in a sensible way."
"–I would inform you that, as of today, 18 December 2003, Written Statement No 17/2003submitted by Mr Stevenson, Mr van de Bos, Mrs Maes, Mr Papayannakis and Mr Whitehead on a prohibition of trade in cat and dog furs has been signed by the majority of Parliament's component Members and will therefore, in accordance with Rule 51(4), be forwarded to its addressee and published, together with the names of the signatories, in the Minutes of this sitting."
"Mr President, I would like to thank all the Members of this House who have signed this declaration."
"We are dealing here with three separate aspects: cruelty, consumer fraud and recently we discovered that these pelts are toxic as well."
"The majority of Council Ministers at the meeting in November agreed to a ban."
"The majority of Members of this House have agreed to a ban."
"The majority of the citizens of the European Union want a ban."
"It is now up to the Commission to impose a ban."
"I hope that the willingness of the House to support this is being listened to by the Commission."
"For any other Members who wish to join in this success story, the declaration will remain open for 20 minutes after this sitting!"
"The next item is the vote."
". Mr President, first of all I would like to clarify for our colleagues from the future new Member States that we are voting today a budget of the EU of 15, which means that allocations we have voted for EU-10 in our first reading will be taken on board in the Amending Budget."
"Some EU-10 figures have been modified as a result of the conciliation, including an additional EUR 100 million in payments for the cohesion fund, compared to the amounts proposed by the Commission and the Council, that is Amendment 335 in block 1."
"I also have some technical corrections and precisions to make."
"Concerning Amendment 308 on OLAF, footnote 16 needs to be adjusted for the vote."
"Instead of two temporary A3 posts for the Supervisory Committee, it should read 'two temporary A7 posts'."
"On Amendment 378 concerning the Preparatory Action to support civil society in the new Member States, there should be a 'pm' entry instead of 'zero'."
"Last but not least, Members should be aware that a technical adjustment will have to be done in accordance with the vote, so that Chapter XX is coherent with the vote taken on the different policy areas."
". – Mr President, if this amendment is adopted, it should go after paragraph 28 and not after paragraph 4, because that deals with other institutions."
"There is no specific recommendation from the Committee on Budgets on this particular point."
"Personally, I do not have a problem with this."
"However, I leave it to the wisdom of this House to make a decision, as it is fully familiar with the issue."
"The services can make the adjustment that you have recommended."
". I should like to congratulate and thank all those involved."
"However, we need a statement from the President-in-Office of the Council to confirm that the budget is correct and that the Council has no objections to it."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me first of all highlight the constructive interinstitutional cooperation that we have seen during this 2004 budgetary procedure."
"I should like to take this opportunity to again thank the Commission and Parliament, the chairman Mr Wynn, and also Mr Mulder, Mrs Gill, Mr Böge and Mr Colom i Naval – I must mention them all – for their constructive participation."
"I would also thank the Commission, and in particular, Mrs Schreyer, for making a significant contribution to this process, as well as the Council Secretariat."
"We have concluded this second reading of the Draft Budget for 2004, which is a historically important year since it covers the enlargement of the European Union to 25 countries."
"We are pleased to see that your vote in favour has made the agreement between the institutions – the result of the conciliation meetings of 24 November 2003 – a reality."
"While noting that some discrepancies remain on the classification of spending – an issue on which the Council reserves its rights – I should like, in closing this short speech, in the same way that I said initially that today is a historic day, to thank everyone, including the institutions, for having made possible the happy conclusion of a day that will go down in the history of the European Union."
". Mr President, President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, you have successfully concluded the 2004 budget procedure, and I would like to emphasise that this outcome is the result of excellent cooperation between the European institutions."
"You have done your homework, and from a budgetary perspective, the preparations for enlargement are now complete."
"Let me say this: outsiders might think, from the results of the 2004 budget, that the budget specialists are able to produce minor miracles."
"However, it is not a miracle; it is the outcome of a great deal of good hard work."
"This result was achieved thanks to the outstanding chairmanship of Mr Wynn and the excellent work by the rapporteurs, especially Mr Mulder and Mrs Gill."
"The last budget in this parliamentary term is a real masterpiece."
"On behalf of the Commission, thank you very much!"
"And so to the authors of this year's masterpiece!"
". – Mr President, I too should like to thank everyone who has been involved in this year’s budgetary procedure."
"I have already expressed my gratitude to the Commissioner and her officials, and, having already mentioned the excellent cooperation with the Italian Presidency and before that, the Greek Presidency, I should finally like to express openly my admiration for the qualities of the secretariat of this House’s Committee on Budgets and of its chairman, who has guided this procedure in a very inspiring manner."
". Mr President, my aim has been to ensure that the European Union, at least in administrative terms, hits the ground running when it becomes a Union of 25, and also to try to achieve a balance between the necessary increases in resources and, at the same time, ensure value for money for the European taxpayer."
"This budget achieves value for money, and we can congratulate ourselves that we have achieved that juggling act and managed to finance enlargement without breaking the ceiling in heading 5."
"This budget fundamentally completes the process of enlargement budgeting and it is a good result for the European taxpayer."
"For those colleagues who are not budget specialists, the payments in the budget for next year for the EU-15 total EUR 94.6 billion, and for the EU-25, EUR 99.7 billion."
"In the light of the comments made, both by the Council and the Commission, I should like to remind the Council, in particular, why it is important not to interfere with the parliamentary prerogative in budget-making in the next IGC."
". Mr President, honourable Members, this report demonstrates yet again that the European Parliament is willing and able to identify compromises."
"We are concluding this matter at second reading."
"I would have wished that the cooperation, especially with the Council, had been as good as on trade."
"In these negotiations, the Council was a little less willing to compromise than in the other negotiations."
"Nonetheless, we have achieved a result that we can rely on and that we can accept."
"I would therefore ask my fellow Members to vote for the amendments in Block I, and I think that although one or two Members might feel uncomfortable about the outcome of the conciliation process, by and large, this report is acceptable."
"(1)"
". I would just like to make a brief point on the vote."
"We have the opportunity to conclude this report at first reading, that is, during the current legislative term."
"Let me comment briefly on the vote itself: I would ask you to support my amendments, which I have tabled on behalf of my group."
"I would like to reject the amendments on the internalisation of external costs because they have nothing to do with this report."
"This is a technical report, and the internalisation of external costs will be regulated next year when we deal with infrastructure-charging systems."
"The two issues must be kept separate."
"Amendments which relate to the protection of the London system, that is, Amendment Nos 22 and 44, but also 41 and 45, are completely redundant as the draft directive has nothing to do with urban systems or other island solutions, and by island, I do not necessarily mean the British isles."
"Let me make a comment on Galileo."
"Amendment Nos 43 and 48 are identical."
"They both aim to achieve the same thing. Amendment No 48, which I tabled, is in the more appropriate place, in my view."
"I would therefore ask you to support it."
"Please, ladies and gentlemen, take heart."
"Vote with my group, and then we can do the right thing and conclude the matter during this parliamentary term."
"Mr President, I do not share Mrs Sommer’s view that the preconditions for the internalisation of external costs should not be created in technical terms in this report."
"If the PPE-DE Group does not accept this on principle, it should vote against it, but it should not use technical arguments as a pretext."
"We have had the debate on that."
"We are now voting."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would ask you to reject Amendment No 5 as this is the only way for us to ensure that the regulation will come into force immediately on first reading, thus establishing a legal basis for further developments from the coming January."
"So please reject Amendment No 5."
"(2)"
"(3)"
"–I should like to point out to the House that we are joined today by Louise McVay, the woman who first brought this matter to our attention."
"Along with Mr Gemelli and other colleagues I had the chance to meet Louise McVay last night."
"It is wonderful that this Parliament, as this time, can establish in a report like this that, where there are active citizens with real interests and issues, we have an open door to care and to listen."
"It is an entirely appropriate vote at this time."
". – Mr President, I would like to put forward an oral amendment and change the wording in points 4, 9, 11, 13 and 15 from ‘multiple sclerosis’ to ‘multiple sclerosis and other similar diseases’."
"That concludes the vote."
"Colleagues, thank you for your cooperation today and throughout the year."
"I wish you a happy Christmas. I look forward to working with you, full of new energy and vigour in the New Year!"
". Although the EU budget for 2004 is one of the lowest in recent years and while spending under the Structural Funds and the CAP is being cut back, the aggressive 'defence and security policy' and the 'reconstruction' of Iraq are being lavishly funded."
"This funding comes within the framework of decisions by the European Council, which unanimously decided that 'the stability of Iraq is a shared interest', emphasising 'the Union's commitment to supporting the political as well as the economic reconstruction' of the country."
"How can someone fund a country under occupation, however, and why does no one talk about it?"
"Objectively speaking, this money will not go to the people of Iraq; it will go to the occupying administration and a few 'non-governmental' organisations."
"It is being given without setting fundamental conditions requiring an end to the murder of innocent people and the destruction of the country's infrastructure and the environment."
"In essence, the invasion by the USA and its allies is being funded and legalised."
"This is yet another example of the excessive hypocrisy of the ΕU."
"We condemn and vote against the funding proposal, which has been tabled solely so that the ΕU has a right to a share in the booty."
"What the Iraqi people need is for the conquerors to leave so that they can take their fate into their own hands."
". As the rapporteur himself states, it has been decided to mobilise the flexibility instrument for the fourth consecutive year, which shows that the needs of heading 4 in the Community budget – External Action – are systematically greater than the initial ceilings of the financial perspective."
"Since 2000, new priorities have arisen out of the need for reconstruction after illegal and unjust wars in the Kosovo region, Serbia and Afghanistan."
"In addition, other priorities have arisen, such as the reconstruction of East Timor, the conversion of the fishing fleet that used to operate in Morocco, and the Global Health Fund."
"These priorities have been financed to the detriment of the cooperation and development policy for other regions of the world, which is not acceptable."
"History is repeating itself again this year."
"Following the Thessaloniki Summit, at which the Commission proposed that the Community contribution to the reconstruction of Iraq should amount to EUR 200 million (40 million in 2003 and 160 million in 2004), the conciliation agreement foresees mobilisation of the flexibility instrument in the sum of EUR 95 million."
"The remainder will have to be found through funding cuts in the other areas, added to which there is an extra EUR 15 million for the CFSP, which is totally unacceptable."
"In any case, funding generated by the invading forces in Iraq is unacceptable, so long as this illegal occupation is maintained by the Anglo-American forces."
".– Any people that has suffered war and destruction is entitled to appeal for help with reconstruction to the relatively wealthy Europe."
"The decision to wage war on Iraq was not, fortunately, the EU’s, but that should not prevent us from making a solidarity contribution in the wake of that war."
"The problem is that this war is not yet, by any means, over; there are still foreign troops on Iraqi territory, there is no legitimate Iraqi government and every day, attacks from the Iraqi opposition on the occupiers claim victims."
"Iraq is, in fact, an American protectorate, and it appears that it will remain that way for the foreseeable future."
"Much as the capture of Saddam Hussein is to be welcomed, it does not mean that peace is on its way."
"As long as this occupation continues, responsibility for recovery and reconstruction lies with the Americans."
"Europe should not yield to the demand that it should foot the bill in order for European industry to be allowed to get involved in recovery."
"I am therefore not advocating that this EUR 200 million should be paid now, but I am in favour of a larger amount at a later stage."
"This should, moreover, not be at the expense of development aid for poorer countries, as is the case in the current proposal."
"For those two reasons, I am voting against."
". I voted for the report, because I believe the European Union should overcome the split it suffered when the last Iraq war began and should unite in view of the need to lay down the conditions for a free and democratic Iraq to rise out of the rubble of the brutal dictatorship of Saddam Hussein."
"In this respect, today I recall the time when this Parliament was unable to adopt any position at all on the Iraqi crisis."
"The real difficulties to which I alerted this House at that time are still current, as is the appeal I then made for a serious, respectful and honest dialogue between equals."
"In view of the most recent developments in Iraq, it is obvious that the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Iraq has to be a priority for the international community as a whole."
"I therefore believe that this proposal helps to establish a responsible position for the Union on this important issue, providing it with the means that are deemed necessary to carry out its responsibilities."
"Since the budget that has been presented – as a reflection of current European policies, with which I do not agree – is a budget that perfectly illustrates the reasons for the crisis in which we find ourselves today in Europe, I therefore, quite naturally, voted against it."
"This does not, in any way, question the work carried out by the members of the Committee on Budgets."
". There are two elements that characterise this budget for 2004:"
"- it is going to be the budget for enlargement of the EU to ten new countries with per capita incomes of roughly 40% of the Community average."
"We shall have a rise in inequalities within the EU and greater needs in the economic and social cohesion field;"
"- conversely, it is going to be the lowest Community budget since 1987 in relative terms, that is, 0.98% of the Community GNI in 2004, less than EUR 100 thousand million, when it could be up to 1.06% of the Community GNI."
"It is no accident that the size of the budget has been getting smaller since 1997."
"This budget not only underfinances enlargement to the detriment of economic and social cohesion, but it also gives a clear signal about the Community’s future financial framework."
"It is regrettable that the European Parliament should have approved this path so far, accepting in the current process a growth in payment appropriations of only 2.3%, which will penalise execution, a reduction in payment appropriations for the Structural Funds, a financial package for the codecision programmes that falls short of what is needed, and the financing of Iraqi reconstruction to the detriment of cooperation and development in other regions of the world."
"That is why I voted against it."
"On 28 April 2003, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development organised, at the request of Mr Souchet and myself, a hearing on the problems encountered by the beekeeping sector in Europe."
"The alarming conclusions of this hearing led to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development appointing Mr Souchet and myself as co-rapporteurs of this own-initiative resolution."
"This was a success; it was adopted with a massive majority in October 2003 and exposes the serious difficulties encountered by our European beekeepers."
"At the same time, I made it a point of honour to follow the development of the 2004 budget."
"When the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development had been consulted, I therefore proposed doubling the proposed budget of EUR 16.5 million to EUR 30 million."
"Indeed, new countries are arriving in 2004 that are major honey producers and that are experiencing similar problems."
"In addition, given that there has been no increase in the ‘aid for beekeeping’ budget for several years, I was right to think that if this budget line were to be increased, it would be this year or never."
"I am sorry to say that the Committee on Budgets, faced with following a drastic plan, granted us only EUR 20 million (that is EUR 3.5 million more)."
"So be it!"
"We were, all the same, satisfied: few budget lines have been increased."
"The common agricultural policy budget is not all that it seems."
"Its increase, as a gross figure, is half due to the significant increase in the amounts given over to rural development."
"European agriculture should not, however, need this intervention."
"It should be able to live from the sale of its products."
"Quality products should be openly encouraged: what is EUR 500 000 for looking into the possibility of creating European quality labels?"
"Why has aid to young farmers finally been cut back compared to the initial draft budget, when these young people represent our farming future?"
"For years the proportion of the European budget going towards the agriculture budget has been steadily decreasing."
"Today, the European Union is not using all of its room for manoeuvre to finance a genuine agricultural policy, which would be capable of responding to the new challenge of enlargement."
"This is why my group and I will vote against this report."
"I have voted in favour of the European Parliament’s draft EU general budget for 2004."
"Although it contains commitments totalling EUR 200 million for 2003-2004 for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Iraq, the budget is limited overall, amounting in the end to approximately one per cent of the Member States’ total estimated GDP for 2004."
"It is also important for Parliament to keep up the pressure on the Commission constantly to improve control and reporting."
"Measures must be taken to combat cheating and fraud."
"It is important and a matter of urgency that there should be a clearer link between agriculture and the environment."
"Adjustment of the common agricultural policy must include, for example, investments in higher food quality and the combating of animal diseases, which is a view shared by Parliament."
"The Christian Democrats also believe that the subsidising of tobacco cultivation should be phased out, as well as, gradually, the export subsidies that distort prices in the world market and are unfair to the developing countries."
"It is only regrettable that such proposals have not been supported by Parliament."
"As Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, my colleague, Mr Wijkman, has successfully campaigned for EU development policy to be mainly aimed at achieving what are termed the millennium development objectives, above all in relation to combating poverty."
"Parliament has adopted this position, as well as wordings in the aid budget aimed at making development policy more results-oriented."
"The CPNT (Hunting, Fishing, Nature and Tradition) delegation to the group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities, laments, as my colleague Mrs Mathieu rightly mentioned, the fact that the CAP budget does not meet the needs of the farming world, and this as much in the interests of the public being offered quality products as in the interests of regional planning."
"The funds allocated to structural measures are badly used or are underused and confirm the shortcomings and the defects of this policy managedby Brussels."
"These phenomena are made worse by an ill thought-out enlargement that will penalise the current Member States without meeting the needs of the new Member States."
"At the same time, official running costs (personnel and property) are increasing noticeably."
"Furthermore, the year 2004 once again shows that a certain number of associations and organisations, in line with Commission’s opinion regarding the future of the European Union or, more specifically, regarding the prospects for a policy similar to the one for the environment, benefit year after year from direct subsidies or from specially thought-up programmes."
"These practices are not safe from blunders and mean that each additional euro of the European budget is susceptible to becoming a source of concern for the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"It is for all of these reasons that the 2004 budget does not meet the priorities of the EDD/CPNT Members, who did indeed vote against it."
"The title of the report is explicit: ‘report on the future budgetary requirements for external actions’."
"This is already the third budget line today for which the results are disappointing to say the least."
"Asking for more money, in a budgetary situation that is already difficult for our Member States, amounts to sacrificing other policies and areas of activity, which Parliament is carefully avoiding identifying."
"This is not a responsible attitude."
"It is even less so because, in the area of foreign policy, the European Union does not exist politically and remains condemned to conciliate the positions of the Member States, some of which openly express unfailing solidarity with the US positions, for example…"
"The answers are, therefore, eminently political and stem from the Member States."
"They cannot come from the creation of a European Ministry for Foreign Affairs, even if it is provided with significant financial resources, as this House seems to believe they can."
"In opposing this report, the CPNT (Hunting, Fishing, Nature and Tradition) delegation to the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities draws attention to the fact that foreign policy, more so than any other, cannot be created by harmonising on the basis of averages and that it cannot be created, either, by using millions that we do not have."
". This report has the virtue of recognising that funding under heading 4 (External Action) in the current financial perspective has proved insufficient."
"The budget solution it proposes, involving redistribution within this heading and between it and other headings, such as the Structural Funds, is, however, not entirely acceptable, particularly since the priorities for external action are, in the end, almost exclusively the common foreign and security policy (CFSP) and the common European security and defence policy (CESDP), to the detriment of the cooperation and development policy, which is practically forgotten in this report."
"The basic idea that dominates here is that of a European Union that has been transformed into a political and military block supporting the strategy presented by the High Representative for the CFSP, together with the Constitution for Europe project arising out of the European Convention."
"We reject this idea. The rapporteur supports the communitising of the CFSP, the strengthening of its operational mechanisms and its financing, the creation of a rapid intervention force – the European army, the financing of defence equipment within the ESDP, and the creation of an EU foreign ministry, in support of a strengthening of the EU’s presence in the world and its response capability in the fight against terrorism and diverse military threats."
"We therefore voted against this report."
".– During the vote on the Podestà report, the Members belonging to the VVD, the Dutch People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy, abstained."
"We can support the gist of the report, but have reservations about those phrases that relate to the funding of future actions."
"The VVD delegation believe that it is unnecessary to draw on the margins under financial perspectives, our own resources in other words, if this is not absolutely necessary."
"Mr President, I would like to inform my fellow Members who are streaming out of the Chamber that I voted against the Costa report."
"I did so quite voluntarily, because I pressed the wrong button."
"I am absolutely convinced that this compromise is not a sound compromise."
"The fact that those concerned felt it would be better to allow a free-for-all rather than conclude this compromise speaks volumes: a free-for-all, in practice, is better than this compromise."
"I hope that during the discussions on the directive on road charging in the coming weeks and months, we will pursue the channels and utilise the available opportunities to establish the safeguards for the health of local communities in sensitive areas, such as narrow valleys, that are necessary to meet current standards."
"I would therefore ask the House to provide its assistance and support in connection with the directive on road charging as well."
"Although they were difficult to hear, your comments will be on the record."
"I hope we can deal with the issue of Euro-vignettes sometime in the life of this Parliament."
"The problem of pollution by lorries crossing Austria is a sign of the absence of policy on the part of the European institutions, with ‘small-time’ measures being deployed instead."
"The European institutions, like the individual Member States are, in effect, incapable of drawing up a long-term strategy for transporting goods that favours road-rail transport in particular."
"The result is that the development of intra-European trade is causing increased pollution for transit countries such as Austria."
"Instead of really getting to grips with this problem, a complicated system of ecopoints, quotas and administrative sanctions is being implemented."
"We voted against this text and we want to stress that implementing this system will only support the secret meetings and the bargaining, but by no means will it spell the end of pollution for people and for the environment."
".– A small Member State is being subjected to a measure which public opinion in that country has unanimously rejected out of hand."
"In that country, the impression is now being created that EU membership and democratic decision-making about their own living environment are no longer all that compatible."
"The arrogance of the large countries and their interests in trade and transport has in this so-called compromise at third reading been the deciding factor."
"To Germany and Italy, Austria is nothing but an inconvenient barrier to their doing business with each other, to which the impact on the quality of life in the alpine valleys is being completely subordinated."
"This is the way to act if you want to incur the EU’s hatred."
"Austria would probably not have become a member of the European Union without the undertakings given upon its accession to restrict through freight traffic on the roads."
"I do not expect Austria to resign now, but I do not blame it at all for not taking any notice of the decision presently to be taken."
"From the beginning of this conflict, I have supported the Austrian representatives in this Parliament, on 4 September 2001 and 12 February 2003 to be precise, in the face of complete ignorance on the part of the majority."
"Today, I am once again joining them in voting against."
". The proposal tabled aims at reducing the negative environmental impact resulting from the transit of heavy goods vehicles travelling through Austria, because of the particular geographical and environmental situation of this region."
"Vehicles using 6, 7 or 8 points (lorries in Euro category 2) will be penalised."
"Highly polluting lorries (Euro categories 0 and 1) will be banned from travelling in Austria, while the least polluting (Euro categories 3 and 4) will have free transit."
"The proposal involves prolonging an ecopoints system that is currently in force and, as such, I voted for it."
"I also concur with the agreement to extend the points system to the acceding countries from May 2004."
"In the previous readings, we voted in favour of this report. Indeed, it proposed significantly to increase the guarantees offered to air transport users, even if, as we have already stressed, it strove to show consideration for the airlines’ interests."
"As the conciliations and other reforms went along, this document constantly reduced benefits granted to passengers in favour of companies’ profits."
"Of course, these benefits have not completely disappeared, and it is only so as not to put obstacles in the way of these that we are not voting against this report."
"Not wanting, however, to sanction this document’s successive concessions to the interests of the airlines, we decided to abstain in the final vote."
". British Conservative MEPs today voted in favour of the Lisi report, but with a number of serious reservations about the final position adopted by both the Parliament and the Council."
"These concerns centred around the levels of compensation not being related to the cost of tickets, which could have serious implications for budget carriers, but more importantly, the deletion of the clause relating to which render airlines liable to pay compensation in circumstances genuinely beyond their control."
"However, given that this measure increases protection given to the consumer and provides an incentive for airlines to improve their performance in respect of the services they provide to their customers, Conservative MEPs felt that this was a compelling reason, despite the reservations outlined above, to support the measure."
". Whilst agreeing that there is a need to protect passengers, I voted against the Lisi report due to a number of serious concerns, centred around Articles 5 and 6 in the final text, which had been agreed by both Parliament and Council."
"In the final draft of Article 6 referring to 'delays', the exclusion of 'extraordinary circumstances' places an unacceptable financial burden on the carrier."
"Situations outside an airline's control cannot be foreseen."
"Therefore, to include full reimbursement as well as a return flight to the first point of departure is wholly unacceptable."
"Also, to suggest that airlines will be able to obtain compensation from third party providers is fanciful."
"Referring to Article 5.3 on cancellations, this only applies in the case of compensation but does not apply to matters such as re-routing."
"The Commission failed to provide a financial impact assessment."
"An estimated GBP 1 billion of extra costs for the airlines will not benefit passengers but will penalise them by increasing the price of tickets and reducing choice."
"None of these rules will apply to third country airlines flying into the EU, rather, they will damage competition."
". I congratulate Mr Lisi on the excellent report he has prepared on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council regulation establishing common rules on compensation and assistance to passengers in the event of denied boarding and of cancellation or long delay of flights, and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 295/91, to which I give my support, particularly as regards the guarantee protecting passengers’ rights in the event of flight delays or cancellations."
"Under the rules thus clearly established, carriers will always be obliged to provide immediate assistance for passengers in the event of any delay or flight cancellation, and it will therefore be easier for citizens to assert their rights."
". The benefits that the liberalisation of air transport, particularly the appreciable drop in fares, has brought to users should not distract us from questions of flight delays and cancellations."
"The solutions indicated as regards the system of financial compensation in the event of overbooking/flight cancellation, reimbursement for delays, the system of carrier liability and passenger assistance in the event of flight cancellations are satisfactory and protect the various interests involved, particularly those of passengers."
"Because of this positive assessment, I voted in favour of the proposal from the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, signed by Mr Lisi."
". I commend the rapporteur’s work for finding a solution to an increasingly common problem, in that it considers airlines operating within the European Union to be liable in the event of anomalous situations such as those described previously."
"In fact, the fall in fare prices and the resulting significant increase in passenger numbers, both a consequence of the liberalisation of air transport and the development of the sector in recent years, have led to increasingly frequent situations breaching passengers’ rights."
"In this context, this proposal suggests that in cases of overbooking, significant delays and flight cancellations, users should be reimbursed or compensated for any damage caused, depending on the situation."
"The agreement also provides for assistance to be provided at the airport or hotel, as appropriate."
"The rights of air passengers need to be strengthened, and indeed the committee responsible approved the rapporteur’s proposals unanimously."
"Lastly, I welcome the European Commission’s intention to extend these provisions to other means of transport, and stress that the basis for this regulation will protect the rights of all kinds of passengers."
". Of course, no one can claim to be against conservation of energy and sources of renewable energy."
"In aiming, however, to promote what could be seen as progress, the report also places emphasis on opening the sector to competition and on reassuring private investors."
"This is in order to call on Member States and the public service for the distribution of electricity to shoulder the additional costs of implementing the new technology and to do so until all of these costs are handed over to the private sector if this operation becomes profitable from a capitalist point of view."
"Whilst being in favour of progress, in this area as in others, we abstained."
". The simple fact that this recommendation for second reading aims at providing the means for the real development of cogeneration, which is expected to provide greater energy efficiency and improved security of supply, led me to support this report, even though I realise that binding targets will probably be adopted for the Community and the Member States and a tighter timetable established for the transposition of the corresponding directive, which may cause difficulties for some Member States."
". I welcome the perseverance of the rapporteur (who was supported unanimously in committee) in inviting the Council to engage in a constructive and fruitful debate after seeing a large number of the first-reading amendments rejected."
"I believe this debate should be encouraged with a view, specifically, to conducting a thorough assessment of this energy solution, taking account of its positive environmental effects."
"This recommendation for second reading in fact aims at providing the means for the real development of cogeneration, which is expected to increase energy efficiency – with the resulting savings – and improve the security of supply."
"These benefits must, therefore, lead the European Union to carry out an assessment and lend particular support to this activity."
"Without prejudice to the strictest compliance with the principle of subsidiarity, as the situation requires, I believe we could move towards setting more ambitious targets and a more appropriate timetable by constructively promoting platforms for understanding with the Council, as is suggested here."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Socialist Group, I wish to announce that we supported the resolution adopted on the IGC, and we take this as an appeal to the Irish presidency to get moving."
"This is not an issue on which we can afford to wait indefinitely."
"The Intergovernmental Conference needs to be kicked back into life."
"We have focused on the Irish presidency because the ball is currently in its court."
"But we will be coming back to this in the New Year and looking very carefully at what progress is being made."
"If there is, in the view of Parliament – and certainly in the view of my group – insufficient progress, we will look towards adopting a further resolution, one which will spell out possible initiatives to be taken by this Parliament in conjunction with national parliaments, and also consequences for our own parliamentary business, because we cannot continue with business-as-usual."
"The IGC needs to come to a conclusion."
"We need the European Constitution; we cannot let it be kicked into the long grass for months and years ahead."
"Business-as-usual cannot go on indefinitely: we must bring this issue to a solution."
"Mr President, the elected socialists from the French community in Belgium and other Members asked me to justify our negative vote."
"Parliament does itself no honour by continuing to blindly defend a Draft Constitution that does not in any way plug the democratic deficit which, despite having been denounced for more than ten years, is spectacularly evident in a number of deficient areas, beginning with the social aspect and the non-governance of the euro."
"Nor does Parliament do itself any honour by concealing, contrary to the evidence, the fact that the Convention has shown itself to be dramatically incapable of raising a sustainable consensus. Nor does it do so by concealing the responsibility of the Commission and its President, who concealed their opposition at the time of the consensus, all the better to reveal it later, although they had chosen to remain silent on the Treaty of Nice."
"We believe, furthermore, that Parliament would do better to denounce the emergence of a European G6 whose clumsy intervention only complicates an already difficult debate."
"Finally, like others, we have high hopes of the Irish Presidency, but we believe that a Parliament makes itself ridiculous in asking the impossible."
". We MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the resolution because, unlike the European Parliament, the workers have no reason to mourn the failure of the Intergovernmental Conference on the 'Euro-constitution'."
"Although the failure was, mainly, the result of internal differences on the distribution of power, objectively it gives new opportunities for the further development of grass-roots reaction throughout the ΕU to the monstrosity of the new Treaty."
"For the rest, the Intergovernmental Conference in Brussels confirmed yet again the assessments of the Communist Party of Greece that the debate is far removed from grass-roots interests, given that no one contests either the introduction of neo-liberalism or the promotion of the ΕU to deputy policeman alongside the USA or the attack on democratic rights and freedoms."
"The resolution adopted by the European Parliament on the results of the Brussels Council and on the deadlock (definitive or temporary) regarding the European Constitution once again brings into question the working method of the Intergovernmental Conferences and praises the ‘effectiveness of the European Convention’."
"Nevertheless, it must be mentioned once again that the Convention proposed a supranational Constitution through internal agreement on the part of a hard core of federalists and that this cannot be called ‘effectiveness’ since the agreement epitomized neither the will of all of the Member States, nor, in all probability, that of the populations."
"Let us not forget the fact that if the French Presidency preferred to let negotiations fail on the fallacious grounds that ‘no deal is better than a bad deal’, then it did so above all because it feared being faced with a negative referendum (despite the floods of propaganda and biased surveys, which claimed and still claim today, that the people are hoping and praying for a supranational Europe."
"The European Parliament resolution is, however, right on one point: it is surprising that, a week after the Brussels Council, we have still not managed to establish exactly the aspects that the governments agreed upon and those that they disagreed upon."
". Contrary to a majority of MEPs, I cannot regret the failure of Mr Berlusconi and the Council regarding the IGC and the draft European Constitution."
"Although the reasons why they failed are not the same as the reasons why I personally would have rejected the draft presented by Mr Giscard d'Estaing, I believe that the current crisis can only be beneficial."
"I hope that it will make people aware that Europe needs a new draft and new social inspiration from the citizens for a different Europe."
". Of all the major conclusions of the Brussels Summit I feel I must highlight the adoption of the European defence strategy and the statement on transatlantic relations, which Parliament shares and welcomes, but which we reject."
"These two documents – perhaps adopted in the belief that the IGC would reach its conclusion, and at a time when the United States was excluding some of its partners from the Iraq ‘business’ – clearly show the ambitions of the forces that dominate the European Union – the major powers and big business."
"They are an appeal to the United States for a commitment to a ‘balanced’ partnership, seeking joint action and the use of all possible means, including military means, and they show the EU’s determination to consolidate its capacities with the intention of sharing the ambition of world domination with the US."
"The so-called ‘defence’ strategy sets the tone, when it states that the first line of defence must often be located abroad, that we must be ready to pre-empt crises, that we have to develop a strategic culture promoting early, rapid and, if necessary, forceful intervention, that we must be capable of maintaining several operations simultaneously, and that by acting together the EU and the US can be an extraordinary force in the world."
"This is militarism at its best, and that is why we voted against it."
"The failure of the Brussels Summit with regard to the outcome of the IGC was positive. It is lamentable, however, that Parliament has not learnt its lesson and continues to uphold the so-called ‘European constitution’ through this resolution sponsored by the right, the Social-Democrats and the Greens."
"The fact is that this time the contradictions surrounding the division of power among the ‘large’ countries were more obvious in the IGC, leading to the collapse of the attempted agreement to impose an antidemocratic, neo-liberal and militarist project, in a context in which inter-imperialist rivalries, particularly with the USA, are not unknown."
"In the meantime, as it is still too early to judge how and when the process will be resumed, the blackmail around the forthcoming financial perspective is gaining strength, with six countries demanding an unacceptable annual ceiling of 1% of the Community GNI."
"For our part, we shall continue with the much-needed disclosure of the real objectives and dangers involved in the unacceptable ‘European constitution’, which has serious consequences for workers and for Portugal."
"We shall continue our fight for a Europe of cooperation among sovereign, equal states, which has as its objective the improvement of living standards for workers and populations, and peace and solidarity with all peoples of the world – a path that effectively serves the interests of Portugal."
". The Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) ended in deadlock over the Constitution."
"But who is going to complain about the lack of agreement over a text that constitutionalises liberalism and militarism?"
"Certainly not the citizens of Europe, who were excluded by the Convention from the process of laying down a constitution from the very start."
"Certainly not the social movements and unions, who have been manipulated from the outset by the Eurocrats for ultimately failing to take account of their additions on social and democratic rights."
"The IGC deadlock is not the result of divergent opinions on the European Project, but on a murky story of qualified majority voting."
"This is incomprehensible and derisory!"
"What is needed is a complete break with the past."
"Political Europe is under construction, but this cannot be done without and against the citizens."
"We must start by redefining a European project that can break free of the dictates of the market."
"This Europe would be more socially and democratically advantageous."
"Priority would be given to democracy, social rights, public services and peace."
"It is this other Europe that we set out at the European Social Democratic Forum in Paris."
"It is because we are in favour of such a Europe that we reject this joint resolution tabled by the Conservatives, the Liberals, the Social Democrats and the Greens."
"– Could anyone have seriously envisaged that the European Council would accept without any amendments – as demanded by Parliament’s edicts – the ‘European Constitution’ prepared by the Convention?"
"Surely not."
"Blinded by their utopian dreams from a bygone era, the federalists fail completely to look at their own record."
"Worthy successors to the wretched Lysenko, they even look around for potential scapegoats to take the blame for their failure to break the IGC deadlock."
"As shown by the first reprisals against the beneficiaries of the budget, the enraged members of the Convention now want heads to roll!"
"Neither the Italian Presidency, nor the attitude of certain countries – who bravely defended their interests – can be blamed for this fiasco; it was simply the result of this Convention and its outlandish constitution!"
"This project was doomed from the start because it is totally divorced from the political reality of Europe, which remains fundamentally defined by the existence of people and nations."
"By rejecting the redistribution of power based on the federal model, Spain and Poland have done Europe a great favour."
"These two countries have finally said aloud what several others have privately thought; that is, Jean Monnet’s old Europe inherited from the Yalta partition is now obsolete."
". Everyone interested is aware of the positions I have publicly held regarding the Treaty revision process, the work of the Convention and the legal and political scope of the conclusions of Intergovernmental Conference."
"They are duly expressed in this draft resolution and also in the draft resolution that my own Group presented on the Summit of Heads of State or Government within the IGC."
"They are the same reasons which, on the other hand, led me to oppose the compromise resolution which the parties of the centre in this Parliament presented on the same subject."
"In fact, I still believe that the European Union is a Union of States and that it is with them that responsibility for the final decision to be taken on this matter rests. It is not the European Parliament’s job to try out forms of political pressure that may hasten the approval of an unsatisfactory agreement, nor to allow the expression of veiled threats about the emergence of a variable-speed Europe, once again introducing unnecessary tensions into a process that requires maturity, responsibility and common sense in the difficult policies to be adopted."
". A majority in this House unfortunately will not learn."
"Stubbornly refusing to face facts, it creates crises that nobody among the people really feels and, by promoting an illusion, it leads to disappointment and sows frustration."
"It was not the method of the IGC that failed and the Convention that was successful."
"Quite the opposite."
"The Convention method demonstrated its limits and its fundamental untruth: the much-flaunted ‘consensus’ never existed."
"It is a serious mistake to insist that the Irish Presidency should now act with the haste that caused the upset in Brussels."
"We need time and must make a calm, in-depth reassessment so that we do not make the same mistakes again or head for another failure."
"All year I have been quoting a sentence from the famous Schuman Declaration: ‘Europe will not be made all at once, or according to a single plan."
"It will be built through concrete achievements which first create a de facto solidarity.’"
"That is what has happened: the Constitution was not passed, because Europe ‘will not be made all at once, or according to a single plan’; but the important Growth Initiative was launched, because Europe ‘will be built through concrete achievements which first create a de facto solidarity.’"
"It was the founding spirit of Robert Schuman that blew through the Brussels Summit."
"I voted against the report. I do, however, support the paragraph that tries to clarify the points of agreement"
". Having gone before the Heads of State or Government, the Giscard draft appears to be deadlocked."
"The (CPNT) [Hunting Fishing, Nature and Tradition] delegation, from the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities (EDD), hopes that the time has come for people and democracy to be put first."
"The outcome of the Brussels European Council was heavily influenced by the forthcoming elections and the intense pro-referendum pressure weighing on the draft Constitution."
"Whether this was a calculated move or a sudden brainwave on the part of our Heads of State, our delegation can feel satisfied that certainties have been challenged by the risk of rejection by the people in various countries."
"Such rejection would not be confined to the question of the weighting of votes for Spain and Poland, but would also have shaken the foundations of the project."
"As the CPNT reminded the House at the beginning of discussions, neither the Giscard draft nor any amount of last minute patching-up were able to produce sound policies based on principles of democracy."
"The time has come to start afresh and get the European project back on track."
"The European Council of 12 December 2003 brought to a close a long period of drifting."
"The next six months represent an opportunity for us to listen carefully to the citizens."
"The CPNT delegation to the EDD Group does not, therefore, share the opinion of the majority and firmly rejected the joint resolution."
". The Heads of Government have failed."
"We in this European Parliament now demand that the Irish Presidency should, in January 2004, present a concrete plan of action to complete the Constitution before May 2004."
"I should like to say at this stage that if that does not happen, further enlargement over and above the Ten is out of the question until a Constitution is in place."
"Financial perspectives will be examined extremely sceptically and legislation (after first reading) will meet with strong protest."
"This House does not want ‘business as usual’, even if we have to call on the Convention, the national parliaments and the European Parliament to help each other in taking action."
"I would therefore urge the public to support ‘their’ Constitution and bring pressure to bear on their governments."
". We voted against the text and the amendments as a whole."
"We are in fact against any kind of toll, as it is tantamount to financial discrimination and only serves as a moneymaking exercise for the companies involved and the giants of the building and public works industry)."
". I voted against the Sommer report because the proposal to put in place a European electronic toll system goes too far."
"The aim, set out in the White Paper, of combating road traffic congestion, can be achieved through other means."
"European electronic toll services are not a priority in this field."
"It would be more judicious, for example, to reduce heavy goods traffic, and to encourage road-rail transport."
"For Member States to adapt their respective infrastructures to put such a system in place would lead to disproportionate costs borne once again by the road user."
"Current toll systems work relatively well and there is no urgent need to put such a system in place."
"In the name of the principle of subsidiarity, the decision to opt for such a system and for the appropriate technology should be left to the discretion of individual Member States."
"We agree with the position that wishes to postpone the creation of the European electronic toll system until 1 January 2007 and recommends that the goal of the directive should be to ensure the general interoperability of the various systems. By 31 December 2009 the Commission should submit a study on the dissemination and interoperability of the various technologies and a cost-benefit analysis."
"On this basis it will then be able to submit a proposal for a migration strategy."
"The Commission’s aim in presenting this proposal is to create a European electronic toll service for the whole toll road system, since the existence of different, mutually incompatible, national toll systems creates problems for international traffic, especially heavy goods vehicles, which need to have several different contracts and different boxes, and for the proper operation of the internal market."
"In short, the objective is one contract per customer, one box per vehicle."
"The Commission, however, is trying to impose a system which has yet to be tried out. Other aspects, too, are still to be resolved, such as the process for transferring tolls collected in one Member State to a contract made in another Member State."
"It is trying to force operators to guarantee interoperability by 2005 on the basis of three technologies, and thereafter to adopt a single system."
"This is a position that we reject."
".– The abolition, in the recent past, of centuries-old road tolls was, at the time, regarded as modernisation that was necessary in the name of freedom of movement."
"The road network has meanwhile grown tremendously."
"Installation and maintenance costs of ever wider and crossroad-free roads are becoming too prohibitive to be able to pay for them out of taxpayers’ money without the need for huge tax increases or without cuts in other government provisions."
"Without road tolls, the car driver is very much at an advantage compared to the train user, and environmentally-unfriendly freight transport is given preferential treatment on the roads."
"As a result, the old road tolls are being re-introduced after all, accompanied by new electronic technology."
"The Commission has created the impression of wanting to use this toll collection as a means of enhancing EU interference and promoting EU projects."
"Is this about establishing a central toll service, promoting new technology at the expense of existing technology and finding new justification for Galileo, a prestigious project that guzzles money?"
"Or is this about removing the irritations about long waiting times for cash payments, about needing to clutter up each car with electronic registration gadgets and about continuously having to pay for bills from different Member States?"
"A majority in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has changed the tone of the proposal from interference to practical solutions."
"I support this change."
". I broadly agree with the European Commission proposal."
"If there is a chapter in which Portugal has made real progress on European issues, it is the chapter concerning streamlining toll charges, by introducing the ‘Via Verde’ [Green Route], which has proven to be the most effective, practical and suitable system in Europe."
"Streamlining toll charges throughout the European Union will certainly make life easier for European citizens, in particular for transport professionals and also represents a substantial step towards deepening the internal market."
"I fully agreed with the ideas put forward by the rapporteur on the need – without prejudice to the concept of interoperability, which is recommended and supported – not to overlook compliance with the principle of subsidiarity with regard to each country’s technical choices, which would have inevitable financial consequences."
"I also agree with the recommendations for prudence in the joint adoption of new technologies – these must really exist and be of proven value to users and for the need for their introduction not to distort market rules and their operation."
". I voted in favour of this proposal to extend the regulation in question."
"I share the rapporteur’s assessment of the European Commission proposal."
"In particular, I welcome the idea of extending the regulation to local organisations in developing countries, such as cultural organisations, political foundations, media associations, consumers’ organisations, universities or even municipal authorities."
"These are what we call society’s ‘lifeblood’ and they must consequently be the main architects of the development process in their countries, regions, towns and villages."
"To this end and in line with its historical commitments, the EU must promote and support this form of decentralised cooperation."
"Perhaps we should also consider a gradual increase in this form of cooperation, which, if its implementation is subject to rigorous quality control, could become a preferred form of cooperation and development aid."
"I deplore the bigotry demonstrated by some of those on the left in demanding that the word ‘churches’ be replaced by ‘philosophical or religious organisations’, which, in the context of the current debates on the text of the Treaty, is by no means a neutral phrase."
"I therefore voted in favour of Amendment No 10, which rectifies this point, and I welcome the fact that it was adopted in plenary with a broad majority."
". We welcome the content of this report, which seeks to promote gender equality in development cooperation and we consequently voted in favour of it."
"The broad objective stated in the European Union’s development cooperation policy is to combat poverty and ultimately eradicate it."
"In order to combat poverty effectively, however, greater practical support must be provided and other policies for cooperation and fair trade must be promoted. We must also fight for equal rights for men and women and for women to play a greater role in the political sphere."
"At the Fourth World Conference on Women, held in Beijing in 1995, a clear agenda was established for the first time on promoting equal rights for women and men."
"In the European Union this led to Council Regulation (EC) No 2836/98 on integrating gender issues in development cooperation."
"In 2001, an action programme on mainstreaming gender equality in Community development cooperation was approved, but expires in 2006."
"This serves as the legal base for budget item B7-6220 (21.02.06) – ‘Promoting equality of men and women in the framework of development cooperation’."
"This expires on 31 December 2003, and will have to be replaced by this proposal, which the Commission was very late in submitting."
". I congratulate Mrs Zrihen Zaari on the excellent report she has drafted on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on promoting gender equality in development cooperation, the proposals for amendments to which I fully support."
"In this context, I wish to express my particular support for establishing a regulatory text that does not contain an exhaustive list of projects to be supported and which provides a real boost for launching actions to promote gender equality in development cooperation."
"I also wish to emphasise the importance of giving support to the collection and dissemination of statistics in this field, because unless statistics are correctly collected, the entire process of analysing them is undermined and unless they are properly disseminated, society will not have the full picture."
". The most important aspects of development cooperation are to fund measures to combat poverty and disease and to find solutions to problems of education whilst establishing a culture of safeguarding fundamental human rights."
"I am wholeheartedly in favour of adopting measures that could help achieve these aims of helping the poorest members of society and, because I believe that the rapporteur’s suggestions could contribute to achieving these objectives, I supported this report."
"I must, however, express some concerns that I fear may not have been given due consideration."
"Firstly, we must bear in mind the appalling disparities between the realities faced in developing countries and those in our own."
"In societies where the main struggle is for survival, we must not dilute these prime objectives in any way."
"Furthermore, we must clearly define what we mean by ‘sexual and reproductive health,’ to ensure that the meaning underlying this reasonable concern is not distorted and transformed into a byword for developing international programmes to promote abortion, which I would have to reject outright."
"It must always be stated that ‘sexual and reproductive health’ means preventing sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS, and guaranteeing women decent conditions for pregnancy, childbirth and postnatal care."
". The fifth fisheries protocol between the European Community and Côte d’Ivoire expired on 30 June."
"With this proposal, the Commission seeks to extend the current protocol for a further year, which warrants our support."
"I share the rapporteur’s view, however, that the Commission must consult the European Parliament, instead of presenting us with a , and a delay of more than three months is completely unjustified."
"Extending this protocol will provide fishing opportunities for 71 vessels of the Community fleet, in particular tuna seiners, including five Portuguese surface longliners, as well as providing a reasonable amount of time for negotiations on renewing the agreement."
"This agreement has been mutually beneficial and clearly demonstrates the importance of international fisheries agreements, not only for the Community fleets, but also for local development."
"Although tuna catches have in recent years been slightly below the reference tonnage, the catch value exceeds the cost of the protocol, which has been financially advantageous to the Community."
"Furthermore, the agreement has contributed to local development."
"The port of Abidjan is the main West African tuna base, and the fish unloaded bolsters the local processing industry."
".– The ever-worsening fish shortages in European seas make concluding agreements with former European colonies in Africa an attractive proposition."
"The EU pays those poor countries in order to give modern European fishing vessels the opportunity of removing large quantities of fish from the adjacent seas."
"Although this is a welcome source of income for those countries in the short term, it is not a solution in the longer term, and hinders the development of a local modern fishing industry."
"By the time those countries are capable of starting such a form of fisheries, those seas too will be fished empty by fishermen from far away."
"Quite apart from my general criticism of such neo-colonial fishing agreements, I have in this case another objection."
"The Cote d’Ivoire that used to be relatively rich thanks to cacao exports has meanwhile been rent asunder by a civil war."
"The animosities between ethnic groups give us little reason to expect that a peace agreement will be adhered to."
"Reunification and a government that can wield power effectively are unlikely prospects."
"As in other war situations, this makes it possible to plunder fish stocks in the coastal waters to a greater extent than had been agreed."
"I therefore support the amendment to suspend the agreement until such time as the civil war is over."
"A rejection of this amendment is for me cause to vote against."
". It is important that we maintain this fisheries agreement, not only because of its importance for the fishing fleets operating under it but also as a sign of the European Union’s confidence in Côte d’Ivoire’s process of political stabilisation."
"The Commission proposal contains a request to extend the agreement governing fishing relations between the European Union and Côte d’Ivoire, for a period of one year, between 1 July 2003 and 30 June 2004, in line with the provisions contained in the protocol in force, from the point of view both of financial compensation and of fishing opportunities."
"This extension would enable shipowners to carry out their activities without interruption and the Commission would have more time to negotiate and renew this agreement."
"I endorse the rapporteur’s recommendations for the Commission to be consistent with the assessment of the state of stocks, and with the real level of activity of Community fleets, in order to avoid gaining concessions that shipowners do not really need."
"I also call on the Commission henceforth to be punctual in presenting the proposals it wishes Parliament to adopt."
". There was nothing original about the Brussels summit in comparison with previous summits as regards the anti-grass roots nature of its decisions."
"We would make particular mention of the new step towards subjugation to the imperialist plans of the USA with the text adopted on trans-Atlantic positions, the further processing of the aggressive 'security' policy in the second Solana document, improved and processed in comparison with the one tabled in Thessaloniki, and the readiness to send the 'Euro-army' to Bosnia-Herzegovina."
"For the umpteenth time, they congratulate the Turkish Government on its 'reforms' and repeat the wish list for the Cyprus problem to be resolved, without daring to close the accession door to Turkey if it is not."
"We would further note that the attack on democratic rights has been stepped up, with police and judicial cooperation, common border management and confirmation and specialisation of the Thessaloniki decision to introduce biometric elements into passports."
"In the economic sector, they confirm their gift to the monopolies in the form of the trans-European networks and promise to improve competitiveness, step up anti-labour reforms and increase the 'adaptability' of companies and workers."
"The European Parliament resolution, despite stammering out a few reservations about biometric elements, fully welcomes the Council decisions and even goes as far as to express regret that most Member States have failed to transpose the ‘European arrest warrant’ into national legislation."
"It is for these reasons that we voted against it."
". The Brussels European Council of 12 and 13 December marked the end of the last complete presidency before European elections and began an ‘end of term’ period for Parliament and the Commission."
"This end of term period appears to be marked by the institutions’ being hamstrung by the blocking of the draft Constitution – see my explanation of vote on the IGC results – by the fact that the Commission, shaken by successive scandals, has failed to re-establish control – see my explanation of vote on the 2004 Commission Work Plan."
"There were also two highly revealing conclusions by the Brussels Council."
"Firstly, the decision to announce a ‘quickstart’ programme of major works, without clarifying how this is to be financed."
"Secondly, the concern prompted by the almost total lack of follow-up, at Member State level, of the Lisbon Strategy, initially aimed at making the European economy more competitive."
"The impression is given of a European system running on empty, within which Member States no longer have anything but headline aims."
"Is this not an inevitable backlash; the consequence of an uncontrollable desire to do everything, to dominate everything?"
". Everyone involved is aware of the positions I have publicly advocated on the process of revising the Treaties, the work of the Convention and the legal and political scope of the conclusions reached by the Intergovernmental Conference."
"These positions are duly expressed in this draft resolution, and in the draft resolution tabled by my group on the Summit of Heads of State or Government that took place under the IGC."
"It is these very reasons, however, that led me to oppose the compromise resolution tabled on this issue by the main parties in this Parliament."
"Indeed, I still believe that the European Union is a Union of States, that it is these States that must take the final decision in this field and that the European Parliament does not have the right to practise forms of political pressure that might precipitate the approval of an unsatisfactory agreement, or to allow veiled threats to be made about the emergence of a multispeed Europe, once again adding unnecessary tension to a process that requires maturity, responsibility and sensitivity in the difficult and sensitive political decisions that must be taken."
". Although I voted in favour of this document, I wish to emphasise that the recent European Council meeting in Brussels was not a failure."
"It was a success, a double success in fact: no agreement was reached on the rash constitutional fantasy; it also introduced the Growth Initiative."
"By 2010, we will have mobilised investment worth several million euros in projects for genuine harmonisation, cohesion and growth: Trans-European networks (transport, telecommunications and energy), as well as innovation, research and development."
"This is what integrating Europe is really about!"
"As I stated in another explanation of vote on the IGC, one can detect in this two-fold decision the influence of the founding spirit of Robert Schuman himself: ‘Europe will not be made all at once, or according to a single plan."
"It will be built through concrete achievements which first create a de facto solidarity’."
"For this very reason, it is utterly deplorable and something we must firmly reject – that following the Brussels Summit, Germany and France – it is always the same countries! unfortunately accompanied, this time, by the United Kingdom, Sweden, the Netherlands and Austria, have exerted intolerable pressure to limit the EU Budget for 2004 to 1% of GDP."
"This attitude ignores all current developments, damages Europe and tears it apart. Furthermore, it betrays Schuman and the European spirit."
"I also welcome the inclusion of paragraph 49 on Cuba and Oswaldo Payá, which was the result of my proposal in the original UEN text."
"I wish to express my satisfaction at the fact that the Group of the Party of European Socialists’ Amendment No 5 was voted down (by 229 votes, with 209 in favour and 22 abstentions). This criticised the Italian Presidency for not having pressed for the Sixth Framework Programme of Research to be adopted concerning research on embryonic stem cells."
"In Member States such as Germany, Austria, Portugal and Ireland, it is illegal, and in the case of Ireland even a violation of the constitution, to conduct research on human embryos."
"It is therefore extremely positive, and in the spirit of the healthy European idea, that a majority of the European Parliament is showing respect for these countries’ legislation and is not forcing their taxpayers to fund an illegal activity."
"The Italian Presidency’s efforts in the Council regarding this point cannot therefore be criticised in the way that the PSE Group tried to criticise them. On the contrary, their efforts can be seen as laudable and as commanding respect."
". This joint resolution contains much hypocritical ‘fine sentiment’, about human rights, and the usual diplomatic/commercial cynicism of the major powers."
"Does China respect human rights?"
"No, of course not, just like dozens and dozens of countries and appalling dictatorships to which the EU has sold and continues to sell arms with which to oppress their citizens or attack their neighbours and to fill the coffers of western arms dealers."
"From Saddam Hussein’s Iraq – armed by France, the UK, Germany, Russia and the USA – to Israel, via dictatorships in Latin America, Asia, Africa and elsewhere, no embargo has ever stopped the arms manufacturers, including some right here in Europe."
"They are able to bypass such embargoes with even greater ease – in China just as elsewhere – because they enjoy the complicity of European governments."
". I fully support the conclusions of the Graefe zu Baringdorf report, and those of my colleague, Mr Souchet, in his speech yesterday on the coexistence of GMO and non-GMO crops."
"This is a major problem, and one that we must not put to one side by giving immediate authorisation to cultivate and market GMOs, as called for by the Commission."
"We must first examine the possible extent of contamination of traditional crops, which at least 70% of consumers would like to preserve."
"Where possible, prudent rules on coexistence should be established, and the companies receiving authorisation should be made to bear the responsibilities and costs arising from introducing GMOs."
"Lastly, financial guarantees must be put in place to cover these responsibilities."
"As yet, none of this has been clarified."
"It is therefore appalling to see the Commission ready to hand out authorisations, using subsidiarity as a pretext for passing on to the Member States the almost impossible task of establishing rules on coexistence, while refusing to allow the same States to declare certain areas GMO-free (Commission decision of 2 September 2003 against Austria)."
"This dossier has been approached with an intolerable disdain for the citizens."
". The rapporteur proposes the rigorous separation of traditional and GMO crops."
"He has a definite vested interest here, since he himself is an ‘organic’ farmer."
"Nevertheless, the separation he is proposing at least has the advantage of leaving the decision up to the consumer."
"There is no need to share his anti-scientific attitude, which consists of putting words into science’s mouth, in order to approve a delimitation that makes it possible to set aside a field for experimentation and verification in research in the GMO sector, while taking the precaution of not mixing production chains."
"The precautionary principle is at stake, not so much with regard to researchers as to large capitalist concerns – in this particular case, the seed producers and agri-food industry giants, for whom scientific advances are a means of increasing their profits."
"In other words, where profit reigns, there is always a risk that irresponsibility will gain the upper hand, with disastrous consequences for human beings and for nature."
". I am pleased that Parliament has received the Graefe zu Baringdorf report so positively, but I am surprised by the vote by Members, notably French Members, in favour of disseminating new varieties of GMO, before rules restricting coexistence have been established."
"Yes, the ambition of seed-producing firms that have earmarked significant funds for research and for the development of genetically modified varieties is, of course, to obtain the maximum return on investment as quickly as possible."
"They tend quite naturally to give credence to the idea of the inexorable spread of a new generation of seeds, called upon quickly to replace seeds that have been improved without genetic modification, as if this were a phenomenon similar to machines taking over work previously performed by animals."
"Such a move towards standardising seeds – all-purpose GMOs – and the corresponding disappearance of traditional and organic farming would undermine both the agricultural diversity of European territories and the specific nature of what is produced."
"The fight for agricultural diversity for the effective and sustainable plurality of these industries is, therefore, an integral part of the fight for cultural diversity."
"We Moderates are opposed to a development whereby the European Parliament has views concerning the way in which serious diseases are to be treated in the Member States."
"Health care policy does not fall within the EU’s area of competence."
"We call upon MEPs in the Committee on Petitions to focus upon matters that fall within the EU’s area of competence."
"The principle of subsidiarity must be fully respected."
"Ultimately, patients and their families must have considerable influence upon the choice of health care and health care professionals."
"The latter are, in the end, responsible for the care and treatment given, but must guide patients and set out the possible alternatives."
"Patients’ rights and influence may also be strengthened if they have the option of changing doctor when the relationship is unsatisfactory or there is a lack of trust."
"This way of guaranteeing the patient optimum care and treatment is diametrically opposed to interference by the European Parliament in individual health care issues."
". Following a complaint to the Committee on Petitions regarding the disparity in EU Member States’ treatment for people who have been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, the European Parliament has today called on the Commission to itemise a discussion on the issues raised in this report at a forthcoming meeting of EU Ministers for Health, with a view to developing a ‘Code of Best Practice’ to be followed in all Member States and which places considerable emphasis on international cooperation in the field of research into combating this disease."
"Another very interesting point addressed by the rapporteur is that of the psychological treatment of multiple sclerosis, a disease which, because it generally affects young people at what should be the most productive time of their lives, causes them to face an uncertain future, both from the social and the professional points of view."
"For the reasons I have just given and because I believe this disease deserves greater recognition by the public authorities, which must demonstrate commitment to finding effective solutions to the problems facing those who are affected, I approved this report, by giving it my unqualified vote."
". I also received a disappointing answer from the European Commission on the sensitive issue of health, when I asked about the possibility of introducing a European charter for children in hospital."
"This is a thorny issue: the principle of subsidiarity can only be called into question by a revision of the Treaties."
"Any increase in the social duties and responsibilities that the EU wishes to impose on the Member States must be accompanied by an increase in the Community resources allocated, which raises issues and problems that are far from easy to resolve and which are quite serious."
"Having said that, the European Union must come up with appropriate instruments for promoting greater protection of those who are most helpless and most in need."
"There are ways of achieving this that do not involve riding roughshod over subsidiarity."
"It will be hard to explain why lamps should be standardised and why we produce initiatives and legislation on the matter when, at the same time, we are too busy to look after our own citizens. What is even worse, this need is felt most powerfully in childhood, in sickness and in old age."
"Commissioner Byrne once again informed a fellow Member that the Commission is sensitive to ‘greater interaction between health systems’."
"This is precisely the Europe that the citizens wish to see a Europe with or without a Constitution but one with real heart."
"A Europe that promotes ‘best practice’, starting by responding to the citizens’ greatest needs."
"I supported this balanced and appropriate proposal, in the hope that it might represent a turning point."
"The plenary has spoken."
"That concludes the explanations of vote."
"(4)"
"The next item is the debate on the Commission statement on the natural disasters in the South of France and the regions ‘Languedoc-Roussillon’ and ‘Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur’."
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission wishes above all to express its solidarity with the citizens affected by the flooding that has recently affected several parts of southern France."
"Unfortunately, my colleague Michel Barnier has not been able to come to Strasbourg today."
"As you know, this question of natural disasters was debated at length here in this very place on 1 September at the end of a scorching summer."
"The Commission has been actively working on the question of natural disasters for the last few years in close cooperation with the European Parliament."
"In the face of the seemingly increasing rate of disasters, two key words underlie the Commission’s action: repair and prevention."
"So far as repairs are concerned, it is a matter of solidarity."
"Following the summer 2002 floods in Austria, the Czech Republic and Germany, on Michel Barnier’s initiative the Commission proposed the creation of the Solidarity Fund."
"Thanks to the support of your Assembly and the Council, this new instrument has now been in operation for a year, and since its creation its mobilisation has been requested 14 times; it has been effective in eight cases."
"At present, the Commission does not yet have sufficient information about the recent flooding in the South of France to be able to say whether it will be possible to mobilise the Fund."
"In any case, we can only act if officially requested by the French national authorities."
"If we receive such a request, we will examine it as quickly as possible."
"Rest assured that we will take the situation in southern France into account in the review we will be presenting at the conference to be organised by the European Commission on 5 March 2004."
"The purpose of that conference is in fact to review the use made of the Solidarity Fund by several regions of Europe."
"I must also point out that the regions of Languedoc-Roussillon and Provence Alpes-Côte d’Azur are already receiving a large amount of EU aid under Objective 2 of the Structural Funds."
"For the period 2000-2006, this aid amounts to EUR 316 million for Languedoc-Roussillon and EUR 340 million for Provence Alpes-Côte d’Azur."
"At the time of the floods that affected those regions in September 2002, specific measures were provided to repair the damage caused."
"The mid-term review provides the opportunity to again put the emphasis on prevention or repair."
"If, as seems likely, the regions in question receive money from the performance reserve and if the programmes in question perform well, that could provide around an extra 4% on top of their allocation, that is EUR 10.8 million for Languedoc-Roussillon and EUR 12.3 million for Provence Alpes-Côte d’Azur."
"The distribution will be proposed to the Commission by the French State before 31 December next."
"Significant regional development measures may be financed."
"Let me now turn to the second key word: we must not be content with repairs, we must also give priority to prevention."
"These natural disasters raise the fundamental question of climate change and prevention, for which research is required."
"I want to assure you of my commitment and that of Mrs Wallström and the Commission as a whole in this matter."
"As Mr Barnier has recently told your Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, he intends proposing that a ‘prevention of natural risks’ line be included in every Structural Funds programme for a future programming period."
"In like vein, the third report on economic and social cohesion, which will be adopted by the Commission early next year, will propose that risk prevention be made one of the objectives of the Structural Funds during the next programming period, after 2006."
"The Commission is also thinking of strengthening European coordination of civil protection, including the formation of a common European civil defence force, an idea on which Mr Barnier is particularly keen and on which he is working closely with Mrs Wallström."
"This new initiative, which is to be unveiled early next year, would have to build on existing structures, giving them sufficient resources to act quickly and promptly in the event of a disaster of any kind."
"Mr President, Commissioner, streets flooded, homes invaded by mud, damaged infrastructure, people in despair: must we become accustomed to these disaster images which are sadly repeated every year?"
"The seriousness of this sadly repeated flooding affects us deeply."
"I would like here to express again our deepest sympathy to all the victims, but also our gratitude to the civil defence services and volunteers, who have shown extraordinary dedication."
"We can only congratulate the rescue and European mutual assistance services on their good coordination, which was really effective."
"Our Parliament was also very active in this respect in asking for that mutual assistance to be put in place."
"Once again in this Chamber we are having to deal with natural disasters, the consequences of which could nevertheless be better contained."
"Temporarily cleaning up, immediately reinstating the infrastructures, providing temporary accommodation, all that is only repair work."
"But we know that repairs cost a lot more than prevention."
"Prevention requires political courage, a command of urban planning and coherent regional development."
"Prevention costs less than repair, but we still need to be able to call on the resources."
"It is true, as you reminded us, Commissioner, that at European level using the Structural Funds is one good way of rebuilding dykes, strengthening them, of quite simply maintaining waterways, of making retention basins."
"But there are two limits to this Structural Funds policy."
"The first lies in the fact that the Structural Funds are currently subject to the zoning rule and do not therefore place all victims on an equal footing."
"The second is that the amount available from these funds is not always sufficient."
"You only have to look at my own region, the Rhône-Alpes region, which unfortunately has not been mentioned today, even though it was severely affected at the same time as Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur and Languedoc-Roussillon."
"It was stricken recently, but will have no more Structural Funds to draw on for 2003-2006: it has all been spent."
"I am now speaking to my parliamentary colleagues who are sometimes tempted to delete or reduce the regional policy budget."
"I say to them: be careful, make no mistake."
"This funding affects our fellow citizens very intimately, it is an expression of European solidarity, the foundation of the Union."
"We must all back Commissioner Barnier in his proposal to overhaul the Structural Funds. You said so yourself, Commissioner."
"These funds should not be constrained by zoning in future but should serve precise objectives, one of which would be concerned with the environment and risk prevention."
"Given the changes our planet is undergoing, we need collective courage to meet these ecological challenges."
"I hope that the Commission as a whole will go along with Commissioner Barnier’s proposals and that our Parliament will be able to adopt the budget the Structural Funds need."
"Meanwhile, we must carry out repairs with the suffering families in mind."
"Europe created a Solidarity Fund for regions and states that have suffered natural disasters."
"It must also pool the technologies for prevention, based on the successful experience of the Netherlands, for example, putting in place cross-border cooperation."
"I hope, Mr President, Commissioner, that we will not have debates on natural disasters in the future."
"Mr President, Commissioner, my fellow Member has just said that she really does not want us in future to have to add our tears to the waters that regularly devastate our regions."
"Unfortunately, I am much less optimistic than she is. Much less optimistic because I know very well that you were making a wish, Mrs Grossetête."
"However, wishes are not enough when we see the climate change that is taking place on our planet."
"I was in my region of Languedoc a few days ago and people told me that what we are seeing now did not used to happen once in a hundred years."
"We have now seen it three times in two years."
"It is therefore clear to see that there is a change of frequency, magnitude and scale."
"I am always surprised to see the authorities, not just in my country, that would be too easy, but in all the countries affected, running a little bit behind the disaster."
"This summer, in the regions that were affected in south eastern France, the locals were already piling up sandbags."
"How was it that the local people knew, but the authorities did not act until disaster happened?"
"There is clearly a gap between those who are on the ground and suffer the destruction and the decision makers, who are obviously still far away from it."
"With heat waves, storms and sudden floods, the climate is changing."
"I do not have the impression that public policies are changing at the same rate."
"I think a whole arsenal of measures need to be taken to deal with it, taxation in particular."
"How many times have we, the Greens and regionalists, said in this House that the tax weapon really should be used to change behaviour that poses a threat to the climate?"
"And we are still waiting for that tax on pollution, that tax on discharges that change the atmosphere of our planet and which, in the end, are destroying entire regions."
"Aids are in the process of changing."
"I do understand, Commissioner, that we have indeed little by little, disaster after disaster, deployed finance for repairs and prevention."
"Repairs are good, prevention is better, my fellow Members have said."
"However, and I agree with them entirely on this point, prevention is inconceivable without a far-reaching reform of the Structural Funds."
"So long as there is zoning it will be ineffective."
"You must understand that storms and floods often care nothing for the zones we have so cleverly drawn on a map far away in Brussels or elsewhere."
"So these funds definitely need to be reformed and perhaps all those Structural Funds that do not find any use on the ground but are paid back into Community and then national budgets could be better employed in prevention to meet this climate change."
"In conclusion, I was saying that these problems have obviously changed in frequency and scale."
"Even if European public policies are changing, which I note and welcome, I do not have the impression that they are changing at the same speed and to the same extent, and I regret that."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to pay tribute to the victims, their families and all who have lost everything, and to the extraordinary work done in the rescue operations by men and women, municipal employees, firefighters, police, military personnel and volunteers."
"The provisional toll of this disaster is particularly high: 30 departments are affected, eight of them severely, in particular Bouches-du-Rhône, Vaucluse and Gard."
"So far as the population is concerned, seven people have died and 32 500 have been displaced or taken to safety."
"We might wonder about the origin of these tragedies and their frequency."
"Some will mention global warming or masses of hot air from the Mediterranean colliding with masses of cold air over my own region, Roussillon."
"But what can we do about it?"
"Others will mention man’s mania for urbanisation, always wanting to build more at the expense of the countryside and indifferent to its population."
"However, forecasters considered this bad weather exceptional because it combined a number of factors: its duration – almost four days – its geographical extent and its intensity."
"I would like to highlight the unacceptable administrative inertia of the authorities in the face of the revelations made in the Lyon technical assistance office’s November 2002 report."
"That report in fact made a full diagnosis of the dangers of the river and recommended a number of measures to reduce the damage caused by any flooding."
"But that study, to which many people contributed and which cost EUR 3.5 million, has remained a dead letter and failed to worry the authorities concerned, or at least to do so soon enough."
"Once again this bad weather has demonstrated the passivity of men in the face of disasters which, remember, cost seven people their lives."
"No notice was taken of the strong signal given more than a year ago highlighting the urgent need for a harmonious development of the rural environment taking the whole of the territory and its inhabitants into account."
"The French Government has released EUR 24 million to repair the dykes of the Rhône delta, which gave way at several points under the effect of the rising waters."
"But that sum is already proving inadequate on the ground."
"I hope that the European Union’s Solidarity Fund, which was set up after the devastating floods of August 2002, will help, at European level, to provide swift and fair compensation for the victims and enable them to resume a normal life."
"But for how long?"
"Some are making their third damage claims and doing their third clean up in the space of a few months."
"I was interested in what the Commissioner outlined just now, in particular about using the Structural Funds, but I second what Mrs Grossetête and Mr Onesta said regarding their limits."
"Of course the damage must be repaired, but should we not be immediately starting major prevention works for this Mediterranean region that has been stricken regularly in recent years?"
"Nîmes, Vaison-la-Romaine, Aramon, Lezignanais, Narbonnais, Minervois, Rennes-les-Bains, Couiza, Estagel, Saint-Laurent-de-la-Salanque, and these days Arles, Marseille, Montpellier, eloquent names and images, unbearable tragedies, much damage and loss of life."
"This is becoming unacceptable in an age of satellite warning and forecasting, surveillance radar, specialist services and, moreover, the massive mechanisation that ought to make protective works possible."
"The Roman aqueduct at Ansignan, close to where I live, the better known pont du Gard and many other testimonies to human genius have withstood every assault."
"How can it be that the structures of the last century are not sufficiently reliable?"
"It is no longer the time for words but for action, with the necessary resources, even if the scale of them should be exceptional."
"A Europe that believes in solidarity must stop letting its citizens die for lack of precautions and prevention."
"That, it seems to me, is a priority and a must."
"Mr President, Commissioner, my region, Languedoc-Roussillon, Provence, the whole of southern France, is again stricken by floods."
"It is true that we have benefited from the solidarity of German and Italian firemen, but the reality as I speak to you now, the reality there even now is that there are hundreds and hundreds of dead bulls and sheep that people are still unable to recover from the flooded pastures and farms."
"The reality is that in many small villages, like Codole in Gard, 98% of the houses were destroyed seven days before Christmas, hundreds of families are homeless, with definite budgetary realities."
"EUR 700 000 are needed for just one kilometre of dyke, EUR 150 000 in one small village to rebuild the roads, millions of euros to reconstruct public buildings, schools, multipurpose rooms, water treatment plants and sewer networks."
"The reality in a small village is EUR 5 000 every day to feed the homeless, the security services, families, even the military who are on guard to prevent looting; it is at least EUR 40 000 to 80 000 for every damaged house, and there are thousands of them."
"That is the most important of it."
"What is to be done?"
"Who will pay?"
"From which budget?"
"Will it be the local authorities, the region, France or Europe?"
"In theory, Mr President, Commissioner, there are solidarity mechanisms."
"There is even a solidarity principle in Article 2 of the treaty."
"There are mechanisms on paper: the ERDF, Objective 2, the EAGGF guarantee which came into play for mad cow disease, direct advances for farmers that were used after the August 2002 floods, the 2000-2004 programme for civil defence and the new Solidarity Fund."
"In this connection, we all know, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, that the Fund’s strict eligibility criteria and the modest EUR 1 billion allocated to it, which, incidentally, has already been swallowed up by the fires in Portugal or the earthquakes in Italy, are leaving my compatriots of Languedoc-Roussillon very much alone as Christmas approaches."
"If, in the case we are concerned with, we have seen the coming of the floods but not of the euros, we must at least work for the future."
"First, by funding a real time information system, which does not exist since the mayors were not alerted."
"In these days in which we are living we need an electronic computer system from Lyons to Arles that will allow all the rivers, dykes, canals, arms and tributaries of the Rhône basin to be monitored in real time and the local elected representatives to be alerted in case of danger."
"The province of Murcia in Spain has done it, Mr President; we ought to be able to."
"The crux of the matter lies elsewhere, however."
"Beyond prevention, reconstruction and compensation we must see that the floods of water mask the reality of a demographic flood."
"The senior citizens of northern Europe, not to mention the executives of the Paris region, come and make their homes in Languedoc-Roussillon, in Provence and throughout the south of France."
"Land is expropriated, the ground concreted over, 150 000 hectares of vines have flooded, and this is why, to cut a long story short, the area is swamped."
"What is more, the Dutch, English, Belgian and northern active European seniors will become truly aged citizens and demand extensive health care infrastructures in our region."
"To conclude, the overhaul of the Structural Funds must anticipate this territorial justice: if populations are transferred from north to south, the funding must be transferred as well, otherwise we will become the Palestinians of Europe, seeing colonies of senior citizens from Northern Europe settled among us."
"We do not want to be a permanently devastated West Bank in the South of France!"
"The debate is closed."
". The South of France has just suffered an unprecedented natural disaster."
"We are now beginning to assess the scale of the damage, which has been considerable."
"Seven people have died and around 100 000 have been affected by the disaster."
"Tens of thousands have been forced to shelter in gymnasiums or other makeshift accommodation."
"In the town of Arles alone, a third of the population has been evacuated."
"Thousands of jobs have disappeared under the water."
"Hundreds of flooded businesses have had to close their doors, plunging their employees into the uncertainty of temporary unemployment."
"The Camargue, with its fragile eco-system, is completely submerged: 250 km of dykes have been damaged, 560 hectares of farmland are under water, over 1000 animals have drowned, the entire rice sector has been destroyed."
"Damage in the region has been put at more than EUR one billion."
"Europe must show solidarity, in accordance with Article 2 of the regulation establishing the Solidarity Fund."
"This is an unprecedented disaster, as the region has fallen victim to the River Rhône’s ‘centennial flood’ – the most serious for a century."
"On behalf of the French Socialists, I ask the EU to make funds quickly available."
"Those stricken in the Rhône Delta expect nothing less."
". Devastating floods have once again struck my region, Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur, and Languedoc-Roussillon."
"I should first like to express my utmost sympathy to the victims of these disasters."
"Although the French Government has taken the necessary emergency steps and declared a state of emergency, we need European solidarity."
"This has already been seen on the ground, and I wish to thank the German, Italian, Belgian and Czech teams that have gone to the aid of the victims."
"Hopefully, European solidarity will also manifest itself in the mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund."
"The French Government is in the process of preparing a request to this end, which will be submitted at the beginning of 2004."
"My region has already benefited from such funds, following the storms and appalling floods of September 2002, and I can assure you that these funds are of enormous importance."
"Whilst the Structural Funds enable the cofinancing of some preventative and aid measures, zoning and normal consumption of funds limit their scope."
"They are thus insufficient to help the stricken populations and regions."
"Nonetheless, I hope that the prevention of natural disasters will, in future, become an integral part of their aims: while we have a duty to repair the damage, the only real aid policy is prevention."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"(B5-0547/2003) by Anne André-Léonard, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on Georgia: presidential and parliamentary elections;"
"(B5-0550/2003) by Demetrio Volcic and Margrietus J. van den Berg, on behalf of the PSE Group, on Georgia: presidential and parliamentary elections;"
"(B5-0554/2003) by Bastiaan Belder, on behalf of the EDD Group, on Georgia: presidential and parliamentary elections;"
"(B5-0556/2003) by Helmuth Markov, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on Georgia;"
"(B5-0560/2003) by Per Gahrton, Marie Anne Isler Béguin and Miquel Mayol i Raynal, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on Georgia;"
"(B5-0566/2003) by Marielle De Sarnez, Bernd Posselt and Ursula Schleicher, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on Georgia: presidential and parliamentary elections."
"– Mr President, I am a member of the Delegation to the EU-Armenia, EU-Azerbaijan and EU-Georgia Parliamentary Cooperation Committees, and I have visited Georgia."
"My impression was that they are very good people."
"It is a beautiful country, the food is excellent, the history is rich and the sense of humour is good."
"We visited Stalin's birthplace and went to a huge museum."
"Upstairs there is a circular room, at one end of which there are quotes about Stalin by contemporary world leaders."
"They are in the Georgian language and the Georgian alphabet, so I had to ask the guide what Winston Churchill had said about Stalin of which they are so proud."
"She replied that Winston Churchill had said that Stalin would be remembered by history."
"I enjoyed that."
"Georgia is also beset by troubles."
"It has Russian interference – Russian soldiers, although they promised to leave."
"There are separatist tendencies splitting the country – pulling it apart – and, above, all, there is deep corruption."
"Money is made from kidnapping foreigners."
"So the first step – the peaceful revolution they have undergone – was a wonderful first step, which this Parliament welcomes very strongly."
"However, they have a long way to go, although we would like to help them."
"They must eliminate corruption to create confidence for foreign investment, and that will create trade, jobs and prosperity."
"In the long run, I for one do not see why they should not one day become members of our Union."
"Mr President, our document calls on the European Union to give a commitment to making the Southern Caucasus at the forefront of promoting peace, stability and economic development."
"Nevertheless, without constructive cooperation from both Russia and the United States, it will be difficult to find a solution that is not merely abstract."
"The word ‘abstract’ seems appropriate for our document, which is indeed full of principles and high hopes, but does not give any indication as to whether these will one day be realised."
"In today’s resolution we hope, for example, that the elections of 4 January – that is, in a few days time – will include the peoples of the regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia: two breakaway regions."
"We are calling for this even though we know that it is a pipe dream, that it is a matter of principle, even though we do not know if this is something that can be called for or if it is – so to speak – merely an extremely abstract statement."
"Europe should, for example, call for a move towards authorising Russian identity documents for citizens of Abkhazia and now also for the third dissident region because, after the forced resignation of Mr Shevardnadze, a third dissident region is emerging, Ajaria."
"After the fall of Shevardnadze, the Moscow meeting of the three regions – I repeat, no longer two but three – which to varying extents want to break away from Georgia, also increases the uncertainty."
"Can the European Union use its instruments and diplomatic relations to discover the political intentions of the great powers, of the major players in the region?"
"The entire issue of the presence of foreign troops in the Southern Caucasus should find a forum in which it can be discussed."
"We want to understand whether the control and presence of foreign troops serves to bring stability or if it spreads further uncertainties."
"Calling on the Council and the Commission to organise, with the United Nations, the OSCE and the other actors, sending a mission to maintain peace in the region and to re-launch the peace process, is part of our desire for stability."
"The process of break-up has, however, reached the point where it is difficult to envisage what type of coexistence could be established, especially – and I repeat – if there is no collaboration between the major powers."
"Every effort must, however, be made, including those which seem somewhat abstract, in the hope of creating a starting point for the new governing group that has inherited a situation that is difficult from all points of view."
"– Mr President, the Russian Federation plays a crucial role in the future of the Republic of Georgia."
"The specific obstacles in the tense relationship between Moscow and Tbilisi are sufficiently known."
"Russia’s maintenance of a military presence on Georgian territory and its protection of Georgian regions threaten to break the political unity of this Trans-Caucasian republic permanently."
"The first obstacle is the international undertaking of 1999, by which the Kremlin committed itself to withdrawing its military presence from Georgia."
"The second obstacle was highlighted once again at the end of November during the much-publicised consultation in Moscow between Russia and representatives of Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Ajaria."
"The present resolution makes a clear stand against the said violations of Georgia’s national sovereignty and territorial integrity."
"This House expects the same political clarity from the Council and Commission in the relations between the European Union and Russia."
"Meanwhile, the interim government in Georgia has the mammoth task of getting their country back on the right track constitutionally speaking."
"This also calls for attention on the part of the European Union."
"Over the past few years, one and a half million of Georgia’s inhabitants have been obliged to leave their country in a gigantic brain drain."
"This centuries-old nation must surely have a prospect other than that of such a sad diaspora."
"Mr President, everyone shares the euphoria about the recent developments in Georgia: the storming of the parliament and the resignation of President Shevardnadze, who at one time enjoyed sustained acclaim."
"After a long tradition of having been the first colony in tsarist Russia, and then having been the birthplace of Stalin, and finally Eduard Shevardnadze, there now comes democracy."
"It is reminiscent of the Central Europe of previous years: Romania after Ceaucescu, or Serbia after Milosevic."
"Many European countries will be inclined to think: this is a nearby region, a Christian region, together with Armenia, but at the same time a long way away from us, only accessible from the Black Sea, via Turkey or via Russia."
"What relations could the European Union have in the future with that country?"
"In addition, Mr Belder has already drawn attention to the problem of its national minorities, and Abkhazia, in particular, has been a Georgian breakaway region for a long time now."
"The inhabitants of South Ossetia are actually unhappy about being part of Georgia, and in Ajaria people are supporting a leader who would gladly have remained loyal to Eduard Shevardnadze."
"A great many unresolved problems remain, therefore, and I think that, if a solution is not found to these internal problems, the democracy that is now able to get off the ground in Georgia will start at a disadvantage."
"It is very important to work towards this, therefore."
"In Amendment No 3, my group calls for the EU to ensure that its involvement, which is supposed to make a contribution to democracy, does not lead to interference in Georgia’s domestic politics."
"We do not believe that the purposes of democracy would be served by the European Union adopting the wrong attitude, putting too much emphasis on forcing together different population groups that have difficulty living together."
"It will have to be a cautious process, one that is primarily based on the efforts of the peoples of Georgia themselves: the Georgians as the largest group, but also taking account of the three large national minorities."
"Mr President, Commissioner, following the euphoria over the peaceful revolution that took place a few weeks ago, we are now preoccupied with a growing number of major concerns."
"Firstly, there is the terrible economic situation."
"We all know, partly from comparison with other countries, that if the situation remains as bad as this, if there is no prospect of an improvement in the economic situation, this will have a very negative impact on the chances of improving the functioning of democracy."
"We all support this: that is laid down in our resolution."
"We also know, however, that many people’s perspective is determined primarily by their economic situation, and that the confidence in parliamentary democracy – and that confidence is not so great in Georgia as it is – melts away if there is no improvement in the economic situation."
"To put it bluntly: without food or heating, democracy soon becomes a luxury."
"A situation such as this must be avoided at all costs, but it is a great danger, one that is threatening at the moment."
"My second great concern is the role of Russia."
"Of course, Mr Ivanov, the Foreign Minister, played a very positive role in the departure of Mr Shevardnadze, for which he deserves great credit."
"At the same time, however, we know that the influence of Russia in Georgia is very bad in the long term from a structural point of view."
"Firstly, there are the military bases, which Russia said years ago it was going to remove."
"That did not happen, which is a very bad thing."
"In recent years, of course, there has been Russia’s support for the three separatist movements in South Ossetia, Abkhazia and Ajaria."
"That assistance is military, but the assistance is often much more subtle: making it easier for the people from the regions to travel to Russia or to adopt Russian citizenship, for example."
"This has to stop."
"In order to change the role of Russia, assistance is required from the European Union."
"Georgia cannot do it alone."
"One way is for us to offer mediation."
"I am very much in favour of this: that is also laid down in the resolution."
"If Europe can play a role in this, it must be sure to do so."
"I am afraid that that will not suffice, however."
"I think that it will also be up to us to exert pressure on Russia to put an end to the negative role it is playing in Georgia."
"To be honest, the European Union is not good at this."
"The example of Chechnya shows that we often handle Russia with kid gloves when it comes to their conduct in the northern Caucasus, and now likewise in the southern Caucasus."
"This really has to stop."
"Supporting the elections is a very good thing, but it is just a drop in the ocean."
"Nor will our help in boosting the economy there suffice – which is also essential for the preservation of confidence in democracy – if, at the same time, we know that the great neighbour to the north, Russia, is very actively engaged in pulling the country apart into three pieces."
"The European Union must play a pioneering role in order to prevent this: if possible, by convincing Russia; but if necessary, by seeking confrontation."
"Mr President, due to the dramatic developments in Georgia in recent weeks and the imminent presidential elections on 4 January, six groups in the European Parliament have tabled a motion for this urgent debate."
"With their peaceful and thankfully bloodless revolution, the Georgian people have gained a hearing and all our respect."
"That is convincing evidence that despite their grave economic plight, the people of Georgia are yearning for democracy."
"There is now a chance for a new beginning."
"Properly conducted elections are a prerequisite for stability and development in Georgia."
"A great deal of time has been wasted since the transforming events of twelve years ago. Surprisingly, Georgia’s state coffers are almost empty."
"Georgia has received financial assistance not only from the European Union but from many other parts of the world, but its people have gone away empty-handed."
"The Georgian people have high expectations of their new President. He must create a democratic order but also provide for the people’s basic needs."
"I would like to thank the European Parliament for making it possible for our special delegation to travel to the elections."
"In this way, we are also showing that in the European Parliament, we take the task of supporting peaceful development in Georgia very seriously."
"At the Brussels Summit, the European Union’s Heads of State or Government have just reaffirmed, yet again, the Union’s determination to build a balanced and reciprocal strategic partnership with Russia, based on the values of the rule of law, democracy, human rights and fundamental freedoms and a free market economy."
"The national governments and the European Parliament, however, must accept that this kind of strategic partnership is only possible with states that honour their pledges."
"Russia has failed to fulfil the international commitments it made to Georgia in Istanbul in 1999 and by adopting this position, it has greatly obstructed democratic development in an already fragile region in the past."
"I can only hope that Russia will in future support constructive negotiations in all parts of Georgia, as agreed in the OSCE accords in 1999, and will not further impede democratic development."
"Russia plays a key role in Georgia and the entire Southern Caucasus."
"We in the European Parliament must address this issue when we deliberate our relations with Russia."
"However, our task now is to help Georgia overcome its crisis."
"Mr President, on the day after the Velvet Revolution that led to the resignation of President Shevardnadze, a new chapter is beginning in Georgia."
"More than ever before, Georgia has the opportunity to turn towards the EU and strengthen the existing Partnership and Cooperation Agreement."
"Georgia is a strategic gateway to Central Asia, but we must make the Georgian people aware that their future should not merely consist of a choice between two influences, Russia or the US."
"The recent political crisis is a strong signal from the people of Georgia, who have shown their determination to fight for democracy, while the financial and economic situation in the country is catastrophic and corruption is on the increase."
"A few weeks ahead of the planned presidential elections, which are due to take place on 4 January 2004, the EU must offer effective political, financial and technical assistance to the new Georgian authorities, in order to help them to adopt the reforms needed to stabilise the situation in the country and to allow the forthcoming elections to take place peacefully."
"It is also our duty to offer our help in at last finding a peaceful solution to the ongoing conflict in the regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia."
"The country’s financial and economic situation must also be subject to far-reaching reforms aimed at eliminating corruption."
"The EU has already provided an overall financial aid package of around EUR 342 million in the form of grants."
"Now more than ever, the process of economic reform must continue to enjoy EU support, so as to restore an atmosphere that is conducive to foreign and local investment."
"In conclusion, the EU must redouble its efforts to encourage democratic institutions and to support and promote independent media, through aid and development programmes, such as Tacis."
"Georgia must be made aware that it can receive generous support from the EU, enabling it to recover some stability, in an atmosphere of democracy and transparency."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, do we really hold ourselves in such low esteem?"
"Is there anyone among us who does not believe that the round of enlargement covering the ten countries that are to join the EU next year is the main reason why, with regard to at least some of them, they are not sinking into totalitarianism or chaos, into a situation in which Georgia almost found itself?"
"I believe that this is really what Europe today is about."
"Yes, we feel down, the Brussels summit did not turn out as we would have wished, but I believe that in historical terms enlargement has always been a success; it is proof that the EU has succeeded."
"The problem facing Georgia today is no different."
"Georgia used to be richer than most of the Soviet Union, whereas today it is the poorest region."
"If six years ago we had offered Georgia the chance to join, it would undoubtedly be in the same situation as the countries that are soon to join the EU."
"We must not follow Mr Meijer’s example."
"He is not only doing a disservice to us, but also to Mr Shevardnadze, a man who has his faults, but who also achieved some good things, and who is certainly no Ceaucescu or Milosevic."
"The issue, Mrs De Sarnez, is not the alternative that we can offer to the potential choice faced by the Georgians between Russia and the US; what we can offer is a choice between membership of the EU and chaos."
"This is what is at stake."
"It is not, Mr Volcic, a matter of nostalgia for a bipolar, US-Soviet world."
"The challenge for us, the EU, is to create an alternative for these countries of the Transcaucasus."
"So I hope that we have seen the last of the unspoken comments and an inability to think beyond the Black Sea."
"The Council has never even considered the matter, as it said again yesterday evening."
"Georgia must be placed immediately on the list of candidate countries, so as to afford it the opportunity, as we did with the Baltic States, and with the countries of Central Europe, to build a path to stability, development and democracy, by offering EU membership within eight to ten years."
"Mr President, an ancient Christian kingdom that had long repelled all invaders became a Russian colony."
"Then after the First World War, Georgia enjoyed a brief period of independence during what we might term the ‘Caucasian Spring’, a fact that is generally forgotten."
"It was brought to an end by Lenin, who failed to uphold his own principles of nationality."
"Then a strong liberation movement emerged at the end of the Soviet era. We should not forget that the liberation movement in the Soviet Union began very vigorously and very early in Georgia."
"We ourselves have a great deal to thank Georgia for when it came to the fall of the Iron Curtain."
"Then President Gamsakhurdia was murdered."
"This was followed by civil unrest, the separatist movements and the Shevardnadze era, which has now come to an end – thankfully without bloodshed."
"The country is now at a stage where it finally has a chance to establish a system genuinely rooted in freedom."
"We must ensure that after many decades of foreign tutelage, the country has the opportunity at last to become what it once was in history, namely a genuinely independent and peaceful factor in a very important and very dangerous region."
"That is why we must push to ensure that Russia upholds the binding commitments it made to the OSCE in 1999."
"We often demand, very arrogantly, of small states that they honour commitments that have often been imposed upon them, so we must be rigorous in demanding that when a major power enters into such commitments voluntarily, it is scrupulous in upholding them."
"Mrs Schleicher is quite right, in my view, to say that Russia cannot be our partner if it fails to fulfil its commitments on this key issue."
"We see that there are other powers as well which, for geostrategic and energy reasons, are aspiring to establish a particular dominance in the region."
"That is why it is our obligation, as Europeans, to stabilise Georgia as our partner, although I would not go as far as Mr Dupuis, who is demanding full membership."
"Georgia is a country with a great European tradition. It is our valued partner and it can be a beacon of freedom in an extremely dangerous region."
". Mr President, honourable Members, the European Union is very satisfied by the peaceful outcome to the political changes that have occurred in Georgia, following the parliamentary elections on 2 November and President Shevardnadze’s resignation."
"Georgia now has a unique opportunity to leave the past behind in order to build a better future for all its citizens, one that is founded upon a clear commitment to democracy, to the rule of law, and to the market economy."
"One must not, however, underestimate the challenges it will face, but, in view of Georgia’s commitment to reform, Commissioner Patten wanted me to assure your House of the EU’s willingness to do everything in its power to help Georgia meet these challenges."
"The most immediate challenge facing Georgia comes in the form of the democratic presidential elections to be held on 4 January, to be followed later by parliamentary elections in accordance with the undertakings given to the OSCE and the Council of Europe."
"The Commission intends to grant Georgia a package of at most EUR 2 million to support preparations for these elections."
"Georgia is also facing very serious difficulties with its budget."
"The Commission has just directed that the sum of EUR 5 million be paid under a fast-track procedure for a food safety programme in order to enable Georgia to meet its most urgent needs during the winter months."
"Now that democratic elections have been held, the Commission will support the newly-elected president, who is determined to introduce reforms."
"We have re-examined our strategy in relation to Georgia, which provides a sound basis on which the country may be helped to tackle the priority areas in which reforms are indispensable."
"Action to combat the scourge of corruption will assume crucial importance for any programme of reform to bear lasting fruit."
"The Commission will consider the means whereby substantial resources may be mobilised in support of such reforms."
"I also want to stress that the Commission is already, under the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights, providing aid to Georgia to help ensure that these are respected."
"Alongside the Council of Europe, we are also working to strengthen local democracy and the machinery for protecting human rights."
"We will, over the coming months, be giving consideration to whether or not we need to change what we are doing in the light of recent political changes in Georgia."
"The European Union has for a long time demonstrated its support for Georgia’s sovereignty and territorial integrity."
"The endeavour to resolve the conflicts that are rending the country asunder, bringing long-term stability to this region of the South Caucasus, and establishing good working relations, founded upon mutual respect, between Georgia and Russia, will play an important part in this."
"For its part, the European Union is examining new ways of giving support that will resolve conflicts or prevent them arising in the first place."
"The Commission will stand ready to support rehabilitation efforts in the aftermath of conflicts."
"The Commission is, in close collaboration with the EU’s special representative for the South Caucasus, Mr Heikki Talvitie, making resolute efforts at devising a broader policy for the European Union in its relations with the South Caucasus region, in which process our efforts at providing support for Georgia are both a major element, and, at this present time, crucial."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place this afternoon following the debates."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"(B5-0545/2003) by Bob van den Bos, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the end of the moratorium on the death penalty in the Philippines;"
"(B5-0551/2003) by Margrietus J. van den Berg, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the end of the moratorium on the death penalty in the Philippines;"
"(B5-0557/2003) by Giuseppe Di Lello Finuoli and Lucio Manisco, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the end of the moratorium on the death penalty in the Philippines;"
"(B5-0562/2003) by Patricia McKenna and Matti Wuori, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on the end of the moratorium on the death penalty in the Philippines;"
"(B5-0567/2003) by Bernd Posselt and Ilkka Suominen, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on the end of the moratorium on the death penalty in the Philippines;"
"(B5-0569/2003) by Cristiana Muscardini and Luís Queiró, on behalf of the UEN Group, on the end of the moratorium on the death penalty in the Philippines."
"Mr President, the situation which has inspired this Resolution today demonstrates that human rights and respect for life, as higher values, are never entirely enjoyed and we democrats throughout the world must be alert at all times."
"Despite the fact that the death penalty has not reduced crime rates in any country, we are very concerned to see that 83 countries in the world continue to maintain and apply it."
"Today we must regret and condemn the fact that President Arroyo has changed her position on the death penalty in the Philippines."
"Furthermore, we must not forget that in the Philippines there are cases of minors who have been sentenced to death."
"The European Union must draw certain red lines, which we must never cross."
"One of them is precisely the death penalty."
"The fact that a country such as the Philippines can backtrack on what was a victory by means of the moratorium, is of great concern to all us democrats in the world at the moment, and in particular the democrats in the European Union."
"Therefore, in view of this situation, we have promoted this Resolution, which the Philippines authorities absolutely must take account of, so that we can continue to believe that it is possible that the values we have advocated as higher values are never jeopardised."
"Today my group will vote in favour of this Resolution."
"Mr President, the death penalty is an abomination."
"It is a mediaeval phenomenon that was used by governments that were unable to guard their prisoners and therefore killed them before they could escape."
"In the present day, however, it is even worse; and the death penalty phenomenon is at its worst when it is used as a political instrument by governments against their opponents."
"The Philippines has a past history that has been a constant source of violence, and those problems are still unresolved today."
"This is clear even from the history of the past hundred years: the takeover of the Spanish colonies by the United States in 1898, followed by a kind of self-determination in 1946, and then the assumption of power by governments that ruled the population in a very dictatorial manner, notably the long-standing Marcos dictatorship."
"Since then, there have only been weak governments."
"There may have been changes of president, but with a powerful army in the background, and with no regard being paid to opponents, and still less to independence movements, movements that envisaged a future outside the Philippines or in a loose alliance with the other parts of the Philippines."
"As a result, the Philippines is constantly beset by various forms of guerrilla warfare."
"In the Philippines of today, the left wing may have a three-strong representation in parliament, but this is actually there semi-legally, whilst other parts of the same left wing are regarded as terrorist organisations."
"Under these circumstances, the death penalty is a highly dangerous instrument in the hands of a government that refuses to listen to diverging opinions and stands in the way of alternative solutions."
"Meanwhile, the succession of governments of the Philippines of recent times has never succeeded in solving the major problems of poverty, deprivation, oppression and violence."
"Everything possible should be done, from both outside and within, to give the Philippines a peaceful and prosperous future, and that cannot be done by means of the death penalty."
"Mr President, I agree with Mr Meijer on many points."
"However, I am afraid it is rather simplistic to describe the death penalty as a relic of the Middle Ages."
"I am afraid that the death penalty is quite specifically a feature of the modern age as well."
"The guillotine and the electric chair are symbols of the modern age."
"So that this phenomenon vanishes from the modern age, we must lobby actively for the abolition of the death penalty worldwide, regardless of the individual or the state concerned."
"We have great sympathy and understanding for the Philippines, a country which is more at threat from organised crime, separatism and terrorism than most other countries in the world."
"On the other hand, however, we must make it quite clear that terrorism and violence can only be overcome through justice and the rule of law, and that the thousands of detainees and persons condemned to death in the Philippines have just as much of a right to life as anyone else."
"We oppose the death penalty in every case – whether the person concerned is Saddam Hussein or the perpetrator of other serious crimes."
"The same naturally applies to the detainees in the Philippines."
"We must make one thing very clear. No state has the right – other than in self-defence – to challenge any individual’s right to life."
"For that reason, the EU opposes the death penalty as a matter of principle and has made this a criterion for accession."
"However, we must also make it a benchmark against which we measure our partners."
"We therefore send out a very clear appeal to the Philippines: a) to uphold the moratorium, b) to review the thousand or so trials, many of which are of dubious legality with miscarriages of justice and political caprice, and c) to abolish the death penalty in general, for it can play no part in enforcing the rule of law."
"Mr President, I am very concerned about President Arroyo’s decision to give in to pressure and end an almost four-year moratorium, in spite of the fact that she is opposed on principle to taking human life."
"This decision emphasises the crucial need for a UN moratorium on the death penalty, which would make it much more difficult to give in to pressure to begin carrying out executions again."
"It would also put an end to the completely unacceptable executions of mentally handicapped people and of child abusers which take place in a good many countries and which will take place in the Philippines from January 2004."
"The Philippines are of course only one of many places in the world in which there is a danger of being sentenced to death for non-violent offences. Others include Pakistan and China where, respectively, blasphemy and tax evasion are punishable by death."
"Innocent people too are at risk."
"In 2003, nine people were pardoned in the United States because they were innocent."
"We have to accept that a country’s penal system reflects traditions and special historical circumstances, but the death penalty involves denying a person his or her dignity."
"The EU’s efforts to abolish the death penalty and introduce a universal moratorium must therefore be made clear and explicit to all the EU’s partners."
". Mr President, honourable Members, the Commission views with extreme concern Mrs Arroyo’s decision to lift the moratorium on the death penalty in the Philippines."
"The European Union is opposed to the death penalty under whatever circumstances, believing as it does in the inherent dignity of every human being and in the inviolability of the human person."
"The European Union has therefore asked Mrs Arroyo to reconsider her decision to no longer stand in the way of executions, and has invited her to maintain the moratorium, which has been in force since March 2000."
"In particular, we are also concerned about the Supreme Court’s imposition of the death sentence on fifteen minors, which contravenes Article 6 (5) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, supported by the Commission through specific actions."
"In its May 2001 communication on the EU’s role in promoting human rights and democratisation in third countries, the Commission reaffirmed the priority it gives to the funding of projects seeking to abolish capital punishment."
"In consequence it included the abolition of capital punishment among the thematic priorities of the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights for the period 2002-2004 and allocated a specific budget of EUR 12 million to action in this area for the period 2000-2004."
"In faithfulness to our commitment, we contributed some EUR 500 000 to the campaign against the death penalty in the Philippines in 2002, as part of the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights."
"The Commission communication, ‘A new partnership with South-East Asia’, stipulates that all new bilateral accords concluded with countries in that region must include the ‘essential element’ clause on human rights."
"In this context, this ‘essential element’ clause, which has capital punishment as one of its fundamental aspects, shall be given priority in any bilateral accord planned between the European Union and the Philippines."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place this afternoon following the debates."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"(B5-0546/2003) by Ole Andreasen, Anne André-Léonard and Bob van den Bos, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on Moldova;"
"(B5-0555/2003) by Bastiaan Belder, on behalf of the EDD Group, on Moldova;"
"(B5-0558/2003) by Giuseppe Di Lello Finuoli and Helmuth Markov, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on Moldova;"
"(B5-0559/2003) by Jan Marinus Wiersma, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the political situation in Moldova;"
"(B5-0561/2003) by Marie Anne Isler Béguin and Elisabeth Schroedter, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on the political situation in Moldova;"
"(B5-0568/2003) by Michael Gahler, Bernd Posselt, Lennart Sacrédeus and Charles Tannock, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on Moldova."
"Mr President, I think that on seeing the iron curtain fall and the Soviet Union collapse, we were all convinced that a great opportunity had arisen for development, peace and progress throughout Central and Eastern Europe."
"We convinced ourselves that this was the end of history, that we were facing a new dawn."
"Perhaps one of the most tragic refutations of this hope is the case of Moldova, which is a perfect example of how history does not always take the direction its leading figures set out for it and is one of the worst examples of this in modern Europe."
"It is an example of a country riven by ethnic conflict, with part of it being occupied by foreign military forces, with its economy in a state of total collapse, with mafias in control and with the country’s inhabitants trying to leave the country by any means available."
"We must not forget that, as of 2007, according to the official timetable for enlargement, the European Union will share a border with Moldova."
"Consequently, and here I address my words directly to the Commissioner, Moldova must be seen not as an issue of minor importance, but as a priority for European diplomacy."
"The current state of affairs cannot be allowed to continue, and this resolution must be seen as a loud wake-up call to all the institutions to pay Moldova the greatest attention and to attempt to find a solution to the current conflict, which is undermining the stability of that country and that of Central and Eastern Europe as a whole."
"Mr President, they were spectacular words that Commissioner Verheugen addressed to Moldova on 5 December during his visit to Chisinau."
"Among other things, he spoke of ‘European perspectives’."
"Mr Verheugen also announced a special EU action plan for Moldova by May 2004."
"I sincerely hope that that will be primarily a practical support plan, which does not raise any false hopes in Chisinau."
"Meanwhile, the Republic of Transnistria, which is not recognised by the international community, remains the political open wound in Moldova."
"The politico-military role of the Russian Federation is evident here."
"It constitutes the litmus test for the near future as to whether the European Union and Russia are really aspiring to common stability and security goals on our continent."
"What was that we were saying about good neighbourly relations?"
"Transnistria, an urgent matter for the Council and the Commission in their relations with the Kremlin."
"What was that we were saying about EU priorities?"
"Mr President, the predominantly Romanian-speaking region that was previously known as Bessarabia and is now called Moldova was part of Romania between the two world wars, but belonged to Russia before and afterwards."
"When the Soviet Union collapsed, the same national colours were chosen as those of the Romanian flag, and many thought about a return to Romania."
"Since then, the country has been torn apart by diverging opinions on its political future."
"Many within the two conflicting population groups support an old-fashioned kind of authoritarian communist, in whom they see their best chance of survival despite their low incomes."
"That is the only thing they do agree on, however."
"The minority who speak a Slavonic language, principally in the narrow strip of land on the eastern bank of the river Dniester, want to preserve the traditional strong bond with Ukraine, Russia and Belarus."
"The Romanian-speaking majority in the rest of the country would probably have joined Romania long ago if that country did not lag so far behind western Europe."
"The way that Romania is now, few consider joining that much larger country a matter of urgency."
"Within Romania, too, endeavours to regain Moldova have become less urgent."
"When I visited Romania last year, I even heard a Romanian member of parliament state proudly that Romania is the only country that is still adhering properly to the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, which established the new western borders of the Soviet Union on the eve of the Second World War."
"The European Union must be careful that it does not appoint itself guardian of that short-lived agreement between Stalin and Hitler for eternity."
"The two conflicting population groups within Moldova once agreed to part company peacefully if the majority were to join Romania."
"It would therefore be prudent to take account of the possibility of the river Dniester becoming the frontier between Romania and Ukraine again in the future."
"That is another eventuality that we should keep in mind."
"Mr President, I do apologise, but I would ask you to ring very loudly, for most Members of the House are assuming that the vote will take place in an hour’s time at the earliest, and it will take some time for them to get here."
"Last time, many people missed the vote because the bell was rung too late."
"I would communicate to Mr Posselt that we have given instructions that the bells in the House should work and let us hope that the Members stay alert."
"The honourable Members know the rules."
"Thank you very much for your positive information."
"Mr President, if we look at the demands and expectations that we have set out in our resolution on Moldova, we see just how archaic the country still is in terms of democracy and civil society standards."
"Among other things, we expect the government to respect democratic principles, to uphold human and minority rights, to allow civil society and a parliamentary opposition to exercise their constitutional rights, and to curb human trafficking in general and trafficking in women and girls in particular."
"These are demands that we made of other countries years ago, and they have already been fulfilled in many regions of Central and Eastern Europe."
"It is apparent that in Moldova, these foundations of democracy and a market economy have still not been put in place."
"The situation is further exacerbated by the status of the regime in Transnistria, which can only survive with Russian support."
"Here too, as in Georgia – as we discussed in the previous debate – we see that Russia is not using its influence to stabilise, but unfortunately to destabilise the situation."
"I really do wish that our governments would address this issue unequivocally, also in connection with Moldova, in their frequent contacts with Russia."
"It is clear that economic and political stabilisation in Moldova can only be achieved if this conflict is resolved. That cannot happen without Russia."
"It is a damning indictment that Russia did not pull out its troops by the end of 2003, as it had pledged to do."
"It does not contribute to a solution if Russia unilaterally submits a plan that simply entrenches the status quo."
"That is why a peace plan must not only be announced but must actually be submitted in Moldova itself."
"I would like to see the government and opposition working together on this issue."
"As the EU, we must make our contribution to ensuring, for example, that an OSCE mandate, which has been discussed here, can be achieved."
"I believe that we should stress yet again that multilateral solutions are important in this context, and we must call on Russia, Ukraine and Romania to refrain from taking unilateral steps."
"Mr President, Commissioner, as a Christian Democrat and Swedish Member of the European Parliament, I am very pleased that the issue of Moldova has been addressed again."
"Moldova has not succeeded in stabilising its democratic development following the collapse of the Soviet Union."
"As Commissioner Busquin is very well aware, the language issue and cultural identity are sources of division for the Moldovan people as a whole. The issue concerns the place of the Romanian language and of the national Moldovan movement in society, as opposed to that of the Russian language and of leanings towards Russia and the east."
"We European and Swedish Christian Democrats wish to express our support for the opposition in Moldova, which is led by the Christian Democratic Party under Iurie Rosca."
"We call upon them openly to stand up for a European, democratic and pluralist direction for Moldovan society on the basis of the common values upon which the European Union ultimately rests."
"What this resolution says about Moldovan democracy not having been stabilised is perfectly true."
"The situation in Transnistria, which is in practice a breakaway republic, does not make the situation any easier."
"I believe that the Commission and the European Council should take action to strengthen cultural development in Moldova, so that the country might acquire an independence in which its own language, Moldovan, is given its rightful place."
"The mass demonstrations conducted in Chisinau in recent years show that the country must be given every support in developing into a pluralist democracy in which the opposition is not suppressed by the country’s Communist leadership."
". Mr President, honourable Members, the European Union has for a long time been concerned about the Transnistria problem."
"In the statement made at the recent Maastricht ministerial summit of the OSCE, with which the Commission is in full agreement, the Presidency of the European Union reaffirmed our commitment to guard the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Moldavia, for which it confirmed its full and entire support in the context of the five-party negotiations between the OSCE, the Russian Federation, the Ukraine and the two parties concerned."
"The European Union regards this framework as constituting a transparent space appropriate to the search for a political solution to the conflict."
"At Maastricht, the European Union made clear its disappointment at Russia’s failure to make any progress in respect of its undertaking, made at Istanbul in 1999, to withdraw its troops and munitions from Transnistria."
"Considering that only a truly multinational commitment would enjoy international legitimacy, the European Union invited Russia to honour its commitments, and reiterated its willingness to help find a multinational solution under the aegis of the OSCE."
"The European Union is also taking tangible action towards resolving the conflict."
"The Commission is joining with Moldavia in putting the finishing touches to an accord drawn up to create a system of dual control over Moldavia’s exports of steel to the EU, a system that will give Moldavia greater control over exports originating from the breakaway region."
"The Commission is also encouraging Moldavia to improve the control of its borders and of its customs area; in March 2003, it organised an initial meeting between Moldavia and the Ukraine at which plans were made to institute joint controls along the two countries’ shared borders and to discuss bilateral issues."
"A second meeting will be held in January 2004."
"The Wider Europe-New Neighbourhood initiative offers new prospects of enabling Moldavia to enjoy the stability, security and prosperity that we have brought about within the enlarged European Union."
"We hope that the very clear prospect of EU membership offered to Moldavia as part of that initiative will act as an incentive to achieve a settlement of the conflict in Transnistria."
"The Commission will continue to give attention to the way the situation develops and to remind the Russian Federation of the issue of its abiding by the undertakings it gave in Istanbul."
"– Thank, you, Commissioner."
"The joint debate is closed, and we will proceed to the vote.(1)"
"– The House has completed its business."
"I declare suspended this session of the European Parliament, wishing you all a splendid holiday, in order to restore your energies ready to complete the fifth parliamentary term in 2004."
"Merry Christmas and a happy New Year!"
"(1)"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 18 December 2003."
"Colleagues, as you know, on 26 December 2003, in the ancient city of Bam in Iran, at least 30 000 people lost their lives as a result of an earthquake."
"Many thousands were injured and tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of people in that city and region have been displaced."
"I wish to place clearly on the record of this House our sympathy for all the victims of this earthquake, and our determination to show practical solidarity with them and their communities in the weeks and months to come."
"I should like also to turn our attention to the accident, on 3 January 2004, involving an Egyptian charter plane, which crashed in the Red Sea killing 148 people."
"I have already conveyed, on behalf of Parliament, our condolences to the families of the victims and to the French authorities."
"Out of respect for the victims, both of the earthquake – a horrendous natural disaster – and of the air traffic accident, I ask you to observe a minute's silence."
"Colleagues, I should like to point out to you that last night, here in this building in Strasbourg, a water leak occurred in a warm-water boiler situated on the floor above our Chamber."
"The water leaked into the suspended ceiling of the Chamber and some of it fell on Members' seats and desks."
"I regret to inform colleagues in the Socialist Group that yours was the target zone."
"The leak was discovered at around 4.30 this morning by the European Parliament services, who immediately took the necessary steps to safeguard the Chamber and the fittings and to seek to localise and stop the leak."
"The technical services and the contractors have cleared away the water from the suspended ceiling and dried it out, cleaned up the furniture and checked the technical equipment for interpretation and electronic voting."
"I have been assured by our technical services that there is no danger in respect of the suspended ceiling, nor any threat of collapse."
"To the best of our knowledge, there was no substantial damage to the voting or interpreting equipment, other than the 11 systems and stations that have been replaced in the course of this afternoon."
"Therefore, the Chamber should be fully operational."
"If there are any operational problems, please inform the services as a matter of urgency so that they can be addressed.(1)"
"The final draft agenda as drawn up pursuant to Rules 110 and 110a of the Rules of Procedure by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday 8 January 2004 has been distributed."
"No changes have been proposed to the agenda for Strasbourg or for Brussels."
"– Mr President, the agenda for this afternoon includes Mr Pex’s report on sanctions for pollution offences at sea."
"Mr Pex is well, as are Mr Doorn and others, and I am telling you that so that you are not dismayed by what I also have to tell you, which is that they have been in an aircraft accident."
"It would appear from what I have been told that the aircraft ran off the runway, but all of them are all right."
"Mr Pex has asked that his report should be taken today rather than being adjourned, and that it should be presented by Mr Bremmer, who, although he is not a member of the committee, is well-informed about the issue."
"I was more than willing to convey this request to you."
"As the Commissioner is present, and as the House seems to agree, we shall thus proceed with the order of business today as planned."
"– Mr President, although, admittedly, we are announcing this at relatively short notice, we would like a change made to the vote on Thursday, and Mrs Gebhardt would be happy – assuming this to be possible – to explain our reasons for this."
"– Mr President, on Thursday, we are due to debate and vote on the Zappalà report on the recognition of diplomas."
"Although there is no reason whatever why the debate should not be held on Thursday morning, I would ask that we defer the vote on this report until the sitting in Brussels at the end of the month."
"There are two reasons for this request, which I am making on behalf of my group."
"The first is that there are a few amendments that still need to be checked before they go for translation today, and there is very little time left in which to do it."
"I believe that the total number of amendments will be over 300."
"The other is that a large number of Members of this House are flying off to India on Thursday morning for the Social Forum."
"The recognition of professional qualifications is such an important topic, and one that affects so many members of the public, that it really would be sensible and proper for there to be a very large number of Members in this House to vote on it."
"That is a reason for us to do it at a time when we can guarantee that many of us will be present, and so we ask that the vote on this report be held in Brussels at the end of the month, but that the debate should still be on Thursday morning."
". – Mr President, I wish to speak to this topic on behalf of the rapporteur."
"I have been advised that he would have been quite happy to have this report put to the vote this week, one reason being that we know from experience that attendance is higher when we are in Strasbourg than when we are sitting in Brussels."
"This topic is of particular importance, one that has been under discussion for many, many months already, and our committee has put off voting on it over and over again, not least because it is so momentous and problematic."
"This time, though, we believe that the time for a decision on the matter has come and that it can be taken this week."
"I am in something of a dilemma on this matter, not just because different suggestions are being made here, but also because my private office had contacted the rapporteur, and I understood that he supported a line of action other than the one now being proposed."
"I suggest that we take soundings at the opening of business tomorrow morning to see if we can reconcile the different preferences that have been expressed here this afternoon."
"Does the House agree?"
"Mr President, would it not be possible to do so before the vote tomorrow lunchtime?"
"Yes, in fact that is preferable, as more people will be in attendance at the beginning of the vote tomorrow."
"I invite colleagues to use the interim period for consultation and, desirably, to come to a consensus."
"We now come to the vote on a request for urgent procedure."
"This is a request that was considered at the end of the last part-session."
"Mr President, I will begin by presenting the apologies of Mrs Randzio-Plath, who is unable to be present."
"The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs will be voting on this question of extension this evening under the simplified procedure, Article 158 (1), so the outcome should be known quickly."
"I think we will in fact have an agreement, but the vote takes place this evening."
"I understand then that after tonight's meeting you will be definitively in a position to give a recommendation."
"Do you thus want to deal with the urgency tomorrow morning at the opening of business?"
"We are able to accept the proposal today, right now."
"Mr President, as you will be aware, last Monday my office received an incendiary bomb which was addressed to me but opened by my staff."
"Could I take the opportunity to thank colleagues for their solidarity and support."
"It was obviously a shocking incident, although we have to put it in perspective: a lot worse has happened to other Members of this House."
"What was particularly frightening was that it was my staff who opened this correspondence and that could have included, for example, students on temporary work experience; that was the most cowardly aspect of it."
"While we have to take security precautions, I hope that we would not allow barriers to be created between us and the electorate, because that is exactly what the perpetrators want: to undermine democratic society."
"We have seen plenty of examples of that in the past."
"Perhaps the most shocking aspect was a decision by Mr Farage of the UK Independence Party to put out an opportunist press release that was at best in the worst possible taste and at worst an apology for terrorism."
"Since that press release, my office staff have had injury added to insult by receiving a lot of emails from supporters of the UK Independence Party, or its members, which have been frankly offensive and inflammatory in the extreme, including one suggestion that it should have been a bigger bomb."
"This has reinforced my view of the UK Independence Party as a group of paranoid reactionaries on the fringes of society who are now clearly prepared to throw their lot in with those who advocate the violent overthrow of governments."
"There have been apologists for terrorists in this House before, particularly Herri Batasuna."
"I am disappointed and ashamed that a British political party should have taken the same stance and I hope you condemn that, Mr President."
"Mr Titley, the House expresses its total solidarity with you and your staff."
"Several other colleagues wish to speak on this subject, but afterwards I should like to make a few comments to the House on some of the elements in hand with regard to learning lessons from the events of last week."
"Mr President, I would also like to express my gratitude for the countless expressions of friendship and solidarity I have received from practically every part of the world, from all the institutions – and I note that the Vice-President of the Commission, Mrs de Palacio, is here – and from many many Members of this House, from all the political groups without exception, following the delivery of the package from Bologna."
"Mr President, I believe that the institutions must not be intimidated by these acts and that, today more than ever, we must continue to work in favour of a united Europe – taking account of the priorities which the Irish Presidency will present to us the day after tomorrow – in favour of a Constitution for Europe;"
"Europe wants and needs a Constitution, Mr President, a Constitution which must include all of us."
"Mr President, I believe it is important that, in view of the threat of terrorism, which affects us all equally – and I believe it is a good time to recognise and express, as a Spaniard, my gratitude for the constant encouragement we have received from the European Parliament in our fight against the terrorist group ETA – we have to continue united, and the response must also be from us all equally."
"And as Mr Titley said, that response must be calm and serene, and not hysterical, mobilising all our efforts and our determination so that freedom – and I would like to point out, Mr President, that this is the European citizens’ House of freedom – is not savagely, and with impunity, violated by barbarity, which is the only thing the terrorist movements represent."
"– Mr President, I did not actually want to make a statement, but, as a number of Members have spoken, I will do so after all."
"It must be absolutely plain to us in this House that we will not allow anyone – be they terrorists, anarchists or anyone else – to bring pressure to bear on us."
"We affirm that European integration is a labour of peace, of understanding and of reconciliation, from which nobody in Europe or anywhere in the world will succeed in diverting us."
"We should therefore consider how we can improve our security, but should also be utterly determined to press on with our labour of peace in uniting Europe."
"Mr President, I have said since the start of this episode that I condemn the use of violence to achieve political ends."
"I said that throughout last week, and I am disappointed that Mr Titley has refused to listen."
"If, as he says, he has received direct threats from people who purport to be supporters or members of the UK Independence Party, he should forward those names to me immediately, because those people would immediately face disciplinary proceedings and be expelled from our party."
"We are a non-racist, non-sectarian, democratic political party, but one which dares to say that carrying on with European integration without the wholehearted consent of the people of Europe is a dangerous thing."
"Would it not be better to put this proposed European Constitution to a democratic vote in every country in the European Union and let the people, not professional politicians, decide their destiny?"
"Not doing this might be a mistake of historic consequences that could lead to very serious disorder in the future."
"I call the former Mayor of Bologna, our Vice-President Mr Imbeni."
"Mr President, I am not taking the floor in my capacity as former Mayor of Bologna, or as an MEP elected in Bologna."
"I have, of course, already expressed my solidarity with those who were directly affected by these acts of violence, but I do, however, agree with those who say that we must not give too much publicity to those who want to weaken the democratic institutions though violent acts and intimidation."
"In taking the floor, I am doing so to ask you, Mr President, and all my fellow Members to support an idea that was put forward by the former Norwegian Prime Minister a few days ago: the idea of awarding the Nobel Peace Price to the European Union."
"Just as Mr Poettering mentioned a short time ago, this is the greatest and most extraordinary labourof peace that has ever been achieved."
"I believe that the European Union – I am not saying the European Parliament, the Council or the Commission, but the Union itself – would be entirely justified in calling for and supporting the Nobel Peace Price being awarded to the Union."
"I hope that all Members, starting with you, Mr President, will support this idea."
"With regard to the incidents of last week, I can reassure colleagues that we have had very intensive contacts with the security services of the Member States, particularly in the light of Mr Titley's experience."
"We have carried out a very thorough review of the security arrangements within our buildings."
"A number of operational issues were raised in that review."
"We have addressed these and shall continue to address them with a serious focus."
"This issue was discussed at length last week in the Conference of Presidents and will be discussed at length again tonight in the Bureau."
"It is appropriate that I should reassure you that this is being treated in the way you would expect."
"It is also fitting that we know what our response is and ought to be, but that we keep it to ourselves."
"On the final issue touched on in the course of these remarks on the incidents of last week, let us be clear that there is no justification for acts of terror against democratically-elected people – whatever the cause, wherever the place – including, in the light of last week, Members of this House."
"No Member of this House should seek, directly or indirectly, to sustain the unsustainable and the unacceptable."
"– Mr President, I should like to bring an entirely different matter to your attention, namely the special expropriation act in Valencia regulating urban development activities – the LRAU – which, in my view, is an outright violation of various international treaties, including the European Union’s Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"It appears as if the Valencian authorities have designed this Stalinist law in order to achieve their plans cheaply."
"The law stipulates that expropriations can take place in the general interest, but, in practice, has the effect that project developers have a licence for carrying out their lucrative plans."
"Compensation for house owners who are evicted is ridiculously low; there is no means of recourse against it and the residents, often retired foreigners from across the EU, are not even informed."
"This seems to be a mediaeval situation."
"I would therefore call for one of Parliament's committees of enquiry to examine whether this law violates international treaties and also for this law to be rendered inoperative during the enquiry."
"Mr President, this week marks the second anniversary of the detention of approximately 660 people in Guantanamo Bay without charge or trial."
"Amnesty International has claimed that some of them are juveniles."
"This House has expressed its concerns quite recently about the continued detention of these people without charge or trial and has urged that they be given a fair and open hearing with the right to choose their own defence counsel."
"I ask you, Mr President, to make direct contact with the United States Congress to express the concerns of this Parliament and also to urge the President-in-Office of the Council to make contact with the authorities in the United States to express our concerns."
"If, in the struggle to defeat terrorism, we deny people civil and political rights then we are undermining our democracies."
"In the course of my remarks on behalf of Parliament to the December 2003 summit meeting in Brussels, I spoke in precisely those terms regarding all of the institutions' contacts with the United States, its administration and Congress."
"Mr President, last week at the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, India and Pakistan announced that they will meet again in a month's time to take bilateral confidence-building measures, including talks on Kashmir."
"This House will welcome an easing of tensions at the most dangerous flashpoint in the globe which only two years ago was on the brink of a nuclear war."
"Both countries have recently announced a ceasefire along the line of control in Kashmir, restored airline and bus links and signed a trade agreement."
"In March, India's cricket team will be visiting Pakistan for the first time in a decade."
"Sport and friendship go hand in hand."
"I urge President Musharraf, nevertheless, at the same time to ensure an end to cross-border terrorist infiltration and I welcome the news today of the arrest of those accused of attempting to assassinate him."
"I am sure this House will wish to express its encouragement and support for the peace process."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the Members who have endorsed a paper that expresses solidarity with women accused of having an abortion and who are currently on trial again in Portugal."
"The trial continues at Aveiro Criminal Court tomorrow."
"Following the Maia case, around two years ago, new cases have emerged on a regular basis."
"Despite the European Parliament’s resolution, adopted on 3 July 2002, which recommends that Member States should not bring criminal action against women who have abortions, the law in Portugal remains out of touch with social reality. It is a cruel law that makes women turn to illegal ‘backstreet’ abortions, treats them like criminals, puts them in the dock and can send them to prison for up to three years."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I therefore ask you to show solidarity with these women and call on the Portuguese National Assembly to address the problem of illegal abortions, and abolish the legislation that convicts these women."
"Mr President, at the beginning of December it was announced that the European Commission had concluded negotiations for an Association Agreement with Syria and then we heard no more about it."
"I believe that, as regards the fight against terrorism, it is not necessary to dwell on links between Syria and organisations such as , and or on the direct aid that Syria provides them with."
"Since, over the years, the European Union has shown itself to be incapable of ensuring respect for the clause on human rights in all of the Association Agreements, it would be appropriate for Parliament to receive all the information from the Commission, before debating the issue, as to how it was possible to conclude an Association Agreement with a country such as Syria."
"Mr President, at Tel Aviv airport a document was handed over which seeks to prevent movement in the Palestinian occupied territories of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip."
"Those who want to go to the Palestinian Authority territories must obtain written authorisation and, without such, the Israeli authorities can – and I quote – ‘deport, arrest and prosecute those entering the autonomous areas’."
"This is, in my view, an extremely serious act and a breach of the sovereignty of the Palestinian Authority."
"The wall stops Palestinians from moving around: now it is the Israeli authorities that decide who Palestinians can meet or not; in other words, the jailers are granting authorisations to the prisoners."
"The same document was sent to European Union contractors and officials."
"I therefore call upon the President, the European Commission and the Council Presidency to intervene and to ask the Israeli authorities why they are restricting people’s movements in this way."
"I will pass on the document that has been received by various foreign citizens."
"Mr President, I wanted to speak about the polemics between the World Jewish Congress and the Commission of the European Union last week."
"My aim is not to reinforce those polemics but to point out that they had their origin in a report, which apparently has not yet been distributed by the European institutions, on a matter that is unfortunately only too real."
"That is the revival of anti-Semitism in a number of countries, France in particular, where Jewish children, because they are Jews, are harassed and persecuted every day by Arabs perniciously applying to them what is happening in the Middle East conflict."
"Mr President, I would like you to intervene to get this report distributed so that the seminars planned on this question can actually be arranged, and quickly, and the European Union can, in accordance with its powers, be true to the commitments it has given, in particular through our Parliament."
"Mr Nordmann, I believe that your expression of interest in transparency through publication is something that would commend itself to this House."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by reacting to Mr Titley's remarks."
"Firstly, I should like to say clearly that he has my wholehearted sympathy and solidarity."
"We do not know yet who is responsible for the inadmissible behaviour in question."
"He mentioned that the House hears Herri Batasuna praising terrorism."
"I should like to say to Mr Titley, that, as an honourable Member of this House, he has the Irish presidency right now."
"He can check all the records of this House and if he finds even one word praising terrorists in my speeches, he should say so."
"I do not think he will find anything."
"If there is proof of that, he should bring it before the Irish presidency."
"Mr President, Mr Gorostiaga has never condemned any of ETA’s attacks, whoever their victims have been."
"He has on occasions expressed regret when there have been deaths and he has always justified ETA’s terrorist actions."
"This is precisely what is known as an apology for terrorism and I would therefore like to express my solidarity with Mr Titley in relation to what has happened to him and what he has said today."
"Mr President, during the last plenary I asked for the House to observe one minute's silence for the needless death of children and other civilians in Iraq and Afghanistan as a result of bombings by the occupying forces and for this to take place at today's sitting."
"The President in the chair at that sitting told me that he would raise the matter with the Bureau."
"I should therefore like to know whether you discussed it and whether you raised the question of observing one minute's silence."
"Mr President, just before Christmas we had the annual Brussels pantomime, otherwise known as the Council of Fisheries Ministers, which deliberated on catch quotas for 2004, along with longer-term recovery measures for cod."
"For the second successive year the outcome for Scots coastal and island communities was a disaster."
"While increasing haddock quotas, which was welcome, the Council limited the Scots fleet to only 15 days at sea, and also restricted access to certain key areas."
"That is likely to bankrupt many boats."
"Incredibly the UK Government-led ministerial team actually volunteered Scotland for this suicidal package!"
"It is little wonder that many Scots have now completely lost faith in the CFP."
"I am calling on the European Commission to look again at this package and to accept that the unworkable and discriminatory nature of its regulation must be re-examined."
"Mr President, I am informed that on 29 December 2003, at approximately 2 a.m., the Casal Jaume I Cultural Centre in Russafa, a district of Valencia, was attacked by persons unknown."
"All Casal Jaume I centres are members of the Acció Cultural del País Valencià association, whose goals are to study, support and promote the cultural heritage of Valencia."
"Acció Cultural has more than 9 000 members."
"Many young people are also members of Casal Jaume I centres."
"The following day a press conference was held in the centre and the reporters could see the damage for themselves."
"The Secretary-General of Acció Cultural referred to 21 attacks since July 2001 on the Casal Jaume I centres in Valencia and the nearby towns of Llíria, Carlet, Sueca and Vila-Real."
"Even the headquarters of the Bloc Nacionalista Valencià party has been attacked."
"In Valencia, there is continuing violence against parties and associations promoting and supporting cultural heritage and progressive values."
"All those attacks have been reported to the police."
"Violence is now on the increase; some people have been threatened, others attacked."
"To date, the response of the government has been inadequate."
"Mr President, I am sure that you and the whole House will join me in expressing our distress and condolences with regard to the 21 Albanians who lost their lives when their boat was shipwrecked recently near Vlora, off the Albanian coast."
"As we rightly strive to develop common European policies for asylum and, in parallel, common policies for Europe for legal immigration, this tragedy and other similar ones have drawn yet further attention to the need for the EU to be constantly aware of the less prosperous states around it and to do ever more to support those countries, of which Albania is just one example."
"Mr President, I am sorry to have to make yet another complaint about Air France."
"On this occasion it concerns embarkation."
"We used to leave through terminal 2D, where there are plenty of security machines and things ran smoothly, but for the last two months we have been leaving from terminal 2B, where there is one small security machine."
"Today it took an average of 40 to 45 minutes to get through."
"I am really speaking on behalf of some very stressed-out passengers from the Interpretation Service and for staff who were in tears at the thought they might not get on the plane."
"Members who went to the lounge and were called at the appropriate moment in fact found they had to queue for 40 minutes."
"The plane was then very late in leaving."
"Could you perhaps ask that these facilities be improved?"
"I was on that plane, Mr Corrie, and I will indeed take up correspondence."
"2b or not 2b: that is the question we need to raise!"
"Mr President, I wish to bring the attention of this Assembly to recent studies on the effects of climate change in particular, which were published in the scientific journal ."
"They document a massive loss of species, both plant and animal, as a result of climate change."
"The golden toad is the most memorable of these species, although probably not the most deserving."
"In the light of this, I should like to ask Commissioner de Palacio to retract comments she made in December on the death of the Kyoto Treaty and request that she seek to revive that Treaty and redouble her efforts in getting Russia to join."
"The Commissioner can take note of that."
"For the record, I believe that your co-president has already raised this question in the House, and that it was answered comprehensively – and denied – by the Commissioner on that occasion."
"Later she may wish to make a brief remark."
"We will not have a debate now."
"The Commissioner heard your point and can respond appropriately."
"I can assure you that we checked on that day that the comments we ascribe to the Commissioner were accurate."
"Mr Prodi did not deny those comments."
"He simply said that the Kyoto Treaty was important and would be pursued."
"I would like the Commissioner herself to state what exactly she did or did not say."
"When we come to the report on air safety the Commissioner may wish to make a brief digression."
"However, I will not call on the Commissioner at this time."
"Mr President, my honourable friend Mr Patakis raised what is, in my opinion, a serious matter a short while ago."
"He had already called at the last session of Parliament for the House to observe one minute's silence in memory of the 16 children killed by the American invaders in Afghanistan at the beginning of December and in memory of the thousands of other civilian victims of the interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq."
"The President in the chair assured him that he would notify you."
"Today my honourable friend Mr Patakis reiterated this request."
"From time to time, Parliament observes a minute's silence for various victims, even victims between invaders."
"I think that basic compassion, Mr President, demands that my honourable friend's request be accepted."
"The request is noted."
"The next item is the Commission statement on air safety and the EU-US agreement on the transmission of personal data relative to transatlantic flights."
"Mr Gorostiaga, this is not a debate."
"I always try to accommodate Members – you included."
"If you wish to make any other remarks you will have to take them up bilaterally with colleagues."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, over recent days we have had too many occasions to take an interest in the problem of safety in air transport."
"And before dealing with the issue of transatlantic flights, I too would like to express my condolences in relation to the terrible accident involving the Flash Airlines aircraft on 3 January in which 148 people died, the majority of whom were European citizens."
"I am sure that we all share the feelings of the families involved."
"But first of all I would like to point out that once again we must wait for the conclusions of the investigation in order to know exactly under what circumstances it took place."
"Over recent years, air safety has been one of the main concerns and tasks for the Commission, for myself and for the whole of the Transport Directorate-General."
"It is a field in which we have made clear progress: we have approved the Directive on the notification of accidents in civil aviation; we have approved the creation of the European Air Safety Agency, which is now operational; we have approved the rules on the certification and maintenance of aircraft which that Agency must apply and we have also made progress on the ‘Single Sky’ initiative, which is an element which must improve safety in the European air sector."
"Unfortunately, these measures are not all relevant – and I do not know whether it is unfortunate – to the case in question."
"We are talking here about a different case."
"There was knowledge of certain problems with the aircraft – for example the incidents which took place when it was diverted for technical reasons to Athens airport – and it was natural to imagine that they would have been registered in the database provided for in the directive you approved last year, but it must be said that that directive will not enter into force for a year."
"With regard to the Air Safety Agency, which since 28 September has been operational, its responsibility with regard to national certification competences is restricted to aircraft registered in the Community, in other words, those which have a Community flag, and therefore does not cover aircraft such as those of Flash Airlines."
"In accordance with the Chicago Convention, it is the flag State – the State in which the aircraft are registered – which is responsible for those aircraft complying with international safety rules, all under the supervision of the International Civil Aviation Organisation."
"Nevertheless, the States retain the possibility of checking that third-country aircraft arriving in their territory respect these rules."
"In order to facilitate this monitoring, in 1996 the States of the Union and certain European third countries created a system for inspecting aircraft and for exchanging the corresponding information, known as SAFA, within the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC)."
"The European Commission co-funds this programme and participates in it as an observer."
"It is this programme which has allowed for the exchange of information on the six inspections carried out by France, Germany and Poland following by the Swiss prohibition of the Flash Airlines Boeing 737."
"Nevertheless, although around 3 000 inspections are carried out each year, nothing guarantees that each State of the Union carries them out and how they are carried out."
"Furthermore, this system guarantees neither the approval of collective measures nor, above all, the transparency of inspections and measures and, furthermore, lacks sanction mechanisms against States which do not comply with the rules."
"Furthermore, I believe that this lack of transparency is prejudicial to the companies which most respect the safety rules and since that respect is not known and the greater quality of the most serious companies is not known, it offers opportunities to those which are less serious."
"On the other hand, greater transparency would mean that everybody knows where things stand and clearly the passenger, the consumer, could choose, and would naturally choose maximum safety."
"The Commission is aware of the shortcomings in the current organisation of the inspection system for aircraft."
"And I would like to point out that, as a consequence of an accident similar to the Flash Airlines accident, which took place in 1996 in Puerto Plata, in the Dominican Republic, on a flight operated by a Turkish charter company on behalf of a German travel agency, the Commission presented a proposed directive in 1997 on the control of third-country aircraft which land at Community airports."
"I would like to point out that the Commission also presented a modified proposal on this text in January 2002 which essentially took up the 1997 text with corrections which improved on the text and which, furthermore, allowed it to be adopted speedily."
"As the honourable Members are aware, we are currently in the conciliation phase, which I hope will move forward in the coming days, and the Flash Airlines accident demonstrates the extent to which this text is absolutely essential and urgent: firstly, it is clear that the time limit for transposing the directive must be as short as possible – recent events demonstrate this – and that we must not exceed the usual two years for the incorporation of directives into national law."
"It will be incomprehensible to everybody if following what has just happened there are further delays on the part of the States of the Union on this issue."
"With regard to the annual report to be published by the Commission, I believe that it should be made available to all interested parties."
"It should provide the necessary data for the choice of air companies by tour operators in order to encourage them to take even more interest in safety issues."
"Naturally, the data in this report can only reflect the reality at a given time and does not always allow us to draw general conclusions on the safety or lack of safety of an aircraft or aircraft in general of a specific company."
"Nevertheless, the British initiative to publish a list of companies which may not enter British air space demonstrates that, in any event, transparency is not only possible but that it is going to happen."
"And the Commission's report must be carried out and drawn up in the light of this aspect."
"The Commission supports Parliament’s proposal that when a measure is adopted by a State of the Union – following an inspection – it should apply to the whole of the Community."
"In that way, the attitude of the most rigorous state of the Union will become the attitude of the whole of the Union in relation to this type of aircraft."
"This accident does not just require an effort and a strengthening of the controls and the transparency of those controls."
"It also requires that we consider the need for greater discipline amongst tour operators with regard to information for passengers on the airline which is going to carry them and on the choice of that airline."
"It makes no sense that when one buys a package deal all types of information is given on the hotel, meals, and also sometimes sight-seeing trips, offers of supplementary activities etc., but there is usually no information on precisely which airline is going to operate the flight."
"I have asked the services of the Commission to study this issue, which I believe to be essential, as a matter of priority."
"This dramatic issue, Mr President, however, is not the only element which is going to lead to controversy and concern with regard to safety issues amongst the public in the civil aviation sector, since over Christmas we have all been aware of issues relating to suspensions of flights from European countries to the United States, with the corresponding problems and difficulties faced by all those passengers who had planned to take those flights."
"There is no question that the current situation justifies enhanced and more active cooperation with the American authorities in order to reinforce security aspects in view of the new terrorist risks."
"However, although we agree with these objectives, we are often faced with measures which are adopted unilaterally and, in this regard, I would like to say that we in the Commission have repeatedly informed the American authorities of the need to hold a dialogue and reach agreement prior to decision-making, which, furthermore, would not only facilitate the implementation of those decisions, but will also produce better results in view of the experience which certain States of the Union have had in this area, for better or for worse."
"The difficult negotiations carried out by Mr Bolkestein on the automatic transfer of personal data to the American authorities also demonstrate that in the end we can find solutions acceptable to both parties, although it takes longer and creates more difficulties."
"In this regard, I would like to say, on the subject of the transfer of data, that in December I had the opportunity to present the results of these negotiations to the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, together with Mr Vitorino, Mr Patten and Mr Bolkestein."
"As we pointed out at the time, we believe that the results obtained on the transfer and storage of personal data allow the Commission to prepare an adequacy finding, bringing it into line with the Directive on data protection, which will complement an initiative within the ICAO to create an international framework and adequate information for passengers."
"It must be made clear that the recent behaviour of our American friends and partners does not relate to these points."
"We must point out that the data which has led to certain difficulties were not the data which appear in the ‘Passenger Name Record’ (PNR) and that they are sufficiently detailed to prevent certain types of errors which have been made in this field."
"Although the justification for the cancellation of, for example, Air France and British Airways flights is not demonstrated , however, we must always be cautious in the face of terrorist threats and it is better to be overcautious than to be faced with an attack."
"I would also like to refer to another issue which has appeared in the media and which causes a degree of concern, and that is the presence of security personnel on board aircraft which fly to the United States, an issue which raises all sorts of problems."
"Firstly, I would like to point out that this issue is one for the Member States to deal with."
"The Community has no competence in this area. Secondly, I would like to point out that, regardless of the way the Commission had organised a meeting next 16 January, that is, at the end of this week, of the aviation group in which all the civil aviation directors of the States of the Union participate, this point will be added to the long list of issues on the agenda and will be discussed."
"Mr President, I will end by saying that what has happened recently demonstrates, firstly, that safety is a central aspect of air transport, and it is essential that we continue to ensure that it is maintained and strengthened."
"That safety must be dealt with in a global manner and it is not sufficient to talk about guarantees and safety for air companies from our territories, that is, European air companies and aircraft, because third-country aircraft also use our airports and huge numbers of our citizens travel on them."
"We therefore have to increase their safety and there is a margin to do so and I hope that there is agreement between Parliament and the Council on the issue of the safety of third-country aircraft."
"I would like to say finally that safety issues for preventing problems relating to terrorism in the civil aviation sector must be dealt with from the point of view of seeking the greatest possible safeguards and security for passengers and citizens."
"In any event, we must not forget that the number of air accidents has decreased over the last 10 years by 45 percent while air traffic has doubled."
"Nevertheless, since in 2003 there were 576 victims on commercial flights at world level, we must continue working to try to prevent this type of accident and to reduce them even more."
"Mr President, the incident with the Flash Airlines aircraft was indeed tragic and I happened to experience the tragedy of this incident personally, in that I was in France and saw the reactions of French society."
"I wish to point out that the European Parliament has good reason to feel satisfied about the fact that it has been aware of the issue of the safety of air transport for a long time now."
"Its stand on the question of the European Aviation Safety Agency, the EASA, is evidence of this awareness. We supported this endeavour right from the start and this year we voted in favour of all the items in the budget needed to staff this agency quickly."
"At the same time, in the Maes report on third country aircraft, which the Commission rightly took the initiative of promoting, Parliament took a strict approach from the outset, and I am delighted that Mrs de Palacio agreed today with the European Parliament's position on our differences with the Council on the conciliation procedure."
"It is very important, and I hope that the Council will take this on board, for the regulations introduced on this matter to be the right ones and for us to guarantee high safety standards, not just for our aircraft but also for third country aircraft flying to the European Union."
"Then, as you know, there is the safety issue which arose after the terrorist attack on 11 September."
"There are still problems here, but unfortunately, despite the talks held from time to time, it has proven impossible to address them correctly."
"I believe that, on the other side of the Atlantic, despite the fact that I understand their reaction, at the same time there is also an arrogant approach to Europe, an intention to deal with the problems unilaterally."
"I believe that we shall make it clear to the other side that we want to work together but, at the same time, we want to be on an equal footing with them, and the European Commission can help decidedly in this direction."
"– Mr President, as I have to take the chair, I have swapped with Mr Simpson, who will be speaking later on behalf of our group."
"Since early last year, the Americans have been demanding the handing over of passengers’ data before they join a flight; some of this information is of a highly personal nature."
"The US authorities planned to store this data for fifty years, with it being used not only to combat terrorism and potential dangers associated with it, but also, potentially, being made available to other security agencies as well."
"The threat was made that, if the airlines did not comply, they would have to pay heavy fines or risk losing their landing rights."
"Not only in this House did this call forth vehement criticisms, one in particular being that this was illegal, in that it is in flagrant breach of two items of European legislation, namely the Data Protection Directive and the Regulation on the handling of data in flight booking."
"This, as the Commissioner has said, prompted the Commission to take action."
"Where are we now?"
"The fifty years for which the data was to be stored have now become three and a half."
"We have managed to get limitations put on what is done with it."
"The data is to be used only in combating terrorism and crimes connected with it."
"The rules are to apply for three and a half years in the first instance, after which they are to be renegotiated, and not all the passenger information is to be handed over; the US authorities have, in particular, confirmed that the really personal and sensitive ‘special service information’ and that derived from the ‘special service request’ is to be deleted."
"Moreover, legal peace has been restored by the requirement for passengers’ prior consent, and the Commission will see to it that it is we who actively transmit the data – which means that we can also filter it – whereas, at present, it is still collected by the Americans; whilst this may well not, unfortunately, meet European data protection standards, it would be unfair to say that we had not achieved a great deal."
"I will end by pointing out to the Commissioner that I see the clause about expiry after three and a half years as being significant in the sense that there is always a tension between, on the one hand, the need to intervene in the private sphere and, on the other, the potential needs of internal security."
"If we are to consider extending this system beyond the three and a half years, it must, in that period, be demonstrated to produce real results."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Mrs de Palacio for her introduction."
"I will confine myself to the issue of flight data and the relationship with the United States."
"I should like to point out that, at present, the United States still receives unfiltered information."
"Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) 2299/89 and Article 26 of Directive 95/46/EC are still not being complied with."
"Meanwhile, as the Commissioner did point out, various flights have been cancelled on the basis of unfiltered information and in addition, the United States have asked for permission for the presence of armed security agents on flights."
"Furthermore, as the Commissioner stated, this last request, in particular, has met with very mixed reactions from various countries."
"I have to say, Commissioner, that all of this has not, in any case, resulted in a joint approach and that this is very confusing for passengers and airline companies alike."
"I therefore take the view that there is still neither adequate protection by the United States nor protection of the interests of air travellers and airline companies."
"Nor am I convinced that the agreement will offer sufficient guarantees."
"This is why I reiterate my desire for a permanent solution by means of an international agreement between the United States and Europe, with full involvement from the European Parliament and the US Congress, which would therefore be a weightier formula."
"I would also repeat my proposal with regard to the Commission, on the basis of Article 300(6) of the Treaty of Nice, to ask the ECJ to give advice on this agreement."
"If you fail to do so, I believe that Parliament itself should take on this responsibility."
"After all, this is about an international world standard, and we will need to maintain very high standards."
"I still fail to grasp, for example, how these decisions were taken on the basis of elements from the briefing, namely: the wider EU-US relationship, the safety and confidence of air travellers and the cost aspect of airline companies."
"Even following consultation with a Foreign Affairs Minister, or various Foreign Affairs Ministers, a unilateral decision was taken to cancel flights."
"How does this relate, for example, to international trade agreements?"
"In general, before we discuss the final agreement, which is in six weeks' time, I should also like to be told in what way cooperation between the European and American security authorities has been achieved."
"In short, I think that the signals that were given over the past month are an example of precisely how things should not be done, and I therefore hope to receive a clear answer now, or at least in response to my written questions."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the only words that are fitting for the terrible disaster of Sharm el-Sheikh are sadness and compassion and I want again to express my solidarity with the victims’ families and share in their grief."
"Obviously, it is impossible today to determine the causes of this accident and to say who was responsible."
"I am also aware that air transport is not without risks."
"No airline is immune from accidents."
"Having said that, we who carry political responsibility are involved, we have a particular responsibility because this accident has highlighted a number of questions that cannot be avoided."
"I would like, in the time that is given me, to go over those that seem to me the most important."
"The first question concerns States."
"Why did two States, France and Switzerland, take different decisions about the condition of aircraft belonging to the same airline?"
"Was it due to inadequate cooperation or inadequate controls?"
"How are the SAFA programmes applied?"
"Important as they are, they are no substitute for thorough technical controls."
"Information should be automatic and transparent, with mandatory inspection on the slightest suspicion."
"As things in fact stand, as you said, there are no sanctions for states that fail to carry out inspections."
"I share Mrs de Palacio’s concern that it should be possible for a particular or reinforced protection measure adopted by one Member State in order to ensure safety to be extended to the whole Community."
"The second question is concerned with the safety consequences of the liberalisation of air transport."
"As you said, Commissioner, it is a global problem."
"With the growth of charter flights and low-cost fliers, airlines are engaged in keen competition."
"Cost cutting is certainly involved, but on what terms is that possible?"
"There is a great temptation to cut back on training, maintenance or staff, and safety is threatened."
"Does not the European Union’s vaunted obsession with favouring the lowest economic cost in aviation help to make that the only regulator?"
"The third question has to do with checks on aircraft that are a safety risk."
"The proposed directive, which was again submitted in January 2002, has still not been adopted."
"We must demand strict safety guarantees for all aircraft using the Union’s airports, step up controls and further harmonise joint technical regulations, including those concerned with flight and rest times."
"The Council should stop prevaricating and really get down to much stricter and more transparent safety rules."
"Finally, if we are to be effective legislators, we must call on the industry’s professionals."
"Pilots, technicians and other professionals have irreplaceable experience in this field."
"It is very useful to listen to them."
"That is the reason for the initiative my group has taken for a hearing to be held here on Wednesday afternoon."
"I also want in a few words to give my opinion on the EU-US agreement on the transmission of data relative to transatlantic flights."
"For the fight against terrorism, data would be transmitted in 34 fields, including the racial origins, political opinions, religious convictions and state of health of passengers, whereas the national authorities competent for the protection of privacy had reduced that list to 19."
"Moreover, the US authorities want to pass that data to US surveillance networks."
"It seems to me that this agreement isolates the European data protection directive and, in the light of European legislation, I do not think we can agree to the transfer of this data."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, the accident involving the Egyptian aircraft has shocked people in Europe."
"The tragic death of these tourists, most of them French, has demonstrated that there are still insufficient safety measures in place."
"The public wants to know how it is possible, when safety regulations are international, widely known and should be widely applied, for an aircraft that is not allowed access to Swiss airspace to be allowed to fly in other European countries."
"The Commission took an initiative more than six years ago, and I am delighted that the Commissioner gave us another account of those events."
"Unfortunately, we are still waiting for the directive."
"A dispute about Gibraltar between Spain and the United Kingdom has held this directive up for years."
"After 11 September, and especially in view of the ensuing crisis in aviation, people have again begun to realise how very important safety is."
"As the rapporteur for the safety of aircraft from third countries, I am pleased with the promptness with which at least this Parliament has acted and has accepted a number of amendments at first and second reading which we still need to debate."
"I am delighted that the Commissioner has pledged her support to Parliament and I am convinced that the trialogue will be very fruitful."
"I hope that the Council's response will also be very positive."
"The most significant difference of opinion between the Commission and Council concerns information to the public."
"We thought that the Commission was rather reserved in this respect."
"As rapporteur, I take the view that we must ensure that every European citizen who boards a plane at one of our airports should have the certainty that this aircraft has been inspected according to the same standards and that regulations are also being complied with."
"This is why we need more European solutions."
"The European Aviation Safety Agency should also be able to play its role to the full so that our citizens can be informed."
"We must question whether keeping data anonymous is not a culpable omission at a specific point in time."
"I cannot accept that a company that is branded unsafe should not be made known to the public."
"I am sorry I had so little time, but I would like to thank the Commissioner and my fellow-Members for the support that they wish to express in the context of this report, and for the initiative they are taking."
"I will certainly come and listen."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I have listened most attentively to your statement on air safety in a context that is particularly difficult for France after the Sharm el-Sheikh disaster and I have heard your concerns."
"On my own behalf and on behalf of the members of the French delegation of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I want to express our most sincere condolences and our solidarity with the victims’ families."
"Since it has not yet been possible to analyse the aircraft’s black boxes, it would be irresponsible to draw premature conclusions about this tragedy."
"For the present, there is nothing tangible that would allow us to call into question either the condition of the aircraft, the professionalism of the Egyptian charter company FlashAirlines, the earnestness of the Egyptian civil aviation authority or the reliability of the technical controls that were carried out on that aircraft."
"From what we know at present, even the hypothesis of an attack cannot be ruled out completely, even if it seems highly unlikely."
"However, it seems to me essential that European users of air transport should be given every guarantee to reassure them."
"I would like to take advantage of this session, Commissioner, to pass on to you some of the most frequent questions concerning charter airlines in particular."
"Would it not be possible to require European tour operators to inform tourists who use their services of the precise identity of the airline they will be travelling with at the time they buy their tickets?"
"In order for European tour operators to be better assured of the level of safety of the airlines they work with, would it not also be desirable to go beyond the random checks that are currently made?"
"Would it not be advisable to recommend real in-depth technical audits of airlines that are not European but which are used by our tour operators?"
"Mr President, I will concentrate on the issue of civil aviation safety."
"I start by offering, on behalf of my Group, our condolences to the relatives and friends of all victims of aviation accidents, not just the recent one in Sharm el-Sheikh."
"I firmly believe, however, that aviation safety has to be put into perspective."
"The industry is the most regulated and has the best safety record of any mode of public transport."
"When you compare the record of aviation with the carnage that occurs on our roads, and when you consider that the number of air accidents is going down, whilst the number of road accidents is going up, then any discussion on aviation safety must take these facts into account."
"However, civil aviation must carry on improving its safety record."
"I wish to highlight four areas where improvements could be made."
"First there is a danger that a system similar to maritime transport's flags of convenience could creep into civil aviation."
"I hope EASA, the new safety agency, will urgently examine this."
"Member States need to increase their ramp inspections to weed out those airlines which are based in one country but register in another and have lower standards than we would expect within the European Union."
"Second, there is an urgent need for a Europe-wide harmonised system of operations by way of an EU-ops."
"This particular issue is all the more urgent with the impending enlargement of the European Union and would include matters such as flight and duty time for cockpit and cabin crew."
"Third, the whole issue of cabin safety needs to be addressed, particularly the number of emergency exits, the amount of cabin baggage – try getting on the Air France flight today from Paris, for example! – and the use of sky marshals."
"Fourth, there is a need to reform the existing package travel directive which is now not only outdated, but ineffectual and allows some airlines to offer packages without being covered by the directive."
"This Parliament, with the help of the Commission, has worked long and hard to improve aviation safety and we have had some success."
"There are still areas where more progress needs to be made."
"However, I repeat that aviation is the safest form of public transport and accidents, however tragic, are thankfully rare."
"The House would do well to await the results of any official investigations before jumping to conclusions that can often be misguided and wrong."
"– Mr President, I too should like to express my condolences in respect of the victims of the aircraft accident in Egypt."
"People are concerned; in my region, too, there is an airport that apparently has been, or is being, used by this airline company, so it is obvious that we need to know whether the assessment of all aircraft that fly in the EU is positive or not."
"We have Mrs Maes’ report on third-country aircraft, in which, fortunately, we demand such things as our own inspections, the possibility of keeping aircraft on the ground and of exchanging information between Member States."
"We have now reached the conciliation stage, and I hope that we can make use of this conciliation to tighten things up to some extent."
"One of the questions that arose after the accident in Egypt is: what do we tell the public, what is intended for the public domain?"
"It is clear that the Council has toned down the questions that Parliament had on that score."
"I would like to ask the Council, in the light of recent events, to revisit this issue."
"It is evident that we do not throw just any piece of information into the public domain, for then it will lead a life of its own."
"If, however, an airline company is banned from a country, surely people are entitled to know this, so that they can avoid using this airline in future."
"I think that we should have clear rules in this respect."
"I have read that a law is to be adopted in France according to which tour operators are to be required to tell customers which company will be used for the trip, so that people know with whom they are flying."
"I think that passengers have a right to this, and if there were to be an imputation in respect of a company, then customers can establish that link themselves."
"Why could that not become EU law?"
"I have also read that the American Federal Aviation Administration is examining the quality of inspections in third countries, or what Mr Simpson termed the role of the flag state."
"This reminds me of safety in shipping."
"Do we actually have control over the quality of the flag state?"
"Could we not do what the Americans are doing?"
"I think that the quality offered by ICAO is sound, but we should apply our own systems and do as the Americans are doing."
"It is, in my view, not a bad idea for us as Europeans to go and have a look over there whether the quality standards are being respected."
"Finally, I have read that there are quite a few differences between national inspections, and that one country is somewhat stricter than the other, or at least makes assessments on a different basis."
"I should like to see flight bans established everywhere on the same basis – after all, one flight ban can be too strict, while another not strict enough."
"In any case, we now have a European Aviation Safety Agency, and it might be useful if an independent audit were to be carried out on the different ways in which Member States assess the safety of aircraft."
"I hope – Commissioner, Mr President, Mrs Maes and other Members who were involved in this conciliation – that we can use the conciliation procedure relating to your report in order to ensure that the points which Parliament pressed home in the light of recent events – and unfortunately, our decision-making is often, if not too often, disaster-driven – will be emphasised."
"Mrs Maes, I hope that you, together with the Members of this House, will be able to salvage a few things yet."
"Commissioner, Mr President, the Sharm el-Sheikh disaster will hang over aviation for a long time."
"We share the victims’ pain, but there is more!"
"I think many French people, many Europeans have identified with the victims because they express part of our way of life."
"We try to break with the everyday, and to do so we travel far."
"We look for a change of scenery, sunshine in winter, and for that you have to go a long way."
"And then we look for cheap services, and for that, too, you have to go a long way."
"If we want this freedom or this mobility to last, then we shall have to increase air safety and be more strict, as we are over safety in other sectors."
"As a result, this air safety is going to become a top priority again because that, at least, is something over which we can and must have some control."
"Of course, we need first of all to know the causes of the accident."
"There is a lot of talk about them at the moment, but they are not really known."
"I think that is a necessity for all of us, even if for some the priority is to find someone to blame."
"A long time ago, in 1996, the Commission presented a proposal following the crash of an aircraft belonging to a Turkish airline."
"Nothing came of it because some States, Spain and the United Kingdom at the time, were in dispute over Gibraltar."
"Since then, an Aviation Safety Agency has been set up, but it cannot encroach on States’ air traffic control, and some of these States, France in particular, often use the pretext of their sovereignty to curb its activities."
"Another text has been under discussion since 2002."
"I hope that this time it will be agreed quickly and that the recent accident will speed us towards a solution."
"Lists have been made of rust-bucket ships."
"We must now do the same for aircraft."
"If some need to be done away with, let us make a list of them, Commissioner."
"Finally, like others before me I would like to stress that yes, it is wrong that a passenger who buys a charter ticket does not know which airline he will be flying with. We cannot demand labelling and traceability standards for GMOs but at the same time not worry about them for aircraft."
"Labelling and traceability are necessary in aviation as well."
"Mr President, to date two stringent Parliament resolutions have been allowed to jeopardise European citizens’ fundamental right to protection of personal data."
"US agencies can directly access data on the flight passenger list with no guarantee that the permission of those concerned will be asked, and with no guarantee of their right to have detailscorrected, or that they will have recourse to a lawyer or an independent authority."
"There are no guarantees on the duration and the purpose of authorising data and, despite the efforts made by the Commission, the prospects for the future are not encouraging: the data of millions of European citizens who book trips to America will, therefore, be kept for years in US databases."
"In what way, though, will keeping all their credit card data enhance our security? How are we going to deny other countries something tomorrow that we are today granting to the US?"
"We called for reciprocity as regards citizens’ rights, but the Commission is instead, rather ironically, proposing reciprocity in the exchange of data between security agencies."
"Let us be careful."
"If monitoring becomes the norm instead of an exception, if a majority is under suspicion instead of an individual and if all citizens become suspects, then we are heading towards a worrying future."
"Mr President, first of all I wish to thank Mrs de Palacio for her efforts to promote air safety."
"I agree with what she has said."
"I also wish to express my sympathy for the families of the victims of the air accident at el-Sheikh in Egypt before concentrating on the sensitive aspects of the discussions with the United States on air safety."
"The Commission deserves all credit for its fight to defend privacy in the negotiations with the United States concerning the air passenger lists."
"Some of us in the delegation for relations with the United States were there in the US and discussed these issues."
"We know, in particular, how incredibly difficult it is to get the United States to achieve an, in our view, fair and considered balance between combating terrorism and defending human rights."
"The outcome of the negotiations is, in some respects, successful and, in others, unsatisfactory."
"The United States has, however, made major concessions."
"The fact that it is possible to store information for three and a half years is positive from an American perspective."
"From a European perspective, it is, however, barely acceptable."
"In this case, it is, however, also a question of creating efficient contacts between the EU and the United States so that business, trade and aviation can thrive and develop."
"In the light of this, it is very important to find a solution that does not put a complete stop to these contacts at the very moment when the economy is in the process of improving."
"I wish, however, to warn against contagion."
"Three and a half years must not constitute a model for the EU when we proceed with our own legislation on data protection and combating crime."
"In Europe, we have stronger protection for human rights than the United States does, especially when it comes to protecting privacy."
"That protection is something of which we should be proud."
"When we in the EU develop our own measures to combat terrorism – in many cases similar to, but not identical with, those adopted by the United States – we must defend our protection of privacy."
"Cooperation and coordination with the United States on these issues is certainly necessary, but we cannot abandon our own principles concerning human rights."
"Who wishes to see European aviation include armed marshals and requirements to have finger prints taken?"
"The agreement must fall if the United States does not comply with the protection of human rights."
"We cannot afford, in either financial or human terms, to make room for woolly interpretations by one side or the other."
"In this area, the Commission must, on every point, be given clear assurances on interpretation and compliance."
"A broader international agreement on air safety may be a step on this road too."
"Mr President, I support the British initiative to highlight those airlines that are not allowed into UK airspace."
"At this time we cannot presume that the recent air accident in Egypt was caused by mechanical failure."
"It is therefore prudent for us to await the accident investigation report."
"However, I agree with the Commission that travel agents and tour operators should inform passengers more fully about the airlines which are part of their holiday package."
"Perhaps we can do something about that."
"There must also be a far better means of exchange of information, whether it be through the International Civil Aviation Organization, the EU or Member States."
"In addition, I believe that the Maes Report on ramp checks, which is coming to its conclusion, should address some of the issues."
"With regard to the transfer of data, we should remember that 3 000 people lost their lives in those horrendous attacks on 11 September, and many of them were from the European Union."
"So it is not surprising that the Americans reacted in the way they did."
"Having said that, I fully welcome the outcome of the negotiations attended by Commissioners Bolkestein and de Palacio."
"The conclusions drawn from those negotiations are extremely positive, not least, in my view, in relation to the information on collection and storage."
"Hopefully that should satisfy Parliament."
"I agree that better cooperation between the US and the EU could probably solve problems before they arise."
"I would therefore urge the United States not to act unilaterally."
"I think we can do things better."
"With regard to the suspension and delay of flights over the Christmas and New Year period, they were clearly decisions that had to be made by national governments."
"In my view, it is therefore necessary to look again at the Lisi Report, which has just gone through Parliament, as regards current non-reference to matters coming under ."
". Thank you, Mr President."
"I would like to thank the honourable Members for their speeches and, firstly, I would like to thank Mrs Maes for the work she is doing as rapporteur on the safety of third-country aircraft."
"I hope that we can have a conciliation quickly and that this accident will serve to make us speed up and overcome certain reservations and difficulties which arose in the Council in relation to the points which I referred to earlier, whether those relating to speedy transposition into national laws or those relating to greater transparency with regard to the stringency and quality of safety and the state of maintenance of the aircraft by the different air companies operating in the European Union."
"I believe that there is a middle ground between Parliament’s initial proposal – which was perhaps too exhaustive – and not providing any information at all, and clearly the Commission supports, as I said in my first speech, an increase in transparency regarding the true situation of the aircraft of air companies, that is to say, stringency in the monitoring of safety standards."
"As well as this issue, I would like to refer very briefly to the fact that there are certain issues which have yet to be promoted over the next few years, but the implementation of the European Civil Aviation Safety Agency is an extremely important step forward."
"When we adopt this legislation on third-country aircraft, we will be taking an extremely important step forward."
"Within the International Civil Aviation Organisation we must strengthen its controls, since, in principle, the control of how activities are carried out in the different States with regard to their aircraft falls to the International Civil Aviation Organisation."
"In other words, it would not be a question of the European Civil Aviation Agency going to a third country to check how they carry out their work and their controls there."
"This task falls to the International Civil Aviation Organisation."
"It is a different thing for the European Union to have competence to ensure that the aircraft which land in our territory comply with the requirements and that we control how the requirements are complied with by those aircraft."
"We must take an additional step forward, so that, at Community level, there are common rules, to the effect that if a country prohibits overflight or landing by certain aircraft, that that rule should be extended to the whole of the European Union’s airspace."
"That if a country detects a particular kind of problem in a specific aircraft, it will be obligatory for that information to be distributed and passed on to all the countries of the Union; and also that there be common rules on the way in which those controls are carried out, on the percentage and on the system."
"We must reach agreements which guarantee that the whole of the Union takes appropriate measures and that they are applicable throughout our airspace."
"The next point which has arisen is the transfer of passenger data to the United States."
"I would like to clarify something which Mrs Ainardi has said, and that is that the United States are not requesting the sensitive information the honourable Member has mentioned."
"The information classed as sensitive in accordance with the Directive on data protection in Europe – health, religion and so on – is not being requested by the United States. This is what the honourable Member must be aware of."
"It is not that information which is going to be communicated."
"The next issue relates to the communication of data."
"I can tell honourable Members that we have reached an agreement which the Commission believes provides for protection of the privacy of our citizens, because, as has been said before – I believe it was Mr Poignant – there is tension between the ‘safety’ component and the ‘privacy’ component."
"We must resolve the tension between the two elements in an appropriate and balanced way."
"We have reached an agreement – amongst other things, thanks to this Parliament, let us make this very clear – which in the end includes a series of guarantees which the European Union was demanding – a reduction in the amount of data, the type of data, a restriction in terms of the objective for which they will be used, a restriction of the time for which they can be used, in other words, all the elements which the honourable Members are perfectly aware of – which means that we can say that, by means of this agreement, the fundamental rights which our legislation affords our citizens are guaranteed, also in terms of the way the United States uses the information, while at the same time we are helping and cooperating in the improvement of safety in the air sector and the fight against international terrorism."
"I believe that all of this responds essentially to the elements which have been raised here."
"I would like once again to thank this Parliament for its cooperation in the different steps we have taken."
"I believe they have been extremely important."
"We can bring them to a conclusion speedily through this Directive on the safety of third-country aircraft, and, ladies and gentlemen, I would like once again to express our condolences for the victims and say that we must continue to work to improve safety in the air sector, firstly, naturally, in European airspace, in relation to aircraft which leave Europe for other places, but also at world level, because, however much information we provide – and naturally we must do so, to increase transparency in the information tour operators give their clients, stating which company is going to provide the transport, stating exactly which companies they work with – this is important and will improve safeguards and information for our citizens and our passengers, and there can be no doubt that we – Europeans or non-Europeans – must fight to improve safety in air traffic and in international civil aviation."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"- A5-0388/2003 by Mr Pex, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on ship-source pollution and on the introduction of sanctions, including criminal sanctions, for pollution offences (COM(2003) 92 – C5-0076/2003 – 2003/0037(COD));"
"- A5-0413/2003 by Mr Poignant, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on the transfer of cargo and passenger ships between registers within the Community (COM(2003) 478 – C5-0366/2003 – 2003/0180(COD)); and"
"- A5-0373/2003 by Mr Di Lello Finuoli, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council framework decision to strengthen the criminal law framework for the enforcement of the law against ship-source pollution (COM(2003) 227 – C5-0244/2003 – 2003/0088(CNS))."
". Mr President, a moment ago we talked about air safety."
"Now we are going to talk about maritime safety."
"The package we are going to discuss today constitutes the penultimate phase and naturally supplements the work carried out over the last four years."
"I would like to remind the honourable Members that, in December 1999, we faced the accident, a tragedy which you are all well aware of; then we had the accident."
"As a result of these two accidents, the citizens of the different European countries have looked to Europe and demanded responses."
"We have taken many very important steps, and I believe we can safely say that during this legislature there has been a revolution in maritime safety in the European Union and a spectacular improvement in the guarantees of protection for our coasts and our citizens."
"Today, Europe can say that it has a system which is at least equivalent to those of the best protected countries in the world, and now there is no country in the world with more stringent measures, unlike the situation four and a half years ago."
"The risks and the seas are different, but we finally have a genuinely ambitious and appropriate system."
"We must continue to make progress and today we are going to debate a fundamental element in the mechanism to combat and prevent the pollution caused by ships, namely the system of sanctions for pollution offences for which a part of the directive establishes a framework, and then there is the instrument in the criminal field."
"In March 2003, the Commission presented its proposed directive on ship-source pollution and the introduction of sanctions, including of a criminal nature, for pollution offences."
"Through this proposed directive, the Commission intends to essentially achieve three objectives: firstly, to define within Community law the concept of the illegal dumping of polluting substances in the sea; the proposal intends to incorporate into our legislation the provisions of the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships, that is, the Marpol Convention."
"Secondly, to guarantee that the people responsible for illegal dumping – not just captains and ship owners, but also charterers and classification societies, which in some cases be responsible for these actions – may be prosecuted and also be subject to penalties in certain circumstances."
"And, thirdly, precisely defining the conditions under which responsibility may be established for each of the parties involved; the Commission believes that criminal responsibility may be established when spills are intentional and also, in the event of an accident, if the spill is due to serious negligence."
"In other words, intention and serious negligence."
"As the honourable Members know, in May last year, the Commission also presented a proposed framework Decision on pollution from ships."
"This second proposal supplements the proposed Directive and essentially regulates the criminal aspects, that is, harmonisation in the field of sanctions and issues of judicial cooperation on criminal matters."
"Now, the principle of incrimination and the imposition of the corresponding sanction must be established legally and, in the Commission’s view, by means of the directive, which, in accordance with the Treaties in their current form, is the only genuinely effective instrument for truly incorporating sanctions into the law of all the Member States and will therefore be an effective deterrent."
"The three objectives I have referred to are clear, viable and, in our view, inescapable."
"Nevertheless, for certain Members States, the proposed Directive which is currently on the table goes too far: they see its objectives as overly ambitious."
"The Council has not yet laid out its position in this regard, but I have heard the doubts of the majority of ministers, who are not convinced that we should continue along this route."
"Some have the clear intention of greatly reducing the ambitions contained in the Commission’s proposed Directive."
"I must confess that the work in the Council is a great disappointment to me."
"The work is moving very slowly and the delay has meant that we cannot respond either to the expectations of our fellow citizens or to the demands of the Heads of State or Government, who had called for Parliament and the Council to adopt this Directive before the end of 2003."
"I am convinced that I can once again count on the support of this House."
"The position Parliament adopts will be a determining factor and will contribute to moving the situation forwards."
"I will now move on to the third issue, relating to the transfer of ships between European Union registers."
"As well as the aspects relating to criminalisation – the treatment or punishment of certain actions in the field of sea pollution and dumping – we are going to discuss the transfer of cargo and passenger ships between Community registers."
"Twelve years after the adoption of the current regulation, it is urgent – in accordance with our experiences and within the context of the imminent enlargement of our Community fleet – to update the oldest text of our acquis in the field of maritime safety."
"According to the current regulation, only cargo ships can be included under certain conditions in the intended system."
"And the main objective of the Commission's proposal is for passenger ships also to benefit from quick transfer between the registers of Community States in a manner which is less burdensome for our operators, thereby improving the operation of the sector and making it more competitive."
"This will obviously be carried out while maintaining the high level of maritime safety resulting from the international conventions in this area."
"In addition to this objective, the proposal intends to improve the circulation of information amongst maritime administrations in the States of the Union to better coordinate the system applicable to transfers between registers with the Community acquis, particularly with the Directives on controls by the port state and classification societies which we have adopted in the packages."
"The debate in the Council has demonstrated the consensus which exists on the need to strengthen their current system of change of register."
"The modifications contained in the text of the Council’s general guidelines of 5 December 2003 contribute to defining the scope of the Regulation and, by coordinating it better with the detention and denial of access procedures in the Directive on control by the port state."
"The Commission fully agrees with these proposals."
"Mr President, with these two packages of measures, we are taking a final step in improving and strengthening maritime safety within the European Union, an area in which I believe we have made considerable progress during this legislature."
"I would like once again to thank this Parliament for its systematic support for the measures we have been proposing and also for its cooperation and contribution of positive proposals throughout this time."
". – Mr President, it is a striking coincidence that this afternoon should find us discussing air and maritime safety."
"Only this afternoon, Mr Pex, together with Mr Doorn and Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, three members of the Dutch delegation, boarded a small plane whose brakes failed and which subsequently collided with a hangar, as a result of which he cannot make it here on time."
"I have been asked for that reason to present his contribution to the House."
"When I therefore talk about 'me', I am talking on behalf of Mr Pex, who, incidentally, is doing fine."
"It is of major importance that the discharge of oil at sea should be prevented."
"Disasters cause significant discharges, which are, with good reason, given a great deal of attention."
"Illegal discharges, however, from vessels other than tankers, also constitute a major problem, especially because they occur frequently and are rarely traced."
"In the few cases when discharges are traced, there are very few prosecutions, and hardly any punishment."
"That is a perplexing situation."
"The draft directive that is currently under discussion should rectify this situation without delay."
"There are sufficient rules internationally to address the situation."
"The problem is, however, that Member States flout the rules to which they have committed themselves in treaties."
"The solution is to include internationally valid discharge regulations in Community law and make provisions for enforcement rules."
"Infringements must be given the character of offences in respect of which it must also be possible to prosecute according to criminal law."
"Further to the disaster involving the , Heads of Government have asked on two occasions, namely on 21 March and 13 December of 2002, strict measures to be introduced before the end of 2003."
"The Commission submitted a sound proposal on time, which I – Mr Pex – have been able to correct with the help of fellow Members from the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, along with the co-advisory committees via a number of amendments."
"I thank the Commission and the fellow Members for the pleasant collaboration."
"I would like to make a few observations regarding the proposal."
"The European rules must apply to all illegal discharges on inland waterways and at sea, both inside and outside of the territorial waters."
"It is important not only to be critical the shipping crew, but also mainly the ships' owners and the authorities on land."
"A common European coast guard is desirable in order to trace discharges more effectively and for the authorities to act more quickly and more adequately."
"For both this coast guard and the already established European Maritime Agency (EMSA), it is important to have sufficient powers to enhance safety at sea."
"Ten amendments have been tabled in respect of the text of my report that has been approved by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism."
"Of these ten, I am happy to adopt the two technical amendments tabled by Mr Sterckx, because their intention is to clarify the text."
"As I have already stated, the introduction of criminal sanctions is a good instrument."
"Unfortunately, the self-same Council that requested them, is now not prepared to accept this proposal, because it is believed that criminal law falls within the remit of the third pillar."
"Although I as rapporteur have tried to work together with the Council, because the prompt introduction of the measures is conducive to safety at sea, the Council cried off."
"It appears that in those circles, discussions of principle take precedence over safety at sea."
"In other words, the Council's conduct leaves something to be desired."
"The Heads of Government who have asked for measures on two occasions should take action to make swift introduction still possible."
"It would be preferable if this were done now rather than when a new disaster occurs, which Heaven forbid."
"On behalf of Mr Pex, I am able to say: ‘I have spoken’."
"Mr President, Commissioner, it is true that our legislature will have seen important steps forward in maritime safety and I would like to congratulate the Commission on its work."
"For me, the duty, or rather the right, to criticise you when necessary goes hand in hand with the duty to congratulate you when appropriate."
"And so far as safety at sea is concerned, I think the Commission has performed its task well and served the European general interest."
"While this report is not the greatest of all reports, it must nevertheless be seen as one of the achievements of the last four years."
"Having said that, the task has not been completed and you only have to read the Sterckx report to see how much a new legislature will be necessary in order to complete the work."
"However that may be, the starting point is simple: every vessel has a flag that belongs to a country, since there is no European flag."
"A move was made in that direction 15 years ago, but nothing ever came of it."
"The first text on changing registers goes back more than 10 years."
"The Commission proposal and the accompanying report by Parliament seek to adapt to the new situation, because a lot of water has flowed under the bridge since then."
"Like the Commission text, this report has three main thrusts."
"Firstly, it includes passenger ships."
"They were not included in the first directive for the reason given at the time, namely that the rules differed greatly from one State to another."
"That is why our committee and Parliament did not include passenger ships in the text at that time."
"Since then, however, a lot of important decisions have been taken – I am thinking in particular of the SOLAS convention – a lot of improvements have been made, rules have been aligned on many points, and it therefore seems appropriate now to include passenger ships in the regulation."
"The second thrust of the report involves a very similar argument, since it is about coordinating Community instruments in the area of maritime safety, in short integrating all the legislation that has been adopted piecemeal, in particular the packages known as Erika I and Erika II."
"Finally, the third thrust seeks to increase cooperation between national maritime authorities."
"These are therefore the three thrusts of my report, which, of course, correspond to those of the Commission proposal."
"While it is important to complete these reforms, it is also because Europe is about to grow and enlarge to take in ten new states."
"May I remind you that we are, indeed, about to welcome 10 States, but two in particular are island States with very large fleets, Malta and Cyprus, and it seems a good idea to get these rules settled before 1 May 2004."
"That is why the text should be adopted after just one reading in Parliament, as we did for single hulls at the time, so as not to lose time but to make maritime safety the objective rather than fighting over pure and simple questions of procedure, the idea being to find the most intelligent compromise, or at the very least the least stupid one possible."
"A number of amendments have been tabled by the Council, and your rapporteur proposes that they be adopted since they do not change the substance of the text."
"Some are technical changes, for example, specifying the ships to which the regulation does not apply, warships in particular."
"Some amendments also allow States to apply rules different from those of the SOLAS convention provided they are no less strict, while other amendments require each State to present an annual report and insist on the first of them to facilitate the implementation of the regulation."
"The most important demand comes from the Commission, which is insisting that, unlike other vessels, a vessel that has been detained more than once following an inspection in a port during the three years preceding the application for change of register should not be able to benefit from a simplified procedure."
"In short, it is a precaution for ships that have shown a number of weaknesses when controls were carried out."
"One of our colleagues has tabled an amendment seeking to have the emblem of the Union appear on the flag that changes register."
"I think that is a nice symbolic amendment and our committee voted in favour, but the Council does not want to adopt the amendment because it would only apply to vessels changing register and not to all of them."
"I am willing to abandon it, but I hope that one day the emblem of the Union will appear on our vessels’ flags so that, while the national flag will still appear, the little corner of Europe, too, will cross the seas of the globe."
"That, ladies and gentlemen, is the essence of this report and I hope it will have your backing."
". Mr President, Commissioner de Palacio, – both of you fortunately Spanish – on this very important point, the in December 1999 and the in November 2002 have already been mentioned as two disasters that were followed by all words and no action, though certainly not from the Commission who – as has already been said – did in fact do a great deal."
"What we deplore is, instead, that there is still no overall legislation on protection of the environment through criminal law and, in fact, the conflict between the Council and the Commission, with the well-known subsequent appeal to the Court of Justice has crushed hopes, at least for us environmentalists."
"On the other hand, in the specific area of maritime pollution – this has already been said, and there is no need to repeat it – the proposal for a directive is extremely worthy of praise, as was Mr Pex’s work, which made considerable improvements to it."
"I believe, however, that this directive will only have an impact if there is the political will to enforce it, especially because recent history teaches us that European Union directives are almost always disregarded by Member States."
"The real issue is the lack of will on the part of Member States to respect these provisions and the fact that, I am sorry to say, immediate corrective action has to be taken today when there have been terrible disasters."
"The proposed framework decision is merely a complementary decision to the directive."
"There is an excellent agreement, and it is, therefore, necessary that both are welcomed by Parliament with all the amendments tabled which are, in my view, excellent, although I have some reservations as regards the European Coastguard, since the sketchy proposal for this body gives us some cause for concern."
"The substance of this directive does, however, go in the right direction although it must be made clear that this will not be enough unless there is an overall framework to protect the environment in general and without which maritime protection will continue to be granted a lower level of protection."
"We need to return to overall community legislation on the environment as a whole and I believe that the Council should be reasonable and adopt the proposal for a directive on protection of the environment through criminal law, which, I repeat, was blocked by an appeal to the Court of Justice."
"This would be an excellent step because we would have adequate maritime protection, which would, however, be within the framework of environmental protection that could be equally protected at a criminal level, since there is no doubt that criminal sanctions are most likely to make workers in the sector adapt to provisions."
"In my view, this directive goes in the right direction and does some justice to all the workers because it will bring many workers under full control that were hitherto excluded."
"We know very well that international conventions excluded from liability ship-owners and a whole range of people who were, in actual fact, directly and indirectly responsible, and we saw proof of this with the , where the only one to pay was a poor captain of a Greek vessel who, at least, did everything possible to avoid the disaster, whilst others should be charged regarding the disaster and its repercussions"
"I therefore agree both with the report on the proposal for a directive and the report on the proposal for a framework decision, and I hope that Parliament will adopt them both."
"Mr President, Commissioner, circumstances are such that we are speaking this evening about safety, the safety of our fellow citizens."
"We began by speaking about air safety and now we are moving on to maritime safety."
"We have been talking about these problems and about marine pollution for four years now and I hope that in a few years’ time we will not need to talk about them much more."
"For our part, we can only hope so, but when, while watching French television last weekend, I again saw Atlantic beaches soiled by oil slicks (whether they came from the or from uncontrolled degassing on the high seas is not known), I said to myself that there is reason to question the effectiveness of the legislation we have been putting in place for four years."
"I would nevertheless like to add my voice to the compliments addressed to the Commissioner for the energy she has shown in trying to overcome the inertia of our governments and ministers in this field."
"If they had listened to her, I do not think we would be where we are now."
"We are here to support her and to demonstrate to our citizens once again that we really do want to put all this legislation in place and see that it is obeyed."
"We know only too well, however, that if legislation is to be obeyed there must be sanctions."
"We will not achieve anything so long as there are no sanctions or they are not enforced."
"That is why we have met this evening and I would like to congratulate the various authors of the texts that are the subject of this debate and say how important it is that we should define the crime of ‘illegal discharges’ and insist on the necessary coordination so that the Member States will at last work by common agreement."
"I will close by saying that the drafting of a clear follow-up document based on the work of the European Parliament’s Temporary Committee on Maritime Safety should enable us to give the Commissioner our support on these problems of marine pollution and responsibility."
"Mr President, Commissioner de Palacio, I feel that I should not say too many words in order to stress, as the various rapporteurs have already done, and therefore those who spoke before me, the significance of the issues that we are dealing with, safety at sea in particular, to which the various provisions that we are considering in this joint debate are related."
"Not adding anything to what has already been stated, I would just say that I too support approval of a very strong initiative, which the Commission has made very effective in this direction, which we hope will find a convergence and a common direction within the Council too, as well as the completion, therefore, of legislation that we need and which, by accepting the proposals in question today, we will make our partial contribution, which will however be specific and important."
"As far as I am concerned, I followed one of the reports as shadow rapporteur which make up a package – the report by Mr Poignant as regards the transfer of ships, not just cargo ships but also passenger ships between the various national naval registers – and I must stress the qualityand the usefulness of both this Commission proposal and Parliament’s reaction as set out in the Poigant report, which we fully support and we agree with the suggestions and guidelines that have, moreover, been confirmed this evening, on the possible acceptance of suggestions from both the Council and, on a point that I consider to be very important, the Commission."
"Finally, the text allowed us to put an end to the various Conventions being interpreted differently and will, therefore, contribute to legal certainty by also simplifying the procedure for re-flagging passenger ships between registers and will, therefore, also lessen the regulatory burden within the EU and make it less bureaucratic."
"What is even more important, in my view, is that it ensures the control of safety aspects – which we see as indispensable – since the proposed procedure provides for, not only better cooperation and the exchange of information between national maritime authorities but, if necessary, additional inspections on ships: it was stressed how important this is in view of an enlargement that also includes countries, such as Malta and Cyprus, that are an important point of reference on this matter because of their traditions, commitment to production, and links between vessels and the fleet."
"Once again I would like to praise the rapporteur and the Commission proposal and, on behalf of my group, I give my full support to the positions that have been set out."
"– Mr President, instead of always focusing our attention on shipping disasters and their consequences, I think we should do more about what I have to call the day-to-day fouling of the oceans."
"So, Commissioner, I warmly congratulate you on this proposal."
"I think it is a good proposal, and would also like to congratulate Mr Pex – who is unfortunately absent – on his fine report."
"We absolutely must do something about this."
"In 2001 alone, there were some thousand instances of illegal discharges into the North Sea and the Baltic, and this must no longer be regarded as a trivial offence and treated as such; it is not like wrongful parking or breaking the speed limit, and must at last be punished as a criminal offence under the criminal law – which means tough and painful penalties, such as fines, imprisonment, and, as the committee has requested, the seizure of vessels."
"The rapporteur was right to point out that several laws adopted by Parliament and the Council have not yet been implemented."
"They have to do with port reception facilities and port state control."
"If, Commissioner, you want to bring before the ECJ those states that have not properly transposed this directive, in order to bring this out into the open and thus to bring pressure to bear in order to get this directive transposed at last, then this House is behind you all the way."
"Even the best laws are ineffective unless they are enforced and monitored."
"For that we need a European coastguard, something else on which there is consensus in this House, for control in the ports is one thing, but it must be accompanied by control on the high seas."
"We have got used to the idea that it is quite normal to monitor lorries not only in yards, but also on the roads."
"In future, that must also be possible at sea."
"You mentioned, Commissioner, that the Council regards that as too ambitious."
"Such arguments must not be given a hearing."
"I believe that we must not encourage the Council’s tendency to hide behind formalities, but should compel it to act."
"If Europe comes together and acts in unison, then we will make progress in sea travel and maritime safety on an international basis too."
"What matters is that we do everything not only to avoid disasters, but also to put an end to the toleration of deliberate, malicious and criminal acts in our waters."
"We can do something about them."
"We back you in doing so and are right behind you in your endeavour to publicly stigmatise the governments that do not do likewise."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to wish Mr Pex, and also the other rapporteurs, luck with their work."
"We have a saying in Dutch to the effect that many small ones make a big one, by which token many small incidents of pollution are, in time, as important as a major disaster."
"I might add that we laid down the 'polluter pays' principle a long time ago, and I think that now is the time for us to also say that the 'polluter is penalised', which I think would be very justified."
"I agree with the text adopted by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, in that it should be clearly stated that it is the illegal, deliberate discharges that are targeted, and not so much those resulting from accidents involving damage, for an accident is, after all, different from a deliberate discharge."
"I think that we should draw this distinction."
"Mr Piecyk pointed out a moment ago that there are already quite a few directives, such as the directive on port reception facilities, which my country has still not yet transposed."
"I see this as a disgrace and as a situation that we should rectify without delay."
"A year has now passed."
"In addition, we must get round to assessing its use, how ships themselves react to it and whether we should not make any changes anywhere to see whether – and if so, how – the directive works."
"I should also like to refer to the monitoring directive and the use of the black box."
"We will have to see how we can apply the use of the black box to find out who pollutes, where pollution occurs, and, if necessary, how much pollution is involved."
"I think that this should also be taken into consideration, because this is a directive that can also be of importance in this connection."
"I am delighted that discharges on the high seas have been included in the text and that there are no geographical restrictions but that the sea is considered a common legacy which belongs to everyone and where pollution takes place."
"Everything hinges, of course, on inspections and on the way in which we catch the polluters in the act."
"I think that a European coastguard can be of some benefit here, or at least, before we reach that stage, improved mutual cooperation by national coastguards, inspections of ships' accounts and that sort of thing."
"If we can use a satellite to read the number plate of a suspect’s car in a given country, what stops us from using this kind of technology to trace discharge offences in time?"
"When, for example, the was salvaged, other ships took advantage of this accident to discharge their oil, for it was established that the oil that washed up did not originate from the , but from other ships."
"We must, in any case, ensure that we draw a distinction between an accident and deliberate pollution."
"In shipping circles, there is disquiet about the treatment of shipping crew in some cases."
"In my view, what is happening with the captain of the is rather nasty, and I hope that we will be able to talk to him again shortly."
"I have read that a shipping disaster has now struck in Karaj and that the crew are being held criminally liable."
"We must be careful about this."
"You are right to say that we worked hard and managed to do a great deal in the previous session."
"It was frustrating on occasions."
"Before the package was complete, we were hit by the , and that is very frustrating."
"However, Commissioner, I think that Parliament and the Commission, despite opposition from the Council, have managed to obtain a few positive results, and I hope that we can do the same in the next session."
"Mr President, the disaster in November 2002 had devastating consequences, which are still being felt in the north of Portugal."
"We know, however, that maritime pollution, from spillage of oil or other noxious substances, continues even when accidents do not occur."
"Illegal dumping and emptying of tanks, either on the high seas or close to shore, must be subject to sanction."
"We also know that the fight against dumping will not only require more legislation, but also, more importantly, greater effective enforcement. In this way, Member States will have at their disposal the appropriate resources and equipment to ensure compliance with existing rules."
"What is needed is the abolition of flags of convenience, the maintenance of accurate and well-structured logs of a ship’s history, its movements and cargo, the establishment of shipping lanes further from coastlines, the adequate inspection of ships in port and better working and on-board safety conditions."
"We know that the MARPOL Convention is ignored on a daily basis by a large number of ships sailing in EU waters, since the principal objective of certain shipowners and oil companies is to obtain maximum profit at minimum cost."
"However, the fight against pollution discharges requires not only effective measures at EU level and greater cooperation between Member States, but also more effective enforcement at world level."
"Creating an EU coastguard will not solve this problem, and nor will it solve the problem of the lack of adequate resources for ship-sourced waste or the requirement for ships to use such resources."
"What is needed is for directives and other legislation in place to be enforced, including the system of information and monitoring – already set out in another directive – specifically as regards the installation of data recording devices for journeys on certain ships, without which it is difficult to prove the guilt or innocence of a ship’s crew, who must be considered innocent until proven guilty."
"It is also essential that crews be adequately trained and employees’ rights guaranteed. Ships must also be built more robustly."
"Member States and their governments must also assume full responsibility for abiding by the various conventions and directives in force."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate the three rapporteurs on their reports."
"Over the past Christmas break, a striking number of dead sea birds have once again been found on the North Sea beaches."
"This is no coincidence."
"Indeed, every winter, around this time, there is an increase in the number of illegal discharges at sea."
"These are done by captains who are not so strict when it comes to adhering to regulations and who know that there is less monitoring during this period and that winter storms mean that the oil does not leave a clear trail."
"This is why this report is so important."
"Europe must act."
"The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance supports the Pex report we are discussing now, because it is a considerable improvement on the draft directive that indicates that Europe is now finally making out a case for attaching a penalty to maritime environmental crimes, including those committed outside its territorial waters."
"We therefore reject the Council’s arguments according to which this subject falls within the scope of the third pillar."
"How will the Commission react to this?"
"How will the Commission react if the Council formally refuses to accept the directive’s introduction of criminal sanctions?"
"The accident involving the brought out sentiments to that effect, because we also want to deal with the port authorities regarding environmental damage arising after a ship that is in difficulty is refused entry to a port or a safe haven."
"A European coastguard is necessary in order to make prosecution truly possible."
"In for a penny, in for a pound."
"Tomorrow, we will be voting on a proposal tabled by my group to link this Pex directive to the Bouwman directive concerning port facilities."
"In that way, we enhance the traceability of polluters."
"Furthermore, we would ask for your support for other amendments, such as the involvement of the EMSA during the implementation of this directive."
"Mr President, I want to make it clear that this should not be an inquiry into the disaster off the Spanish/French coast: it concerns the safety of the entire European coastline."
"Very often rust-bucket, single-hull, decaying tankers carry enormous quantities of oil which are, in effect, environmental weapons of mass destruction."
"I cannot imagine what would have happened if such a disaster had occurred off the coast of Ireland."
"I do not know how we would have coped."
"There are a great many measures in place, as has been said here today."
"One we should insist on is that only double-hull ships be allowed in and around European waters."
"We need political will – which does not exist and is unlikely to exist – within the European Union to avoid a repeat of the disaster."
"It is a well-known fact that all the maritime safety organisations are understaffed and underfunded."
"They will remain so, and, as a result, the safety of our seas will remain in danger."
"Much of the pollution that occurs in Community waters, as has been said already, is either deliberate or avoidable."
"This type of action is nothing short of criminal and must therefore be dealt with by criminal sanctions."
"I am aware that criminal law is essentially a Member State competence and we must avoid taking a position that would seek to infringe Member States' rights in this area."
"Nonetheless, there is much to be recommended in the Commission's proposals and there is a clear way forward for harmonising criminal sanctions by means of a third-pillar instrument."
"A second key element to ensuring a safer, cleaner maritime environment is the newly established European Maritime Safety Agency."
"This agency will have to play a major role in anti-pollution and ship security measures."
"The agency should be properly staffed and funded."
"It certainly is not at the moment."
"Finally, I would like to draw colleagues' attention to the initiative of a number of Member States along the Atlantic north-west to establish particularly sensitive sea areas."
"I hope that this initiative, tabled by Ireland, France, Portugal, Spain, the UK and Belgium within the UN's International Maritime Organisation, will have the full support of all current and future Member States."
"This will allow progress to be made on the matter in 2004."
"However, it must be said that there is no doubt whatsoever that, without political will, nothing will change."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, safety remains an important topic in both the marine and maritime spheres."
"To this day, the disaster involving the has continued to demonstrate this."
"An agreement has recently been reached within the IMO about the extent of an additional fund for damage caused by oil pollution."
"Comments have been made in that respect about possible contributors to that fund."
"I take the view that the proposals expressed in the reports by Mr Pex and Mr Di Lello Finuoli are a valuable addition to this regulation."
"Responsibilities are clearly indicated and unambiguous sanctions are imposed in the event of non-compliance."
"I am pleased that criminal sanctions form part of this."
"I am less happy about the request to set up a European coastguard, because in my view, this concerns an extra layer of existing activities rather than a useful addition to tasks that individual coastguards are already carrying out."
"This also applies to the request in the Poignant report that ships under European flags should be given a clear, physical, EU designation."
"As long as we do not have a joint European shipping register, this does not strike me as useful."
"Moreover, it will lead to a delay in the discussion of this proposal with the Council."
"Leaving aside a few reservations, then, I take, on the whole, a very positive view of these proposals."
"Mr President, we are obviously in agreement with the aims of the new legislation before us today and the findings on which it is based."
"The threat of severe financial and criminal sanctions being credibly applied to all the players in the maritime transport chain is certainly the most effective form of prevention for dissuading those concerned from making use of dangerous ships."
"The observation on which that is based is a certain laxity in the matter of compliance with the rules on discharges on the part both of a section of the maritime sector and of certain port States and of flag States in particular."
"On the other hand, we have strong reservations about the method used."
"In the first place, it is always dangerous to lay down rules – some of which are not consistent with the Marpol convention and which have severe financial implications – that will apply only to ships flying the flags of Member States of the Union when they are the least likely to cause pollution."
"Proposing the confiscation of a vessel flying a European flag when it is not possible to confiscate a third-country ship is to shoot ourselves in the foot."
"If we did that, we would be discriminating against our own fleets, which come closest to meeting the standards."
"I can assure you they do not need that."
"That is why we must always give priority to the international level over the European level in matters of maritime safety."
"Those States of the Fifteen that wish to do so must therefore argue passionately and tirelessly for high standards, but ones that apply to all within the framework of the IMO."
"My second comment is that the texts before us make strangely little reference to the liability of the flag State. We know, however, that the principal threat to maritime safety will remain so long as flags of convenience are able to prosper by covering ships that are not inspected or are inspected by classification societies that are themselves ‘convenience’."
"This is the burning question when the director of the Maltese maritime authority, which was responsible for the registration of the , is ordered by his government to refuse to answer the summons of the judge investigating the case and when the authorities in the Bahamas are showing the most obvious lack of good will by constantly delaying publication of their report on the disaster, a ship that was flying their flag."
"Our Temporary Committee absolutely must tackle this crucial question."
"Finally, I would like to rule out the idea of European coastguards, which seems to me to smack more of ideology than of a realistic and appropriate approach to the problems."
"No one can say who would be authorised to mobilise and deploy such an instrument, which has a very direct bearing on the security of the Member States, assuming a way could ever be found to pay for it."
"Instead, we should be strengthening the operational modes of command and coordination of the means of intervention available in countries like France and Great Britain, perhaps extending them and sharing the costs of the heavy equipment bought by those Member States that contribute more than others, and for the benefit of all, to the management of the shipping lanes that connect Europe to the world."
"That, Mr President, would be a clear manifestation of real European solidarity."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by deploring the fact that profit, competitiveness and the monopolising of resources all too often make people deaf and blind."
"The human and environmental costs of the economic warfare imposed on all the nations are devastating."
"It is true that the sea is a space without borders, governed by the principle of freedom of shipping, but our role is to make carriers aware of their responsibility and therefore to make them answer for their deeds."
"That is why it is important to ensure, with this framework decision, that appropriate sanctions, criminal sanctions in particular, are applied to the persons responsible for illegal discharges of hydrocarbons and noxious liquid substances."
"The Member States really must adopt strict common provisions and a robust system of criminal sanctions."
"Today, let us be clear."
"The Member States are often not equal to their duties and responsibilities in this area."
"True, the European Union has already considerably strengthened its legislation on maritime safety, but most Member States have applied the first 1995 directive on the control of shipping using Community ports very poorly."
"Then, following the disaster, in December 1999 the European Union adopted five major texts on maritime safety."
"The two legislative packages were adopted in an exceptionally short space of time, but on 19 November 2002, the day the was wrecked, only one Member State – Denmark – had transposed one of those five texts into its national law."
"At the December 2002 Copenhagen European Council, the European Union expressed its determination to adopt every measure necessary to prevent a recurrence of such a disaster."
"The framework decision that we are going to adopt tomorrow complements the 2003 directive on pollution by ships, which was a first important step."
"The European Parliament’s Temporary Committee on the disaster was finally formed last December, after 10 months of obstruction."
"That committee will have to assess the responsibilities of the maritime authorities and governments of the Member States in the management of maritime disasters."
"We must find a solution that will ensure that the Member States comply with the measures adopted by the European Union in the field of maritime safety and agree to receive vessels in distress in harbours of refuge."
"I repeat, we must enforce every liability, be it private or public, involved in these environmental crimes."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Sterckx’s report takes an important stand on the maritime environment."
"With effective action we will protect waters in which people bathe, safeguard the supply of clean fish to eat, and improve maritime ecology, especially in enclosed sea areas."
"Oil from ships is very dangerous in many ways and for that reason pollution offences must be dealt with firmly and by making those who contribute to them accountable."
"The committee has reached an excellent conclusion, which Mr Sterckx’s amendments make more specific."
"There is one point I nevertheless cannot support as it stands: the proposal for a common coastguard goes just a bit too far."
"As the coastguard also has many other responsibilities, this should be considered in the wider context."
"Mr Poignant has done some good work with regard to his own report."
"There is just one detail in it, however, that should be addressed."
"I too am in favour of ships displaying the emblem of the European Union."
"The amendment to display the emblem on national flags is problematic, however, as the rapporteur has also said himself."
"It would require a debate on flag legislation in the Member States."
"If this amendment is dropped, it will be possible to bring this whole issue to a swift conclusion."
"Mr President, the proposal for a regulation to transfer cargo and passenger ships between registers comes within the more general anti-labour policy of the European Union."
"On the pretext of strengthening competition, it aims to increase the profits of the shipping industry by cutting back marine workers' wages and social rights and giving scandalous tax breaks to shipping companies in the Member States of the European Union."
"The recommendation in the explanatory statement of the regulation in question, that the Member States re-consider the creation of a European shipping register, is a strategically important choice by big business in order to increase its profitability."
"This proposal was submitted by the Commission back in 1989."
"Its implementation today, apart from new profits for shipowners, will result in lower safety standards in maritime transport, with new dangers to human life and the environment."
"This will create the conditions for new crimes at sea, such as the , the and others."
"The proposal to strengthen the criminal framework for abolishing pollution from ships will do nothing to reduce crimes at sea, in that everything will be subjugated to safeguarding and increasing the profits of shipowners and big business in general, which controls the sources of energy and the means of transport and production."
"We take this opportunity to call on the European Parliament to intervene and to force the P[amp]I Club and the companies which own the and the to pay the fines for the two shipwrecks so that their crews, which are being held hostage as scapegoats in Spain and Pakistan respectively, can be released."
"Mr President, the Communist Party of Greece rejects wholesale all three proposals for regulations …"
"Mr President, Commissioner, as Mr Poignant points out quite rightly in his report, back in 1989 the Commission presented its proposal for a European register of ships, known as ‘Euros’, and the European Parliament recently approved the Sterckx report resulting from the accident, calling for this possibility to be examined again."
"Being aware that the Member States do not currently want to surrender their identity at sea, but also of the advantages of all our ships displaying a European symbol, I proposed the idea of the symbol of the European Union appearing in one of the corners of the flags, the ring of stars on a blue background."
"I believe that my British colleagues in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism were offended by this."
"I would like to clarify to them that my idea does not violate their Union Jack."
"A flag has four corners and theirs has three available."
"I believe it is very positive and it has great synergy for all of us that European Union ships should be identifiable in all the seas of the world."
"Mr President, illegal discharges of oil from ships is a major problem in Danish waters."
"It is not only a question of the sea being polluted, causing damage to fisheries. Often, the oil washes up on the land and pollutes our beaches."
"Equipment for easily removing waste oil must be set up in our ports."
"This should be funded by means of a general port duty so that there is no benefit in discharging oil into the sea instead."
"The Commission now proposes that penalties for illegal discharges now be transferred to EU law."
"There must indeed be penalties for illegal discharges."
"Illegal discharges into Danish waters must be penalised under Danish law."
"Illegal discharges into international waters must be punished by an international environmental court."
"The Commission proposes that an EU coastguard be set up to track down the lawbreakers."
"In Denmark, polluters are monitored and traced by aircraft made available by the military."
"We therefore need neither EU law nor an EU coastguard with their attendant bureaucracy."
"We should, however, like to see the EU take the initiative in setting up an international environmental court under the auspices of the UN."
"At the same time, the Commission suggests promoting the reflagging of ships by bringing passenger vessels under existing easy-going rules and by limiting what is termed the quarantine period."
"Reflagging would undermine the pioneering countries’ agreements on salaries, working conditions and safety."
"The ship owners would also evade the VAT and tax rules that fund the welfare state."
"That would be unacceptable."
"Finally, the proposal that ships’ flags should have the EU symbol with the twelve gold stars against a blue background in the top corners of their national flags is ridiculous."
"We cannot, unfortunately, support any of the proposals."
"Once again."
"Mr President, it is really impressive that it has been ascertained yet again that the problem of marine pollution is caused mostly, not by shipwrecks per se, but by illegal dumping by ships, be it of petroleum products or waste in general, and this problem has not, so far, been duly addressed."
"There is the MARPOL convention, which is applied differently in the Member States as far as the sanctions imposed are concerned, which is why the initiative by the European Commission is useful, so that there is a uniform approach to the matter from the point of view of sanctions."
"Similarly, there is already a directive on the matter, Directive 2059 on facilities for receiving waste from ships, which is not applied fully by the Member States."
"This directive must be applied."
"It is not, of course, an excuse for those ships that discharge oil into the sea but, on the other hand, nor should the Member States only champion environmental protection on paper; they must also apply in practice the provisions which they themselves voted through on this particular issue."
"Consequently, we are taking a positive step here and what I want to emphasise with regret is that the Council, having asked the European Commission to submit this regulation on sanctions in cases of illegal discharges of waste by ships, does not now appear to be prepared to proceed quickly, does not appear to be prepared to accept the Commission's and Parliament's proposals and appears to be delaying the whole procedure."
"On our behalf, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I want to emphasise this and highlight the negative stance by the Council, stating that we shall fight to the end so that the Pex report becomes reality."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to be feeling happy and optimistic today as a result of this legislative progress and to congratulate the Commissioner and my fellow Members, rapporteurs and non-rapporteurs, and even myself, but as a citizen from Galicia and given that these legislative proposals result – as we have heard here over and over again – from the disaster, please allow me to make a different – although I hope complementary – point."
"It seems to me positive that this tragedy, which the Commission euphemistically describes as ‘an accident of great media interest’, should lead to significant legislative changes which lead to criminal prosecution in the event of illegal behaviour."
"But I am concerned that it may become generally accepted that by resolving the issue of illegal discharges we are resolving more than half of the problem of sea pollution with hydrocarbons, since the Commission states that the majority of that pollution is not due to accidents but to deliberate discharges."
"I also fear that the future may lead us to forget the present and this is a disaster which has not yet come to an end, as demonstrated by the new slick of fuel oil which is currently reaching the French coasts or the 14 000 tonnes of fuel oil still contained in the wreck awaiting a solution."
"I therefore say that concern for the future must not make us legislators forget the present."
"The present, ladies and gentlemen, means the three great questions which the citizens of my region are quite rightly still asking and which have not received a European response: compensation for the parties affected, environmental problems and the solution to the issue of the wreck."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am happy that our disaster should lead to Community legislation moving forward, but I am also firmly convinced – and I hope to convince you – that Europe must have mechanisms for providing a European response, which does not yet exist, to these disasters, which are going to continue to occur."
"It is scandalous that we have had to wait for the loss of the before adopting more or less constraining directives with a view finally to applying rules dating back thirty years."
"It is no less scandalous that the victims of previous losses, such as that of the , are not always properly compensated and that the oil corporation, Total, which is responsible for the loss, is cynical enough to claim compensation for pumping costs."
"Some amendments are designed to water down the Commission’s wordings on the pretext of avoiding a witch hunt against the captains and crews."
"This is all very well, but why are the directives only aimed at the latter?"
"Why not implicate the people who are really responsible, namely those who organise the shipments?"
"Why not prevent them from causing harm by applying genuinely dissuasive sanctions, for, if ships are able to sail under flags of convenience and if determining who owns them is sometimes a real headache, the big companies that profit from these shipments, notably the oil corporations, are, for their part, perfectly identifiable."
"It is against these groups that the most severe measures should be taken in order to prevent the race for profits leading to collective tragedies."
"Mr President, bearing in mind the severity with which breaches of the Highway Code are cracked down on, it is hard to understand the laxity from which those who pollute our marine environment and view the sea as a dustbin at present benefit, especially since most pollution by hydrocarbons stems from deliberate discharges rather than accidents."
"Every party involved in marine transport must be made to accept responsibility."
"In our view, a system of criminal sanctions should be introduced, with heavy fines imposed, ships confined to harbour and sums demanded by way of guarantee."
"In France, the police port authority has recently set an example by imposing fines of EUR 250 000."
"Offending ships must be banned once and for all from EU ports in the event of repeat offences; joint Member State investigation teams must be strengthened, as permitted by the framework decision of 13 June 2002; and full use must be made of criminal investigations in the country in which the port is situated with a view to carrying out on-board inspections, hearing witnesses and taking samples. Cooperation must be strengthened between maritime police in detecting pollution and identifying the polluters; a European coastguard must be created in the long run; and Member States must be encouraged to transpose the European directives relating to safety at sea into their legislation, and must be penalised if they delay doing so."
"At present, eight Member States, a number of which are quick to give lessons in ecology, appear not to respect Community legislation on classification societies and port state control."
"Let us not forget that, if the Erika I package had been respected, the disaster could have been avoided."
"With the Motorway of the Sea project, the sea appears more than ever as an alternative to roads."
"For example, 350 000 lorries should embark each year at Montoire to travel to Spain."
"Strict, and strictly applied, maritime regulations are required, but they should be applied to everyone and not only to European ships."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I believe that the Commissioner and we as Parliament are right to claim responsibility for a measure adopted in this parliamentary term that is finally effective in the area of safety at sea."
"What we are dealing with is a series of provisions that completes the picture of fruitful work, which includes the provision for double hull tankers to be on the black list of ships that are no longer sea-worthy, the call for Member States to provide a list of refuge ports: a raft of measures that have been taken during this parliamentary term and for which we must give credit to the Commission, but for which we must also claim our part."
"This is, therefore, what compelled me and my group to fully support the Pex report, in particular, and I would like to highlight one of its amendments – which I have heard being challenged in parts but I believe that we should all appreciate how useful it is – on the call for a European coastguard to be set up as rapidly as possible."
"We cannot call for greater controls, we cannot expect sanctions to be enforced if we do not have the instruments to do so effectively."
"This would be a great step forwards, also for a whole range of other issues that we are faced with in the European Union, not least that of illegal immigration."
"I believe that we need to carry out a general review."
"On the issues of safety – aviation safety, as we heard just now, safety at sea, and I would add food safety – European public opinion is at times far ahead of governments; it calls for more Europe, for European regulations."
"We should feel encouraged by this feeling amongst the public and also call on the Council, which has to date been somewhat reticent on these issues, to not disappoint such important expectations, which, for our fellow citizens, have increased recently and which can really give us important results for the future."
"Mr President, like others I welcome these reports on combating ship-source pollution."
"The UK, as an island, is especially vulnerable, and the history of our coastline is littered with horrific accidents and disasters not dissimilar to the ."
"I am sure there is merit in the idea of harmonising sanctions, but these need to be very powerful measures and certainly must not weaken Member States' existing legislation."
"Harmonising up, yes, but levelling down, no."
"Then we need to ask who we are really trying to make responsible."
"Mr Andrews referred earlier on to 'rust buckets': the elderly ships on our seas that are a threat to coastlines, to maritime safety and to marine life."
"In the event of an accident, it is not the captains of these ships who need a custodial or prison sentence; it is the owners, those who are really responsible."
"All too often, it seems, it is those at the top, those with ultimate responsibility, who escape justice."
"Mr Ortuondo Larrea and others referred to flags."
"This is something of a distraction."
"The real issue here is the farce whereby ships are allowed to sail under flags of a country with which they have no connection at all."
"Finally, we also need to ensure that the rights of people living near areas vulnerable to disasters are protected."
"We have to consider the consequences for citizens who live close to pollution disaster areas."
"All these aspects vary from one country to another and, listening to this debate, I remain to be convinced as to how these harmonising instruments will actually crack down on those who are really responsible and bring them to justice."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today’s debate is extremely important and responds to the expectations of the citizens, who are calling for greater maritime safety."
"We Galicians are well aware of the problem, unfortunately, but I sincerely believe that we are moving in the right direction."
"The Commission has reacted quickly and correctly and we must once again congratulate the Commissioner, Mrs de Palacio, on her proposals."
"It is now our turn and, fundamentally, the turn of the Council."
"And I would like to stress the important step we are also taking on the issue of codecision, with the intention from the outset to agree common positions with the Council allowing us to speed up the very necessary entry into force of the legislative rules."
"I therefore hope that the Council will accept our proposals, and I believe that Parliament must stand firm, as our fellow Members have said, in particular Mr Piecyk."
"I would therefore like to congratulate our rapporteurs – Mr Pex, Mr Poignant and Mr Di Lello – on their efforts and their contributions to complementing and improving the Commission’s proposals in relation to these indispensable deterrent measures."
"The sea belongs to all of us, and whoever pollutes must pay the price, whether they do so intentionally or as a result of negligence, including criminal sanctions which could involve prison sentences."
"And the European Union must offer an example and lead this effective prosecution of offences against the marine environment at world level."
"We therefore also support measures, such as the preventive seizure of ships, aimed at guaranteeing compliance with the sanctions imposed."
"We also agree with the proposal in Mr Pex’s report that there must be a common European coastguard service, charged with monitoring one hundred percent compliance with this international and European legislation. This does not imply that we want to replace the national services in the Member States."
"We are talking about an additional monitoring and coordination measure, as well as a genuine Community system for monitoring the maritime traffic in dangerous goods, by satellite, with black boxes, etc."
"Another issue which is key to maritime safety, as has been demonstrated, is controls of flags of convenience."
"We must promote and incentivise European flags, and I therefore also share the opinion in the report by Mr Poignant that European symbols should begin to be used on ships’ flags, as currently happens in the European Union in the case of vehicle registration plates."
"With these two reports, the European Parliament is allying itself with the Commission and contributing to giving the European Union greater maritime safety and better environmental protection."
"All we need now, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, is for the Council to approve them and for them to enter into force quickly."
"Mr President, I begin by thanking our rapporteur, Mr Pex, although he is absent this evening, for his work on this very important report, which we broadly support."
"It is extremely important to have legislation in place under which those responsible for unlawful oil or chemical discharges from ships can be prosecuted."
"We are no longer prepared to put up with reckless behaviour, which too often has resulted in irreparable damage to the environment."
"Nevertheless, it is necessary to differentiate between intentional and accidental pollution."
"The United Kingdom already has criminal sanctions in place for unlawful discharges from ships, as specified in the Marpol Convention, and matters relating to criminal law should, as such, fall within the competence of the Member State and not the Community."
"Furthermore, as there have been no practical difficulties between Member States in deciding where a prosecution should take place, this proposal should be removed from the framework decision."
"Finally on this point, the introduction of a European coastguard is neither practical nor necessary, nor is it consistent with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea."
"British Conservative MEPs will oppose those amendments."
"As regards the Poignant Report, in principle we support this proposal and accept that the new regulation will improve cooperation between the administrators of maritime registers in the Member States."
"As I clearly pointed out prior to the vote in the debate of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, British Conservative MEPs will vehemently oppose the integration of the emblem of the European Union onto our Red Ensign."
"It will do nothing to enhance security and could even make EU-registered ships potential targets."
"In addition, identification is not an issue, as all vessels carry their unique IMO numbers as well as the name of their ports of registry."
"To conclude, registration principles are determined internationally in the United Nations and IMO system, which is global rather than European."
"The EU is not a nation-state – fortunately – and it is doubtful whether anyone else would recognise an EU flag in terms of the international conventions."
"Mr President, better late than never, as they say."
"The current proposal for a Council decision is based on the idea of tightening up civil and criminal responsibility for pollution-generating maritime transport."
"In line with the positions of the Commission directive and with the traditional positions of the European Parliament, the proposal has enabled the European Parliament to fine-tune the initial text with two unanimously approved amendments that I consider to be highly relevant."
"The first extends the scope of criminal responsibility to behaviour resulting in substantial harm to people, beyond the limited criterion of death or serious injury."
"The second, following a similar logic, extends the perpetrators’ responsibility from damage to species of fauna and flora to substantial damage to the protected natural environment, which is all marine and coastal life at risk from pollution."
"I therefore pay tribute to the rapporteur Mr Di Lello Finuoli, who tabled these amendments."
"Indeed, the new legal framework on maritime pollution and the future Lisbon Maritime Surveillance Agency, established by the Brussels Council last month, leads us to believe that Europe is finally assuming its responsibilities."
"It would be absurd for Europe to be responsible for regulating sea resources, without first having the necessary means to protect them."
"– Mr President, when an accident occurs at sea it has far-reaching and almost irreparable consequences for the immediate environment as a whole."
"The maritime environment is also being contaminated by practices indifferent to the law and environmental welfare, such as emptying bilge water into the open sea."
"Polluters of the environment must be made accountable for what they do."
"Strengthening the penal framework will hopefully act as an adequate deterrent to those who transport cargo which is dangerous for the environment in vessels in poor condition or unsuited to the purpose, or otherwise contaminate the environment though negligence or indifference."
"For example, in the Baltic Sea, which is a very fragile and shallow internal sea surrounded by quite a number of countries, enormous risks are taken which could prove to be environmentally disastrous."
"Oil is transported in single-hull vessels in difficult conditions in the winter when there is pressure from ice."
"There also have to be more inspections and routine monitoring to bring illegal pollution under control."
"I hope that after the directives to improve safety at sea enter into force at EU level, all parties responsible for maritime transport will consider carefully how consignments can be handled using appropriate equipment and in a way that is as environmentally safe as possible."
"Apathy and the taking of unnecessary risks must be minimised."
"I am glad that EU legislation is to be strengthened and harmonised with regard to this issue."
"I thank the Commission and the rapporteurs for the work they have done, and I hope that the reformed, stricter legislation will soon be brought into effect."
"Mr President, I commend the rapporteurs on their reports."
"Criminal sanctions should be used against those responsible for the environmental pollution caused by deliberate dumping and by maritime disasters."
"The consequences of the disaster are still being felt in Spain, Portugal and France."
"It is high time that the international rules governing marine discharges were incorporated into EU legislation and, equally importantly, that such rules were enforced."
"I fundamentally disagree with Mrs Foster's and her colleagues' opposition to the idea of a European coastguard."
"I have been arguing for the creation of an EU coastguard for some time, and welcome Mr Pex's acknowledgement that such a body has an important role to play in implementing these rules by carrying out spot checks."
"It could also play a number of additional roles in EU waters, such as providing an adequate emergency response mechanism should an environmental disaster, such as the , occur again."
"If one considers the problems we have in EU waters, one can see the potential of an EU coastguard."
"For example, our waters are being exploited by organised crime for trafficking in arms, drugs and human beings."
"Illegal human trafficking in the EU is now worth over EUR 4 billion annually."
"Drug trafficking remains a massive problem and the illegal trade in small arms, whose main recipients are terrorists and criminals, is estimated to account for 10% of the global trade in arms."
"Cigarette smuggling has almost replaced drug trafficking, due to the enormous profit margins that can be exploited without the same degree of risk in terms of penal sanctions."
"I would argue, in total contrast to what Mrs Foster says, that an EU coastguard could effectively police EU waters: it could clamp down on illegal dumping, enforce the common fisheries policy, assist with emergency rescue services and restrict illegal trafficking."
"I hope that the Commission will respond positively to Mr Pex's call for the creation of an EU coastguard, and that the Irish Presidency of the Council will also heed that call, particularly since, in coming from an island, it will appreciate the value of such a body policing our high seas."
".– Mr President, I expect the House has noticed I have a scarf wrapped round my head. I should like to explain straight away that appearing like this in Strasbourg does not mean I am taking sides in the debate on wearing the veil."
"Over the last four years I have come to this building some forty times. On more than twenty of those occasions I have left with a cold and feeling quite unwell, sometimes even running a temperature."
"I should like to take advantage of this opportunity to urge those in charge of maintaining the building to take appropriate action. It seems to me that the building itself is rather unwell."
"It is certainly causing some of us who frequent it to become unwell."
"I assure you I do not suffer in this way anywhere else."
"Sudden drastic temperature changes should not be allowed. They are not good for one, nor are all the draughts around this building."
"Mr President, honourable Members, I must express my gratitude to Mr Pex for his work. Basically, it supports the Commission’s position."
"In this connection, I should like to say that most of the amendments are aimed at clarifying the text of the proposal for a directive. They improve the text of the Directive."
"Consequently we accept them all, notably Amendments 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 12, 15, 18, 20 and 23."
"Other amendments are acceptable in principle, but will need some redrafting. This is the case of Amendments 6 and 22 concerning the creation of a common European coastguard."
"The Commission was able to explain its views on the subject in the course of replies to questions in the House."
"We are favourably inclined towards the ideas. Nonetheless, the budgetary and operational implications of such an initiative will need to be studied first."
"In particular, it will be necessary to consider relations between this potential coastguard, the Maritime Safety Agency and the agency to be charged with managing external borders, as well as with the existing competent national structures."
"The latter may be modified in the future."
"The Commission will work with a will to deal with these complex issues. It has to be said, however, that this is not an easy task and will take some time."
"Nonetheless, some amendments are unacceptable. We therefore reject them, either because they are redundant or because they are not in line with the objectives of our initial proposal."
"As I conclude on the report by Mr Pex, allow me to reiterate my conviction that there is considerable convergence. Parliament is once again supporting us with regard to strengthening maritime safety."
"I await the outcome of tomorrow’s vote with great interest. I trust that at the earliest opportunity the House will adopt this report and this position at first reading."
"That should promote debate with the Council, where things are much more difficult."
"I am grateful to Parliament for debating this report alongside that of Mr Di Lello and the framework decision."
"I should like to thank Mr Di Lello too for his work and for his support for the Commission’s proposals. I should also like to thank him for his determination to carry on fighting the curse of ship-source pollution."
"Parliament and the Commission are of one mind on this. We are particularly concerned about intentional discharge."
"As I stated in our text, intentional discharge accounts for over 50% of the pollution of European Union waters. It is therefore a crucial issue."
"We cannot accept the first amendment as it stands. This is because of its non-legal nature."
"Nonetheless, we would like to emphasise that we are appreciative of the support we have again received for our position regarding the Community’s competence to include the principle of criminal sanctions in the implementation of Community policy."
"We are conscious of Parliament’s support in connection with the appeal brought by the Commission against the framework decision on protection of the environment under the Criminal Code."
"I trust it will prove possible to adopt both these texts. I also hope the Council will find a way of being more accommodating, or that it will at least prevail on certain Member States to moderate their position."
"After all, other Member States of the Union fully support the stance adopted by Parliament and the Commission."
"All these issues would complete the global framework of stepping up maritime safety and combating pollution caused by discharges."
"I have in mind European waters, coastlines and exclusive economic zones."
"This is the crux of our policy. As such, it calls for special attention."
"In response to statements made by some honourable Members, I should like to make it clear that the Commission will continue to work to see the legislative proposals through."
"We shall not hesitate to act if countries fail to meet the deadlines for transposing into their national legislation the directives adopted here with a view to combating marine pollution and promoting maritime safety. We are quite prepared to go to the courts to insist on implementation by the Member States of the Union."
"Port facilities designed to deal with discharges are part of this drive. Such facilities are absolutely essential for the implementation of these texts."
"With regard to the other issue before us today, namely the transfer of cargo and passenger ships between registers in the Community, I should like to thank Mr Poignant for his work."
"I must also thank him for the discussions and contacts with the Council. I very much hope they will facilitate the adoption of this regulation at first reading, assuming the House endorses the rapporteur’s report and the amendments he supports."
"Early adoption is essential, given the imminence of enlargement. This particular enlargement will have major implications for the maritime sector."
"Mr President, it is important to develop existing legislation and to supplement and update it."
"The Commission has accepted most of the amendments, and I should like to thank Mr Poignant once again. The Commission can accept Amendment No 3."
"Nonetheless, we have to reject Amendments Nos 1 and 2 on displaying the Union’s emblem in a corner of the flags flown by vessels registered in Member States of the Union, as it would hinder agreement with the Council at first reading. Furthermore, this is not the appropriate legal instrument with which to introduce such a measure."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The Bureau notes that there are indeed significant temperature differences within the building and hopes that, in view of the precautions that you are taking, you do not fall ill."
"We will try to improve conditions in the building."
"The debate is closed."
"Voting will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"The next item is the joint discussion on the following reports:"
"- A5-0442/2003 by Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a Council Directive (Euratom) on the management of spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste (COM(2003) 32 – C5-0229/2003 – 2003/0022(CNS))"
"- A5-0441/2003 by Mr Seppänen, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a Council (Euratom) directive on setting out basic obligations and general principles on the safety of nuclear installations (COM(2003) 32 – C5-0228/2003 – 2003/0021(CNS))"
"Thank you for your kind words, Mr President."
"I hope I shall survive this time and avoid catching yet another cold."
"Turning to more serious issues, I should like to thank Parliament, especially the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy. Particular thanks are due to the two rapporteurs, Mr Seppänen and Mr Vidal-Quadras."
"I appreciate all the work undertaken jointly and welcome the results achieved. I believe the latter are very reasonable as regards the Commission’s drafts for a directive concerning safety at nuclear facilities, the management of spent fuel and the management of radioactive waste."
"The determination to contribute to the setting up of a Community approach to nuclear safety has been abundantly clear both at discussions at the Commission and at the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. Nuclear safety was understood in its broadest sense, encompassing both the safety of facilities and the management of waste."
"In addition, it will provide significant political support. It should be borne in mind that difficulties have arisen at Council regarding several Member States, and such support would be helpful."
"It is particularly important for Parliament to support the Commission’s initiative concerning the use of legally binding instruments to provide a framework for nuclear safety and the management of nuclear waste in the future enlarged Europe of 25 Member States. This approach is the only way of putting in place clear and stable general legal rules."
"Such rules will guarantee future prospects for investments in electricity companies. They will also have the effect of informing and reassuring public opinion about the conditions in which nuclear energy is used within the European Union."
"I shall now turn to the draft directive laying down the basic duties and general principles regarding the safety of nuclear facilities. The Commission has complied with Parliament’s request that nuclear safety be guaranteed during the decommissioning process also."
"This is a sensitive issue. It involves both concerns for nuclear safety and the desire for fair competition in the electricity market."
"The Euratom Treaty constitutes the legal basis for the Commission’s proposal. This proposal allows Parliament’s expectations to be met in a balanced manner."
"Parliament’s amendments have been studied. In particular, it emerges quite clearly that the ruling to be forwarded to the Council will make it possible to counter any attempt by Member States to change the substance of the Commission’s initial proposals."
"The Commission is willing to show some flexibility. It is not, however, prepared to sacrifice the political objectives set when drafting the proposals."
"We therefore believe it is essential to ensure sufficient financial resources are available to ensure decommissioning takes place safely."
"I shall now turn to the draft directive on the management of spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste. I have taken careful note of the proposals to amend the timetable for approving permanent storage facilities and their entry into use."
"Initial discussion in the Council suggests the latter is favourably inclined to this idea."
"Clearly, both sides are of the opinion that the timetable put forward by the Commission is over-ambitious."
"Personally, I still believe the difficulty does not lie with the dates themselves. The difficulty is that most Member States have not made sufficient progress with their decisions and preparations."
"I would not like to suggest that this applies to Finland, however."
"Finland is very much in the lead, and has taken specific decisions. Sweden has made a great deal of progress too."
"Returning to the timetable, the Commission is prepared to be flexible if specific and reasonable time periods are suggested."
"This is actually in line with Parliament’s proposal, namely to allow more time but to set specific dates."
"We are prepared to allow flexibility in such circumstances."
"There is international consensus at technical level on the final storage of high-level and long-life radioactive waste in deep geological repositories. All are agreed that at present this is the best method of isolating radioactive waste from human beings and from the environment for the long periods necessary."
"This does not of course mean that other solutions are not being researched."
"The Commission does not wish to close any doors. The fact that deep geological repositories are currently the best solution does not necessarily mean they will be the best solution ten years from now."
"We are inspired solely by our desire to ensure safe management of radioactive waste in the long term. Our aim is to provide effective protection for our citizens."
"In this connection, there is scope for proposing an increase for research and development if necessary. I must emphasise we are not writing off other solutions."
"Mr President, by way of summary I should like to confirm the main objective of the Commission’s proposal. This is simply to guarantee the highest possible level of safety within an enlarged Europe."
"In addition to guaranteeing a high level of safety, we wish to make this whole issue more transparent for the citizens and especially for Parliament."
"We also wish to ensure that the nuclear sector tackles the problem of managing radioactive waste. We hope the various Member States will make a determined effort in this regard."
"I must emphasise that implementation of this Community legislation will result in stable and balanced general rules for the European Community sector. Such rules will allow the sector to develop without any part of it being favoured or discriminated against."
"I think I should mention how pleasing it is to note that the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission are cooperating to endow the enlarged Union with a genuine Community policy on nuclear safety."
"Such policies already exist for other areas."
"As I recalled when presenting these initiatives, in the past the Commission tabled proposals on issues such as acceptable levels for bathing waters in the European Union."
"Parliament and the Council adopted these proposals. There is nothing currently laid down on European levels in this area, however."
"With your permission, Mr President, I should like to respond to a point made by Mrs McNally at the start of this sitting."
"I must point out again to Mrs McNally that it was another honourable Member of this House who declared the Kyoto Protocol dead. I never said so."
"What I have actually said and will now reiterate is as follows."
"Unfortunately, it is very likely that the Protocol will not gain the number of ratifications needed for it to come into force. That is something different."
"Others arrived at different conclusions, not I. I stated that it is important to continue working on the objective of the Kyoto Protocol. I would like to emphasise this again today."
"It is vital to keep working on the reduction of greenhouse gases. We have to maintain our commitments."
"That is something quite different. The objective must be pursued."
"I should also like to reiterate that if it did unfortunately come to pass that the required appropriate signatures and ratifications were not forthcoming and the Kyoto Protocol did not come into force, the Community would need to reconsider."
"Sadly, such a scenario could come about, as it seems certain countries such as the United States, Australia and possibly others might not lend their support. This could be because of the statements made recently in Russia."
"The Union would then have to consider whether the measures adopted to date are those best suited to obtaining the desired outcome, namely the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. It might prove necessary to consider other possibilities."
"This is what I stated. I put this forward and stand by it."
"I think it is entirely reasonable. Regrettably, it is also entirely reasonable to believe that the acceleration of climate change is linked to the very harmful effects of greenhouse gas emissions."
"That link has actually been scientifically proven."
"It must continue to fight and work for an effective, real and adequate reduction of these emissions. It is important to bear in mind that Europe is only one small part of a world it shares with many other countries."
"Unfortunately, forecasts suggest that Europe will not be the source of future dramatic increases in greenhouse gas emissions at global level."
"Other countries will be responsible for the rise. Nonetheless, there is a positive side to this."
"Those countries will become more developed than they now are. They will therefore no longer be classed as developing countries."
"They will be deemed to be fully developed. That is something we should all encourage and look forward to."
"– Mr President, the so-called nuclear package we are debating tonight was devised in response to the enlargement of the Union and in particular to the Green Paper on safety in energy supply."
"Enlargement brings into the Union a number of countries producing electricity through fission. The safety culture and the power stations in those countries differ from those in Western Europe."
"Thanks to the accession process, the countries in question have met all the safety objectives required set for them. There is absolutely no need for concern on that score."
"Nonetheless, I would remind the House that nuclear power is not perceived simply in strictly technical, practical or scientific terms. It is perhaps unfortunate that the issue of nuclear power tends to be permeated by ideology and all too often by emotion."
"Consequently, it was absolutely essential for the Union to provide its citizens with a regulatory framework at European level in order to allay specific and well-founded fears. This nuclear package was devised to meet that need and we believe it does so effectively."
"One of the basic conclusions of the Green Paper is that all options for the future of energy in Europe must be kept open. Allow me to emphasise the use of the word all."
"It does of course cover the generation of electricity through nuclear fission."
"Due to the emotional factors I mentioned earlier it is extremely important to ensure that the establishment of a legally binding European regulatory framework guaranteeing nuclear safety becomes a common objective for the Union."
"This involves a common methodology and the necessary guarantees that any anomaly or incident will be dealt with by reference to the latest available technical developments."
"Such is the added value the nuclear package also provides for public opinion across the Union."
"There was considerable debate as to whether the nuclear package called for directives, or whether recommendations, guidelines or other weaker legal instruments would suffice. In my opinion, Mr President, recourse to weaker legal instruments would have rendered the whole exercise meaningless."
"What the citizens of Europe are insisting on is that their demand concerning the highest possible standards for these facilities be met. This can only be achieved through a legally binding instrument such as a directive."
"With reference to the two specific legislative initiatives considered, I can say that Parliament’s concerns have been appropriately recorded in our respective reports."
"I could mention the adjustment of the timetable concerning the creation of final storage sites for high-level waste."
"I could also mention avoidance of a situation in which European regulations were superimposed on national ones. Such duplication would have been inefficient."
"Further, efforts were made to ensure the public was fully informed and involved throughout the whole process."
"I should add that we believed it was essential for the directive on waste to leave open the option of further research in the future. Although storage in deep geological repositories in stable strata is currently the preferred option, the situation could change."
"Commissioner, this nuclear package certainly represents a step forward. Your approach to the difficulties arising has demonstrated how, although outwardly frozen, you actually have within you a bow of burning gold and the arrows of desire to take decisions."
"Lastly, the nuclear package demonstrates something further. It demonstrates that, as one of Spain’s greatest twentieth-century thinkers maintained, the solutions to problems it is difficult to solve at national level lie in Europe."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, the Commission has had good intentions in proposing a directive to improve the safety of nuclear installations."
"Good intentions are not enough, however."
"The proposal for a directive drafted by the Commission is inappropriate and should not be approved as it stands."
"The fact is that electricity is produced by means of nuclear power."
"When nuclear power is being used the safety of the equipment must be at a level that is as technically high as possible."
"The improvement of safety in nuclear power plants today must be a project that both the supporters and opponents of nuclear power are involved in."
"In its directive the Commission is proposing a transfer of power from the Member States to the Commission itself."
"It does not, however, specify in the directive the principles on which it would wield its additional powers."
"If the directive were adopted, the Commission would virtually have to adopt a position on safety criteria for nuclear installations."
"Representatives of many Member States understandably object to the directive because they are afraid of high-handed monitoring practices."
"If nuclear plant safety is to be regulated by a directive, it must define precisely those powers the Commission is to be given and the principles upon which those powers are to be used."
"Such is not the case with this Commission proposal."
"Responsibility for the safety of nuclear installations must always lie with the plant itself, by which I mean the polluter pays. Plants have to comply with national laws and the regulations laid down by the national authorities."
"There must be no attempt to transfer responsibility from the plants to the Commission."
"The authorities must act to improve the safety of nuclear installations in collaboration with the International Atomic Energy Agency."
"The latter has set out principles that represent the world’s best shared experience of the safety of nuclear plants and the monitoring of safety."
"We have to move forward on that basis."
"The Commission has no equivalent resources."
"In fact it has been unable to show Parliament it will have the personnel resources it should have at its disposal if it acquired additional responsibilities in the monitoring of nuclear safety."
"In that regard, the directive would weaken safety, not improve it."
"Representatives of quite a number of Member States have also drawn the same conclusion."
"At meetings led by the Italian Presidency they eventually proposed some fundamental amendments to the Commission proposal, and our committee took a sympathetic view of the Council position in our report."
"The Commission proposed in its directive that the management of the decommissioning funds in respect of nuclear power plants should be reformed in such a way that they should remain financially independent of other funds pertaining to nuclear power companies."
"It was right to insist on that."
"It is essential to the safety of nuclear installations that adequate funds are set side for the decommissioning of plants whilst they are still operating."
"They have to be managed in such a way that they do not produce competition distortions in the price of electricity in the market."
"The Commission proposal is justified in this respect."
"On account of opposition from the Member States, however, the Commission has been unable to produce a balanced proposal, and for that reason it is only right to keep this outside the scope of the directive and call for a new directive on this very issue."
"The Commission has justified the need for the directive with indirect reference to the accession to the EU of the new Member States."
"According to reports received by the committee, the standards of safety in nuclear power installations in the Member States joining the EU in May is no worse than those in current Member States, especially when we consider that the Ignalina power station in Lithuania is being wound down."
"We on the committee have worked on this basis."
"If someone could show that standards of safety in nuclear installations in the new Member States are significantly worse than in the current Member States, that would be an important new item of information."
"The committee’s compromise proposal can, I think, be approved as it is."
"Finally, I wish to point out to the Commissioner that she obviously misinterpreted the committee’s opinion of this matter."
"Parliament in its report is more in favour of the opinion of certain Member States represented in the Council than that of the Commission, and does not intend to approve the Commission proposal as it stands."
". – Mr President, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, I should like to make a few observations about the management of spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste."
"I will start, first of all, with the legal basis."
"The Commission is mistaken to refer to Articles 30, 31 and 32 of the Euratom Treaty, which pertain only to the health and safety of workers."
"They are not related to the safety standards for nuclear facilities."
"The Commission should have adopted the correct legal basis, namely Article 203 of the Euratom Treaty."
"According to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, this Waste Directive mainly sets unified timetables."
"This approach will benefit neither the nuclear energy sector, the environment nor the public."
"As far as the disposal or storage options are concerned, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is of the opinion that there is no broad international consensus."
"Even in France, the nuclear energy country , national legislation requires a series of different options to be considered."
"As for timetables, not one single new Member State will be able to meet the timetable under the current circumstances, not even Finland, which will need another two years."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy also takes the view that the export of waste outside of Europe will have to be banned and that the proposed directive must be amended accordingly."
"The Commission must publish its current plans for the management and disposal and storage of radioactive waste of all Member States and allow comments to be made."
"It must draw up a list of waste whose export is not allowed – not into the atmosphere or into the sea – and may not qualify for disposal or storage."
"In addition, a proposal in the style of Aarhus must be established following compulsory consultation of the public."
"With regard to the safety of nuclear plant, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is of the opinion that the current amendment to the directive will not lead to an improvement because the international, worldwide directives that are already in place are more or less taken as a basis."
"We also have to get off our chests the fact that the dismantling funds should be paid for by the nuclear energy sector itself and not by the taxpayer."
"We therefore take the view that the directive should be tightened up drastically so that it results in the introduction of the latest safety standards, compliance with which can be enforced effectively."
"This too is missing from the present proposals."
"Finally, I should like to comment on the remarks made by Commissioner de Palacio about Kyoto."
"I assume that she was expressing her personal view and that she did not represent the view of the entire Commission, for she is not responsible for this dossier."
"I will therefore ignore her remarks with regard to Kyoto."
"– Mr President, I wish to thank my colleagues for their excellent work in drafting these reports."
"This has been a long and demanding exercise in which patience has been truly put to the test."
"Producing a report on safety standards in particular has at times been a real game of cat and mouse with the Commission and the Council."
"Luckily, however, the institutions began to see eye to eye last autumn and Parliament has been able to discuss the current version."
"In its proposals, the Commission began to make slightly curious assumptions."
"The timetable with regard to the issue of waste was pulled out of the air and is completely unrealistic."
"Regarding funds, the Member States must have the chance to decide on the form funds and reserves should take, as long as they ensure that a certain amount of funding is available if needed."
"The Directive on safety standards was in that sense funny in its original form in that it did not speak any more about safety than it did standards."
"Furthermore, with regard to definitions, many concepts remained, and still partly remain, very much up in the air."
"For a long time it was unclear as to whether there would be any standards, when they might possibly be introduced, what shape they would take, who would formulate them, where they would apply, and so on and so on."
"As has been said, both rapporteurs have done some excellent work tweaking the reports to make them more realistic and practical."
"During its presidency Italy played an important and conspicuous role in the Council and helped take the package forward."
"I hope and believe that Ireland will continue to use the same constructive and cooperative approach as its predecessor, Italy."
"It is still unclear what the added value of the proposal for safety standards will be."
"It goes without saying that the role of the national supervisory authorities will have to be called into question."
"Cooperation between the EU, the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Western European Nuclear Regulators’ Association must be stepped up."
"Owing to its obvious lack of resources and know-how, the Commission cannot now nor in the future have anything but a coordinating role in cooperation on nuclear safety."
"In its proposed format, then, this is not any complete directive package, but, as I see it, those who are in favour of safe and environmentally friendly nuclear power will have no alternative but to give their support to both reports in their present form."
"I am for high safety standards and voluntary cooperation between the Member States and the authorities."
"– Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteurs most warmly for these reports, as also all those who played their part in preparing this debate."
"I would, though, also like to thank the Commission, for in my many years in this House – almost twenty-five of them so far – never before has a Commission dared to put its head as far above the parapet as this one when it comes to the safety of nuclear power stations and the safe disposal of radioactive waste."
"I really would like to thank you for that."
"I see that as progress, as an advance on what we have had up to now, for a remarkable contradiction is apparent."
"On the one hand, one cannot deny that there are of course such things as radioactive risks and that these are transnational in nature, but, on the other, we refuse to acknowledge that these transnational risks need to be managed on a European basis."
"These directives do nothing to resolve that contradiction, but we have, all the same, moved on a bit."
"It is for that reason that I favour a directive rather than the recommendation that some Member States are demanding, some of them with very different considerations in mind."
"Not the least reason why I favour a directive is that it will be capable of being extended in future."
"Admittedly, as many have already said, these directives leave responsibility with the Member States, but, as things stand today, that makes sense and that should be affirmed; directives do have the advantage that the responsibility, being with the national governments, will become more transparent in future."
"What that means is that we – or rather those of us who will be re-elected – will have the opportunity to hold, in this House, a debate on inspection reports."
"My next point is a brief one on the Vidal-Quadras Roca report: what is waste?"
"There has been much discussion of the way in which waste has been defined in an actually political way, which the Commission text has also done to some extent, in other words, that waste is waste if it is not reused."
"Physically speaking, though, it can indeed be reused, and that is why retrieval is extraordinarily important."
"It may very well be that, in a century or two’s time, what is now waste will perhaps again become fuel; it is certainly feasible in terms of the physics involved."
"As we should leave future generations that option, retrieval must be a possibility."
"I might add that this should also be done for ecological reasons; we may well not believe this to be possible, but one day it may be that."
"Next, let me turn to reduction – of waste, of volume, of toxicity – and I would like to address something that we have not discussed in this House, but that we certainly will have to discuss in the future, namely the transmutation of long-life isotopes."
"It is, in principle, very definitely possible for transmutation to reduce the half-life of long-life isotopes, especially the minor actinides, and also the volume of these pollutants or of this waste, so that less toxic matter has to be finally stored."
"Interestingly enough, though, this requires research, and a new generation of technology, and the possibility cannot be excluded of this becoming part of the technologies and philosophy intrinsic to and incorporated in the reactor, perhaps in the fourth generation of nuclear power stations."
"Although I mention this only in passing, that too is not something that should be ruled out."
"Work is in any case being done on it and on Generation 4, and the Commission is playing its part in it."
"The next point to which we had to devote a great deal of attention, is the funds issue, that is, of how the decommissioning of a power station or installation is to be funded."
"What we have now got presented to us by the Council is a much-reduced form of this, and it is probable that a majority of this House will vote in favour of it."
"Whilst I think that is sensible, one question that will not thereby be resolved is that of competition, in view of there being not only the Euratom Treaty, but also the competition articles."
"It may well be that someone will realise, and point out, that there are enterprises that have to put aside a lot of money for these funds, whilst others get funding from their governments; does this not put at a competitive disadvantage those who put money into these funds?"
"The directive makes no reference to anything of the sort, and I do not suppose that this is what the Council of Ministers intended, but I am certain that this issue will again need to be discussed in the next few years."
"All in all, I see this debate and the directive as progress, and hope that we will, tomorrow, adopt the reports by a large majority."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the important debate on the nuclear package, my position, and that of my group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, is clear."
"We do not, on this occasion, have to take sides in the confrontation between those in favour of, and those against, nuclear energy."
"We have to start from where we are in terms of the planet’s energy needs and in terms of how to respond to these needs."
"I would draw your attention to a few figures: at present, we use the equivalent of ten billion tons of oil, 90% of which is fossil fuel."
"Looking further into the twenty-first century, we observe that our needs are going to double by as early as 2050 or 2060, even if we are unwavering in our efforts to make energy savings."
"We do not, therefore, have the resources to do without nuclear energy."
"If we were to do so, we should both be short of energy and see more serious pollution of the planet."
"We must therefore do everything to improve the management of nuclear energy."
"That is why, regarding the management of radioactive waste and spent fuel, I congratulate Mr Vidal-Quadras for the quality of his work."
"In particular, he proposes an essential change."
"Each Member State should, between now and 31 December 2006, set its own deadline for preparing and presenting a waste management programme."
"That seems to me to be more realistic than the Commission’s proposal."
"The report also poses the problem of the nature of the waste in question."
"Does it amount to freely circulating merchandise?"
"For us, the waste is not ordinary merchandise, and we agree to specifying that, although a Member State’s programme may provide for the transfer of nuclear waste to another Member State, no Member State is obliged to accept such imports."
"When, finally, it comes to the safety of nuclear installations while they are being operated or decommissioned, I also wish to congratulate my colleague, Mr Seppänen, who has been very skilful in carrying out his work as rapporteur."
"The Commission’s proposal was not really satisfactory, and Mr Seppänen was not content to ask the Commission to try to come up with something better."
"Instead, he listed the shortcomings and put forward constructive criticisms, which my group and I support."
"Yes, our European Parliament and our Commission may genuinely be said to have worked well, overall, on this nuclear package."
"Mr President, I am sorry to hear that the Commissioner is ill this evening."
"I think her remarks addressed earlier to Mrs McNally were actually intended for me, but I am very happy to see that she is not symbolically sporting a headscarf in solidarity with Islamic fundamentalists."
"I would be appalled at that, but I am sure it is something she would never do."
"Your proposals, Commissioner, are totally misleading."
"Whilst superficially proposing to increase nuclear safety, they hide their true purpose which is to revitalise a totally defunct nuclear industry."
"The nuclear package represents a coordinated effort to prepare for further development of atomic power in an enlarged European Union and it has been stripped of all meaningful safety requirements."
"It will receive no support from my Group."
"Commissioner, you may have bitten off more than you can chew, but that is for you to decide."
"As an Irish MEP I would strongly urge non-nuclear countries like Ireland to take a stand against this nuclear package and I am sorry that it has not so far done this."
"I will be urging it to adopt such a position as this directive is not a first step in the right direction, but in fact a giant leap backwards."
"It is a recipe for a bureaucratic nightmare with zero safety gains."
"Regarding safety, the draft directive claimed that it would introduce common safety standards, but this directive, as drafted, does not set out those safety standards."
"It only sets out basic obligations and general principles."
"In fact it calls for pre-arranged reviews of nuclear safety authorities, rather than a proper inspection of nuclear facilities, and that is clearly nonsense."
"The current draft will not lead to an increase in nuclear safety in the EU or the accession countries, because all nuclear states in the EU and the accession countries are already parties to the International Atomic Energy Agency's Nuclear Safety Convention and must already report on the safety of nuclear power stations."
"Some inspectors think that it will actually have a negative effect."
"On the particularly thorny question of reprocessing, we have high level waste that needs to be made safe much faster than is currently the case, and this processing should be continued."
"Where is the justification for this directive?"
"It is illogical given the huge variation in size of nuclear programmes."
"We need to exclude the exportation of waste and indeed, as has already been said, the timetable is way out of line with what the Member States can achieve."
"Think again, Commissioner."
"This is a bureaucratic nightmare and a nonsense."
"– Mr President, what I basically want to say is that I think there is no justification for the European Parliament having no right of codecision in nuclear matters."
"That decisions should be taken about support measures for a source of energy that in any case gets preferential treatment without the approval of the representatives of the European people is contrary to every democratic principle."
"In the final analysis, this is about nothing more or less than European taxpayers’ money."
"Any increase in Euratom’s credit limit should be firmly rejected."
"The transaction limit has not yet been reached, so there is not even any need for the increase."
"Safety improvements and decommissioning measures can and must be funded from the money available."
"Euratom loans are fundamentally inconsistent with the directive on the internal market in energy and put other energy sources at a disadvantage."
"As I see it, the directive on nuclear plant provides for nothing other than the control of the controllers, but it does not, unfortunately, put in place the uniformly rigorous, transparent and legally binding norms in the field of nuclear safety that Parliament has been demanding for years."
"If further hindrances to free competition in the energy market are to be avoided, the funds for decommissioning and waste disposal must be administered transparently and in strict and invariable separation from each other, and must be subject to monitoring by an independent authority."
"The way the rules are applied in France and Germany, with reserves used for quite different purposes, is a threat to free competition in the energy sector."
"What can be said, in general terms, about the storage of radioactive waste is that the mere fact that there is no sure solution to how to dispose of nuclear waste shows how irresponsible it is to build new nuclear power stations."
"It also beggars belief that certain countries are able to get rid of waste that gives off radiation by exporting it to – of all places – those third countries that are not so fussy about nuclear safety."
"Mr President, I sympathise with the Commissioner over the vagaries of temperature in this building."
"To paraphrase William Shakespeare, I come not to bury radioactive waste but to praise nuclear energy: that is to say, to provide a reminder that nuclear energy is vitally important to European electricity and, therefore, our people must have great confidence in the safety standards applied to its generation."
"There has been an interesting debate about whether this should be a directive, which is binding, or a non-binding instrument."
"I would remind colleagues that the existing instruments covering nuclear safety – national regulations and the Convention on Nuclear Safety – are perfectly and wholly adequate."
"Let us remember that the buck stops with the Member States."
"However, what a directive can do is to change the perception individuals have of nuclear energy and their judgment as to whether or not it is safe."
"That is vitally important."
"I welcome the changes to the treatment of decommissioning funds in the main text, which was a very important issue."
"I also welcome the principle involved in the proposal on decommissioning waste – the principle of setting deadlines for adopting a programme and choosing a site."
"I say that because Member States must take decisions and they – my own included – must be pushed into taking those decisions."
"That is the vital role of this proposal."
"Let us have flexibility, but let us set deadlines."
"That also will enhance public confidence."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteurs and the Commissioner, and commiserate with her for her illness."
"Although she was actually speaking to Mrs Ahern, I hope that whatever happens to Kyoto, we would pursue policies on a no-regrets basis, which, apart from helping the climate, make complete business sense."
"The package is, as the Commissioner said, a response to the European Parliament, which is in turn responding to the very real fears and concerns of European citizens, as is our duty – my voice sounds rather similar to yours, Commissioner, I apologise: I too have a cold."
"Whatever one's views about the future of nuclear power, mine are considerably less optimistic than those of others who have spoken."
"I believe that market liberalisation means there is practically no future for nuclear power without a huge change in the ability of states to promote it."
"I believe that technical advancement in other forms of energy, including perhaps nuclear fusion, make the future very unsure."
"We are talking about the present, namely the present dangers of nuclear accidents and the present uncertainty surrounding the disposal of existing radioactive waste."
"I regret very much that the changes which the Convention could have made to the Euratom Treaty were not seized upon – in great cowardice – by Member States and by the Convention."
"As far as radioactive waste is concerned, there is no agreed solution."
"The Royal Society in the United Kingdom pointed out that the so-called solution of deep geological burial has many uncertain points which need to be solved technically."
"There is no public acceptance either in my country or in many others of deep-level storage."
"We must look at other possibilities, including partition and transmutation."
"The issue of decommissioning funds is one that has been rightly raised and is of great concern."
"I am glad that has been tackled."
"The risk of accidents, with which Mr Seppänen's report and your draft directive are concerned, has also been strengthened because of 11 September, as has the even more serious security question which is now facing us."
"I read today that Germany has come up with a somewhat bizarre solution which appears to be to cover nuclear power stations with artificial fog!"
"Frankly, we need to be a little bit more constructive than that."
"I have some doubts about the capability of the European Commission to have the resources and rigour which our citizens demand."
"Therefore, my Group, although it supports the two reports, wants a lot more from you, Commissioner, and from our Member States."
"I hope that will be forthcoming."
"Citizens really worry about these issues."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, even though the trend right across Europe is to leave nuclear power behind, the Commission is doing the donkey work for the ailing nuclear industry."
"Rather than opting for the energies of the future – by which I mean renewable energies – you are trying to revive the nuclear energy industry, using artificial means to breathe new life into an industrial sector that is already dead."
"This shows what close links you have with the nuclear lobby."
"What you, Commissioner, have put forward under the pretext of standardising safety norms in the enlarged EU is actually a massive programme of support for the European nuclear industry, which cannot pay its own way."
"Instead of imposing real standards of safety, what you are basically doing with these soft and undefined basic standards is, I believe, trying to give the public a tranquillising pill."
"What your nuclear package actually lacks is any hint of any drastic tightening-up of the safety provisions; on top of that, you are trying to impose the burden of monitoring the nuclear installations on the Member States."
"We know that you have no solution to the problem of disposal, so it does not help when you try to set really unrealistic deadlines for individual sites, and I find it even more scandalous that you are, indirectly, inviting the Member States to shuffle off onto Eastern Europe the problems with disposal that they have not been able to resolve."
"Especially in terms of the illegal dispersal and discharge of radioactivity into the environment, I regard that as enormously risky."
"Mr President, I also want to thank the Commissioner for the brilliant work she has done on this matter."
"I wish to comment on two things."
"The first concerns waste."
"Considering how Sweden, with its model project in Oskarhamn, has shown how highly radioactive nuclear waste can be got rid of, I would recommend those who are in doubt to go over there and see how it is done."
"You take a bus, travel five kilometres into the mountain, and you can see what they are doing. It is public and easily accessible."
"The method appears to be clearly delineated. It is well accepted, and the sites designated for possible final storage are well accepted in the municipalities, where more than 70% of citizens have agreed to have them."
"I consider the problem of waste to have been solved in technical terms."
"If anyone wants to carry on a smear campaign against nuclear waste, they are welcome to do so. We are all entitled to our opinions."
"I am pleased about the option of being allowed to export nuclear waste."
"In Denmark, we have 230 kilos from our experimental reactor and elsewhere which, under the current rules, we apparently have to store ourselves at an additional cost of approximately, or more than, EUR 100 million."
"If we are not permitted to place it with the very many tons that exist in other countries, we shall acquire an additional expense to no purpose."
"We are therefore pleased about being able to export waste to countries that will accept it, that fulfil the EU’s safety requirements and in which we are certain that inspection and such like guarantees that the waste is being constantly monitored."
"I am opposed to nuclear energy and opposed to the nuclear package."
"Nonetheless, I wish Mrs de Palacio an excellent year and, above all, very good health."
"That being said, our Parliament must not be led astray by the Commission on nuclear matters."
"I am adamant that what we have here is a concerted campaign to misinform and brainwash our populations, who are more and more sceptical about the nuclear issue."
"The Commission would like to convey the impression that, with the wave of a magic wand, it is settling the issue of the management of nuclear waste, whereas thirty years of research have ended in failure."
"Nuclear safety in the power stations of the new Member States would be better guaranteed without putting some new standard in place or by proposing to grant loans to the nuclear industry, thereby giving it an advantage over clean, renewable energy sources which have difficulty gaining a foothold."
"Whereas all opinion polls show that the problem of nuclear waste, some of which – it must be remembered – has a life span of millions of years, is our fellow citizens’ main worry in environmental matters, the Commission considers, in view of its project, that burying nuclear waste is apparently the solution, and this without scientific proof."
"If, by any chance, the European Parliament were to come out in favour of burying radioactive waste, this would be a disastrous political signal for the inhabitants of Bure in Lorraine, the prime site for carving out in a deep clayey stratum a laboratory designed for testing the reaction of highly radioactive nuclear waste."
"Without any comparative study and without any democratic European debate on the future of nuclear waste, this decision would give the Bure site its one-way ticket for burying European nuclear waste and would turn it into the nuclear dustbin of Europe."
"There is still time to respond by asking the Commission to try to come up with something better regarding waste management, both by proposing that waste be stored underground within the power stations and, above all, by putting in place new, demanding standards where nuclear safety is concerned."
"Finally, a last question, if you would allow me: how does the Commission intend to set about asking France to provide the public with wide-ranging information on the transport of nuclear material, when this issue has been classified as a top-secret defence matter since last August."
"Commissioner, I shall begin on a humorous note."
"I think your look suits you very well."
"I have, in fact, always called you the nuclear ayatollah, and I think that this evening’s photograph is likely to be almost perfect."
"I will limit myself to segregated decommissioning funds."
"These funds are the single biggest distortion in the liberalised EU electricity market."
"EDF, EON and RWE are buying up other companies with billions from these funds."
"Mrs de Palacio, when we discussed the Liberalisation Directive, we as a Parliament said that we should tackle this problem under the EU Treaty."
"You said: 'Don't worry, we will tackle it under the nuclear package under the Euratom Treaty, because that is a good way to do it'."
"I did not trust you at that time."
"Today we know that you fooled us."
"You knew one-and-a-half years ago, through your legal services, that it is not possible under Articles 31 and 32 to have segregated decommissioning funds."
"You waited for the legal services of Parliament and the Council to come out with it, but you knew it!"
"I challenge you to publish the legal service advice on the nuclear package so that the whole world will know that you fooled us on this issue."
"Mr Chichester, as a fair and plain-speaking English MEP, you got directly to the point when you asked what added value the directive has."
"It is a public relations exercise for the European public."
"You understood very well what this is about."
". – Mr President, we know all about ."
"It is just too bad."
"Such is life."
"I believe issues such as nuclear power are very serious indeed. It is not appropriate to tackle them from a religious standpoint."
"In my view it is important to make an effort to be rational. Account should be taken of the current state of technological development, the current state of the European Union, the current state of international and European institutions and of current energy needs."
"Problems such as meeting the Kyoto objectives should also be borne in mind. There is no scope for rabble rousing in dealing with such issues."
"Nonetheless, I do appreciate that concern might be felt. I also appreciate that the views of others might differ from my own."
"I can even appreciate that it is possible to hold a view running counter to the Commission’s proposals for solving these problems. After all, these are the very problems we are dealing with."
"I fail to understand, however, how plainly irrational positions can be adopted on this issue. It is an issue which is unfortunately very important for the future of the European Union and for the safety and well-being of its citizens."
"Today’s debate concerns initiatives regarding the safety of nuclear power stations. It also concerns the treatment of radioactive waste."
"Nuclear power stations are not the only source of radioactive waste. I would remind the House radioactive waste results from a whole range of industrial activities other than the generation of electricity."
"Medical procedures produce waste of this kind too."
"I am sure honourable Members are not opposed to medical applications. I am sure too that the House does not wish to put a stop to scientific advances resulting from progress made thanks to this technology."
"The fight against cancer is one example. I suggest all these aspects are discussed."
"It is essential to guard against seeing everything in black and white in a completely irrational way."
"I can understand all the approaches to this issue."
"What I cannot understand, however, is not making even the slightest effort to have a rational debate on such serious matters."
"Turning to the second point, it is claimed that what is on the table today serves no purpose whatsoever."
"May I enquire how these critics think the Union has been working with the candidate countries all these years?"
"It is alleged that the International Atomic Energy Agency alone is sufficient. Allow me to pose a further question."
"If that is the case, what is the Union trying to negotiate with Russia, for instance, with a view to improving the safety of its nuclear facilities?"
"It should be remembered that the candidate countries have all been members of the International Atomic Energy Agency from its creation."
"If there were no added value to the measures under negotiation and on the table today, none of them would have been necessary."
"Quite simply, all that would have been required would be to allow the candidate countries to continue abiding by their interpretation of the IAEA’s rules."
"In my view, the argument adduced by those who maintain that all this means nothing just does not stand up."
"All this actually means a great deal."
"It means equivalent safety standards will apply to all facilities."
"Candidate countries have been required to strengthen and improve measures."
"In some cases they have been required to shut down their reactors. What is on the table today means these same standards can be required everywhere and can be imposed in future."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this therefore amounts to guarantees."
"I find it impossible to understand the stance adopted by some individuals."
"It would seem they are opposed to the proposals and would actually like there to be an accident to blow everything sky-high."
"That attitude beggars belief."
"I simply cannot understand how it can be argued that strengthening safety means pandering to the nuclear industry."
"That amounts to saying it is best to leave things be and run major risks."
"This package is set to have significant impact on the safety of nuclear power stations. It will impact on waste management also."
"With regard to the latter, I grant that the dates set in the original text were over-ambitious. Nonetheless, cut-off dates will be set."
"Countries will therefore be forced to take decisions. It is important to bear in mind at the outset that there is no question of deep geological repositories being perceived as the only solution, to the exclusion of all others."
"Quite the opposite is the case. Research into waste disposal is being financed."
"In particular, this is true of all the research into transmutation. The latter is one of the most promising options for the future."
"This does not mean it is not appropriate to take certain measures here and now. I certainly agree with Mrs Isler Beguin regarding temporary geological storage."
"Finland has opted for this. The decision was taken to set up geological storage for fifty years."
"This is not a permanent facility. There is therefore scope for other solutions in the future."
"That is what is being suggested as a way forward. All Member States of the Union would do well to learn from the Finnish approach."
"Decisions should not be evaded and left for later governments to take. It is essential to assume responsibility and move forward on these issues."
"This is not the kind of issue the companies can deal with."
"It calls for decisions at the level of the governments and competent authorities in each of the Member States of the European Union."
"This proposal also has significant implications for funding."
"Such is the proposal prepared and endorsed by the Commission."
"I should state that it could only come about in the context of a global agreement with the Council. In any case the outcome would be far greater transparency regarding the nature and management of funds."
"I could quote a case where bankruptcy was declared. Subsequently, when funds where needed, none were available, because funds for decommissioning had been allocated to the bankruptcy fund."
"I am bound to say that work is under way within the Council. The outgoing Italian Presidency presented a number of proposals."
"I trust they will be taken forward by the incoming Irish Presidency, as they should facilitate progress on this crucial issue. They will also allow work to continue in this sector as it has in others."
"I have a challenge for certain honourable Members. I would like them to identify any directives predating the present Commission and providing genuine support and backing for renewable energy in Europe."
"I challenge the honourable Members to come up with any."
"I mean specific measures, not mere declarations."
"By contrast, I am certainly in a position to circulate directives prepared and adopted during the present Commission’s term of office."
"Further, I challenge anyone to come up with specific measures on energy efficiency predating this Commission’s term."
"There was hardly anything at all, other than declarations."
"On the other hand, I am indeed able to list the achievements of the last four years."
"In conclusion, Mr President, I should like to say that the Commission has not adopted an ideological stance with regard to energy. The Commission works on the basis of objectives and criteria."
"Its objectives are to guarantee the safety of the population, to provide maximum transparency for the citizens and to guarantee a safe and reliable supply of energy for the European Union."
"Consequently, the Commission works consistently in the interests of the citizens, employing a range of instruments. The Commission is constantly striving to promote energy efficiency and to support renewable energy."
"It also strives to ensure safety in the nuclear industry and the safety of radioactive waste. It should be remembered that as I mentioned earlier, nuclear power stations are not the only source of radioactive waste."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"I see that our rapporteur is requesting the floor, so we shall listen to him."
". – Mr President, Mrs Ahern is a much-respected fellow Member of this House and I hold her in high esteem. Sadly, at the end of her intervention she referred to the nuclear package as nonsense."
"That amounts to condemning as totally worthless the work undertaken by the Commission. By implication, Mrs Ahern also condemned as totally worthless the work undertaken in good faith by the rapporteurs with a view to improving on the Commission’s proposal."
"All this work was dismissed as nonsense."
"In my view, Mr President, nonsense is an unduly pejorative word to use."
"I would never resort to it to describe Mrs Ahern’s views and opinions."
"I would certainly refrain from referring to them as nonsense. I might say they were mistaken, lacking in rigour or unrealistic, but I would never dismiss them as nonsense."
"For the sake of my personal regard for Mrs Ahern, and in the interests of parliamentary courtesy, I therefore call on Mrs Ahern to withdraw the word nonsense. As I said, I believe it is unduly derogatory."
"Ladies and gentlemen, given what time it is and the state of the debate, we should be here all night, without anyone succeeding in convincing anyone else in this Assembly, if I were to give the floor to all the MEPs requesting it."
"That, in any case, is my own feeling."
"I shall, therefore, only give the floor for 30 seconds to Mr Turmes, as I have the impression that he has a genuine question to put to the Commissioner."
"After that, we shall conclude."
"I asked a question about the legal basis, Articles 31 and 32, and the decommissioning funds."
"I distrust the Commissioner."
"The only way I could believe the Commissioner would be for the Commission to publish its legal opinion on the nuclear package."
"Would the Commissioner agree to that?"
"I shall say simply that the legal basis – Articles 30 and 31 of the Euratom Treaty – has been accepted by the legal services of the Council and the Commission."
"If I understand correctly, Mrs Ahern, you are requesting the floor, on the basis of our Rules of Procedure, in a personal capacity."
"I give you the floor on that basis alone and for a maximum of one minute."
"Mr President, I wish to speak in a personal capacity on a point of order because I have been traduced here tonight by the rapporteur, Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca."
"I am entitled to my opinion, and so I repeat that this directive has been stripped of all meaningful safety requirements."
"It has to add to the existing safety requirements of the IEA, therefore it is a nonsense."
"Not only is it a nonsense, it is a scandalous nonsense."
"The genuine work that has been done is, as has been said, a PR exercise – a whitewash exercise."
"This is very clear from the Council's response."
"The Council has – and will retain – the ultimate responsibility for the nuclear safety of our citizens."
"Your minute is up, Mrs Ahern."
"I believe that everyone has been able basically to understand what the positions were on the various benches of the Chamber."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"The next item is the report (A5-0443/2003) by Mrs Breyer, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a Council decision amending Decision 77/270/Euratom empowering the Commission to issue Euratom loans for the purpose of contributing to the financing of nuclear power stations (COM(2002) 456 – C5-0570/2002 – 2002/0246(CNS))."
". – Mr President, I speak on behalf of Mr Solbes, who has asked me to convey his apologies."
"The Euratom loan instrument was set up in 1977, pursuant to a Council decision."
"It is a mechanism enabling the Commission to award loans to help finance nuclear power stations in the Member States."
"Following the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, the Commission broadened the scope and the loan instrument in 1994. The intention was to contribute to financing projects aimed at improving the safety and efficiency of nuclear power stations in the aforementioned countries."
"It was stated clearly that permanent closure of facilities was eligible for funding. The hope was that this instrument would encourage the countries concerned to undertake the necessary improvements regarding nuclear safety."
"The maximum Euratom contribution was set at 50% of a project’s cost."
"At the end of the 1990s agreement was reached on a loan to Bulgaria and Ukraine."
"As the sum involved was close to the maximum permissible for Euratom loans, the Commission found it necessary to inform the Council of the need to present a proposal to raise that limit."
"Romania recently applied for a loan. The Commission is due to consider the application this month."
"Should it be approved, the current limit on loans would be reached."
"There would be no further opportunities for finance and the Euratom instrument would cease to be operational."
"Consequently, it is not possible to accept any loan requests on that basis at present."
"Nonetheless, there are important sectors in which the instrument could be helpful to the Commission’s policy on nuclear safety."
"Firstly, the safety of eight nuclear power stations in three candidate countries is giving cause for concern. The Commission has called for their closure at the earliest possible stage of the enlargement process."
"Another possible important measure concerns first generation nuclear reactors in Russia."
"The Commission could play a part in their closure. It could also help to improve the safety of a number of Russian plants where work is not proceeding to plan due to lack of funds."
"Lastly, another project that could potentially benefit from Euratom funding involves improving the safety and efficiency of 14 plants currently operational in Ukraine."
"Every one of these projects concerns improving safety and facilitating the closure of unsafe power stations. If you, honourable Members, bear all these ventures in mind, you will readily understand why the Commission is calling for the Euratom mechanism to be increased by EUR 2 billion."
"The proposals would ensure that the countries joining the Union this year plus the remaining candidate countries could continue to apply for loans to improve safety and efficiency and also for loans to fund permanent closure following accession."
"Our proposals would ensure these safety projects would still be eligible for Euratom funding in an enlarged Union."
"Our proposal is as follows. We wish to raise the maximum level of loans, and modify the scope and the instrument."
"It is not, however, proposed to modify the scope of loans to Member States, as that would require changes to the Euratom treaty."
"New investment in the Member States is not formally excluded from the proposals. Nonetheless, the Commission believes priority should be given to nuclear safety and permanent closure."
"The Commission will have the opportunity of assessing the individual merits of applications when it studies each of them in turn."
"It would be prepared to combine both proposals if agreement were reached with the Council."
"I would, however, encourage the House to express its support for the Commission’s general guidelines on the proposals before they are submitted to the Council. The guidelines should encourage the Council to adopt the proposals."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, in November 2002, the Commission proposed that an additional EUR two billion in credit should be granted to Euratom, thus raising the amount already loaned from EUR 4 billion to EUR six billion."
"At the same time, because of the enlargement of the EU, the Commission changed the purpose for which the loan was made and the conditions to which it was subject."
"Euratom loans were first set up in 1977, and the amount has since been increased five times."
"The last time this was done, in 1990 – when the amount was increased to EUR 4 billion – the decision was taken that the credit limit of EUR 3.8 billion had to be reached before any increase could be considered."
"It is unfortunate that the committee has to date had no response to its query as to how much had actually been spent."
"The Commission’s calculations included EUR 688 million for the completion of K2R4 in the Ukraine, although it had to admit last October that this was not the amount spent on completing these reactors and that the Ukraine would be drawing on an amount of at least EUR 175 million, and at most EUR 500 million."
"I think it very important that we bear in mind the fact that this change in the situation regarding the K2R4 reactors is not in accordance with the 1990 resolution, especially in view of the potential legal difficulties."
"Even though the Council debates the amount of the Euratom loans and the use to which they are put, Parliament has not, officially and formally, been consulted about the EUR 2 billion increase."
"This enormous increase in credit has been the subject of critical debate, and my report gives expression to the regret that Parliament has not been consulted about it or about its potentially adverse effect on the European internal market."
"My report, moreover, calls on the Council to consult Parliament in the event of any substantial amendment to the Commission proposal, especially in view of the fact that the Commission’s proposals are combined in a single document."
"It is precisely because the Council is working on a single document, discussing both the amount of the loans and their conditions, that it would be most regrettable if this House were, today and tomorrow, to be giving its opinion on a document that is utterly obsolete – as will quite conceivably be the case."
"I would ask you to revisit this subject, for it would be a waste of our institution’s time and derogatory to this House’s dignity for us to hold a debate and vote on an utterly obsolete document, one that is currently being debated in the Council in a quite different way."
"We in this House expect the Commission to be honest about this."
"As has already been said many times over, the Commission proposal contains two decisions, and what this means is that the Commission is taking the proposals apart, while we in this Parliament are not consulted about the increase."
"It also means, though, that the Commission has not incorporated in its proposals the resolutions that this House discussed in the course of the debate on the Convention’s draft for a constitution, in which we urged that the Euratom Treaty should expire in 2004, by analogy with what had happened with coal and steel."
"I think you should bear that in mind as well, Commissioner;"
"Parliament has urged this on many occasions."
"Earlier in the debate, you yourself said that renewable energies are practically going without, so it is the case that only one source of energy receives loans of this sort."
"I would like to conclude by saying something very briefly. I am aware that what I say in my capacity as rapporteur has to reflect the position taken by the committee."
"In committee, there was a very close vote on the amendment from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, which provides for loans to be made only for plant already in operation and only outside the European Union, to avoid competition being distorted."
"Quite apart from the fact that the committee rejected that only very narrowly, we must, tomorrow, be very careful to bear this issue in mind when we vote. Having only recently debated and adopted the directive on the European internal market for electricity and gas, we should not tolerate any distortions of competition."
". – Mr President, the Commissioner has been on the receiving end of much criticism, so please allow me, outside my speaking time, to hasten to her aid and thank her for putting two proposals before us, enabling us, for the first time in this Parliament, to discuss nuclear safety."
"That is something quite tremendous and quite new, for which, Commissioner, many heartfelt thanks;"
"Mr Linkohr knows what he is talking about when he says that the Commissioner has put her head a long way over the parapet."
"On the subject of the Breyer report, let me say, as the Committee on the Environment’s rapporteur and also with real conviction, that we cannot imagine this House approving these proposals in their present form."
"The granting of Euratom loans for new nuclear power stations cannot be accepted under any circumstances."
"We all know that Euratom loans support the nuclear industry in a way that distorts competition; with their more favourable interest rates and their high political risks covered, nowhere in the whole of the energy sector is any other form of investment even comparable."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has made it abundantly clear that, of the European Union’s fifteen Member States, six have never taken up the production of nuclear energy, and six have decided to abandon it, which leaves just three Member States."
"That is something that must be borne in mind."
"We have also made it very clear that the issue of the final storage of nuclear waste remains unresolved until it is resolved worldwide. We may well know where we would like depositories to be, but we will not have them for another twenty years, so the building of new nuclear power stations is simply not acceptable."
"Funding should be given solely to projects to improve nuclear safety and to decommission installations, and not, as the Commission proposal envisages, to plant already in use."
"That is not acceptable."
"We do, though, want to have research projects, into pilot installations for safe final storage and into nuclear plant, and we want to see these supported."
"The introduction of uniform and binding safety standards throughout the EU is unreservedly to be welcomed, and for that thanks are due to the Commissioner."
"This standard is to reflect the state of the art."
"I believe that we are doing much as people did in the Middle Ages, when they dumped their ordure on the streets and wondered why they got ill."
"In that we have no final depositories, but merrily go on producing waste, we are still in the Middle Ages."
"I believe in human intelligence; we should do our research, look for solutions, and only when we have them should we produce."
"– Mr President, my colleague Mrs Breyer likes to compare this loan facility we are speaking of to state support for one form of energy production which creates market distortions."
"Sometimes it seems that the meaning of the word ‘loan’ was forgotten whilst the analysis was being conducted. The other theme has been the market distortions that result from systems of financial support."
"How much are renewable energy sources being subsidised?"
"Are we actually talking about loans, where every cent is paid back with interest?"
"There has been talk of the existence of other kinds of facilities."
"The Euratom loan scheme has served us Western Europeans for very many years."
"In recent years the benefits have been channelled mainly in the direction of the candidate countries."
"It is true that in the 1970s and 1980s nuclear power plants were built in Western Europe with the help of these loans."
"Loans for building new capacity, however, have not been used for a long time."
"The best example of this is funding for a new unit to be constructed in a certain country in northern Europe."
"Private investors were interested in building new nuclear power facilities so that a 1 600 megawatt unit would have had funding for the construction of a facility with 2 500 megawatt capacity."
"This is indisputable proof, if ever there was any, that Euratom loans are not needed to finance new capacity."
"There is nothing wrong with nuclear power plants in the candidate and other Eastern European countries receiving funding in this way to improve the safety of installations."
"It is interesting to hear Mrs Breyer encourage the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance to adopt a campaign against nuclear safety."
"I am in favour of the Euratom loan scheme continuing."
"It is important for improving standards of safety in nuclear installations in third countries."
"– Mr President, just a few words on the support measures: to be sure, past decades have seen a lot of money poured into the promotion of nuclear energy, just, incidentally, as it is today into renewable energies."
"I think that is right."
"If you put that in terms of kilowatt-hours, in the case of nuclear power, the amount is down in the one-thousandths, whilst, with renewable energy, we are talking about tens of cents."
"I am not saying that I am against it; I just want to make the proportions clear."
"Tomorrow, the issue of the Euratom loans will probably boil down to the question of whether we should support nuclear power stations in the course of construction or those that are being used, on which subject the only thing I have to say is that we are indirectly supporting nuclear energy in Russia by buying more and more gas from the Russians."
"Russia will be unable to supply much of this gas in future unless it cuts back on gas at home, which will be replaced by electricity from coal-fired power stations and from nuclear power stations that are being built."
"Perhaps we should give some thought to that when we talk about a European energy strategy."
"Our increased use of gas does, it is true, mean that we are improving our record on CO2-emissions, but elsewhere, more CO2 is being produced from coal-burning power stations, or nuclear power is being promoted."
"That is something else we should bear in mind; it shows that our own energy strategy is not always consistent."
"I believe that we should vote in favour of these Euratom loans, quite simply because of the improvement in safety."
"It was for this reason that the Council of Ministers, after Chernobyl, increased the funding for Euratom loans."
"I believe that the argument still holds water today."
"Mr President, there is no justification under Euratom for allowing the Commission to extend the Euratom loan by EUR 2 billion, as proposed in November 2002, bringing the loan up to EUR 6 billion altogether."
"This loan has been increased about five times since it was set up in 1977 and is a thinly veiled attempt to promote the nuclear industry: whilst asking for the extension of the loan, it also changes the condition and type of project to be funded in light of the expansion of the EU."
"This is akin to Enron's creative accounting."
"Indeed, we could even call it fraudulent accounting practice."
"You will get a similar, Enron-style scandal as a result of all this."
"It is compounded by questions of transparency and whether the proposals are not already obsolete."
"In addition, questions about the distortion of the market, particularly in regard to plant construction, have been raised."
"I am not satisfied that these loans are for safety as opposed to plant construction purposes."
"Indeed, I have evidence that construction activities are taking place."
". – Mr President, in reply to Mrs Breyer, I can say that, with the Council’s consent, the Commission would be prepared to merge the two proposals. That would allow both ceilings and conditions to be combined."
"In principle, there would not be a problem over this, provided Parliament agreed."
"The Council would have to give its consent, of course."
"What is at issue here is facilitating the decommissioning of a number of power stations and improving the safety of others. Essentially, it all relates to the countries due to join the Union in four months’ time on 1 May."
"I should like to assure Mrs Matikainen-Kallström that the European Union is currently making a great effort regarding renewable energy."
"It must be said that this effort has certainly intensified over the last four years. I am very proud of that, because I believe the Union has to promote renewable energy as much as possible."
"This does not mean it is not also bound to ensure the maximum possible nuclear safety across the European Union, as I stated just now."
"I admit I am capable of making mistakes, as are all of those who are present or absent today. Nonetheless, I am certainly not prepared to lie or to disregard the responsibilities incumbent on us all."
"To mention just one such responsibility, each and every one of us is responsible for ensuring not just the safety of supply, but also maximum safety for the citizens."
"Further, we are all responsible for ensuring compliance with the commitments entered into under international agreements such as the Kyoto Agreement."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"(1)"
"We now come to the resolution on urgent procedure:"
"The Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has already adopted a report on this subject."
"Mr President, thank you for giving me leave to express my support for urgent procedure in the case of this proposal for a decision."
"The proposed instrument provides for the continuation of the system of dock dues, with an exemption mechanism for certain local products from our four French overseas departments of Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Martinique and Réunion, for a ten-year period beginning on 1 July 2004."
"The proposal also extends the present regime for six months, from 1 January to 30 June 2004, to fill the legal vacuum that has existed since 31 December of last year, the date on which the last statute expired."
"I wish to commend the content of this proposal, which is the fruit of intensive consultation between the Commission, the French Government and the representatives of the four outermost French regions."
"My only reticence relates to the lack of flexibility in the exemption mechanism in the case of new products or activities."
"Be that as it may, this proposal will serve to maintain a vital source of revenue for our local authorities, especially those of the smallest communities."
"It will thereby help to sustain the present effort to foster the economic development of these areas in pursuance of Article 299(2) of the Treaty."
"I regret that our Parliament has been unable to devote sufficient time to the drafting of a precise report on the text of this proposal for an instrument that is crucial to the future of our outermost regions."
"I would nevertheless encourage the House to vote in favour of urgent procedure in order to fill the present legal vacuum, which is liable to have a highly detrimental impact on our overseas departments. We can thus clear the way for the adoption of this new system for the next ten years, leaving the French authorities enough time to transpose the decision into national law by the first of July."
"Mrs Sudre, the purely legal issue here is about whether we can vote on the substance of this motion on Thursday."
"We now come to the vote on the request for urgent procedure.(1)"
"The next item is the report (A5-0484/2003) by Mr Herzog on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the Green Paper on services of general interest (COM(2003) 270 – 2003/2152(INI))."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our vote on this report is eagerly awaited."
"Throughout this working year, I have experienced at first hand the vehemence and the passion of the political debate on this subject."
"Before Maastricht, local and national authorities made their choices, and those choices coexisted comfortably with the Common Market."
"Since the advent of the single market, conflicts and concerns have been rife."
"The fact is that a solution to these problems is still being quite literally prevented by the existence of taboos."
"Some boast of a proud record of liberalisation."
"In the opposite corner are those who regard public service and competition as incompatible."
"Others – and I hope there will be many of us – believe that liberalisation has had both positive and negative effects, that a better balance needs to be struck between commercial and non-commercial principles in the substance of laws and regulations and that such a balance would enhance cohesion and efficiency."
"An objective assessment of the real situation is needed, because the conviction that the market does everything better is becoming an article of dogma and is dividing Europe into two camps."
"It seems crucial to me that the legislature should be committed to redressing the balance and reconciling these conflicting principles in accordance with the great tradition of European civilisation."
"Many of my honourable colleagues accept the idea of a balance but consider that the power to strike such a balance rests exclusively with the local, regional and national public authorities."
"I absolutely agree that the decision-making rights of decentralised administrative bodies should be defended and strengthened, but I am convinced that the market will steadily erode them unless the Union acts as a guarantor of these rights and takes its due share of responsibility."
"And indeed our Community would not really serve any purpose unless it also provided complementary services in domains such as education, rail transport or information."
"My colleagues have rejected this line of argument, but I stand by my view that subsidiarity and co-responsibility must go hand in hand."
"Throughout history, Europeans – be they Christians or Humanists, Liberals or Socialists – have deemed it essential to ensure that services of general economic interest were so organised as to foster the development of the individual and enhance life in society."
"Let us not fall short of those ideals."
"Let us strive resolutely to bridge the gaps that divide our national communities with regard to the ethics of universal access to services of general interest."
"As to the matter in hand, why a framework directive?"
"Not for the sake of legislating, because we do more than enough of that."
"In this case it is necessary, however."
"It is time that the legislature itself interpreted the treaties instead of letting the Commission exercise all sorts of power – legislative, executive and judicial powers as well as powers of self-assessment."
"The Convention recognises our right to do so, having inserted a new article to that effect in the draft Constitutional Treaty, and the prevailing situation demands that we do so."
"Firstly, a legal framework must give services of general interest the status of a positive right in law rather than simply condoning the protection of such services as a derogation from the norm; rules governing the market and competition would then be bound to respect the status of these services."
"Secondly, there is a need to eliminate the profound uncertainty about the distinction between services of economic interest and those of non-economic interest."
"Key areas such as education, health and water must not be liberalised, and there is a need to recognise the increasingly numerous hybrid situations in which social, economic and environmental factors are intertwined."
"Accordingly, my proposals are designed to provide local authorities, non-profit businesses, semi-public companies and public-private partnerships with a general framework of more solid guarantees within which they can develop."
"Thirdly, there is a need to clarify the principles relating to funding and organisation."
"The Altmark judgment on state aid is a step forward, but it leaves serious question marks about the calculation of costs, while care must also be taken to avoid criminalising public operators."
"Fourthly, we want a pluralist and independent evaluation method to be established."
"To reject it would be an affront to democracy."
"Let me add that a framework directive would certainly be consistent with the sectoral directives."
"We therefore ask the Commission to respond quickly to the results of the consultation process it has launched and to the parliamentary vote by answering this question: what commitments is it prepared to make with regard to the legal framework, funding and evaluation?"
"Moreover, we refuse to accept the use of Article 86(3), which gives us no right of codecision, in its response to the Altmark judgment."
"I should like to offer my very sincere thanks to the numerous associations, NGOs, trade unions, local-authority networks and businesses which were consulted and whose opinions enlightened and assisted me."
"Like the elected politicians, they want to have the legitimate means to express themselves far more on the policies and rules of the Union."
"Let me also thank my fellow members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, who have shown great commitment, and particularly those who have been seeking compromises."
"Regrettably, a majority said no to a framework directive and no to a democratic evaluation."
"By so doing, they not only rejected my proposals and our compromises; they quite simply turned their backs on the resolution adopted by this Parliament in 2001."
"Tomorrow, the House can reaffirm its endorsement of that resolution."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I firmly believe that many of you, whether on the Right or the Left, are pledged to defend and promote services of general interest."
"For this reason, I strongly urge you not to retreat into party or national blocs but to make up your own mind on each amendment, on each article, motivated only by the general interest of the European people."
"Mr President, may I begin by thanking this House and especially Mr Herzog, your rapporteur, for the remarkable efforts you have devoted to this complex and delicate issue that the Commission raised in its Green Paper on services of general interest."
"The Commission believes that public services are at the heart of the debate on the future of the European integration process."
"Every country of the Union has public services which are rooted in unique traditions and situations, particularly those of a local nature."
"We regard the services of general interest as a vital component of the European social model."
"We believe that these services contribute to people’s quality of life and to the competitiveness of our industries and that they help to strengthen our social and territorial cohesion."
"This is equally true with regard to the future Member States, because the efficient provision of services of general interest is one of the keys to their smooth integration."
"In its Green Paper of last May, the Commission undertook its first full re-examination of Community policies on services of general interest."
"This review was essential, particularly in the light of your own demand, stated in the Langen report of 2001, which had initiated a debate on the question whether a general legal framework should be created at the Community level for services of general interest."
"At the present time we are in the process of finalising our analysis of the contributions received in the course of the public consultation."
"We have now received almost 300 contributions, many of which are very substantial, and they obviously merit detailed study."
"It would therefore be premature at this stage to draw precise conclusions from this work."
"We do, however, intend to formulate political conclusions before the effective end of this legislative term, thereby responding, in fact, to a unanimous request from your Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"There is undoubtedly a need to decide on the type of instrument that the Commission will be able to propose as a means of ensuring that Europe enjoys high-quality public services."
"One of the options that can be considered is a framework directive enshrining a number of common principles: equality of user access, universality, continuity, adaptability and evaluation."
"I am aware that this has been the subject of lively debate here in Parliament."
"Consideration can also be given to the adoption of a White Paper, pending the entry into force of the Constitutional Treaty, which contains what we regard as several steps forward on this point."
"In the meantime, a White Paper could define the political framework for our future activity or else provide a road map for the pursuit of the sectoral approach."
"To supplement these efforts, we are continuing our work on other matters relating to services of general interest, and particularly the application of the rules governing state aid, in the wake of the Altmark judgment."
"Clear messages have emerged from the public consultation on this point."
"We need greater legal certainty in the domain of state aid, particularly a mechanism for exemption from notification with adequate coverage, given the number of cases that could potentially be affected by the application of the Altmark ruling."
"In conclusion, our aim is to lay foundations that will enable the Community to play a more proactive role with a view to guaranteeing the provision of high-quality services of general interest to the public and to businesses."
"This approach will obviously have to take account of the subsidiarity principle, and our aim is to pave the way for the formulation of a coherent policy in favour of services of general interest within the Union, a policy that will provide the best possible elucidation of the relationships between the various tiers of government and of their respective responsibilities."
"Your resolution will be an essential and indispensable contribution to the definition of this approach, which is why the Commission awaits the outcome of your vote with eager interest."
". Mr President, I should like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Herzog, for the admirable cooperation which we had during the preparation of this report, which was drafted with enhanced cooperation between the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Committee on Legal Affairs."
"However, I should like to express my regret at the result of the vote in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which rejected the basic proposals of the Committee on Legal Affairs."
"The approach which we adopted jointly with the rapporteur does not turn a blind eye to the problems raised by the current situation."
"The vital question is not who owns services of general interest."
"It is clear that current developments allow the private and public sectors to work together."
"However, in order to avoid privatisation having a negative character, the basic rules governing the mission of services of general interest, including their basic operating and funding principles, need to be respected."
"Among other things, it is important for care to be taken in all cases to satisfy the needs of the entire populace."
"That is why the principles of universality, continuity, affordability and quality need to be guaranteed at Community level."
"The difference between ours and a liberal perception is that privatisation is not an end in itself and that it must not under any circumstances mean full dependence of services of general interest on market rules, as any such dependence would reach the point of even precluding funding by local authorities of services of general interest which serve local society."
"With certain services in particular, such as health, education and social services, the national authorities must have the right to lay down the rules which govern the provision of these services by private, profit-making agencies."
"I therefore call on the House, especially those who believe in the European social model as part of the European productive system, to vote for the amendments relating to what I have just said."
"Our resolution will be a balanced resolution if we accept the compatibility of the rule of competition with the mission of the social state."
"Furthermore, the proposal to adopt a framework directive should be accepted, as it was in the previous resolution by Parliament."
"If we want to ensure that the basic requirements of the working classes as a whole are satisfied, we must all work to safeguard the future of services of general interest."
". – Mr President, I would like to start with the most warm thanks to Mr Herzog, who had a difficult task as rapporteur and, having an explicitly left-wing stance, did not always find it easy to put his position across."
"He demonstrated a very great deal of willingness to cooperate."
"I would like to say that at the outset, for, on the substantive and fundamental issues, he and I are poles apart."
"What I am saying now I say on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, which, by a large majority, made a recommendation practically all of which the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs took on board, and whose first basic premise is that definition is a matter for the Member States."
"Rather than there being any need for a European model, it is the Member States or the sub-levels acting on their behalf that are competent in these matters."
"Secondly, the debate in which we are engaged is not about tampering with the efforts at liberalising certain sectors; on the contrary, we believe that this liberalisation in the internal market has, as a whole, albeit with some exceptions, been very successful and that it must not be jeopardised by European framework legislation."
"Thirdly, we discussed the legal framework."
"On 13 November 2001, we called for a framework directive on the basis of the article on the internal market."
"There have to date been no indications whatever of this being possible, which is why most of our group have changed their position on this issue."
"Commissioner Lamy, you have just given us a wonderful list of the options that are available – framework directive, White Paper, guidelines, exemption from notification and so on – but all that must be coherent."
"We have been discussing the topic for over three years, and the Commission was previously unable to give us chapter and verse concerning the various legal options available to us."
"Pleasing though what you have told us today has been to the ear, I do not believe that the Commission has finished its homework."
"Not the least reason why we have been debating this for so long is we have hitherto had only lists of issues, but no solutions."
"It is for that reason that our group takes the line that the Green Paper must as soon as possible be succeeded by a White Paper in which the Commission will at last come clean, elaborate on the legal issues involved in a framework directive, and clarify what the potential options are."
"Having already spent two years waiting for this, we can do no other than encourage you, as soon as possible after the decision on Wednesday, not only to get started on it, but also to put some concrete proposals before us."
"The last point I want to make is that water supply and individual regions are contentious issues."
"There are of course some local services that must continue in future to be offered by the responsible authorities at the local level."
"We are not interested in liberalising markets that are unsuited to liberalisation, but we are saying that each can decide whether something is to be done on an independent basis or whether it should be handed over to someone else."
"If, though, it is to be handed over to a third party, it must be put out to tender, so that the contract is awarded in an honest and transparent manner."
"That is the consensus to which we have come, and I hope that, having formed our opinions today, we will be able to adopt the whole Herzog report tomorrow."
"Mr President, let us simply remember that today’s debate on the future of services of general interest is taking place at a particularly significant moment in the history of Europe, at a time when Europe is in the midst of a debate on its future, on its constitution, and when we are preparing to welcome a host of new citizens of the Union from the countries of the East."
"I am reminding the House of this fact because I believe that a link exists between the difficulties we experienced, during the debate on the draft constitution, in reaching agreement on the recognition of a positive right to services of general interest and its enshrinement in European law and the considerable obstacles which we have encountered – and which our excellent rapporteur, Mr Herzog, certainly had to confront in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs – in trying to advance this principle."
"Moreover, I believe it would be extremely prejudicial if this report were less ambitious than the compromise – insufficient though it was, it did constitute an improvement – which we obtained in the framework of the debate on the draft Constitution."
"It would be difficult in these circumstances, ladies and gentlemen, to convince people that we are representing them properly, because I am not the only one who perceives a firm belief in the public mind that European integration will mean more services, better services, more protection, more safety – food safety, maritime safety, security in the widest sense – in this high-risk society."
"Broad-based movements within our European societies today are also voicing clear demands for the effective exercise of citizens’ social rights – the right to education, culture, health care, environmental protection, clean water and clean air as well as rights of access to housing, transport, communication, information, energy supplies, etc."
"In short, all of us – I hope – are convinced that these services are essential, but I have the impression that some Members of this Chamber are doggedly determined to reinstate scurrilous paragraphs which effectively detract from Mr Herzog’s excellent work."
"For example, they emphasise the inestimable benefits of liberalisation, but they will not manage to convince us, for the market cannot provide all of these services in accordance with the principles of equal accessibility and universality – hence the absolute necessity of a recognised positive right to services of general interest."
"This being the case, I hope that the amendments you vote to adopt tomorrow will rid us of a document which, in its present form, is extremely compromising for our European Parliament and will seriously undermine the dialogue in which we shall be engaging over the coming months with the people of every European country."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, unlike Mr Langen, I would like to say that my committee has painted a rather subtler picture than that presented in the regrettable contributions to this report from the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"I would like to take this opportunity to warmly thank Mr Herzog and say that, while it is unfortunate that too few of his good ideas have found their way into this draft, we may perhaps be able to make some corrections."
"The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy did indeed, with the support of votes from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, opt for European framework legislation, and our committee takes the view that services of public interest are something special; they are a characteristic, a distinguishing mark of the European social model, and that is something that we wanted the report to make abundantly clear."
"Let us, for example, consider the postal service."
"We are not opposed to liberalisation measures, far from it; our committee, too, has prepared them in various sectors."
"We know, however, how important it is for many people in Europe that there should be in their neighbourhood a post office – ‘office’ is perhaps the wrong word – a postal facility."
"That also plays a part in the European public’s satisfaction with public services."
"Alternatively, let us consider local transport."
"A majority in this House has rejected the Commission’s proposals for liberalisation – which I would describe as pigheaded – and the Commission is now finding it extremely difficult to come up with new ones, our view having been that public passenger traffic cannot be seen in black and white in the same way as trans-European freight transport or air travel, and that there are special interests involved in it, including regional ones."
"The Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism is therefore also of the opinion that local and regional authorities in particular must have greater freedom, the freedom to define."
"The fact is that this also plays a part in democratic politics, as the public, if they are dissatisfied with the services, can respond accordingly by voting certain towns’ governments out of office and other parties into it."
"It is especially in the provision of public services that this democratic element should not be overlooked, and so I hope that the Herzog report will enable even more to be done to strengthen social cohesion in Europe."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to thank Mr Herzog for his cooperation."
"Although our different views on policy made working together difficult, we managed together to get the report underway."
"How did we first get on to this topic?"
"The Commission alone possesses decision-making powers in respect of services of general interest – it has had in recent years an increasing tendency to take up these matters – and also as regards lawmaking in connection with competition law."
"Particularly with the constitutional treaty in mind, we were of the opinion that this was an area in which Parliament should gain greater competence."
"It was for that reason that we, too, originally favoured a framework directive."
"When debating the framework directive, though, we certainly have to ask ourselves questions about its substance too."
"Can we resolve the problems with competition law?"
"The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats came to the conclusion that the framework directive was inherently unsuited to doing that."
"The fact is that those who advocate it must ask themselves, over and over again, what a framework directive of this sort is meant to contain."
"Underlying the debate on services of general interest is, on the one hand, European law on competition in the internal market, and, on the other, the way in which ‘services of general interest’ are defined, by way of subsidiarity, in the Member States or even at the regional and local level."
"Not under any circumstances do we want services of general interest defined at European level in the future, be it in a framework directive or in the constitutional treaty."
"We are in favour of competence and responsibility at the local level, where competition can be introduced through tendering, in cooperation with the private sector."
"The EU of the future, though, with its 25 Member States, will be too diverse for us to lay down at the European level what this expression means."
"That is why we say ‘no’ to a framework directive and ‘yes’ to local competence, particularly when it comes to the supply of water."
"This is where the Commission should start by putting before us evidence for competition being a good thing in postal services, public local passenger transport and in other areas such as energy."
"It is particularly with France in mind that much lost ground has to be made up, and you, Commissioner Lamy, should resolve these problems before tackling any new projects."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, not for the first time, but yet again, the debate on the Green Paper shows that services of general interest, the way in which they are provided and structured, are more than ever in the spotlight, not only in terms of political debate but also of the European public’s concerns about universal access to services."
"For us in this Group of the Party of European Socialists, they are an indispensable component of any model of European society – I will explicitly use the word ‘component’, as this is not about developing a European model for services of general interest; they are an essential and elemental component in a European social model with objectives common to all European societies."
"They play a crucial part in improving the quality of life for all citizens and in overcoming economic stagnation, social exclusion and isolation."
"This is where I want to attempt to clear up a misunderstanding."
"This is not about our having the market and competition on the one hand and services of general interest on the other."
"Services of general interest can perfectly well be provided by market instruments in a competitive context, but we have to take note of the fact that there are also situations in which the market does not provide such services efficiently, and that is when the democratic community has to be able to ensure that such services can be provided outside the market’s machinery."
"This interaction highlights our need for a bit more legal clarity."
"That is why our group endorses the rapporteur’s thinking on this, and this is where I too want to extend warm thanks to Mr Herzog, who really has done everything possible to bring about compromise; even though he is the rapporteur, he has changed his position in essential areas, and I think it is rather a pity, in view of this achievement, this attempt at consensus, that there are elements in this House that have quite simply refused to give him credit for it."
"We endorse the report because we need it if we are to have legal certainty and a common legal framework within which these issues can be dealt with, but, above all else, we want Parliament to have a part in it, and on that point I want to say something in response to Mr Langen’s statement that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has, in the meantime, come to an agreement that they do not want a framework directive after all, on the grounds that Article 95 does not allow it."
"I do not see that such is the case at all; you decided that you did not want one, and the reason why you did so was that a majority of you no longer saw it as politically acceptable."
"For whatever reasons you did this, we can understand them, we can live with them, but please do not try to tell me that it cannot be done for lack of suitable legal basis."
"That has never bothered us before, and quite right too; when we wanted to get something done politically, we found the legal basis for doing so, and, as the Commission is a veritable master at doing this sort of thing, now is the time for us to support it in finding one."
"There is absolutely no doubt about the fact we want it, but Parliament’s right of codecision must be safeguarded if we do."
"Of course, a legal framework of this sort needs to contain some substance, and I urge that we should, in future, spend more time discussing substance than this or that legal basis."
"That is what our debates should be about; there is a whole range of items that have to be embedded in a framework of this sort, and I want to list just six of them."
"As I have already said, the framework directive must aim to give the stakeholders legal security when current Community law is applied to what they do."
"There is, quite clearly, no disagreement about the fact that the actual definition, structure, organisation and funding of services of general interest lie within the remit of the Member States and their sub-divisions – that is, of course, the municipalities, where these have the relevant competence."
"It follows that it is not worth working towards a uniform and all-embracing European definition, but there are a number of standards and a few criteria that of course amount to the same thing and that also have to be embedded in it."
"Universality, for example, is one of them, as are also continuity, the quality of the service, efficiency, affordability and also the involvement of the users and the democratic supervision of the service providers."
"Far more than was the case in the past, we have to concentrate on the actually essential point: when is an activity economic and when is it not?"
"That is the yardstick by which we determine whether or not the rules on competition or the internal market should apply, and I see this as the area in which we should pursue the debate."
"So, the situation being as it is, we say ‘yes’ to a legal framework of this kind, and let us discuss its substance rather than any legal bases."
"Mr President, first of all, I should like to thank the rapporteur for his considerable efforts, even though he and I are definitely not in agreement."
"I am, however, very pleased about the discussions to which this report has led, with their focus upon a list of important issues concerning services of general interest."
"It has been a refreshing political discussion, reflecting the political differences in this House."
"On behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I should like to express support for the report, as adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"For the ELDR Group, it is important to emphasise that the liberalisation already implemented by a range of sectors has generally been a great success."
"It has meant the creation of approximately one million new jobs and, in particular, better service for less money."
"At the same time, the issue of whether or not Parliament should demand a framework directive has been of crucial importance to the ELDR Group’s support for the present report."
"I should like to emphasise that the ELDR Group does not support a framework directive."
"The purpose of a horizontal directive would be to freeze a number of areas which, as we know by experience, develop the whole time."
"There is absolutely no need for this at a time when we in Europe are already lagging behind with economic reforms."
"On the contrary, we should support further liberalisation, but on equal conditions."
"This must, however, take place via sectoral directives of the kind of which very successful use is already being made in a number of sectors."
"In the ELDR Group, we are, as I say, convinced that it will be neither possible nor desirable in a framework directive to establish any usable definitions of services of such different kinds as are at issue in this House, at the same time bearing in mind the large regional and national differences that exist in the area of services of general interest."
"We recognise, however, the doubt and uncertainty to which what is termed the Altmark judgment, concerning the funding of locally based services of general interest, has led."
"We therefore wholeheartedly support the Commission’s reflections concerning a legal initiative to clarify this issue."
"Nor, as I say, do we think, however, that a framework directive would be of any help in this context."
"If it were a question of a legal initiative, we should, however, greatly regret the fact that the existing Treaty does not give us in the European Parliament power of codecision concerning such an initiative."
"To dispel any doubt, I should like to emphasise that our opposition to a framework directive does not in any way mean that we in the ELDR group want the duty to supply certain services of general interest to disappear."
"On the contrary, we believe that such a duty could easily go hand in hand with liberalisation and, for example, environmental requirements, if only the political authority were to require this."
"Responsibility for demanding quality lies, of course, with the political authority, which must also ensure that the demands are complied with."
"I want us to obtain more value for money."
"Mr President, in spite of the power of work that Mr Herzog has put into this report, I have to say from the outset how far the report, as adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, has fallen short of our hopes and expectations for a vigorous European instrument on services of general interest."
"My group cannot accept it."
"The text has become an ode to liberalisation with one single aim in mind, namely to make competitive market forces the sole regulator of service provision."
"Recital H, for example, emphasises that liberalisation in leading sectors in the internal market is a factor in technological progress and economic efficiency, while paragraph 13 welcomes the liberalisation that has taken place in the fields of telecommunications, postal services, transport and energy."
"Even the moderate proposal calling on the Commission to perform without delay a precise and comparative evaluation of the real impact of the policy of liberalisation of services of general interest before embarking upon further liberalisation, a proposal contained in the Langen report which was approved by this very House, is not endorsed in this report."
"On spurious pretexts, the report also discards the aim of a framework directive in which services of general interest and the obligations they entail for governments as well as for public and private operators could be defined more precisely."
"Only basic education and social protection would remain in the public sector."
"This is far removed from the sort of approach that is absolutely essential for the protection of people’s fundamental rights to energy and water supplies, transport, housing, communications and information."
"The purpose of services of general interest should be to guarantee these rights in accordance with a number of principles, namely equal access for everyone, information, consultation, user and worker participation and financial viability."
"It is impossible to achieve this ambition by relentlessly continuing to pursue the sole aim of liberalisation."
"This text is unacceptable as it now stands."
"The hopes and expectations aroused by the Green Paper were that public services would play a pivotal role in guaranteeing economic, social and environmental rights, that the true ambition of Europe was to satisfy the needs of the greatest number in a society characterised by solidarity."
"It follows from these remarks that my group will support all the amendments that are designed to remove the constantly recurring references to liberalisation and those which strengthen a model of services of general interest that are worthy of the name."
"My group reaffirms the need for an evaluation."
"It emphasises that services of general interest are elementary public services."
"It also expresses its desire to confirm unambiguously the right of local and regional authorities to choose freely the way they administer the services of general interest for which they are responsible."
"These things, at the very least, must be guaranteed if the services of general interest are to be an engine of solidarity in Europe."
"Mr President, on behalf of the ecologists’ group I should also like to pay tribute to the political and intellectual achievements of Mr Herzog in this assembly over many years and particularly to his work on this report."
"As several speakers have already said, this report, compiled on the initiative of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, is essentially designed to clarify the terms of the debate and particularly to ensure that the opening of individual sectors of the economy to competition in the European Union is accompanied by greater legal certainty and is subject to funding guarantees and an evaluation requirement."
"Let me say that the Greens will support the amendments that have been re-tabled in plenary in order to return to the spirit of Mr Herzog’s original proposal."
"I should like to add two elements to the debate."
"Firstly, I must remind the House that the Convention also debated this issue and concluded that there was a need for a legal basis other than the one currently provided by the treaties."
"Accordingly, if the European Parliament, in tomorrow’s vote, were to come out against the position of the Convention, we should have an interesting conflict of political legitimacy between the two bodies."
"Secondly, I would add that, in the course of this debate, we ecologists have observed that there is a curious underlying alliance between the advocates of maximum subsidiarity – a precept, incidentally, that is also supported by Mr Herzog and our group – and those who believe that there must be no barriers at all to engagement in free competition."
"As a result of this alliance, there is basically no agreement within the European Parliament, just as there is no agreement in the Council, on the need to proceed towards framework legislation."
"So I should simply like to ask the following question: when we have all delivered our speeches, who will be the winners in this debate?"
"It clearly will not be the advocates of subsidiarity but rather the defenders of the right to engage in unbridled competition."
"The fact is that, month after month, we vote on sectoral directives, and we can see how difficult the Court of Justice finds it to justify the imposition of any obligation to provide services in the public interest."
"The result is the reinforcement of a European model which is largely based on tax, wage and welfare competition between locations."
"If we want to redress this imbalance to some extent, we really need greater legal certainty in order to guarantee the funding of services of general interest, however they may be defined by the Member States."
"For this reason I call on each of you to reflect on this dubious alliance between those who aspire to define services of general interest in their own countries and regions and those who swear by completely free competition with no holds barred."
"We agree with the former but urge them to dissolve their alliance with the latter."
"Mr President, I can still remember vividly the time, in our November 2002 session, when Mr Herzog’s report on state aid was adopted by one vote."
"Nevertheless, the report adopted had been amended to such an extent that nothing remained of the original proposal."
"It looks very much as though Mr Herzog has problems now, too, with the point of view of the majority in Parliament, which rightly opposes the introduction of a framework directive on services of general interest."
"Even before the European Commission presented its Green Paper in May 2003, the rapporteur had presented a working document containing his views."
"That was too quickly and too soon to answer the questions that the Commission presented to Parliament in its Green Paper."
"It is regrettable that the Green Paper was not a visionary document, but the fact that the rapporteur already had a view on the Commission proposal before the proposal was made is downright premature."
"The Green Paper rightly draws attention to the powers of national and regional authorities with regard to services of general interest."
"It is my firm belief, therefore, that it is a matter for national and regional politicians to take decisions on services of general interest."
"I do not see any need for granting the Commission new powers in this area, therefore."
"I can endorse the proposal adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"Mr President, I too would like to praise Mr Herzog for the work that he carried out both enthusiastically and seriously."
"I believe, however, that the text that came out of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs gives, in a way that is more in line with the current climate, an accurate picture of the situation and the prospects as regards services of general interest."
"Services of general interest make up a substantial part of the European economy, which is increasingly becoming an economy of services; liberalisation and competition, also within this extremely important sector, are essential to the dynamic nature of the European economy and its capacity to grow and create jobs."
"I believe that it would be a mistake to think that it is possible to set in stone the situation regarding the provision of services of general interest within the context of a framework directive or within new legislation."
"It is not easy to define these sectors, which are sectors that are forever evolving: what today is a public service, may tomorrow be a sector in which providing products and services is completely assured by the market."
"It would be a mistake to enshrine this and set it in stone."
"I believe that, as is stated in Article 19 of the report, the current provisions for the internal market and competition ensure, in itself, that in this and other sectors, public measures, where necessary, are adopted within the context of the rules already laid down by the Treaties, guaranteeing that the economy providing public services is competitive and dynamic."
"Otherwise, there would be stagnation and the European economy would be in jeopardy."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Herzog, for an extremely comprehensive piece of work and for many fruitful discussions, even though we have not been completely in agreement."
"I also wish to thank the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs who have contributed through many discussions and many sound amendments so that, in the end, we have obtained a result from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs that I think is very good."
"I am not well disposed towards a general framework directive."
"In my opinion, it would offer no advantages but, instead, be confusing."
"It would be like an extra layer of legislation between the internal market’s rules of competition and the sectoral directives, and it would also be an obstacle to product development."
"The process of gradual deregulation of the EU markets has been the most important component for improving services of general economic interest during the last decade."
"Another of the reasons for the deregulation has, of course, been the generally poor quality of the services before the market was opened."
"I am anxious that we should not again find ourselves in a monopoly situation."
"I should therefore like to call upon Parliament to go with what came out of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, stated in Mr Herzog’s report, and not to vote in favour of the amendments from the Left."
"If we go with the position of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, we stimulate competition and product development and provide opportunities to offer consumers both cheaper and better alternatives."
"Mr President, I congratulate Mr Herzog on an excellent report."
"I hope that tomorrow Parliament will rectify matters by overturning the rejection of the framework directive proposal by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"This is not the end of the debate: this is a debate on a Green Paper and is the beginning of what I think will be a fairly long debate."
"Parliament is seeking, in this debate at least, to give some guidance to the Commission as to how it should proceed with regard to services of general interest, both economic and non-economic."
"For me the issue of general-interest services – both economic and non-economic – is a line in the sand between those who favour a social market economy model and those who favour a neo-liberal market economy."
"It is not acceptable that we should move by stealth to denying citizens their rights as citizens, which citizenship grants them in Europe, by making competition the only measure of service provision."
"The OECD has estimated that in the 1990s governments in Europe transferred about EUR 300 billion of public-service property to private operators, in some cases with disastrous results in terms of both service provision and, indeed, loss of life."
"As a Union and a Parliament we have to stand by access for all to high-quality, affordable services, and we must recognise that those services dictate the quality of life of our citizens."
"We have made progress in Amsterdam, in the Charter of Fundamental Rights and in the new draft Constitution on re-establishing the rights of citizens to public services."
"We must defend those rights."
"It is not a question of defending an , but of looking to see how high-quality services to our citizens can be guaranteed across the board in what are new circumstances."
"In particular, we must defend the advances we have made in the constitution on this matter."
"Mr President, the single market is undoubtedly the most important achievement of the European integration process at the economic level."
"Europe has given us a single large trading area without barriers, with 375 million consumers now, soon rising to 450 million."
"Over the last ten years, the market has been increasingly extended into other sectors, such as telecommunications, postal services, transport and energy."
"The European market is a socially corrected free market, which means that the markets in these sectors have been opened up in a gradual, controlled – and successful – manner."
"This has resulted in greater competition and modern service provision that is of better quality and lower-priced."
"This liberalisation has by no means had any harmful effects, therefore, and the example must be an inspiration to other sectors."
"The Commission Green Paper is certainly not before time, and deserves particular credit."
"It is indeed necessary to examine whether we can apply the operation of the internal market and the opening-up of the borders to other services of general, and particularly economic, interest."
"What other possibilities are there for breaking state monopolies whilst continuing to guarantee that all citizens obtain the best service at an affordable price?"
"I share the feelings of many others in thinking here of the water supply, waste management and even information sectors, for example."
"The debate on this subject must be held not only here, however, but also with national or even regional authorities, which are now often responsible for managing these sectors."
"We must use the results of this wide-ranging, interesting and indeed already productive debate to examine whether, and if so how, European legislation can be of benefit, especially to citizens."
"Mr President, Mr Herzog really has had a thankless task."
"If there is one area in which opinion in this Assembly and general opinion throughout the EU is deeply divided, it is precisely this area."
"The problem is that we have legislation for the internal market that is in actual fact an invitation to unrestrained and unlimited competition where both goods and services are concerned."
"That is something we cannot live with. It is said that it is mainly a question of services of economic interest."
"Which services are not of economic interest?"
"Is not the education sector of economic interest?"
"Is not the health sector of economic interest?"
"Are not all the social services of great economic interest?"
"We are talking about welfare policy as a whole and about something that really is political dynamite."
"If there is a desire for balanced development and for stopping this general attack on the welfare sectors, what is to be done?"
"Are we to pin our faith on a framework directive?"
"I am a little unsure."
"In and for itself, a framework directive could place limits upon legislation governing the internal market."
"It would of course be good for calming things down and reducing the intensity of antagonisms."
"In the political climate of today and of the next few years, I am afraid, however, that such a framework directive would be heavily dominated by adherents of the market and by right wing forces."
"In that case, such a directive would be a step in the wrong direction and might instead become a trap."
"Is decentralisation a better alternative?"
"Is it better to focus upon protecting local and regional activities?"
"It would perhaps open up certain other possible ways of securing a type of protection and increased opportunities for conducting a local campaign to protect what we wish to preserve."
"Above all, however, we need time for research and discussion as a counterweight to the giant battle we face over the next few years."
"Mr President, it is interesting to see that none of our British Conservative colleagues are here today to support their record on liberalisation in such areas as the railways."
"A recent UK parliamentary report on water privatisation has shown that many poorer people, such as pensioners, have had such difficulty in meeting their bills that they have been cutting their water use to a bare minimum."
"In some cases this has been described as verging on a public health crisis."
"The drive for privatisation has also been part of a drive to reduce costs in the public sector and this has often resulted in wage squeezes that have hit the lowest paid."
"The tab for that is still picked up by the public purse through effectively subsidising wages in that area."
"Those people may be on a minimum wage, but it is not necessarily a liveable wage."
"That is not to say that everything in the public sector has been perfect, but in our view a lot of the claims made for liberalisation in this report are highly questionable."
"My Group does not believe that general-interest services can be treated in the same way as companies which produce, for example, plastic key rings."
"It is not an area that should be subject to general competition policy and we have tabled amendments to that effect."
"We believe that competition rules need to give way to general-interest services, and not the reverse."
"We agree entirely with the Commission on the need for legal clarity."
"That is an issue we have often raised in connection with GATS and is the subject of an amendment we have tabled and for which we hope to win support."
"Mr President, in the belief that they are curbing the excesses of Community competition law, certain Members are playing with fire."
"The answer to these excesses is to change the law or at least to make explicit provision for an unqualified derogation for public services."
"The aim must remain an equally high standard of service for everyone, not the quest for profitability which would throw open these public services to competition."
"It is therefore dangerous to seek to establish a European definition of services of general interest."
"First of all, a coherent definition would be impossible in view of the diversity of territorial structures and national practices, and then the political will to formulate such a definition is lacking, as is even a simple majority in favour of definition."
"My group is in favour of deliberations that would culminate in the identification of the interests that are common to all European service users and of measures to guarantee the funding of the identified services."
"This Green Paper and this report, which proclaims the success of the liberalisation measures that have been taken to date, are very far from satisfying this need."
"The Convention’s draft Constitution, which the European Council rejected in Brussels, would not have changed anything, because it also subordinated services of general interest to competition law."
"A structure has been put in place, and its aim is clearly to dismantle the public services that exist in some of the Member States."
"The important thing for my group is that we should be able to discuss these things democratically with our peoples, recognising their ultimate right to choose the model they believe should be developed in order to guarantee the social and territorial cohesion of their respective countries."
"In conclusion, we shall not endorse this report, although we shall, of course, vote in favour here and there to support the less distasteful proposals."
"In this way we shall answer the rapporteur’s call, but we would also ask him to reflect further on the purpose that would be served if the present report were adopted in its entirety."
"– Mr President, the rapporteur, Mr Herzog, is unhappy with the amended version of his report on services of general interest that was adopted in committee, and this is understandable to some extent, because, irrespective of political positions, the text of the report is not very coherent."
"Numerous paragraphs are contradictory."
"For example, while paragraph 36 calls for the adoption of a framework directive establishing common European rules, paragraph 20 strongly condemns the selfsame approach."
"For our part – and here we differ from the rapporteur – we believe that the framework directive, which was the idea of the last French Presidency, would only serve to divest the Member States of essential regulatory powers, as the services in question are closely linked to the unique character of each society."
"Moreover, it would be too generalised, would be inapplicable to any individual case and would create endless difficulties."
"These are very delicate problems and should be solved by each government at the closest possible level to the people in the framework of the national democratic system."
"In this respect I am, moreover, only half surprised that the Left is nailing its colours to the mast of centralisation and enforced uniformity here."
"For the same reason we are opposed to Article III-6 of the draft European constitution, whereby European law, in other words the legislative decisions of the majority in the Council and the majority in Parliament, would be able to define the principles and conditions applicable to services of general economic interest."
"If this article were adopted, it would very soon have adverse repercussions on the freedom of choice of our national democracies and on subsidiarity."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the first thing we have to bear in mind is that this is not a legislative procedure, but we are discussing our position on the Commission’s Green Paper."
"Although we had asked for something else, the Commission has responded to the Langen report by presenting us with this Green Paper."
"Secondly, I would like to thank all the rapporteurs, who have approached this from many different angles in the course of the discussion process, for preparing, in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, a very good resolution, and one that is likely to get majority support now that it is to be voted on by plenary."
"Thirdly, the question arises of what services of general interest are."
"We take the term to mean services for the public that are provided in the interests of all."
"They are meant to provide services where the market alone cannot do so on a universal basis, at a reasonable price, or, in many instances, free of charge."
"Services of general interest ensure security of supply."
"Service providers may compete among themselves, but they do not have to."
"Support from public funds is required."
"What is crucial is not who provides the services but the fact that they are provided."
"Services of general interest are an expression of the European social model and of the ecologically-responsible market economy."
"What was crucial for me was the safeguarding of the subsidiarity principle;"
"I can endorse the Social Democrats’ Amendment No 18."
"I welcome the statement that the liberal professions perform services of general interest for the good of all, and I am glad that we have made it our concern that the definition of services of general interest and responsibility for them should be matters for the Member States rather than for Europe as a whole."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should naturally like to say a big ‘thank you’ to the rapporteur, Mr Herzog, for the quality of his work and for the opportunity he has given us to debate the issue of services of general interest today."
"Even if it is not taking place within the framework of a legislative process, our debate today is fundamental, because it deals with the borderline between the world of the market, where competition has to prevail, and that other world where solidarity, equality and democracy – in short, social cohesion – must be paramount."
"It is fundamental, because our European model, the envy of the world, and the most elementary civil rights, chiefly enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, are at stake."
"Within the European population, among associations, trade unions and local authorities, there is grave concern, because the various experiences of liberalisation or privatisation – and I need only cite the British experience – have had rather adverse consequences."
"This is why we propose that the report, which is totally unacceptable in its present form, should undergo substantial amendment."
"First of all, we propose a thorough public, pluralist and open evaluation of the development of services of general interest, perhaps through an observatory of services of general interest."
"In actual fact, we find it difficult to understand the opposition of the Right to this proposal if, as its adherents loudly and proudly proclaim, the effects of liberalisation have all been beneficial."
"Because of the ambiguity of the criteria used to distinguish between economic and non-economic activities and to guarantee the subsidiarity that everyone is demanding, certain areas of activity – education, health care and social housing – will have to be explicitly excluded from the application of the competition rules."
"By the same token, there is a need to protect the right of municipalities and other local authorities to choose democratically the way in which they manage certain services – water and refuse disposal, for example – in accordance with local needs."
"Lastly, the Member States and their territorial subdivisions and local authorities are, of course, responsible for services of general interest, hence the need for a framework directive which could truly establish a set of common principles for services of general interest."
"It is surely a matter of summoning up the will, at a given moment, to protect the citizenry of our countries."
"This is how one vision of Europe can be understood."
"Mr President, while I likewise salute the great energy expended by Mr Herzog and all his hard work, I wish to say very clearly that I really cannot vote tomorrow for this report as amended and adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"I oppose this report because it is the expression of an ultraliberal will."
"It has been hijacked for use as a weapon in the campaign to demolish our social model, destroy jobs and abandon the policy of regional development."
"Should the plenary Chamber endorse the position of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs tomorrow, we should have no choice – as several speakers have already said – but to reject this proposal and demand a proper framework directive and genuine European public services."
"We still have time to set matters right."
"That needs to be done for the sake of the overwhelming majority of European citizens."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I support all those who believe, as I do, that services of general interest are, first and foremost, committed to the common good."
"We understand a European social model to mean that the public must be guaranteed these services, and that is why they are not primarily a political task for the Commission, but a matter for local and regional authorities."
"The task of the Commission is to ensure that such services are facilitated and secured in local communities; it must defend services of general interest in the GATS negotiations, where it must ensure that local communities have room to manoeuvre, so that the public may be guaranteed these services in the interests of social justice, solidarity and territorial cohesion."
"It is for the Commission to set up the framework in such a way that services of general interest are protected."
"Mr President, Mr Herzog’s report, caught as it was between the rapporteur’s ambitions and the wariness – in my view the excessive timidity – of the parliamentary committee, illustrates how difficult it is for us to sit down together and define a model for European society."
"I believe we have to escape from this dilemma, but we must leave in an orderly manner by the front door."
"First of all, it is necessary to affirm the fundamental legitimacy of services of general interest."
"There is a set of public assets that must be organised more or less in the form of exemptions to the rules of the market, either because they need to be subsidised by the public authorities if everyone is to have guaranteed equal access to them or because the principle of equality is incompatible with excessive price fluctuations."
"There is therefore a need to reaffirm the axiom that we are in a market economy, not a market society."
"Secondly, a legal framework is necessary, otherwise we should all have to give up our common ambition."
"This framework must begin by specifying where competence lies in accordance with the subsidiarity principle, in other words the level – European, national or local – at which services should be organised."
"The legal framework must also specify the scope of services of general interest – how far their definition may legitimately be extended."
"And, lastly, it must define the principles governing the way in which they are to be organised."
"In particular, care must be taken to ensure that no service of general interest is abused or becomes a monopoly, generating a secure income for those who provide the service rather than its beneficiaries."
"All these things have to be said."
"Finally, the legal framework must be democratically structured."
"We in this Parliament cannot abdicate our responsibilities."
"We cannot be like the frogs who demanded a king."
"This is a matter that concerns the public, the peoples of Europe."
"Together with the Commission, we must establish a legal basis that enables us to set this issue within a democratic framework on the basis of a proposal from the Commission and with the Council and Parliament acting by codecision, otherwise we should be failing in our duty."
"Mr President, Commissioner, this report cannot be detached from the European context."
"What do the people of Europe remember about the EU in these past few months?"
"They remember the division over foreign policy, they remember the split over budgetary policy, they remember the deadlock on the draft constitution, and they remember the feeling of impotence as they watched the dollar soar in value."
"If the social model were to be taken away from them, what would be left in the coming months?"
"The social model is their one source of pride in Europe at the present time, and services of general interest are part of that social model."
"The market is a fine thing, but we are not about to replace the dictatorship of the proletariat with the dictatorship of the shareholders."
"We are not about to enshrine the principle of an all-powerful market which is familiar to those who live in the land of the Rockies, nor are we about to return to an all-powerful state, which used to be a familiar concept to those in the land of the Urals."
"Mr Herzog’s report and proposals strike the right balance."
"We need to rediscover that harmony, that judicious compromise, especially for the sake of our fellow European citizens."
"There are strong points that must be built upon: the provisions of the draft constitutional treaty, the progress promised by the framework directive and the implications of appropriate guaranteed funding of services of general interest."
"There is a need to recapture the spirit that inspired Mr Herzog’s initial report before the committee began to chip away some of its substance. That spirit needs to be recaptured, particularly for the sake of our fellow citizens."
"Mr President, the purpose of the proposed arrangements is to make it easier to hand over public services of general interest to private interests."
"In a period of economic crisis, the only thing that is certain is that big business will want to get its hands on the public wealth in order to maximise its profits."
"Undertakings of general interest, apart from their important role in the development of the national economy, also play a strategically important role with regard to the security and independence of each country, especially in times of economic and other crises."
"Privatising these undertakings and liberalising their markets will ultimately limit this development and will certainly enrich their shareholders instead of strengthening the national economy."
"The statement that liberalisation is a factor of technological progress and economic efficiency is not true because, from experience with its practical application to date, it probably has the opposite effect."
"Privatisation results in the destruction of productive forces, problematic performance, a fall in the quality of the services provided, terrible social inequalities, higher prices and fewer jobs."
"Privatisation has an adverse impact on workers, not just as a result of the increase in the prices of the services provided but also, more importantly, as a result of the waves of redundancies and the resultant replacement of the work regime with flexible forms of work."
"Any restrictions placed on the action of big business in the services of general interest sector and any good intentions to guarantee certain principles which will govern operations and the services provided, even if applied initially, will subsequently degenerate, and the only victims will be the citizens."
"We are opposed to the selling off of public wealth for the benefit of big business."
"We support the public character of undertakings of general interest, which need to be upgraded, providing good, cheap services to the workers, and to act as a lever in a publicly-owned economy."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Commission, I have listened attentively to all the speakers."
"The diversity, to say the least, of the views they expressed did not surprise me, and I should not have intervened had I not perceived in Mr Langen’s contribution a somewhat critical attitude to the Commission on this issue, a suggestion that the Commission raised many questions but did not provide clear answers or, to be more precise, that it was slow in delivering clear legal responses."
"This is therefore the point that I should like to take a few moments to clear up between us."
"If the Commission had been able to propose a clear legal response to you today, this would mean that a solution had been found to the problem we have been debating."
"In point of fact, the very purpose of the Green Paper we published last year was to open the broadest possible debate on a highly complex issue, and our feeling in the Commission is that a year is not an unduly long time for a debate with civil society, with you and with a number of representatives of economic and territorial interests."
"The problem is indeed a difficult one, as our debate has shown."
"In political terms, this issue palpably centres on a specific European policy mix for which we all want to suggest a slightly different recipe, depending on whether our political preference is for the market economy, which we recognise for its competitiveness and efficiency, or for collectivist virtues in the domain of social or territorial cohesion."
"These are all dimensions of solidarity, but each of us has his or her own idea of the proportions in which the ingredients should be mixed."
"In political terms, then, the problem is relatively clear, and I do not really distinguish any great differences between the various ways in which you have described the contours you would give these services of general interest, or public services, if they had to be more precisely defined at the European level."
"The difficulty plainly relates to the way in which they should be defined."
"This remains an unresolved issue at the present juncture."
"Would what we are doing just now, with our sectoral directives and our decisions taken on a somewhat basis on state aid, suffice as a legal framework?"
"This is surely the question that is being asked."
"As you have pointed out, the Convention debated this point and concluded that it might be necessary to have a European law to provide the legal basis that is currently under discussion today in the context of the EC Treaty in its present form."
"This is certainly the question we must clarify."
"As I said in my introductory remarks, the Commission is examining various options."
"To reassure Mr Langen, I repeat that, particularly in the light of the debate which will culminate in tomorrow’s vote on a resolution, the Commission will communicate its own positions before the end of this legislative term."
"Whether we come out in favour of an instrument which involves the European Parliament in codecision or whether our conclusions favour a different approach, I must stress on behalf of the Commission that all our options are still open at this stage."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 11.30 a.m."
". In this debate on the Herzog report on ‘the Green Paper on services of general interest’, which was watered down by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, we reiterate the need to adopt proposals that acknowledge the importance of high-quality public services, which guarantee all citizens the right of access to these services whilst respecting the specific characteristics of each country."
"The consequences of the liberalisations are already evident in the sectors affected, not only in the shape of redundancies and greater job insecurity, on the railways, in energy, postal services and telecommunications, but also, in some cases, in more expensive tariffs and prices and in lower quality of services provided. This situation is gradually affecting larger and larger spheres of activity, particularly in Portugal."
"Despite acknowledging the role of public services, known as services of general interest, submitting them to the rules of competition devalues the social role of public services that are essential to the population, to combating poverty and exclusion, to guaranteeing human rights, to the regional development of afflicted areas, to environmental protection and to economic and social cohesion."
"We insist that we should adopt proposals that promote the protection of public services and a democratic and pluralist evaluation of the impact of the market and competition, taking account of the need for high-quality public services and the damaging consequences of the liberalisations and privatisations that have already taken place in various areas."
"The next item is the report (A5-0471/2003) by Mrs Almeida Garrett on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on the communication from the Commission: ‘The operating framework for the European regulatory agencies’ (COM(2002) 718 – 2003/2089(INI))."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament is today responding to the Commission communication on an operating framework for the European regulatory agencies, in which, as a follow-up to the White Paper on Governance, the Commission presented the general conditions for creating new agencies, the framework within which they are to carry out their activities and the Commission’s own responsibilities as regards supervising those agencies."
"I wish first of all, Commissioner, to congratulate you on this initiative and also on the broad criteria it contains."
"Parliament is pleased to note that due account was taken of its positions, which had already been set out in the resolution on the White Paper, with responsibility for the creation of agencies being attributed to the explicit choice of the legislator, on a case-by-case basis, through an act based on the provision of the Treaty which constitutes the legal basis for the specific Community policy which is to be implemented."
"One important point that we wish to emphasise is the Commission’s acceptance that new agencies should be established sparingly and selectively."
"The use of such agencies is justified only in highly specialised scientific or technical areas, with a precise demarcation of the tasks to be performed and within a framework of responsibility and autonomy which does not call into question the unity and integrity of the executive function or lessen the Commission’s political accountability to Parliament and the Council."
"As with everything in life, there is always a ‘but’."
"The report I am presenting today regrets the fact that the Commission has limited the scope of its communication to the so-called regulatory agencies to be created in future, within the institutional framework of the EC Treaty."
"It is regrettable that no reference is made to the existing agencies, when we all agree that there is a need to undertake in-depth assessment of the work of these agencies, to propose the reworking of some of their tasks and powers and, possibly, to update the structure and composition of their organs."
"These are concerns, as you know, Commissioner, that Parliament has expressed to the Commission through the parliamentary committees most directly involved in scrutiny of the agencies’ functioning and which today, once again, we emphasise."
"We also deplore the fact that no discussion has taken place on the consequences that will ensue from the thoroughgoing changes proposed in the draft European Constitution, specifically the end to the pillar structure, the introduction of a hierarchy of legislation and the explicit provision made for judicial supervision of agencies’ acts."
"These must be properly understood in order to define the future legislative environment of the agencies more completely, coherently and boldly."
"As regards the limited scope of the communication, Parliament’s main concerns will always be to ensure the unity and integrity of the executive function at European level and the corresponding political responsibility of the Commission."
"You will also understand, however, that Parliament will pay particular attention to rules that enable tasks to be carried out transparently and effectively, to appointments to posts and cost management at the future agencies."
"We will, therefore, pay particular attention in the proposal for a future legislative framework to rules that impose on the agencies all the requirements for sound administration, for compliance with legislation on transparency, on access to documents, with the rules for protection against fraud and for protecting the Community’s financial interests."
"I wish to conclude by thanking the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control for their competent and judicious opinions and all my fellow Members who, by participating, served as co-authors of this report."
"Commissioner, we look forward confidently to the initiative for a legal framework for the agencies, which the Commission will present at some time in the future."
". – Mr President, the Commission should like first of all to thank Mrs Almeida Garrett for her excellent work on the Commission’s communication on the operating framework for the regulatory agencies."
"Let us start with the facts: we currently have 16 agencies that were set up by the Treaties in successive waves to meet specific needs on a case-by-case basis."
"What characterises these 16 agencies today is indeed their diversity, in terms of how they operate, the tasks assigned to them and what they are called."
"As we stressed in 2001, we believe that creating new regulatory agencies helps to improve the implementation of Community rules."
"The 2001 White Paper proposed that the Commission set out parameters, more precise criteria, for the creation, operation and supervision of these agencies."
"Our communication, the one that you are debating today, therefore seeks primarily to launch a process of reflection with you, and moreover with the Council, within a common framework, on the creation, operation and supervision of any future regulatory agencies, which we define as being actively involved in exercising the executive function at Community level."
"As your rapporteur has just mentioned, the work that they do is indeed at the very heart of the executive function."
"To avoid any misunderstandings – and I will be coming back to this when I respond to the debate, with reference in particular to the point raised by the rapporteur – this initiative does not cover the ‘executive’ agencies that help to manage Community programmes."
"In a nutshell, what is the reasoning behind the Commission’s proposal?"
"It is a balance between, on the one hand, strengthening the integrity and unity of the executive function – and we know that this is incumbent primarily on the Commission – and, on the other hand, providing the autonomy that these agencies must be able to enjoy if they are to plan their work for the longer term."
"It is all about striking this delicate balance."
"The purpose of the agencies is, on the one hand, to relieve the Commission of very technical tasks so that it can focus on essential policies."
"Nevertheless – and you reminded us of this, Mrs Almeida Garrett – the Commission must retain the final political responsibility for implementing regulations, because this is our particular responsibility to you and because we need to provide people with clearly identifiable remits to come before this House."
"It is then this difficult balance that we are trying to improve, clarify and formalise, given that more and more of the regulatory agencies are meeting a need for an increasing level of expertise in a number of fields, regardless of short-term considerations."
"For this expertise to be constantly available and to ensure a certain amount of transparency, some degree of autonomy and, of course, supervision is also required."
"It is this balance that we are seeking and we await your debate to find out whether the way in which we have expressed this balance also reflects the kind of compromise that you might be able to accept on these tensions, which are inevitable, but which we wish to manage in a positive way."
". Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking the Commission for the presentation of this Communication and Mrs Almeida Garrett for her report."
"The Commission will note that there is substantial agreement between the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and the text presented by Mrs Almeida Garrett."
"In the field of regulatory agencies, there is a danger of us falling into the North American vice of the proliferation of agencies, which act in a completely autonomous manner and without any real control on the part of the legislative powers."
"Paragraphs 2 and 3 of the resolution contained in Mrs Garrett’s report are very significant."
"Specifically, when we get into the strictly regulatory field, we are talking about a legislative power and not an executive power."
"I would therefore call on the Commission, when drawing up a text with specific proposals, to prevent any reference which could imply the assumption of legislative powers by these agencies."
"In other words, we should try to ensure that, for any type of legislative delegation, there is an interinstitutional agreement, with the Council and Parliament as the legislative power."
"Secondly, we must prevent the proliferation of agencies, regulatory or non-regulatory, because it appears that, at the moment, they have become a kind of Christmas present, which are given each year to governments, so that they can say in their respective capitals that they have achieved something from an institutional point of view."
"With regard to the legal basis and the tendency to invoke Article 308, the regulatory agencies would only make sense if there were specific European Union competence in that area, but not by creating special means for justifying that type of creation."
"Finally, it is important that the regulatory agencies are subject to the same type of scrutiny as the Commission."
"Even more in fact, given their distance away."
"Mr President, the legislation on European agencies, our opinion on which is contained in the report by Mrs Almeida Garrett, is a subject that goes to the heart of the debate on the future of Europe, that is to say, the fight against European bureaucracy."
"Now, of all times, when Europe finds itself in a crisis from which we have to extricate ourselves together, it is important that we ask ourselves how the various European institutions, including the existing and future agencies, can be embedded in the democratic structure of Europe: a democratic, transparent and efficient Europe."
"I should just like to reiterate that 2004 is a decisive year for Europe."
"It is a year in which it is vitally important to win back the confidence of the European electorate."
"This electorate looks at us and sees the European system as unwieldy and bureaucratic."
"Incidentally, the Heads of State or Government, who are fairly often found wanting, bear a large part of the responsibility for this."
"Citizens, who mainly see quarrelling between Heads of State or Government over the distribution of power and money, are naturally increasingly unable to grasp what this European cooperation actually means. It is not for nothing that we speak of a democratic deficit in the European Union that has to be filled."
"Europe is too slow-moving, frequently inefficient and incomprehensible to its citizens, and is thus achieving too little."
"This has to change, particularly with a view to the enlargement of the EU by ten new Member States on 1 May."
"That is why we must make Europe more efficient, more democratic."
"We must root out sluggish bureaucracy."
"In the first instance, this will of course be carried out by means of proposals in the European Constitution, which will hopefully become reality very soon. However, it will also take place in the case of subjects such as today’s – the creation of a framework for European agencies – which are not dealt with in the European Constitution."
"The focus is on the performance of essential tasks that are financed with European funds."
"I should like to mention a number of things that I believe to be essential within this framework."
"Firstly, direct scrutiny by the European Commission and political accountability to the Council and Parliament must be guaranteed when the European agencies are set up, and it goes without saying that those agencies must have a management that, on pain of dismissal, presents all problems of a genuinely political nature directly to the politically accountable Commissioner. I am sure we all remember the Eurostat case."
"Secondly, the confusing situation we find ourselves in at the moment, where we have no less than twelve different structures, must be replaced by a uniform structure that can be monitored and is comprehensible to all."
"Thirdly, the seat of an agency must be subject to criteria such as efficiency and cost-benefit analyses."
"That means no quarrelling over Parma ham and Swedish models."
"This approach applies not only to new, but also to existing agencies."
"Only then will we tackle bureaucracy seriously."
"We give our full support to the report by Mrs Almeida Garrett."
"Mr President, at the Brussels Summit in December 2003, the Heads of State or Government agreed to domiciles for ten new agencies, including an agency for IT security."
"In the Øresund area, universities and business enterprises on both the Danish and Swedish sides formed a consortium and put forward proposals as to how good conditions could in practice be created for locating precisely this IT security agency in the area."
"The Øresund region has a sound infrastructure, good international transport connections, very extensive IT facilities and strong environments for IT research and development."
"The universities would make facilities available so that the agency’s workers could have close contact with the research environments, and there was a desire to create buildings able to fulfil the agency’s demands."
"In short, here was an offer, in terms of location, that could guarantee a rapid start to the agency in an area easily able to attract qualified labour."
"I know there were other attractive environments in the offing in the Netherlands and Germany."
"What emerged from the efforts concerned, however?"
"They were a waste of energy."
"The EU’s Heads of State or Government agreed that this agency should be situated in a town in Greece."
"I have nothing negative to say about Greece, but the decision-making process simply cannot be taken seriously."
"It is neither transparent nor comprehensible to the public."
"I am therefore very pleased with the report we are debating today, for it lays down a list of important and clear principles about the way in which decisions concerning agencies should be made in the future, about their operational frameworks and about how they should be placed in relation to the EU’s institutions, and I wish to congratulate Mrs Garrett on the good outcome."
"The decision concerning a new agency must be transparent and based on analyses of advantages and disadvantages."
"It must be the basis of a strong professionalism, and setting up an agency must not be a short cut to increasing administrative expenses."
"It is important for the Commission to have ongoing responsibility and for Parliament to have the role of supervisory power and not be governed by the agencies."
"The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party’s amendments are to emphasise this, and I very much hope that there will be broad support for these proposals."
"– Mr President, as permanent rapporteur for the agencies, I would like to make the following budget-related points in addition to the opinion on this project, on which the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has led."
"My first point is that this regulatory agency should have its headquarters, for reasons of cost, close to the Commission."
"The second is that the functions of the regulatory agencies should be limited to the creation of secondary legislation linked to the Commission’s initiatives and should be subject to the approval of the budgetary authority."
"Thirdly, I believe it to be important that the new regulatory agencies should exercise their autonomy subject to the direct control of the Commission and to the political control of the European Parliament."
"Fourthly, it should also be laid down that all the provisions of the Financial Regulation and of the Staff Regulations shall apply to the regulatory agencies."
"Fifthly and finally, the Commission should, before submitting any legislative proposal for the establishment of a regulatory agency, present an assessment of its budgetary consequences and of its profitability, as well as proposals for the redeployment and management of human resources."
"– Mr President, we agree with Mr Prodi, the President of the Commission, when he tells us that the EU is to have the most modern administration in the world."
"If this goal is to be achieved, though, all the administrative units must be modernised; not just the Commission’s main offices, but also the subordinate offices, the agencies, and I can also see that the establishment, organisation and control of these is flourishing unchecked."
"There is too little transparency; often there is neither the necessary efficiency nor adequate control, and that is why the agencies of the future need to be put on a new footing."
"In its report, Parliament now demands that an agency should be established by a law adopted by way of the codecision procedure."
"The joint involvement of the Commission, Parliament and the Council in this decision must become the norm in future."
"The legislative act of establishment must also stipulate where the agency is to be based."
"I could spend all my speaking time on what went on between Helsinki and Parma with regard to the food agency."
"That was a tragedy."
"Nothing of the sort must be allowed to happen again, and the choice of headquarters must be made by reference to competence and cost-efficiency."
"We have to cut back the number of types of agencies; having fifteen agencies divided up into twelve types makes for an impossible situation."
"As these agencies are subject to the Commission, it is the Commission that should appoint their directors."
"I will conclude by thanking Mrs Almeida Garrett for this report, and by expressing the hope that it will get through."
"Mr President, I congratulate Mrs Almeida Garrett, whose report has, in my opinion, done a good job in providing a clear and concise analysis of the entire set of issues concerning the agencies, amongst which I would very briefly highlight the following, because of their relevance:"
"- the urgent need for the Commission to clarify the appropriate legal instrument for defining the framework of general conditions governing the creation of these agencies, which would avoid the risks to which Mr Medina Ortega referred;"
"- the need for Parliament to be fully and permanently involved in appointing the members of the administrative board and in monitoring the activity of these agencies;"
"- the crucial need to monitor the legality of the actions undertaken by the regulatory agencies and by their administrative boards in line with the provisions of the draft Constitution drawn up by the European Convention."
"We hope that the Commission will take account of the proposals made in Mrs Almeida Garrett’s report, drawn up on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, and once again I offer my congratulations to the rapporteur on the excellent work she has presented to us."
". – Mr President, I am going to try to respond very quickly to the various interventions made, which, broadly speaking, seemed to me to be along the same lines and to express similar views."
"Firstly, on the scope of application of the text, your rapporteur indicated just now that she would perhaps have preferred the Commission to be a little more ambitious at this stage."
"It is true that for the time being we are only proposing instruments for future regulatory agencies."
"Why?"
"The reason for this is quite simply that we want to start with what is immediately feasible and it seems to us that if we had to work initially on streamlining the existing agencies with their very disparate characteristics, it would have been difficult, if not impossible, to adopt a truly uniform approach."
"We therefore favour a uniform approach and wish to apply it first of all to future agencies."
"As far as the legal instrument is concerned, I do not think that we disagree: a framework regulation is required, as you propose."
"The advantage of having such an instrument on the regulatory agencies is that it would exist in parallel to the framework regulation on the status of the executive agencies, which was adopted by the Council in December 2002."
"Turning now to the substance – and I think that we are in full agreement on all of these points – I noted that several principles emerged from your discussion: efficiency, supervision and responsibility, all subject to an overriding principle of parsimony, which I thought your rapporteur expressed very well."
"On the principle of efficiency, we agree, and in particular we need to apply our good resolutions on efficiency to the structure and composition of the agencies."
"It is clear that if the administrative boards are excessively large and if the selection of the directors calls for permanent consultations then we will not achieve our aims."
"We therefore need to be disciplined enough to keep these in check and I think that we will be able to work together on this point."
"The second principle is supervision."
"Many of you have said that whether it be from a legal, administrative or financial point of view, these agencies, which are, as it were, Commission outposts, need to be subject to greater supervision the further they are from the seat of the executive authority."
"The third principle is the principle of responsibility."
"You said this and we agree with you on this point: the Commission bears the political responsibility and its agencies, even the regulatory agencies, work under the Commission’s political responsibility, which you must be able to call into question: it is, after all, your right and your duty to do so."
"Finally, all of this, and I will conclude on this point, implies a principle of parsimony."
"We have to admit that it is sometimes tempting to resolve this or that problem by creating an agency; together we need to be able to resist this temptation."
"We need a good means for preventing proliferation and it would seem, having listened to your debate, that your intentions in this respect are perfectly in line with those of the Commission."
"I conclude then that we are well provisioned with criteria and principles that will enable us to improve the current situation, which is, it is true, starting to bear a strong resemblance to a plate of spaghetti."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m."
"The next item is the Commission’s statement on the prospects for the Doha Round following the meeting of the WTO General Councilon 15 December 2003."
". – Mr President, you wanted us once again to review the progress of negotiations in the WTO on what is known as the Doha Development Agenda following the period of reflection, work and consultation that the Commission undertook after the collapse of the talks in Cancún."
"It is clear that since we last debated this, just after Cancún on 24 September, the situation has changed, both in the Union and in the WTO."
"I will address three aspects of the post-Cancún process: our policy following the Commission’s November communication and the General Affairs Council; the situation in the WTO since 15 December and, finally, the prospects for 2004."
"Let us first turn our attention to our own policy."
"As you are aware, after Cancún, the Commission embarked on a phase of in-depth reflection and consultation of Parliament, the Member States, the social partners and civil society."
"All of this led, in mid-November, to a communication on relaunching the negotiating process, which we still believe to be of the utmost importance for the European Union."
"You received that communication."
"It has been debated in your committee that deals with external trade issues and has been discussed bilaterally with a number of your political groups."
"Let me sum up this policy as it stands today."
"It is clear."
"Above all, we remain firmly attached to multilateralism."
"This remains the top priority of the Union’s trade policy and we want negotiations to resume as soon as possible."
"On the substance, we have adopted a more flexible position on the so-called Singapore issues, which will please a number of the groups in this Parliament."
"We have also adopted a more flexible approach towards geographical indications and even the environment, so as to facilitate the negotiations."
"On agriculture, we have reiterated our desire to inject momentum into these long, drawn-out negotiations, if only because since implementing our own reforms we have the means to make an active contribution to them."
"At long last, the European Union is no longer on the defensive here."
"I will now say a word on the state of play in the WTO, in particular since work resumed on 15 December."
"The good news is that although Cancún had revealed slight differences of opinion, indeed even some substantial ones, on the need to pursue these negotiations, now everyone in the WTO agrees that it is important to resume them."
"We all agree that the world will probably be a worse place without a negotiated outcome than with one, which is an important political motivation."
"That is the good news!"
"Nevertheless, will this mean that negotiations will proceed at a pace that will, in our view, make it possible for ambitious objectives to be achieved in 2004?"
"It is still too early to say."
"Let me move on to the third point, the prospects for the negotiations in 2004."
"The real challenge is not, I believe, to restart the discussions."
"There is agreement on this point and the process is underway."
"The real challenge is to make them proceed at a good pace and with the necessary energy and ambition."
"We are going to spend a month or two on technical issues in Geneva."
"It is absolutely essential that this technical phase leads as soon as possible to a political phase, which will enable the various ministers to reiterate their positions on the timetable and the content of the final negotiations."
"The European Union has been working hard on this since mid-December."
"We are pleased to have been joined since the end of last week by the Americans, because my American counterpart has stated that he wishes to see a definite relaunch of the work in Geneva and has indicated, as we had done in our turn, that there is room for flexibility on some points. This is, I believe, a welcome initiative."
"It means that we can correct an increasingly widespread impression that, because 2004 is an election year in the United States, these negotiations would be, as it were, put on the backburner for the duration."
"Fortunately, my American counterpart has disabused us of this pessimistic notion."
"What are we going to be doing in the coming weeks?"
"Firstly, we are going to continue our dialogue with the developing countries, and in particular with countries in the G20 and G90."
"I myself took the initiative by travelling to Latin America in mid-December and we are going to pursue the dialogue that was, I think, begun to good effect on that occasion. The same goes for the G90."
"Next week I will be in Bangladesh, India and Indonesia to work on these various issues with countries that are clearly crucial negotiating partners."
"As I said a moment ago, what is vital now is to see whether we can move forward quickly on agriculture, industrial tariffs, services and the Singapore issues that we consider to be priorities, that is trade facilitation and the transparency of public procurement."
"My feeling is that everyone, at least the United States and Europe, has sufficient room for manoeuvre."
"We now need to ensure that Brazil, South Africa, India, China and our Japanese friends invest as much energy in these negotiations as we are prepared to."
"In any case, the message on which I would like to hear your views, the Commission’s message, is that we hope that in 2004 we will be able to make up for a large part of what we were unable to achieve in 2003 in Cancún, and we think we can."
"Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, I just want to make a few comments of an agricultural nature in relation to what my fellow-Commissioner Mr Lamy has already said."
"You have heard about the steps that the Commission has taken to relaunch the negotiations, and I am sure you were disappointed to learn that the members of the WTO, as long ago as December, were unable to resume negotiations on the development agenda."
"What went on in the run-up to the Geneva meeting on 15 December gave me the impression that this failure had to do, among other things, with the nature of the proceedings."
"The WTO members did not negotiate directly with one another, but everything was done through the mediation of the chairman of the WTO’s General Council, and this way of going about things was certainly not particularly conducive to agreement."
"I became all the more convinced of this when, shortly afterwards, in the margins of the FAO Conference in Rome, I met many ministers who also regretted the absence of any direct contact, which they said they would have expected."
"I have come to the conclusion that, if there is to be agreement, there is in any case an absolute need for more dialogue and for more intensive efforts among the members of the WTO."
"As Mr Lamy has already said, we will, for our part, be doing everything possible to ensure that 2004 is not a wasted year."
"We will be playing a particularly active part in this."
"As regards the subject matter of the negotiations, I have to say that we cannot accept any and every framework for negotiation modalities at any price."
"We see it as a fundamental condition that such a framework should reflect the spirit and content of the Doha Declaration."
"Among other things, one primary requirement is that there should be tighter restrictions on ‘amber box’ measures than on ‘blue box’ measures, which distort trade to a lesser extent."
"Secondly, when considering export competition, all forms of export subsidy must be tackled in parallel."
"You will be aware that we have gone on the offensive in the debate about export subsidies, by proposing that all forms of export subsidy for a range of products important to developing countries be allowed to expire."
"We are still waiting for a response to this offer."
"At the same time, we cannot but note the continuing lack of willingness to make comparable commitments in respect of other forms of export subsidy; as far as I am aware, for example, the Canadian Wheat Board was compensated for its latest losses by the Canadian Government."
"Another example is Argentina, which uses differentiated export duties on soya beans and soya bean flour as a means of indirectly subsidising the building of its largest soya mill. The USA continues to use supplies of food aid as a means of reducing its surpluses."
"From the very outset, we have made it plain that all measures to deal with export competition must be dealt with simultaneously and that they must all exercise discipline to the same degree."
"This is something on which we will continue to work."
"Mr President, first of all, my thanks to the two Commissioners for their efforts and for the points they have raised here."
"The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats greatly appreciates your commitment and your efforts, which must be aimed at making 2004 a greater success than 2003."
"I share the Commissioner’s view that we need to give the Member States more information with regard to the offer made by the European Union in the field of agriculture."
"It was already evident in Cancún that people did not believe it, and I think that it is useful and necessary to go further towards explaining that offer."
"It strikes me that, whilst it is true that Mr Zoellick is making a great gesture, it is still unclear what exactly he is proposing."
"We do of course welcome the increased flexibility on this point that is now being shown by the US Government, but the question that I should like to ask both Commissioners is as follows: does that also apply to cotton, for example?"
"I ask this because, as far as I know, the position of the United States regarding cotton is still fairly rigid."
"Perhaps you could tell us a little more about this?"
"I am also wondering to what extent Japan is currently prepared to relax its policy with regard to rice, because, as you know, the subject of rice was another of the obstacles in Cancún."
"Perhaps you would also like to give us some further details on this?"
"The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats believes that the offer we have made in the field of agriculture, which even includes the possibility of reducing export subsidies to virtually zero, and now also an increased flexibility regarding geographical indications, is sufficient for us to go into the negotiations."
"We also welcome the fact that the offer is being seen in a wider perspective and that we are not only looking at agriculture, but also at services and the Singapore issues."
"Unfortunately, we shall also have to accept that there is an inherent degree of flexibility, but I think that the package now before us should offer sufficient scope to get the negotiations off the ground."
"Something that is tending to fall by the wayside is the whole debate on a kind of reform of the WTO."
"We all know that Cancún also revealed that the organisation cannot carry on functioning the way it is now doing."
"I hope that this is also included in the package, therefore."
"The question that Commissioner Lamy asked us was whether we would give him free rein to enter into the negotiations with the package as he proposed it."
"On behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I can give him a straightforward answer: yes, we believe he can."
"Mr President, Commissioner, you are familiar with the position of the Group of the Party of European Socialists."
"Restarting the Doha Development Agenda promptly is in the interests of economic recovery in Europe."
"Restarting it promptly is in the interests of all parts of the world."
"We must fulfil our development promises: stop the agricultural subsidies that have shot up and instead use them for the environment, consumers, and agriculture that is beneficial to the developing world."
"The European trade agenda must be brought closer to the citizen."
"The Group of the Party of European Socialists wants to see a higher priority accorded to a citizens’ agenda."
"This would read as follows: counterforce."
"Citizens want protection against unfair competition at work: this is a tribute to your efforts against the US in the steel dispute and South Korea’s unfair shipyard aid."
"Citizens also want respect for nature and the environment, and consumer-friendly agriculture: no animal transports, quality over quantity and respect for nature."
"They want social power."
"They do not want any products that have been manufactured by exploiting women or using child labour."
"They want support for fair trade products and for free trade unions."
"Our additional GSP approach would enable extra support for countries that take education, health care and free trade unions seriously, but we would want a multilateral approach to this."
"As far as we are concerned, that approach would require dropping the Singapore issues: removing them from the single undertaking."
"Now is the right time to do that."
"The truth is, however, that many developing countries think that we, like the US, do not genuinely want this."
"In the field of agriculture, in particular, and with regard to the Singapore issues, the message has not got through clearly."
"We hope that we shall be generous to the new alliance, that is to say, stop export subsidies for products sensitive to them, open up our markets, and give them help in marketing their products in their own region and on our market."
"As you yourself say, we have to be clear about the G-21."
"We need this new, emerging world power as a multilateral player, but the G-21 must also be aware that, if they make requirements of us, they themselves must also make their contribution."
"They must guarantee their citizens the right to a free trade-union movement, and put an end to child labour and the exploitation of women."
"Why should they not be the first to give that new alliance a chance, just as we did with Everything But Arms, and permit their countries to import goods?"
"That would make Lula’s agenda credible."
"Europe’s commitment to cheap AIDS drugs has finally borne fruit."
"This point demonstrates that Europe is not focusing on short-term gain for itself, but on the bigger picture."
"This approach to the global free market, with fair rules, will make us a great deal more credible."
"I believe that prompt implementation of this approach in the Member States and the European Union is the right course to follow."
"Mr President, this morning’s session seems to be turning into a private chat among the Dutch contingent, so we shall just continue."
"The Netherlands is pre-eminently a trading nation, after all."
"Back in September, during the debate in this Parliament on the failure of the Cancún negotiating round, I made Commissioners Lamy and Fischler aware of the support of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party and myself for restarting promptly while the momentum was still there."
"In this regard, multilateralism remains the best route to global free trade, and the conclusion of bilateral agreements is detrimental to smaller countries and developing countries."
"Indeed, these countries benefit from general standards applying worldwide."
"The Commission sees reform of the WTO as another priority, and I agree with Commissioner Lamy on this point, because there is room for improvement in the way in which the organisation is currently functioning, which is no longer appropriate in 2004."
"He must bear in mind, however, that it was the members that were to blame for the failure of the negotiations."
"The most important thing, therefore, is to obtain constructive support among WTO members for the continuation of the Doha Development Round."
"That will not be easy, however, in view of the US presidential elections this year, because the campaigns will probably be full of protectionist rhetoric."
"An enhanced role for the Secretariat in Geneva and for the Director-General would be a step in the right direction, in my opinion."
"The Director-General must be given the right of initiative in order to generate more support and increased commitment on the part of the Member States to putting the negotiations back on track; and also in order to hold the members to the agreements they have made."
"This enhanced mandate for the Director-General would then have to be set against democratic control by a parliamentary assembly."
"In Cancún, we gave this another firm push by means of a parliamentary conference."
"That must continue, because this democratic control really cannot be left in the hands of the NGOs."
"Firstly, they lack democratic legitimacy and, secondly, Cancún showed once more that these organisations are not exactly striving for the success of the negotiating round."
"The subject matter of the present agenda should stay the same, in my view, and the Singapore issues and market access play a key role in this."
"It is precisely developing countries that stand to benefit from a favourable investment climate, reduction in import levies and transparent legislation."
"The southern countries would profit from trade facilitation; indeed, 80% of all import levies are paid by the developing countries combined."
"The European Union must also provide other members with better information, however, as my colleague Mr van Velzen has already said."
"Finally, the ELDR Group gives Commissioners Lamy and Fischler a clear field for promoting their strategy and the proposed package in this sphere, and for continuing on this path."
"Once a pepper trader, always a pepper trader, Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel!"
"Mr President, I am grateful that we are now having this debate that we requested, although I am sorry that other political groups did not allow a motion for a resolution to be tabled on the negotiations at the World Trade Organization."
"The failure to reach an agreement at the WTO Ministerial Meeting in Cancún confirms the need to halt and reverse current trade liberalisation policies."
"We need to implement policies that promote fair and equitable trading systems, geared towards the sustainable development of each country’s true potential, without imposing relationships of dominance and dependence and also geared towards improving the living conditions of the various peoples of the world as a matter of urgency and towards reinforcing their rights and social ."
"The Commission’s current mandate, however, obstructs this need."
"The great acts of social mobilisation that have taken place throughout the world, specifically at the European Social Forum, against the WTO and its various proposals, specifically the agreement on services, which jeopardises high-quality public services, prove the need for us to review the Commission’s mandate."
"We cannot allow the European Union to continue to align itself with the United States of America on fundamental areas of negotiation, specifically farming, the liberalisation of services, what are known as the ‘new Singapore issues’, investment, competition, and public procurement."
"Account must also be taken of areas that are important to the textiles and clothing industries, especially those in the countries of southern Europe such as Portugal, in order to safeguard employment and development in huge areas to which these industries are crucial."
"Consequently, we reiterate the need to review the current mandate in order to avoid the disastrous social and environmental effects of the trading systems that the WTO has put in place."
"We want to see fair and equitable trading, geared towards development, public health, respect for the environment and towards cultural diversity."
"We must grasp the opportunity provided by the failure to reach an agreement at Seattle, Cancún or recently in Geneva, to review the proposals presented by the Commission and to give consideration to this much-needed balance."
"Hence my question about the European Commission’s willingness to review its current mandate and to undertake negotiations in a new framework, respecting the principles that I have just referred to."
"– Mr President, I have already had the opportunity in a committee meeting to express my disappointment to Commissioner Lamy with the Commission’s new proposals and, ultimately, with the Council’s position confirming these."
"Given his robust remarks the day after the talks collapsed in Cancún, I was actually expecting the Commission to be thinking more along the lines of proposing a thorough overhaul of the international trading system rather than adopting a new tactical position."
"In fact, it is not strategic change that we are discussing today but rather a tactical repositioning."
"As regards the Singapore issues in particular, Commissioner Lamy is reporting greater flexibility on the part of the Commission, the kind of flexibility that emerged right at the end of the Cancún process, too late in the day in my opinion."
"But is flexibility still the issue today?"
"All the same, I must remind you that the Doha Declaration required a unanimous and explicit agreement on the negotiating arrangements for these issues."
"In fact we know that, as things currently stand, there is no chance of such an agreement."
"The G90 countries, which are the poorest, have restated their opposition to opening negotiations on the Singapore issues."
"I think it is clear that these countries have nothing to gain for their development from such negotiations: their priorities lie elsewhere, which is understandable."
"Both technically and in terms of human resources, these countries are ill-equipped to play an effective role in such negotiations, which would only place greater strain on a timetable that everyone recognises is already very tight."
"I think that by abandoning the Singapore issues for the time being, or at least putting them on the backburner, the European Union would send out a powerful and meaningful signal to the G90, showing them that we are sensitive to their concerns."
"This attitude might even be a smart strategic move because it would put the European Union in a more positive position on agriculture: we would have more room for manoeuvre."
"As for the rest, on agriculture, the World Trade Organisation is not, in my opinion, an appropriate forum in which to deal with everyone’s rights and obligations."
"I think it is essential and urgent to relaunch a process of dialogue within a body like the FAO, where we can have a calm discussion on food safety and the protection and development of rural areas."
"In particular, I think that an urgent file like the cotton one, which was tabled in Cancún, should be given top priority by the European Union, and I would be grateful if the Commissioners could take this into account."
"Mr President, we welcome the recent announcement by the Americans that they are starting to think multilaterally once again."
"After the collapse of the talks in Cancún, there were some worrying signs that the United States was going to abandon the multilateral rules and force a series of bilateral deals around the globe."
"In the context of the WTO talks, I am concerned primarily about agriculture."
"I find worrying the noises the Americans are now making in this respect and I believe they are trying to move the goalposts regarding farming."
"European farmers have signed up to a reform deal that involves tremendous upheaval in the sector, but at least they know where they are heading."
"It is totally unacceptable to suggest reopening the Luxembourg Accord of last year."
"Our farmers need policy stability in order to plan for the future of their businesses and the livelihood of their families."
"There can be no question of our going back, under pressure from the Americans, on any of the commitments we have entered into with our farmers."
"I call on the Commission to state clearly that it will not tolerate such pressure and that it will rigorously defend the existing agreement."
"Finally, I would also remind the Commission that there exists no mandate to negotiate away the current export refund regime."
"The Americans must not be allowed to call for an end to export refunds while they continue to operate a host of schemes which have exactly the same effect as far as American farmers are concerned."
"Mr President, as I have remarked previously in this House, Christian charity obliges us to adopt a more constructive approach to the development agenda."
"In that light, I have a number of comments on the present strategy."
"My first relates to agriculture."
"The EU agreed a framework with the United States ahead of Cancún."
"The US Trade Representative, Mr Zoellick, recently declared himself in favour of resuming the negotiations in the current trade round."
"I presume that the Commissioner is holding consultations with him with a view to arriving at a framework outlining clear commitments."
"A second element in the Doha Development Agenda is the manufacture and import of unpatented medicinal products for developing countries that are undergoing a serious health crisis."
"The complex import procedure for cheap medicinal products needs to be simplified."
"The United States is a strategic player in this, so a more workable solution must be agreed with them."
"I cannot find the necessary clarification on this point in the Commission document."
"Finally, this trade round is a development round."
"The negotiations must not focus on the Singapore issues, but instead all the more on the development issues."
"Mr President, Commissioner Lamy, Commissioner Fischler, I appreciate and support the Commission strategy geared towards multilateralism."
"Much more than the United States, Europe needs multilateral bases in order to develop international trade."
"There is one point, Mr President, Commissioners, on which I completely disagree."
"Commissioner Lamy said that as far as agriculture is concerned, negotiations are being reopened and the European Union is no longer always on the defensive."
"I believe that, at political level, this is not entirely true."
"Of course, the United States also have agricultural problems, in terms of protectionism, as does Japan; but Europe remains a cornerstone of the world system of protectionism and State handouts for farmers and rich countries."
"The so-called reform has not made sufficient progress in this regard."
"One only has to look at the budgets of the European Union: we are continuing to spend 40% of the Union budget on subsidising and protecting rich farmers, who represent a declining sector in the European economy."
"Is it possible that some people do not understand that we are discussing the future of Europe’s international trade?"
"Do we have to discuss this with Commissioner Lamy – and that would be the last straw! – and with Commissioner Fischler?"
"Personally, I have nothing against Commissioner Fischler, but we have the Commission or the Council representative for agriculture – and not for technology, or for industry."
"How is that possible?"
"To conclude, Mr President, agriculture remains the obstacle in key negotiations on Europe’s world trade, and agricultural protectionism is harming Europe before developing countries."
"– Mr President, the reiterated support given today to both Commissioners’ negotiating positions by our group, that of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, indicates that we too are in favour of everyone moving, when there are negotiations on agriculture, to ensure that such negotiations are actually held, and that the other participants in them should follow us in not merely announcing reforms but also implementing them."
"That is my first point."
"My second is that our present support for the mandate given to the Commission and the Council also means that we in this European Parliament have to be consistent."
"It is not acceptable that, in this House, we are supporting the Commission by a large majority, at the same time as, in the ACP-EU Joint Assembly, the same group and the same rapporteur prepare reports that are diametrically opposed to what we have said to the WTO."
"I would refer to the negotiations on the regional partnership agreements, in which the same principles must apply, including such things as the Singapore issues."
"What we see as of the utmost importance are the reciprocal opening-up of markets and, of course, preferential treatment for our ACP friends as well."
"We cannot, though, send out two conflicting messages, and we in the Group of the European People’s Party, perhaps along with other Members forming a majority in this House, will see to it that we remain coherent."
"My third point is that we in this House have to try, if we are to become active on the parliamentary front, to play a significant and leading role, which – difficult though this may be – will mean the constant involvement of our partners in the US Congress."
"After all, they are our principal trading partners, and we do not want to be dragged along in the wake of the Indians and the Chinese."
"– Mr President, I should like to say first of all, in response to the comment made just now by Mrs Plooij, drawing attention to the large number of Dutch Members present, that it is not only because my first name is of Dutch origin – which it is – that I am taking part in this debate today, but because I believe that all of us are very concerned, as elected representatives of the European Union, about the relaunch of the multilateral trade negotiations."
"I believe, Commissioners, that the most striking aspect of the communication of 26 November that you tabled in the Council was indeed the U-turn on the Singapore issues."
"I am glad to have been one of those Members of this House to whom Commissioner Lamy referred who told you to what extent negotiations on the Singapore issues were pointlessly weighing down the whole enterprise."
"Like Mr Lannoye, I do not believe that the WTO is the right forum to deal with several of these issues."
"I should simply like to tell you what a shame it would be, today, to do too little too late."
"You had first-hand experience of this at the end of the Cancún Conference: on the last day, you wanted to indicate that you were prepared to withdraw some of these subjects, but by then the confidence had evaporated and this initiative was not enough to get the discussion back on track."
"In fact, today you are agreeing to exclude several of the Singapore issues – investment and competition – from the single undertaking, from the overall agreement, while nevertheless keeping them on the negotiating table for the multilateral agreements that you want to negotiate: in doing so, you will foster mistrust and hostility."
"I think that, on the contrary, every effort needs to be made to restore confidence between the European Union and the developing countries."
"This provides a hint of the problem that we have when reading your communication."
"The feeling is that you are trying to learn the lessons from the failure of Cancún, but at the same time you give the impression of only going halfway and of doing so backwards."
"It is as if you wanted everything to change provided that everything remains as it is, to use Lampedusa’s words."
"For example, you ask to keep your negotiating mandate, which dates back to before Seattle, requesting that modifications be kept to a minimum."
"You want to maintain your positions on agriculture."
"You want to keep the European Union’s initial objectives on the liberalisation of developing countries’ markets and on the liberalisation of services, with, on the latter, a very significant ambiguity on public services, as we have been reminded."
"You actually say that they should not be affected, but at the same time you state that you want to liberalise environmental services, which are amongst the most important public services."
"Obviously I am thinking of water."
"You even make a very questionable assertion."
"You say, and I quote, that in your view, ‘the WTO is not a structurally unfair system that needs to be rebalanced.’"
"I think that by making such a statement you are turning your back on the spirit of Doha, which was precisely to recognise in relation to our partners in the developing countries that since the end of the Uruguay Round the trade system had not kept its promises, that it had not worked fairly and benefited the development of all and that it needed to be rebalanced."
"In this sense, the Commission communication is marked by positions that threaten to delay resumption of the dialogue."
"I am thinking, for example, of the very severe criticism of the system of preferences or the system of special and differential treatment."
"The year 2004 must not be a forgotten year."
"I am glad that you have taken up your pilgrim’s staff to revive the dialogue with the countries of the G20 and G90."
"It is an attitude that is in stark contrast to the speech you made in Cancún, which was perceived as very contemptuous by some of these countries."
"We need to set a new agenda; we need to rebuild confidence around the Doha Agenda – but an improved Doha Agenda – and around a thorough reform of the WTO, of the way it works, its rules and dogmas, so that this organisation really is at the service of development for everyone."
"We therefore need to rebalance this international trading system and not continue to make liberalisation and free trade our sole priority, as these can only be unfair when the various players are so very different."
"Mr President, it is common knowledge that the most recent ministerial conference, in Cancún, sadly ended in failure."
"It is good, therefore, that the European Commission now wants to take renewed action to get the current negotiations started again."
"The proposed development round must not fail; it must be brought to a successful conclusion."
"After all, a great deal is at stake."
"There is the potential risk of the World Trade Organization and the multilateral trading system becoming completely undermined."
"Bilateral and regional trade agreements are not a viable alternative in an increasingly globalised world, and in a system that has contributed to stable and sustained economic growth for almost 55 years now."
"Therefore, it is high time that the welcome discussions on the subject matter were complemented with improvements in WTO working methods."
"Negotiating and taking decisions by consensus in a forum with 148 members requires procedures that are up-to-date, simple and efficient, but at present that is precisely what the WTO’s procedures are not."
"It remains my deep-rooted conviction that the WTO is more necessary than ever, because, particularly as far as the European Union is concerned, further liberalisation of world trade and the removal of barriers to trade are the key to increased economic growth and employment."
"– Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, the WTO conference in Cancún having been a failure, the December meeting of the WTO’s council in Geneva was a non-event, thus, once again, demonstrating that the WTO is in crisis and that the trade policies it practises are no longer sustainable."
"Further evidence of this is provided by the growing resistance to WTO trade policy on the part of the international social movement."
"The Commission plays a decisive part in the WTO’s current trade policy."
"Its tactical approach shows that what really matters to it is not development policy and global fair trade, but only free trade."
"You asked whether my group would give you a mandate to do the things you have described."
"To that I can only say that we will not."
"What would we want to give you a mandate for?"
"For a start, it is high time that we comply with the demands of many developing countries and proceed with an evaluation of what the WTO’s policies have achieved to date."
"Secondly, agricultural export subsidies, which are ruining millions of farmers in the countries of the South, must be done away with once and for all."
"Instead of burying developing countries with European agricultural produce at prices that amount to dumping the stuff, the European Union must help these countries to develop sound internal markets and regional economic activity."
"Thirdly, the GATS negotiations, which will lead to massive rounds of liberalisation in areas of general-interest service provision that have so far been spared them, must be halted."
"This is another instance in which, instead of signalling the beginning of new rounds of liberalisation, the Commission would do better to give more attention to the evaluation of what has been achieved so far."
"I will give you a prediction: there will be little on the assets side of the balance sheet where quality, security of provision or price stability are concerned."
"Fourthly, there is no need to make changes to what we call the Singapore issues; they simply need to be swept away."
"Rather than endlessly extending the WTO’s competences and adding new topics for negotiation to the agenda, the outstanding tasks on the development agenda have to be dealt with."
"The WTO’s work must, in particular, get back to focusing on such horizontal tasks as sustainable development and public health."
"Fifthly, we need to subject to scrutiny the WTO’s structures and the way it works."
"We call for it to become democratic, with transparency in all negotiations, for all its member states to be treated as equals, and for the procedure for settling disputes to be revised."
"In particular, we call for the WTO to be a party to the international treaties of the UN and the ILO."
"– Mr President, I note that the collapse – and what a dramatic one it was – of the talks in Cancún, which should have acted as a kind of electric shock, particularly on the Europeans, has not in fact generated any real basic reflection on the actual nature of the process of liberalising world trade that is underway."
"No really novel proposal has been made since then to improve it substantially."
"Given the importance of the agricultural issue, it would have been good to consider in particular the relevance of integrating it in a process which, in its current form, does not allow its specificities to be taken into account, despite the fact that it is a sector that determines food sovereignty and constitutes the basis for development."
"Given the importance that the European countries have attached to these two parameters, one might have thought that they were the right ones to ask this key question."
"This is not the case, as we see."
"We deplore this omission because it places a severe strain on the very future of the process."
"Having reached the time for the votes, we will suspend the debate and continue with it this afternoon."
"– Ladies and gentlemen, before beginning the vote, I give the floor to Mr Zappalà for a proposal on an issue that we did not resolve at the beginning of yesterday’s sitting, that is when to vote on his report: on Thursday here in Strasbourg, or during the part-session in Brussels, taking into consideration, however, the fact that, according to our agenda, the debate on this issue is in any event planned for Thursday morning."
". Mr President, we – and therefore I personally as rapporteur – agree with the request from the Group of the Party of European Socialists to keep, if possible, the debate on Thursday morning at 10 a.m. and to postpone the vote – which was conclusive at first reading – until the next session, that is to the part-session at the end of the month in Brussels."
". – Mr President, I will be very brief."
"This convention is the first global instrument on combating criminal networks to contain universal definitions of fundamental notions of criminal law in the field of the fight against organised crime."
"The international community now has a comprehensive instrument with which to fight in a concerted way against the rise in organised crime."
"I therefore call on those Member States of the European Union that have not yet ratified this convention to do so quickly."
". – Mr President, the Council of the European Union has stated three times in its summit meetings that in the future agriculture will also be able to be practised in those regions that have special problems."
"Earning one’s living from agriculture has considerable importance for those regions, as there is a desire to keep the countryside alive and habitable."
"It also has its own cultural and environmental value."
"I think it important that any reform in rural policy should take account of the criteria which apply to northern agricultural areas."
"In my report I propose that the Commission should lay down clear definitions and criteria, based on climate, the length of the growing season, low population density and outlying position, so as to ensure that the permanent handicaps of northern agricultural regions can be taken into account."
"My basic premise is that the range of measures under the common agricultural policy must be developed in a way that takes the special conditions prevailing in northern agricultural areas into greater consideration."
"One idea is to regionalise the CAP and make it more flexible, so that it can identify more effectively than at present the preconditions required to enable farms operating in different areas to compete on an equal footing in the single market."
"– Mr President, I regret having reacted too slowly."
"I wish to remove my name from the Breyer report in view of the decision by the majority in this House to support nuclear power stations in the course of construction within and outside the EU, which is diametrically opposed to my own position."
"I would therefore ask you to have it recorded in the Minutes that I wish to resign as rapporteur for this report."
"Mr Breyer, a rapporteur usually makes this explanation before the final vote, but I can see that we have perhaps proceeded too quickly in the vote."
"Your explanation will, however, be recorded in the Minutes."
". Despite the obvious diversity inherent in the nature of plants in the area under our consideration, which fundamentally warrants its own Community Institute, for a long time plant varieties have not only been goods to study and consume, and human creative activity has clearly played a role in their development."
"Given the multiplicity of industrial property rights at stake in this issue and the specific characteristics inherent therein, I voted in favour because I accept the need, highlighted by the Council and the Commission, to bring the Community system for protecting plant varieties into line with the directive on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions."
"The value of legal certainty and of the protection of creators and inventors, the interweaving of these situations and their importance today suggest that the coherence of users’ rights systems and of cross licences for plant varieties that incorporate patent-protected inventions should be guaranteed."
"This harmonisation will in particular guarantee that the holder of a biotechnological patent can use a plant variety that contains his or her invention, when the holder of the plant variety right refuses to grant a contractual licence and when the invention represents significant technical progress of considerable economic interest."
". Illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU fishing) a highly destructive practice, a mode of fishing that damages the conservation and sustainable management of fish stocks."
"Tuna fishing is one of the types of fishing worst affected by these illegal practices. It should be added that Community fleets are among the largest exploiters of these stocks."
"In this context, the EU has played a leading role in combating this type of fishing, specifically by fighting against flags of convenience."
"These measures are, however, clearly proving to be inadequate."
"In Portugal, especially on the coast of the Algarve, we are extremely familiar with IUU fishing, but I will not repeat accusations that I have already made in this House."
"I do support this report, however, which in my opinion will both help to preserve fish stocks and to bring some calm to Community waters."
"I support this report because it urges Member States to make efforts to prevent their nationals from taking part in illegal fishing activities."
"I congratulate Mrs McKenna on this report which, when implemented, could effectively solve problems with which we are all familiar, even though we are finding it hard to combat them."
"The issue before us concerns the apt proposal to update a Community regulation that brings together the control measures agreed by the various Regional Fisheries Organizations (RFOs). Since the regulation’s adoption, the RFOs have adopted new measures, which must be transposed into Community law."
"In particular, the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT, an RFO that has played a leading role in combating illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing, now proposes a package of measures with which to confront this destructive practice, concentrating on fishing undertaken by vessels flying flags of convenience."
"Another situation that needs to be remedied is the poor quality of the data submitted by the flag countries which, apart from being one of the most fundamental obligations of the flag country, makes any assessment of stocks less reliable."
"Since Community vessels constitute one of the main fleets fishing for these stocks, the EU must adopt a responsible stance and lead by example."
"I join the rapporteur in welcoming the efforts made by ICCAT to address these problems in its field of regulation, accepting a stance that will inspire other RFOs and other international developments in this field."
"I supported this report and voted in favour of it."
". I support this excellent report by Mr Pirker, which proposes a reshaping of the 1997 Joint Action, with a view to combating new synthetic drugs more rapidly and effectively."
"We face the problem of a steady increase in the manufacture and trade in synthetic drugs and rigorous and effective forms of control must be put in place as a matter of urgency."
"This proposal seeks both to update this Joint Action and, at the same time, to ensure greater transparency and to extend the Joint Action’s scope as regards exchanging information, risk assessment and the control of new synthetic drugs."
"This has been an extremely effective instrument for ensuring a rapid exchange of information and the scope is now extended to all new synthetic drugs and narcotic drugs, including those likely to be defined as medicinal products."
"We should also welcome the fact that the structures are to be simplified, as the rapporteur proposes, so as to ensure that information exchanges and risk assessments are carried out as simply and effectively as possible."
"We hope that the Joint Action does not confine itself to operating simply as a rapid-response mechanism but also serves, in future, to provide long-term monitoring of synthetic substances through a constant exchange of information between the Member States, Europol and the EMCDDA."
". This largely technical report seeks to update and extend the scope of the Joint Action and to improve the exchange of information, risk assessment and control of synthetic drugs and narcotic drugs on the basis of current procedures such as the ‘early-warning system’, the mechanism for assessing the social risks to health, amongst other things – by a scientific committee – and the procedure of monitoring by Member States."
"It is hoped that, in future, we will not simply implement the rapid response mechanism but new synthetic drugs will also be monitored, in the long term, by means of an ongoing procedure for exchanging information."
"I share my group’s view of the rapporteur’s intention in highlighting the aim of simplifying the structure of information exchanges, proposing a set of amendments that seeks to make the entire process more effective."
"Consequently, this report broadly warrants our support."
". The Commission proposal seeks to update, enhance and extend the Joint Action of June 1997, on exchanging information, risk assessment and the control of new synthetic drugs through Europol and the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA)."
"Coordinating on three aspects – a early-warning system, risk assessment by a scientific committee, EU action to subject notified substances to control measures in the Member States – the Joint Action has proved its effectiveness, fully justifying its existence and the clarification procedures, and I, like the rapporteur, welcome extending its scope to new drugs and the introduction of deadlines for each stage of the procedure."
"Given that it won a broad majority in the specialist Parliamentary committee, this proposal, with the amendments tabled to it by the rapporteur, responds to the desires of those who have not renounced the war on drugs, or opted for the path of least resistance, which removes any accountability."
"I voted in favour because I believe that this is an area of key importance to the future of Member State communities, particularly amongst young people, which fully justifies closely coordinated actions that will enable a rapid reaction and effective monitoring of the nature, origin, trafficking and consumption of new narcotic drugs and new synthetic drugs."
". I welcome the European Community’s conclusion of the International Convention against organised crime, in other words, the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime and the protocols thereto against trafficking in persons and the smuggling of migrants."
"This extremely important convention is the first legally binding United Nations instrument in this field and constitutes the first global instrument designed to combat criminal networks, laying down universal definitions of certain fundamental criminal law concepts relating to the fight against organised crime."
"The widest possible cooperation is required, based on common procedures and minimum harmonisation of legal standards."
"This is the only way we will be able to fight transnational crime more effectively and prevent criminal networks from exploiting the differences and loopholes that exist in the legislation of the Member States."
"This Convention must enable signatory states to cooperate more effectively in fighting organised crime by harmonising definitions of individual offences in the different national legal systems."
"There will be four types of serious offence: involvement in an organised criminal network, money laundering, obstruction of justice and corruption."
". Given the extremely poor living conditions of millions and millions of migrants and victims of trafficking in human beings throughout the world and in Europe, who are forced to endure situations of unacceptable exploitation and humiliation, without any rights, I welcome the Council’s conclusion of the agreement on the UN Convention against organised transnational crime and the protocols thereto against the trafficking of persons and the smuggling of migrants."
"This is an instrument of international law that will contribute to closer cooperation between countries in the fight against organised crime, in particular by harmonising the definition of offences (involvement in an organised criminal network, money laundering, obstruction of justice and corruption), through measures including mutual legal assistance and joint investigations."
"The protocols, for their part, are designed to enable measures to be developed to combat trafficking in human beings in particular women and children thereby protecting such people against slavery, sexual exploitation and illegal employment. These measures include providing victims with assistance and support."
"These are measures that need to be implemented urgently and effectively, and absolutely must be complemented by other policies to combat the deep-rooted societal causes of today’s organised economic crime, from financial crime to the exploitation of men, women and children."
". Conservative MEPs support cooperation on issues of transnational organised crime on an intergovernmental basis within the framework of the UN."
"However, we cannot support the growing trend for harmonisation of criminal law at a European level as this is unnecessary and impractical."
"Because of this, we will abstain on this report."
". The United Nations Convention is intended to enable signatory countries to cooperate effectively in fighting organised crime, by harmonising the definition of crimes in the various national legal systems, so that an act constituting an offence in one signatory State is also considered to be an offence in the other signatory countries."
"In this context, this will be the first global instrument for combating criminal networks, which will provide universal definitions of certain fundamental concepts of criminal law in the fight against organised crime."
"This will also be the first legally binding United Nations instrument in this field."
"As regards the two Protocols, these set out rigorous measures designed to combat trafficking in human beings in particular women and children thereby protecting such persons from slavery, sexual exploitation and illegal employment."
"It should be noted in this context that measures are included to provide both legal and material assistance to victims of trafficking."
"Article 6 consequently obliges signatory States not only to ensure that information is provided on the judicial and administrative procedures in force, but also to adopt measures designed to ensure the physical and psychological recovery of the victims of trafficking."
"Given the importance of the issues at stake, and the genuinely pioneering nature of this Convention, my vote could only be favourable."
". I support this initiative and stress the urgent need to adopt a set of regulations on protecting the environment through criminal law."
"Various environmental disasters have occurred, such as the recent sinking of the , off the coast of Galicia."
"The necessary measures must be adopted on pollution by ships, in order to prevent this type of disaster from reoccurring."
"I agree with the rapporteur’s statement that the proposal for a directive on protecting the environment through criminal law must be adopted as swiftly as possible, because it provides for the harmonisation of criminal and other deterrent sanctions applicable to acts of pollution which infringe Community law."
"This Framework Decision is intended to strengthen this criminal law framework with measures designed to harmonise Member States’ legislative and regulatory provisions on the crime of ship-source pollution, to provide jurisdictional competence (by preventing conflicts of competence) and to promote cooperation between Member States (by establishing contact points for exchanging information)."
"We must end the variation in current levels of sanctions, which ultimately creates distortions in terms of the potential consequences, in particular the financial consequences, of an incident of pollution for the place in which it occurs, because this pollution might affect several Member States of the Union."
". Conservative MEPs believe that ship-source pollution is a problem which must be tackled."
"We agree with some of the measures proposed in the report, including the establishment of joint investigation teams."
"However, we cannot support the growing trend for harmonisation of criminal law within the EU and cannot therefore support this report."
".In light of both the oil tanker disaster and of the proposal adopted by this House, at the initiative of the signatory, to create a Community programme aimed exclusively at developing mechanisms to protect the EU’s external borders, in particular its maritime borders, I have followed this debate with great interest."
"Any measures taken in the name of maritime safety are to be welcomed and correspond to a correctly identified general need."
"It is appropriate to focus not only on accidents but also on the main sources of maritime pollution, which are the systematic contraventions of legislation in this field."
"This also displays political awareness of the environmental problems affecting us."
"I therefore voted in favour of the reports on maritime safety, with the exception of the Pex report, as I do not agree with the rapporteur’s proposal to create a European Coastguard."
"The EU has an obligation to promote maritime safety and must not, under any circumstances, be relieved of this obligation."
"The creation of a European Coastguard would be a step too far, however. We would be better advised to encourage closer cooperation between Member States, which would in turn foster greater interoperability and compatibility of the resources available at intra-European level and would avoid wasteful duplication and overlapping."
"With regard to Amendment No 22, we believe it is extremely important to take measures against environmental offences at sea."
"We welcome increased European cooperation between the national coastguards when it comes to common operations, planning and the development of competences."
"We do not therefore believe that there is any need to develop a new, parallel organisation at European level."
"We look forward to the work of the European Maritime Safety Agency."
". – I voted in favour of the Pex report, which is a major step forward in the fight to improve maritime safety."
"Do I need to remind you that every year more than 6 million tonnes of polluting waste is deliberately discharged into the sea?"
"It is vital that we fight with determination against the hooligans of the sea who use the oceans as a rubbish dump!"
"Polluters should be severely punished and all of the parties involved in the transport of goods should be made aware of their responsibilities."
"Prevention is better than cure."
"The fight against these unscrupulous people therefore needs to be more effective and better reflect reality."
"The number of people caught in the act is actually minimal compared with the real number of deliberate acts of pollution."
"In addition, there is often a long procedure before judgment is passed on them and heavy penalties are imposed – which is not always the case – to deter them from reoffending."
"As a first step, I support cooperation between the maritime police forces of the various coastal States."
"Subsequently, a joint European coastguard service could be set up, provided that it is subject to strict controls on its efficiency."
". This report forms part of the package of proposals on maritime safety, put together following the disaster of the oil tanker."
"It should be noted that maritime pollution by oil tankers does not occur only as the result of accidents; it is also caused by illegal discharges."
"For this reason, the proposal seeks to incorporate into Community law the existing international rules governing discharges – such as the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) – and to provide guidance concerning the nature of the penalties to be imposed."
"We must recall, however, that this battle will not be won through further legislation alone; this legislation must be effectively implemented and monitored, which requires the appropriate means."
"I reject the proposal to create a European coast guard (Amendment No 6), not only because of the issues of sovereignty that it raises, but also because it is not the best solution for ensuring compliance with laws and monitoring and nor does it respond to the fundamental issue of resources. This proposal consequently contains broader ideas than simply combating pollution."
"What is needed is effective cooperation and exchanges of information between the various national coast guards and to ensure that each Member State provides the appropriate funding of resources for monitoring and combating maritime pollution – and here the Community budget could make a significant contribution."
". Conservative MEPs broadly welcome the proposals to put in place legislation under which those responsible for unlawful oil or chemical discharges from ships can be prosecuted."
"The UK already has criminal sanctions in place for unlawful discharges as specified in the MARPOL Convention and, as such, matters relating to criminal law should fall within the competence of the Member State and not the Community."
"We do not believe, however, that the introduction of a European Coastguard is either practical or necessary, since it is inconsistent with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea."
"For this reason we were unable to support amendments calling for the creation of a European Coastguard."
".In light of both the oil tanker disaster and of the proposal approved by this House, at the initiative of the signatory, to create a Community programme aimed exclusively at developing mechanisms to protect the EU’s external borders, in particular its maritime borders, I have followed this debate with great interest."
"Any measures taken in the name of maritime safety are to be welcomed and correspond to a correctly identified general need."
"It is appropriate to focus not only on accidents but also on the main sources of maritime pollution, which are the systematic contraventions of legislation in this field."
"This also displays political awareness of the environmental problems affecting us."
"I therefore voted in favour of the reports on maritime safety, with the exception of the Pex report, as I do not agree with the rapporteur’s proposal to create a European Coastguard."
"The EU has an obligation to promote maritime safety and must not, under any circumstances, be relieved of this obligation."
"The creation of a European Coastguard would be a step too far, however. We would be better advised to encourage closer cooperation between Member States, which would in turn foster greater interoperability and compatibility of the resources available at intra-European level and would avoid wasteful duplication and overlapping."
". Mindful of the consequences of the ecological disaster caused by the stricken oil tanker in November 2002 I believe that the appalling damage caused by illegal discharges of oil or other noxious liquid substances, endanger communities and the environment and must consequently be subject to criminal sanctions."
"The ‘polluter pays’ principle must apply in this matter, following the approval last December of a recommendation for a Directive that sets out tougher EU rules on environmental liability."
"From a strictly legal perspective, however, I believe that this situation is far from simple, given that the proposed Directive is based on Article 80 relating to transport, although it also a matter of defining a crime."
"It is, therefore, legitimate to question the appropriateness of the procedure."
"I also have certain reservations concerning the creation of a European Coastguard, since this is the prerogative of the Member-States, without prejudice to very close intergovernmental cooperation or to Community responsibility regarding equipment and modern and effective measures."
"Although I am unreservedly in favour of the final aims, I had no choice but to abstain because I feel that this matter merits further consideration, in order to find a technical solution to this serious problem."
"Each year, thousands of deliberate discharges take place through waste and cargo residues, including chemicals and oil, being dumped in the sea."
"The need for common legislation within this environmental area is therefore indisputable."
"It has not, however, been demonstrated, and still less proved, that the most suitable and effective method of coping with these breaches of the law is to set up a further European agency or common EU coastguard."
"Better coordination between the Member States, together with increased accountability on the part of respective countries’ governments may prove to be just as effective."
"For that reason, I voted against Amendments Nos 6 and 22, which were however adopted (by, respectively, 382 ‘yes’ votes, 82 ‘no’ votes and 20 abstentions and 392 ‘yes’ votes, 71 ‘no’ votes and 33 abstentions)."
"Mr President, with reference to Mr Poignant's report, I voted against the notion that the EU flag should appear on all EU vessels."
"The diversity of the European Union is something to celebrate and not to eliminate."
"I look forward to the day when an independent Scotland will have its flag on its vessels and in many other places, choosing if and when it is appropriate to have the EU flag alongside."
"I do not believe that this is one of the occasions when that is either appropriate, necessary or desirable."
". In principle Conservative MEPs welcome the proposal for a regulation on the transfer of cargo and passenger ships between registers within the Community and accept that it will improve cooperation between the administrators of maritime registers in the Member States."
"Proposals that make it easier for ships from an EU Member State to move in and out of Community ports, thus facilitating the free movement of goods, are to be welcomed."
"However, Conservative MEPs voted against amendments calling for Member States to display the emblem of the European Union i.e. a circle of 12 gold stars on a square blue background – in the corner of their flags because these amendments will do nothing to improve maritime safety and could even make EU-registered ships potential targets."
". – We supported the amendments seeking to improve maritime safety."
"We are in favour of extending the scope of application of the regulation to passenger ships, of coordinating with the other Community tools and of strengthening cooperation between national maritime administrations."
"At a time when the European Union is enlarging to include Malta and Cyprus, making it the world’s largest shipping power, these changes are urgent and essential."
"The two island States must at all costs raise the moral standards of their flags, which are real flags of convenience at the service of the ‘hooligans of the sea’."
"But we must also denounce those countries which, like France, have created a ‘second flag’."
"French shipowners now only use the flag of the French Southern and Antarctic Lands."
"Their vessels are registered in France (making them eligible for the relevant aids and subsidies), but up to 65% of the seamen on board are of foreign nationality."
"Their pay and working and living conditions obviously depend on their country of origin and bear no relation to their qualifications."
"This exploitation means that huge profits are reaped at the price of the dignity, rights, health and sometimes even the lives of crews that come in the main from the poorest countries on earth."
"That is the real scandal of the shipping register."
".In light of both the oil tanker disaster and of the proposal approved by this House, at the initiative of the signatory, to create a Community programme aimed exclusively at developing mechanisms to protect the EU’s external borders, in particular its maritime borders, I have followed this debate with great interest."
"Any measures taken in the name of maritime safety are to be welcomed and correspond to a correctly identified general need."
"It is appropriate to focus not only on accidents but also on the main sources of maritime pollution, which are the systematic contraventions of legislation in this field."
"This also displays political awareness of the environmental problems affecting us."
"I therefore voted in favour of the reports on maritime safety, with the exception of the Pex report, as I do not agree with the rapporteur’s proposal to create a European Coastguard."
"The EU has an obligation to promote maritime safety and must not, under any circumstances, be relieved of this obligation."
"The creation of a European Coastguard would be a step too far, however. We would be better advised to encourage closer cooperation between Member States, which would in turn foster greater interoperability and compatibility of the resources available at intra-European level and would avoid wasteful duplication and overlapping."
". I believe that the approach taken by this report, regarding the transfer of cargo and passenger ships between EU Member State registers, manages to strike the right balance between the various elements involved."
"While the 1991 Regulation succeeded in its aim of reducing administrative duties regarding changes of flag within Member States, the rapporteur, and the European Commission in its proposal, have not lost sight of the indispensable need for safety, tragically confirmed by the oil tanker disaster in 2002."
"I believe it is possible to make it attractive to fly the flags of Member States – the EU needs to have a considerable fleet – without being negligent on matters of safety."
"Shying away from centralising everything, the rapporteur chose not to suggest creating a single EU register."
"While such a register might cut costs, this would only be valid if the EU register could replace national registers completely, which according to experts does not appear to be feasible."
"Cooperation and in particular establishing reciprocal responsibilities between national maritime authorities are preferable and will certainly contribute towards establishing regular interaction. This would also be reinforced by the rapporteur’s suggestion that the Commission draft a report to the EP and the Council regarding the implementation of the new rules."
"Mr President, today's vote on nuclear waste is most timely, given that research recently showed that over half the UK sites identified as potential nuclear dumps are located in Scotland."
"My Group today voted against the nuclear package because it offers nothing in terms of environmental safety."
"Furthermore, my party will continue to fight against Scotland becoming a nuclear dustbin."
"The Scottish National Party's vision of an independent Scotland is one of a clean, green Scotland profiting from our natural heritage and healthy environment."
"London, by contrast, seems to think that the rule when considering nuclear-waste dumps should be 'the further away the better', and regards Scotland as the ideal place."
"The people of Scotland will simply not stand for this treatment and my party will continue to fight against this filthy industry."
". – In the Vidal-Quadras Roca report on the management of spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste and in the Seppänen report on the safety of nuclear installations, we supported all those amendments that sought to impose stricter safety requirements on the operation of the installations, and on the treatment and storage of radioactive waste."
"We did not, however, support the amendments that removed any timetable for improving safety, sometimes for technical reasons, but ultimately letting the Member States do as they please."
"Without denying that nuclear power has its intrinsic dangers, it is the fact that we cannot trust those in power, because they always put the financial interests of private groups before the human interests of the public, that is still the worst danger."
". We believe that the need to find acceptable solutions to radioactive waste management is one of the main problems, if not main problem affecting nuclear energy."
"The Commission feels that current policy in most Member States and candidate countries does not effectively address the problem of nuclear waste. It is imperative that Member States develop appropriate strategies and prepare detailed, timetabled programmes for the long-term management of all types of waste within their jurisdiction."
"The aim of the Directive is to encourage progress to this end, while stressing the importance of the various elements of the question: identifying and preparing disposal sites, carrying out important R[amp]D into identifying and implementing the best technical waste elimination solutions and technologies that will enable significant reduction of the amount and danger level of waste generated during the process of producing nuclear energy."
"Member States must be encouraged to work together on waste management, without losing sight of the principle that each country must deal with its own waste, except in special circumstances, and no activity in this field must endanger public health or the environment."
"I welcome this Directive, which appears to be fully justified."
"There are certain proposals in the report that do not appear to be essential and some did not deserve..."
". Nearly thirty years after the publication of the 1975 EEC Directive on the management of solid waste, the institutions of the European Union have finally decided to address the subject of the management of spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste."
"In reality, the proposed directive, apart from rehashing a few general terms which apply to all waste, contains no material reference to the special and sensitive nature, as far as public health is concerned, of radioactive waste."
"The proposals to create deep geological disposal facilities by specific deadlines are so poorly substantiated that they are in fact no more than idle chitchat."
"The report by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy endeavours to support the inadequate text of the directive with comments which are either neutral or even negative."
"For example, the report accepts the export of spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste to third countries, something with which we disagree radically."
"The proposal for a directive and the report by the Committee on Industry confirm yet again our assessment that there is a huge gap between the seriousness and acuteness of the environmental problems created by the uncontrolled action of big business and the measures taken to deal with them."
"That is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece are voting against the relevant texts."
". – The proliferation of radioactive waste is a major problem for the environment and public health."
"Nonetheless, countries like France are relaunching their programme to construct new nuclear power stations, which are no better than the old ones in this respect."
"At the same time, the liberalisation mentality brings social dangers as well as ecological ones, in particular because of the increasingly widespread practice of outsourcing the maintenance of nuclear installations."
"In this context, the Vidal-Quadras Roca report, as amended, admittedly claims to contribute to better monitoring of nuclear waste, but it presents serious shortcomings in two respects: it maintains the possibility for a State to export its waste to a third country (even though, and this is an improvement, it provides for, ‘the prior written informed consent of States’) and it advocates the deep geological disposal of radioactive waste, a practice that is strongly opposed by those who live nearby and by many scientists."
"That is why we voted against this report."
"The nuclear sector confirms that it is prohibitively expensive and benefits from scandalously advantageous conditions compared with sectors that produce ‘clean’ energy."
"We need to reverse this way of thinking."
"We therefore express our solidarity with the joint demonstration calling for us to abandon nuclear power that will be taking place on Saturday 17 January in Paris."
". When, in the fifties and sixties of the last century, nuclear fission was promoted as an inexhaustible source of energy for the future, scarcely a thought was given to the waste."
"The radioactivity of that material takes a long time to diminish and can last for tens of thousands of years at a lower level."
"This insoluble problem of waste should be a compelling reason to refrain from any further use of nuclear fission."
"Instead, pressure is mounting to increase underground storage capacity for this hazardous material, for example in the underground salt domes in the Dutch province of Drenthe."
"In June 2003, I asked the European Commission for clarification on the subject of plans to make it compulsory for Member States of the EU to use geological disposal sites for the permanent disposal of the most hazardous forms of radioactive waste from 2018."
"In reply, I was told that a study on the evaluation of the functioning of geological containment systems had shown that all the European countries have a suitable subsoil of suitable clay, salt or crystalline rock strata."
"In addition, the possibility now seems to be left open of regarding this waste as a commodity that must be allowed in to all Member States of the EU without an import licence by virtue of the free movement of goods."
"Since Parliament does not have the authority to prohibit this, the only remaining way of contesting imports is via the Court of Justice of the EC."
"As far as I am concerned, this is reason enough to vote against this whole directive."
". In the vote on the three reports on nuclear energy, I opted for what I consider the most prudent political line for those who, like me, are in favour of this energy source, provided that the highest levels of safety are maintained."
"This would mean safe installations – not only working installations – and safe spent fuels and radioactive waste – both at the final destination and at every stage en route to the disposal site."
"All Member States produce radioactive waste from nuclear processing plants, research reactors and various medical and industrial applications."
"It is bad enough that these materials are stored in temporary facilities but, worse still, there are no immediate plans to build permanent disposal facilities in any Member State."
"In its proposals, the Commission argues that whenever nuclear energy is exploited for commercial purposes, adequate safety levels must be guaranteed and that countries must accordingly be obliged to enforce a series of rules."
"It is this concept of obligation that sets these proposals apart from the international conventions already in place."
"I too therefore voted in favour of these proposals."
". All Member States and candidate countries produce radioactive waste, the most radiologically toxic forms of which are currently held in temporary storage facilities."
"No Member State has access to permanent storage, and nor does any Member State have plans to build any such facility in the near future."
"It is therefore a matter of the utmost urgency that we provide workable solutions."
"The rapporteur was right to favour a two-stage approach, which would be more feasible and more effective than a single timetable."
"Firstly, each Member State should, by 31 December 2006, set its own deadlines to prepare and submit to the Commission a detailed programme for the long-term management of all types of radioactive waste under its jurisdiction in line with international standards."
"Once the programme has been submitted, each Member State must set its own deadlines to put the programme into practice, choose a site, build the disposal facility and begin operations."
"Working in this way will make it possible to achieve the stated aim, ensuring the flexibility needed to address the various situations in the EU in this regard."
"This solution, in keeping with the principle of subsidiarity, is an important step towards responding to European citizens’ concerns for regulation in this sensitive field. By setting deadlines, timetables and targets, it also creates an effective framework of liability."
"I therefore voted in favour."
"We Moderates give the highest priority to the best possible level of safety for nuclear energy."
"We believe that the Swedish safety organisation, in conjunction with the work done by the IAEA, WENRA and other existing organisations properly fulfil the requirements for devising safety regulations and monitoring compliance with these."
"We are, however, doubtful as to whether the EU has the required Treaty-based competence to take decisions on directives concerning the safety of nuclear installations, at least where the Seppänen report is concerned."
"In the final vote, we have chosen to vote in favour of the report since it has not been possible to vote on the proposed legal basis for the directive and since the report is clearly much better than the Commission’s proposal."
". It is essential that we create a legally binding legislative framework in the field of the safety of nuclear installations, given that there are still major discrepancies between nuclear safety measures in the various Member States."
"The aim is to ensure that high levels of nuclear safety are maintained in the EU, given that the system to be implemented will fall within the competencies of national safety authorities."
"The purpose of the Community system is to complement national systems."
"Community monitoring will consist of verifying the way in which national authorities are carrying out their work."
"The intention is not to undertake on-site safety inspections of nuclear installations."
"The Commission’s proposal would appear justified."
"Some objections, however, might be raised by Member States that feel that the Commission is interfering in matters of national sovereignty, in terms of competence to take decisions concerning conditions of securing and operating nuclear installations."
"This is why so much care is being taken in the wording of provisions on interaction with national safety authorities and the form that Community monitoring will take, which we believe to be the right approach."
"I therefore voted in favour."
". In the vote on the three reports on nuclear energy, I opted for what I consider the most prudent political line for those who, like me, are in favour of this energy source, provided that the highest levels of safety are maintained."
"This would mean safe installations – not only working installations – and safe spent fuels and radioactive waste – both at the final destination and at every stage en route to the disposal site."
"All Member States produce radioactive waste from nuclear processing plants, research reactors and various medical and industrial applications."
"It is bad enough that these materials are stored in temporary facilities but, worse still, there are no immediate plans to build permanent disposal facilities in any Member State."
"In its proposals, the Commission argues that whenever nuclear energy is exploited for commercial purposes, adequate safety levels must be guaranteed and that countries must accordingly be obliged to enforce a series of rules."
"It is this concept of obligation that sets these proposals apart from the international conventions already in place."
"I too therefore voted in favour of these proposals."
". I voted in favour of this important report, for the same reasons I expressed in my explanation of vote on the other reports in this ‘nuclear package’."
"Views on this sensitive issue differ substantially between Member States. Similarly, the level of acceptance of nuclear risk on the part of the citizens varies markedly from Member State to Member State."
"Fortunately, however, emphasis appears to have been placed on the crucial issue of promoting and sharing ‘best practice’ in many areas of European life."
"The Commission’s aim, with this proposal, is to ensure that best practice in the field of nuclear safety is implemented in all Member States and in all civil nuclear installations."
"I believe that the intention of this proposal is not to replace the Convention on Nuclear Safety – concluded under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency – to which all EU States are party. It is rather aimed at maintaining a high level of minimum safety, under the auspices and responsibility of the Member States, on the basis of closer cooperation and greater solidarity, thus resulting in ‘best practice’."
"I would vote against the proposal currently before us if it implied a shift towards shared competences from what has hitherto been traditionally and exclusively a matter of national competence."
"This is a very reasonable concern on the rapporteur’s part, one which has always been something of a ‘warning sign’ and a clear delimitation of the legislator’s spirit."
"I chose to vote in favour of Amendment No 29 by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, designed to clarify and tighten up the wording on protecting the general public when radioactive material is handled."
"Moreover, I also voted in favour of Amendment No 30 on removing obstacles in the energy market in the interests of fairer competition between nuclear energy and other energy sources."
". The question before us is whether the 77/270/Euratom Decision, which empowers the Commission to issue Euratom loans for the purpose of contributing to the financing of nuclear power stations, must be adapted to suit the circumstances of certain third countries about to join the EU, in which such investments are clearly of considerable significance."
"There does not appear to be any place for technical nuclear considerations in this proposal for an amendment."
"Whether or not the principle of these loans is acceptable is another matter."
"This is a question, however, which would arise regardless of the amendment currently before us."
"It should be noted that the mechanism of loans was introduced in 1977 and at the time covered only Member States. It was amended in 1994, when the question emerged of the EU’s contributing towards encouraging safety improvements in nuclear installations in third countries, in particular Soviet-designed reactors in former Eastern Bloc countries."
". My stance of absolute opposition to the use of nuclear power is well known."
"I respect the right of each Member State to decide on its own energy policy."
"However, that choice must fully respect the choices made by other states to be nuclear-free."
"The activities of nuclear power stations and reprocessing plants have implications that go beyond borders."
"As a public representative for the east coast of Ireland, I am at all times conscious of the threat posed to my constituents and our environment from nuclear installations on the other side of the Irish Sea, in particular the outdated, decrepit and accident-prone Sellafield plant in Cumbria."
"If Member States which persist with nuclear generation want to reassure their neighbours, they must give full access to information to the appropriate authorities in those neighbouring states."
"The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland has recently stated that it has become more difficult to obtain information on Sellafield from the British authorities over the past couple of years."
"This surely neither is good neighbourliness nor reflects an ."
"It is hypocritical to spend EU funds on prolonging the life of dangerous facilities."
"Plants that cannot meet rigorous international standards should be decommissioned."
". Euro-optimists often declare that there was an enormous increase in the powers of the European Parliament in the nineties."
"This is true as regards the number of subjects where codecision applies, but not as regards final decisions."
"In a normal parliamentary democracy, the parliament has the right of initiative and also the last word on legislation, budget and the forming of coalitions."
"This proposal clearly reveals the democratic deficit within the European Union once more, now that the increase in the ceiling for Euratom loans, from EUR 4 000 million to EUR 6 000 million, appears not to fall within the competence of Parliament, but only of the Council."
"The most positive element in this proposal is the extension of action to improve nuclear safety from just the Member States of the EU to Russia, Ukraine and Armenia."
"A difference of opinion remains over the form this action should take."
"Some want nuclear power stations that are more modern; others want these closed down for good."
"I agree with the rapporteur, Mrs Breyer, that the purpose of loans for the financing of nuclear power stations should no longer be to expand nuclear power, but to abolish it."
"The vote in the specialist committee has practically reversed the direction of this report, and, as a result, I, like the rapporteur herself, can no longer support it."
". – Let us hope that this Parliament’s startled reaction to the Breyer report will not only mark the final shot in the dogmatic campaign of the anti-nuclear ayatollahs, but will also usher in a period of calm reflection that will herald a real change of direction."
"In fact, only nuclear energy – enriched with spectacular research progress which already makes abundant high-quality energy available perfectly safely – is able to respond not only to the concern to safeguard the environment but also to the need for energy independence and the formidable challenge represented by the growth of emerging countries."
"Is it in fact reasonable to think that the demand for energy, the corollary of development, can be satisfied by renewable energies in countries like India and China?"
"Is it responsible to condemn nuclear energy to be abandoned in Europe when we alone can contribute, by virtue of our experience and excellence in this field, to making new installations really safe, installations which will not wait for the Union to give the green light before being built in these third countries?"
"The energy issue, a sensitive one for the European Union, a vital one for three quarters of the planet, will only be resolved by adopting a dispassionate and pragmatic approach, far removed from the idle dreams and fantasies of ecological fundamentalism."
". In the vote on the three reports on nuclear energy, I opted for what I consider to be the most prudent political line for those who, like me, are in favour of this energy source, provided that the highest levels of safety are maintained."
"This would mean safe installations – not only working installations – and safe spent fuels and radioactive waste – both at the final destination and at every stage en route to the disposal site."
"All Member States produce radioactive waste from nuclear processing plants, research reactors and various medical and industrial applications."
"It is bad enough that these materials are stored in temporary facilities but, worse still, there are no immediate plans to build permanent disposal facilities in any Member State."
"In its proposals, the Commission argues that whenever nuclear energy is exploited for commercial purposes, adequate safety levels must be guaranteed and that countries must accordingly be obliged to enforce a series of rules."
"It is this concept of obligation that sets these proposals apart from the international conventions already in place."
"I too therefore voted in favour of these proposals."
". I agree with the proposal for a Decision currently before us."
"I also feel that the increase in appropriations must be directed primarily towards improving safety in existing reactors. Unlike the rapporteur, however, I feel that this should not exclude financing projects aimed at securing or improving existing equipment."
"Such is the case of the Euratom loan under active development for the completion of a reactor designed and built in Romania by Canadian, French, Italian and US companies – Cernavoda 2."
"I am therefore opposed to such restrictive measures aimed solely at decommissioning facilities."
"Like all European citizens, I am concerned about the safety of installations – especially following the socio-political changes in Eastern Europe after November 1989 – and about current decommissioning programmes."
"Support for this proposal for a Decision arises from these concerns and from the idea that economic and social cohesion in Europe must also contribute more actively towards revitalising the economies of many of the countries where these installations are located, to which energy safety and sufficiency will certainly contribute a great deal."
"I voted in favour of Amendment No 19 by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance (which was voted down by 235 votes, with 71 votes in favour and 11 abstentions)."
"This amendment emphasises that inhabitants of potentially affected areas in neighbouring countries must have the same rights as people in the country in which the installation is situated, for example in the event of public consultation when loans are to be given from the Community budget."
"It is a matter of urgency that the Espoo Convention should be applied in practical terms."
". The Commission has, at the request of Parliament, submitted two framework directives."
"As these are within the competence of the European Institutions, we have voted to approve them, even though we do not agree with everything that they contain."
"The Danish Social Democratic delegation has today voted in favour of a series of amendments which, in terms of safety and the environment, will tighten up the original proposals."
"We finally chose, however, to abstain from voting in favour of these reports as a whole, because we do not think that the proposals go far enough regarding safety and environmental protection and because we are generally opposed to the use of nuclear energy."
". It is indeed important that we address the specific problems faced by the farming sector in Arctic and Sub-Arctic regions of Finland, Sweden, Scotland, Austria and Estonia."
"The cold climate of these regions means a shorter growing season and higher costs both for arable and livestock farming. Cereal harvests are similarly low and lacking in variety."
"In addition to the adverse climate, and partly as a result of this, there are also difficulties in terms of transporting and marketing produce."
"I therefore endorse the need, already highlighted by various European Councils, to ensure the sustainability and redistribution of agriculture throughout Europe and to maintain not only the picture postcard image of the rural landscape, but also the vitality of the countryside as a whole."
"Speaking as a staunch advocate of genuine convergence and of fighting against regional discrepancies, particularly in the outermost regions, I endorse recognising the special status of northern regions. I believe that the EU has a duty to encourage a balanced approach to farming areas, based on criteria of proportionality and suitability, without overlooking national identities or the side effects of agriculture."
"Since I am constantly referring to the specific characteristics and problems of Portuguese farming I am obliged also to recognise the specific problems faced by other Member States."
"As I have advocated on many occasions, the terms of the regulation and implementation of EU legislation (and operating rules of EU institutions) need to be as clearly worded as possible. If this is achieved, those operating in the sectors subject to this discipline will be afforded greater protection and so too will the citizens."
"We speak a great deal about bringing Europe ‘closer to the citizens’, whereas in reality it remains distant from them. The most effective contribution we can make towards bridging this gap is to simplify the rules and make them easier to understand."
"This would also guarantee the appropriateness and proportionality of community-level actions, while, of course, adhering to the principle of subsidiarity."
"I congratulate the rapporteur on her work, which, among other things, emphasises the importance of reviewing the legality of the European ‘executive’ agencies, those with certain responsibilities for managing Community programmes."
"I support in particular the requirement that these agencies must comply with the principle of transparency and with rules governing access to their documents."
"Lastly, I welcome the suggestion of a hearing of those nominated to head the agencies before the competent parliamentary committee and the idea that, on the committee’s recommendation, Parliament should deliver an opinion on the proposed candidate."
"This role of ‘ex-ante’ political scrutiny played by Parliament would be the natural complement to the ‘ex-post’ political scrutiny, in the form of the discharge for the implementation of the budget."
"That concludes the vote."
"The next item is the continuation of the debate on the Commission statement on the prospects for the Doha Development Round after the World Trade Organisation General Council meeting of 15 December 2003.(1)"
"– Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, Commissioner Lamy, ladies and gentlemen, global international trade plays an essential role in securing jobs in Europe, and especially in creating new ones."
"We have now got through a development round the core task of which is to bring about the right changes to internal imports into Europe."
"Although imports are, in principle, a very important and very good way to supporting development aid, we must not, on the other hand, overlook the need for our own small and medium-sized enterprises to be encouraged in their turn to export their products."
"The euro/US dollar parity and China’s present growth potential in excess of 8% per annum must prompt us to consider how we are to maintain our trade balance in future."
"To do that, we do, of course, have to be capable of competing on global markets."
"I believe it is a good thing, and that it will in future be important, that Europe should take on a certain leadership role in this area, that we should use regular conferences within Europe as a means of affirming our commitment to this and, as soon as possible, come up with feasible strategies and objectives, with a definite timetable."
"A single multilateral legal framework is, of course, of particular interest to Europe’s small and medium-sized enterprises, which employ in any case two-thirds of our workers."
"We are not interested in a complex international structure that only large conglomerates and their lawyers can cope with."
"The developing countries are not alone in needing clear and simple structures that will, in future, bring willingness to perform, the consequent access to prosperity and, finally, peace."
"Here too, we need to distinguish between equity based on distribution and that based upon what people contribute, and we should keep both these aspects in mind."
"Opening up our markets does, though, bring problems with it, for we must remain capable of competing internationally in the future."
"It is for this reason that Parliament must deal with this topic not merely in general terms; instead, this parliamentary assembly should, in future, put the emphasis on Europe."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Lamy and Commissioner Fischler, I would like to pick up on two brief comments that the two Commissioners made this morning."
"Commissioner Lamy remarked that we were, so to speak, passing from the technical stage to the political stage of the negotiating process, since officials had, in December, come to a sort of agreement as to how negotiations were to be proceeded with, although it is still not yet clear how the political negotiators can actually put that into an active working calendar."
"The second comment that I found very interesting was from Commissioner Fischler, who said what we would do, and added that it would not be at any price."
"That is, of course, an allusion to the European agenda and to the issue of how our thinking can have any influence in the context of the WTO negotiations."
"What, though – if I may make so bold as to ask the two Commissioners – does that actually mean in concrete terms?"
"Next year is an election year and a difficult one; you two will still be here in its first half, then things will get critical, and then – so to speak – you will no longer be there."
"We do not know who will be."
"The situation is similar on the American side – Bob Zoellick will not be coming back again either – and nor is the geostrategic situation straightforward; look at the way things are shaping up in India, look at China or at Brazil."
"So I ask you both: what do you now expect to happen, and how are you preparing yourselves for it?"
"What is in your calendars for January, February, and March, and when do you think the political stage will begin?"
"Now for my second question. Where is the pain barrier?"
"Where do we really think it is?"
"What is the ‘not at any price’ issue?"
"The Singapore issues?"
"I think not. Agriculture?"
"Perhaps, but I have seen the draft working document on the market organisation for sugar."
"Will you, Commissioner, produce a final draft by the end of your term of office?"
"You see, where is our pain barrier?"
"If we know a bit more about that, I believe we might perhaps be able to be a bit more proactive in steering the process that you all and we all want."
"In relation to that, please allow me to put a final question to the two Commissioners: what do you now, really, think of Bob Zoellick’s latest venture?"
"I heard brief indications that you take a positive view of it, but could you go into more detail about just how positive?"
"– Mr President, among the many failures that marked the history of the European Union in 2003 – the split on Iraq, the rejection of the euro by Sweden, the wreck of the Stability Pact and the fiasco of the draft constitution – the rout of the Commission in Cancún, which we debated in this very House just a short time ago, could in the end have been regarded as a minor incident."
"The vast majority of countries and people were actually glad that the Cancún Conference collapsed."
"The earth did not stop turning as a result and neither, moreover, did the world of trade."
"We could have left it at that and therefore preserved our way of life, because that is what this is all about, the covetousness of multinational markets."
"But we were reckoning without the Commission’s being so proactive; without you, Commissioner Lamy, being so proactive, if I may say so."
"In fact, this proactive stance owes nothing to any economic or social imperative – we have not heard anyone lament the failure of Cancún – but is actually due entirely to your desire to exercise and defend the Commission’s monopoly on representing the EU and negotiating on its behalf in the field of international business and external trade."
"The relentless pursuit of this goal that you are proposing to us is in fact not at all guided by the interests of Europe, but by the specific interests of the Commission in Brussels, at a time when the danger threatening our external trade, Commissioners, is not the lack of new outlets for our products but quite clearly the insurmountable and intolerable handicap imposed on us by an introverted European Central Bank, which delivers the most expensive, and by no means the strongest, currency in the world."
"Mr President, first of all I should like to say to the two Commissioners here – one of whom was in Cancún – how well and hard they worked to get a solution to the WTO negotiations."
"Where do we go from our new position?"
"Mrs Mann said, quite rightly, that we will have new people, both from America and from the European Union."
"We must make sure that people understand the position in which the European Union has put itself."
"Commissioner Lamy said in his speech that we have correctly reformed to move forward."
"How right he is."
"One of the reasons for the failure of the Cancún debate was its use and misuse, for example by NGOs."
"I have two press releases, one from Oxfam and the other from Friends of the Earth, one of which states that the G21 today refused to accept European plans to expand the WTO and bring in new negotiations to liberalise investment."
"Mr Rübig talked about small and medium-sized enterprises, the very things that are needed within the European Union and within the developing countries to help them."
"They are the backbone of their future."
"The other press release mentions bullying."
"Could I ask this august House whether our two Commissioners look like bullies?"
"Have they been throwing their weight around the WTO trying to bully the emerging democracies into submission?"
"Not at all."
"We reformed."
"Commissioner Fischler worked hard on the reformation of the common agricultural policy."
"That is the way forward."
"We must get the message across: the European Union is there to negotiate."
"Commissioner Lamy has put forward 'everything but arms' in the new proposals that are helping these underdeveloped countries."
"We must get these points across and make sure that we have multilateral discussions with EU involvement."
"At this point, I must say how well the European Parliament meetings in Cancún were received, and how well we were supported by some of the developing countries."
"It is important that we play a strong and future-oriented role in the next negotiations."
"I rely on the new negotiators, whoever they may be, to make sure we get that point across."
"– Mr President, on 30 August last year, an important decision was made."
"On the eve of Cancún, the United States, the EU and the developing countries agreed to flesh out paragraph 6 of the Doha Declaration, which has to do with the production of medicines for developing countries undergoing serious health crises."
"The agreement is not brilliant, but it is a start, although we now have to think about implementing it."
"I have meanwhile gleaned from the press that the United States is backtracking from it."
"That is why now is the time for the European Union to take a few convincing steps."
"So far, though, the European Union is showing little initiative."
"An opportunity to carry out in practice the decision of 30 August was recently lost with the review of legislation on pharmaceuticals."
"The Commission appears to be of the opinion that this matter belongs in Community and national patent legislation, but that is insufficient."
"The Community patent is still some way off and does not involve existing patents."
"Moreover, the Community patent does not affect data protection in any way."
"The health crisis in Africa is an urgent problem."
"Last month, it became known that AIDS has claimed five million casualties over the past year."
"It is beyond me why the EU has not so far been prepared to do what the EU agreed upon prior to the Conference of Cancún."
"Commissioner, what I want to know from you is when the European Union will have taken the legal measures in order to speed up the production of generic medicines for developing countries."
"What pledges can you make to Parliament today?"
"Mr President, I will develop a few ideas regarding the sector that is most dear to me – agriculture – because, whilst I support the policy to guarantee the greatest benefits of the expansion of world trade to developing countries, I would like to stress that the European Union has already granted these and so many trade preferences to become the main market for the export of agricultural products."
"I would like to again consider the further concessions and the proposal for duty-free access, because this does not, in my view, constitute the most effective means to help farmers in these countries, whilst it would permanently jeopardise many strategic European products."
"As a negotiating tactic, I would strengthen the argument in defence of the Community system, to guarantee stability mechanisms on the world market, knowing that stability of world prices is beneficial to all members of the World Trade Organisation."
"In order to do this, and not cause a structural crisis in the agriculture sector, I am adamant that the results of the WTO negotiations should not go further than the decisions taken in Berlin in the context of Agenda 2000 and supporting prices and markets should remain a fundamental element in the common agricultural policy."
"Following changes to the United States support system that were, in my view, very intelligent, we need to review our internal support to examine to what extent the GATT agreement is being respected and to assess the effect of aid on market prices and the competitive positions of commodities."
"Finally, it is important that the issue of the great challenges posed by enlargement for the European Union is raised during the WTO talks."
"This is a process of worldwide significance that must, in my view, be recognised at the negotiation table."
"Mr President, Commissioners, thank you very much for being here today, and I will take this opportunity to speak about cotton, which is a problem for Spain and Greece, but which I would like the whole of Europe to take on board."
"Cotton cultivation in Europe, in fact, only accounts for 1% of the world's surface area and 15% of European needs."
"The remaining 85% is imported mainly from the poorer countries, without tariffs."
"Furthermore, we have other third countries, such as the United States, which is the world's largest exporter of cotton, or China, which dominates the market by being the world's main producer, the main consumer of industrial cotton and the main exporter of textiles."
"Despite the insignificance of cotton in Europe, however, there have been certain statements against Community policy on the sector, which I believe to be entirely demagogic, since in the European Union export refunds are not given and goods are imported freely, without tariffs."
"Specifically, France led the proposal on the part of four African countries at the WTO ministerial conference in Cancún to remove aid for cotton and has subsequently presented a European initiative on cotton which attempts to promote a Commission-led action programme in favour of the African cotton-growing economies and, at the same time, includes a reference urging reform of the system of aid for cotton, partially decoupling it from production."
"I would like Commissioner Lamy to hear me: Commissioner, I believe that this attitude can only be interpreted as a wink or a gesture of rapprochement by France to these countries and the powerful interests of French capital in the African cotton sector by means of the French Company for the development of textile fibres and its subsidiaries in Africa, with the French State as the main participant in its capital."
"In no way can this justify the belligerence allowed by the Commission in Cancún, with a proposal which it was inappropriate to present in that forum and which unjustly condemns Community policy in this sector."
"Neither does it justify the reform of the Community system of aid for cotton as suggested by the Commission, the approval of which would mean the social and economic death of many communities, without – and this is more serious – as a result resolving the problems of competitiveness of the sector in Africa."
"Finally, with regard to European agriculture in general, I would like to point out that the objective agreed at the G20 is to achieve an agreement on the dismantling of aid for exports, as well as a significant reduction in tariffs and direct aid which distort the market."
"Nevertheless, it appears, Mr Lamy, that in your meeting with the G20 countries, held in Brasilia, the European Union would have accepted the demand to define the criteria relating to the green box in a more restrictive manner."
"I would like you to either confirm or deny this information because, Commissioner, agreeing to discuss it goes further than the mandate that you had received, but, above all, it directly affects the very principles of the reform of the CAP which we approved six months ago and not just that of cotton which we are discussing here."
"It is all very well to adopt measures in favour of the least-developed countries, but what benefits them more, and they say this themselves, is greater viability for their exports rather than a growth in the volumes exported, which in reality benefits the marketing companies based in the most developed countries."
"For example, sugar producers believe that export quotas for sugar at guaranteed prices are more profitable for their economies than the possibility of exporting without restrictions."
"I would urge you to consider all of this very carefully and to listen to the supposed beneficiaries of all these policies."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, the recent statement by the American representative in the WTO is without a doubt the only new piece of information that we have learnt since our last discussion."
"I think it is an interesting statement, because it seems to indicate a change of attitude on the part of the United States and suggest that it will be possible to relaunch the negotiations in the WTO."
"It also comes on top of the initiatives that the Commission itself has taken with a view to relaunching these negotiations."
"But relaunching them does not mean letting go, facilitating does not mean abandoning everything, and I have to confess that after listening to this morning’s interventions I am a little concerned at the attitude expressed by a number of our Members, in particular on the Singapore issues."
"We have always said here in the European Parliament that we are in favour of regulated trade facilitation."
"We are in favour of liberalising trade subject to certain standards and rules, and it is clear that the Singapore issues will force the World Trade Organisation to lay down a number of rules."
"It is regrettable that they omit certain aspects."
"Personally, I would have liked social issues to have been taken into account in this context, but in Doha we were obliged, under pressure, to abandon the corresponding standards."
"What worries me is that we now seem to want to abandon the Singapore issues too."
"What chance do we have, if we adopt this position, of seeing social issues and the like reappearing on the negotiating table, if the few areas that had been accepted as a potential basis for negotiation are abandoned today?"
"I believe that the European Union has, through you, taken a series of initiatives with a view to facilitating matters."
"I think that we should leave it at that."
"The purpose of today’s debate is not to reopen the Doha negotiations but to apply all of the agreements, including those on the issues that concern us and that affect the kind of globalisation that we want to develop."
"Mr President, Commissioners, Mr Lamy said this morning that, in order for the world to be a better place, we need Doha."
"I completely agree with this statement and therefore, just as I regretted the failure of Cancún at the time, today I must regret the lack of progress at the Geneva meeting in December, while acknowledging that the simple fact of having resumed talks is positive, although, as the President of the General Council has recognised, those talks have only served to provide a clearer view of the key issues and to make us aware of the difficulties we are going to face, as well as reaffirming, on the part of the members of the WTO, the commitment to the Doha programme and, above all, the multilateral trade system, which, in itself, is of sufficient importance."
"The time has now come to show flexibility in our positions, so that we can move on from words to actions and furthermore do it at the pace that the calendar set at Doha requires."
"I therefore believe that we should thank Commissioners Lamy and Fischler for their efforts to open up channels for dialogue with everybody and between everybody, as well as the work done with the clear objective of moving the Doha agenda forward without losing sight of the European Union's legitimate interests."
"To this end, I completely agree with the analysis and the proposals contained in the Commission communication, particularly with regard to industrial tariffs and the need to achieve certain levels of commitment, particularly on the part of the emerging countries, which are much higher than those proposed in the Debray document and, in any event, equivalent to those of the European Union."
"With regard more specifically to tariffs for textile products, the Commission's document talks about negotiating new reductions which are as close as possible to zero, a proposal I totally agree with, provided that this does not mean - and I hope the Commissioner will clarify this – that the European Union will be obliged to reduce its tariffs, while others have not achieved an equivalent level for theirs."
"I would like to put a final question, Mr President."
"This morning, Mr Lamy also referred to the European Union becoming more flexible in environmental terms."
"I would like to ask him how far he intends that flexibility to go, because there is no doubt that the high costs in the environmental field are one of the causes of the relocation of many Community companies, but there is only one planet Earth, and the legislation demanded in order to achieve environmental development at planetary level must also be planetary."
". Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, I will be brief."
"I would like to express my gratitude for the constructive contributions, of which we have heard a great many during the course of today."
"I would simply like to comment on the issues relating specifically to agriculture, and then my fellow-Commissioner Mr Lamy will round off the discussion."
"It was asked whether there are signs that the USA is now showing more flexibility on the cotton issue."
"Well, as you know, Bob Zoellick has sent a letter to all WTO members in which he specifically addresses the issue of cotton."
"In fact, he devotes a whole chapter to it, and from the way he presents it, there are indeed signs of more openness on this issue."
"At any rate, he shows that he is open to reforms not only on export subsidies – that these should be eliminated, also as regards market liberalisation and the adoption of a less trade-distorting system of domestic support – but he also indicates that ways of providing better support to the very poor countries, which are wholly dependent on cotton production, should be developed through development assistance."
"Let me comment on what Mrs González said about cotton cultivation and the importance of cotton for Europe."
"I must stress, yet again, that it is true that European output only amounts to around 2% of the global market."
"It is also true that we do not apply any export subsidies and that we have completely opened our cotton markets to the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) through the EBA decision."
"Indeed, as you know, there is a proposal to amend our cotton regime, which would result in less trade-distorting measures for cotton; in other words, a mix of blue box and green box measures."
"I am working towards the adoption of a decision on this issue in the Council of Agriculture Ministers in March."
"On Japan’s rice policy, we all know that rice is a very sensitive issue for Japan and it has always been viewed as such."
"However, we have seen that Japan has recently commenced bilateral negotiations with a number of WTO member states."
"The rice issue is indeed included on the agenda for these bilateral negotiations and is an element of the negotiations, and one outcome is that the Japanese have generally started to adopt, shall we say, a more constructive or less rigid position on this issue in Geneva."
"It was claimed that there exists no mandate to negotiate away the current export refund regime."
"In fact, this is quite simply wrong; our mandate states quite specifically that we can indeed propose this for various products."
"Mrs Mann asked me about progress on our sugar proposal."
"We are working hard on preparing a proposal and I have already said that I am aiming to submit the proposal to the Commission in mid 2004 and then present it to Parliament and the Council."
"Let me make one final comment; I would like to ask this House to play a part in intensifying the dialogue that we proposed in our opening statement."
"We need more, we need more intensive talks, and I would ask you in particular to deepen the discussions with the NGOs, for some of the NGOs sometimes come up with ideas that are quite contrary to Europe’s interests."
"I would ask you all to consider that waiting is in any event bad for us, for the European Union, and also for European agriculture."
"Please consider this: the very positive reactions to our reforms around the world will fade away as the gap between the adoption of these reforms and the progress of the WTO negotiations widens."
". – Mr President, in my turn I should like to thank the speakers from the European People’s Party, European Socialist and Liberal Groups, who expressed their support for the proposals that Mr Fischler and I have developed and for the paper that we have tabled both in the Council and here in this House."
"Our main objectives in these negotiations remain the same: firstly, an additional phase of market opening; secondly, better rules to govern multilateral trade and, finally, better integration of developing countries, which so far have had only a very unequal share in the benefits of increased international trade."
"If we try to translate all of this into an answer to your questions – what needs to be done, what has to be our objective for 2004 – then it is quite straightforward."
"Our objective for 2004 is to achieve before the summer what could not be done in Cancún; in other words, it is to complete two thirds of the negotiating process."
"That is our political objective for 2004."
"Well then, you will say, given what you said in your introduction to the debate on how the work is progressing in Geneva, such an objective will no doubt require energy and acceleration."
"The current work rate and the pressure in the Geneva boiler will have to be increased and, like others, we intend to stoke up the Geneva boiler to get things moving."
"With this in mind – I have said this and I will say it again in response to Mrs Mann’s question – the letter that my American counterpart has circulated in recent days and on which he commented in the press yesterday is good news, because it gives the lie to a theory that was gaining currency and according to which 2004, an election year in the United States, was going to be a lost year."
"Well, it is not! 2004 may very well not be a lost year and it is important that two of the major players in world trade, the United States and Europe, support this idea."
"To achieve this we are of course going to have to get moving and we are going to work, as we have started doing since our mandate was renewed, with the G20, the G90, the United States and Japan, to mention just the main players of the moment, within a system of variable geometry that will enable us to put forward our own position in the best conditions."
"As Mr Fischler rightly said, in our efforts to work on this process and drive it forward, if we are going to raise the temperature, we are going to need you and the contacts that you maintain with your colleagues in each of the major blocks that I have just mentioned."
"That is what I had to say in response to the support expressed by a large majority during this debate."
"I will now respond briefly to a few criticisms."
"Mr Lannoye reproaches us, basically, in two respects: firstly, we did not redraft our mandate, we only repositioned it and, secondly, within this mandate traces of the so-called Singapore issues survive."
"Yes, Mr Lannoye is right that we did not redraft our mandate and that we repositioned it."
"And if there is a lesson to learn from what has happened between Cancún and now, we should bear in mind that no one around the WTO table has asked to renegotiate the programme of negotiations that was adopted in Doha."
"It is this programme that is on the table and it is this programme that needs to be negotiated."
"As for the Singapore issues, it is true that we have adopted a more flexible position. We see our priorities as facilitating trade and introducing greater transparency into public procurement, for reasons that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance should understand, being so keen on transparency."
"In a number of cases this would actually be very beneficial to facilitating trade, in particular for small and medium-sized companies, which often, alas, do not have the resources to pay for the trouble-shooters that the major multinational groups can afford to employ to speed up decisions and ensure a smooth passage through procedures, customs and other networks."
"To Mrs Figueiredo and Mr Désir, I will simply say once again that their fears about public services are unfounded."
"My mandate on this point is clear and completely unambiguous."
"I have never strayed from it and what is more I have no intention of doing so."
"I will now turn to two specific points in response to comments made by Mrs Ferrer and Mrs Corbey."
"Mrs Ferrer, on the textiles sector, we are prepared to reduce our textiles tariffs and therefore what remains of our industrial protection, but obviously on one condition, and that is that others do the same, which is part of the negotiations."
"Mrs Corbey was enquiring about where we were on access to medicines: we are working on this in the two arenas where this work is now being followed up."
"The first of these is Geneva, where we need to transpose the terms of the August agreement into the TRIPS Agreement, and we are working hard on this. It is not as straightforward as it would seem, because the balance that was struck in August between the various different parties and the various different requirements needs to be reflected faithfully in a text that will now be a legal text and, clearly, this requires a little work."
"We are also working on this within the European Union, because we want, as it were in anticipation, to amend our own provision on obligatory licensing in European legislation to bring it into line with the new WTO agreement and possibly allow easier access in a number of developing countries."
"We are going to do so by tabling a proposal for a recommendation in the Council of Ministers because, pending the entry into force of the European legislation on patents, which has been adopted but will only take effect in a number of years, the only way of implementing this agreement on access to medicines is to amend existing national laws one by one."
"We are therefore going to have the Council adopt a recommendation, if it agrees, and we have every reason to think that this will be the case, to ensure that the necessary amendments are made to each of the national laws, pending of course an update to the European provisions, which, I would remind you, will only come into force in a few years’ time."
"Those are the answers that I wanted to give at this stage and I would like to thank you for your attention."
"The debate is closed."
". – Is the European Commission deaf?"
"That is the question that inevitably springs to mind when you read its policies for relaunching the Doha Round of the WTO international trade negotiations."
"It actually seemed clear to us as soon as Cancún had failed – and we said so in this House – that the fact that the negotiations had reached deadlock showed that it was necessary to review the objective of global free trade and return to the idea of a form of globalisation that was controlled by the people."
"In fact, the Commission programme recommends a revision of the strategy to achieve the EU’s objectives in the form of a new negotiating position."
"This internally contradictory sentence states that there will be no in-depth review, just some tinkering around the edges."
"The Commission retains its priority objectives of free market access, free global competition and free investment (the so-called Singapore issues), which are certainly of interest, but it should now give other concerns their rightful place, in our interests as well as in the interests of the developing countries."
"We now need to lay down the rules for a form of international trade that better respects the sovereignty of nations and is more compatible with safeguarding the environment and public health."
". – Has the Commission taken account of the Cancún Conference?"
"Reading its communication, tabled with a view to a possible relaunch of the negotiations on the Development Agenda that began in 2001, it is difficult to tell!"
"Its supposed ‘flexibility’ on the Singapore issues is just tinkering around the edges; the call for a balance between rights and the market and its avowed intention to adopt more flexible positions in no way weaken neoliberal European policies."
"Contempt, a lack of self-criticism and a reluctance to question remain at the heart of the Commission’s creed."
"Faced with Commissioner Lamy’s statements – rubberstamped by the Council – the poorest countries neither wish to sign up to the supposed new proposals nor are they awarding full marks to the policies implemented since Seattle."
"On the contrary, the people of the South are organising themselves and resisting European ambitions and the WTO."
"The opening up of trade in services provided for by the GATS and the no less sacrosanct opening of the market – put forward as a clear benefit for developing countries! – have been clearly identified as dangers by the countries of the South."
"International relations, which are based on cooperation and trade between equals and are respectful of individual and collective fundamental rights, deserve better."
"A public debate, relayed by elected representatives, to show the fallacy of this way of thinking is now unavoidable."
"The next item is the report (Α5-0355/2003) by Mr De Rossa, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, on Petition 461/2000 concerning the protection and conservation of Great Apes and other species endangered by the illegal trade in bushmeat (2003/2078(ΙΝΙ))."
". Mr President, obviously it will not be possible in five minutes to do justice to the issue."
"I wish to begin by thanking my colleagues in Parliament for the opportunity to have this debate."
"It is important that a petition signed by 1.9 million citizens of Europe should be given a hearing in this House."
"For a while that looked unlikely, so I thank everybody who worked so hard to ensure that it did."
"I want to thank in particular Mr Corrie, the rapporteur for the Committee on Development and Cooperation, who also helped to prepare this report, because this was an enhanced cooperation report shared by the Committee on Petitions and the Development Committee."
"At this point I would like to make clear that this report does not deal with hunting in Europe."
"Therefore the three amendments tabled are not necessary and I would ask colleagues not to support them."
"'Bushmeat' or 'wild meat' describes the food product of wild animals, whether consumed locally or traded commercially."
"Although the overuse of bushmeat is a fast-growing problem everywhere, this report concentrates on Africa because the bushmeat problem there is the most significant and best-described in the literature."
"However, the illegal trade in the meat of wild animals is not limited to Africa."
"In Asia many species are unsustainably exploited, either to provide food for the pet trade or because people believe that eating specific animal parts can cure disease or strengthen their sexual capacities."
"The trade in wildlife in South America is also growing and wild animals such as monkeys, birds, capybara and other large rodents, as well as tapirs, armadillos and deer, are for sale."
"In principle any wild animal can be used to provide a market with bushmeat."
"In Africa more than 50 species are for sale in markets and restaurants, including antelopes, monkeys, apes, pangolins, pigs, large rodents, elephants, reptiles – such as snakes, lizards and crocodiles, invertebrates – such as snails and insects, and birds such as hornbills."
"However, the bulk of the trade is made up of mammals, usually weighing more than one kilogram."
"Current estimates show that bushmeat is being consumed on a massive scale across the humid tropics, particularly in Africa."
"The most recent estimates of the annual wild meat harvest are 23 500 tonnes in Sarawak, 67 000 to 164 000 tonnes in the Brazilian Amazon and between one million and five million tonnes – off the bone – in the Congo Basin."
"This results in overexploitation."
"In Africa, in 2000, at least one species of red colobus monkey probably became extinct due to hunting, and many other species are expected to follow shortly."
"Livelihoods and biodiversity suffer as a result of overexploitation of wildlife for food."
"Of the estimated 1.2 billion people who live on less than the equivalent of one euro a day, about 250 million live in agriculturally marginal areas, and a further 350 million live in or near forests, of whom an estimated 60 million are indigenous people living in forests."
"A recent study by the UK Department for International Development has estimated that 150 million people – one-eighth of the world’s poorest – regard wildlife as an important livelihood asset."
"Therefore it is clearly not an easy problem to get to grips with."
"Human population growth, poverty, bad governance, and the commercialisation of consumption and distribution of poached animals are the underlying causes of the bushmeat problem."
"Natural resources cannot replenish themselves in the face of growing demand."
"Small stable rural communities could subsist on the natural resources in their environment without depleting them. However, the human population explosion, combined with an expanding urban – and world – market system, has changed this."
"The exploitation of natural resources has become unsustainable, with the developed industrialised nations dominating the acquisition of resources."
"Poverty inevitably outweighs concerns about conservation and makes enforcement measures seem unjustified and hard to implement where people depend on bushmeat to survive."
"Many of the underlying causes of the unsustainable bushmeat trade also cause poverty: weak local governance and unfavourable terms of trade."
"It is therefore important that the conservation and development communities should work together with indigenous populations and civil society on this shared agenda in order to address the underlying causes of poverty and biodiversity loss."
"I have listed about 20 issues which the Commission should address."
"Resources are obviously required."
"We have avoided putting a figure on those resources, but the Commission should commit a specific amount of resources to ensure that this matter is dealt with effectively and that it is possible to work with the relevant organisations and with the people on the ground who either depend on bushmeat for income or for protein to survive."
". Mr President, addressing the bushmeat crisis is of the utmost importance."
"As you know only too well, poaching and unsustainable levels of hunting threaten the existence of some of our closest relatives in the animal kingdom: the gorilla species, chimpanzees and other types of apes."
"This matter is clearly of concern to the general public, as nearly two million signatures to the petition suggest."
"It is also a matter of great concern to the Commission, in line with the global commitment to stop biodiversity loss by 2010."
"We therefore welcome the report from Mr De Rossa, which I find balanced and to the point."
"We are working to address the issue in a number of different ways, but I must first emphasise the need to distinguish clearly between the bushmeat crisis – which threatens certain species of animals – and the everyday consumption of wild meat, which forms an essential part of food security for poor people in the developing world."
"We are well aware that there are several aspects related to bushmeat which go beyond the development agenda; these include health issues in Europe, some trade issues as well as scientific issues."
"But since most over-exploitation of bushmeat takes place in developing countries, the best solution is to provide support for these countries through our development cooperation efforts and address the bushmeat crisis at its origin."
"This crisis can be taken up in the context of natural resources, rural development or governance issues, or as a cross-cutting issue to be addressed through Environmental Impact Assessments and Strategic Environmental Assessments."
"These assessments should identify risks and possible mitigation measures with respect to bushmeat for all development activities."
"In this respect, I am happy to inform you that the manual for ‘Integrating environment concerns into development and economic cooperation’ will be finalised and made operational during the first half of this year."
"The revised manual should go a long way to ensuring that proper attention is given to bushmeat issues in environmental assessments and therefore in all our relevant development activities."
"The mid-term reviews of our cooperation strategies this year will be used to strengthen the integration of environmental concerns, in particular through promoting a more systematic use of Country Environmental Profiles, Strategic Environmental Assessments and as previously mentioned, Environmental Impact Assessments."
"All this is fine; it may not constitute a very direct reaction but nonetheless provides the background necessary for proper consideration of the issue."
"National ownership is very important."
"In fact, activities aimed at curbing over-exploitation of bushmeat mean if the bushmeat countries themselves do not take the lead."
"We can help with appropriate support-building capacity and with injecting the views expressed when we are revising country strategies, but the ownership of the problem is crucial."
"I would like to add a special point which is that peace is essential."
"If we look at the conflict in the DRC and in other countries in the region over the past 10 years, the reality is that these conflicts have been blocking any attempt to create even a minimum of governance in relation to the problem we are discussing."
"Soldiers and internally displaced people, refugees, have had no restriction, no incentive, no guidance, no punishment, no governance whatsoever on how to behave in this regard."
"It has been an area outside law and order and we have seen the terrible consequences."
"I would make this number one on the list of priorities and, in fact, I regard a peace dividend for the environment and for the bushmeat crisis as one of the many important aspects for securing peace in the DRC and elsewhere in the region."
"The Commission is not convinced that a specific action plan would be the best way to address the bushmeat crisis, and this reflects what I said about ownership."
"Both the EC strategy for integrating environmental into economic and development cooperation and the Biodiversity Action Plan for development cooperation are being reviewed this year."
"It is preferable to ensure that bushmeat issues are properly addressed in these two strategies, rather than to put together a specific bushmeat strategy which would require a lot of resources in terms of staffing but may not necessarily lead to additional action to address the problem."
"Considering the multi-sectoral implications of the bushmeat issue, such an approach would not be the best one."
"Many Community projects in East, South and West Africa take on this challenge in very practical terms."
"Although spending on the environment as a percentage of the total aid programme is quite low, we have invested considerably in environmental protection and management in key countries."
"For example, in Central Africa since 1992 the Commission has invested approximately EUR 67 million in the Ecofac programme for Central African forest ecosystems, which pilots innovative, protected-area management in crucial Great Ape habitats."
"The Commission is also funding work to control hunting and poaching in private forest concessions, and promoting eco-tourism in the region as part of its responsible management of the initiative."
"Furthermore, we are working at political level to address the bushmeat crisis."
"For example, we recently provided a EUR 500 000 grant to help launch the Africa Ministerial Process for Forest Law Enforcement and Governance."
"Although the primary objective of this process is to improve forest-sector governance and combat illegal logging, the inclusion of several important references to bushmeat and wildlife in the conference declaration will help to raise the profile of this issue."
"We very much welcome the initiative of presenting this broad-based engagement on the part of the public to Parliament."
"This, in my view, is a very constructive way of giving this issue the attention it deserves."
". Mr President, any petition which receives 1.9 million signatures deserves to be treated seriously."
"I congratulate Mr De Rossa on his excellent report and the way in which he presented it today."
"Firstly, can the Commissioner confirm that the action plan only covers tropical areas, and in particular the continent of Africa, and does not in any way impinge on hunting in the European Union, as some people are interpreting it?"
"Sensible action is vital and urgent for three reasons."
"Firstly, as Mr De Rossa has said, at least 150 million of the world's poorest people regard wildlife as a vital livelihood asset."
"Commercial hunting, the exploitation of timber and the opening-up of the forests are destroying the ecological balance and depriving local inhabitants of their food and livelihood."
"Secondly, the totally indiscriminate killing of great ape species will wipe out gorillas and chimpanzees, which in countries such as Rwanda are a major sustainable tourist attraction and source of income that will be lost forever."
"The devastation of forests will also obliterate an ecology if logging is not urgently brought under control."
"There is a third even more important point."
"The illegal exporting of bushmeat to all corners of the globe could have a devastating effect on health that would make SARS look like the common cold."
"Many gorillas and chimpanzees carry SIV, the animal equivalent of HIV, which can jump to humans – and has done so."
"That would be bad enough, but if ebola-infected meat reaches the world market, we could see a catastrophe far worse than HIV."
"Recently, 2 000 monkey noses were found in a suitcase at Amsterdam airport, showing that the illegal trade is thriving."
"This resolution urges the Commission to adopt a series of measures, which I hope it will."
"However, making Heads of State in bushmeat countries aware of the situation and getting them, as the Commissioner has said, to take the lead in action to safeguard ecosystems and the wildlife they support would be a major step forward."
"Mr President, I support the ideas behind the proposals in Mr De Rossa's excellent report and congratulate him on it."
"One of the issues we need to address is the definition of bushmeat."
"It is insufficiently precise."
"We know or believe that we are all talking about the same thing: primarily, endangered species, in particular the great apes."
"There is, however, a delicacy trade, which is for the consumption of bushmeat outside Africa."
"It is clearly enormously difficult, both in Africa and in South America, to prevent people who are starving or who have extremely limited amounts of food from 'poaching' in their neighbouring jungle."
"However, there are species both in South America and in Africa that can be managed and could form the basis of an organised trade, with the appropriate safeguards."
"My concern is that there is a large market in Europe for bushmeat."
"Every year several thousands of pounds in weight of illegally-imported bushmeat is seized at London Heathrow airport alone, most of it in an appalling condition."
"There is a reasonably large number of residents and citizens from the European Union, and from African and South American countries who, perhaps legitimately, want to consume this if it can be provided on a sustainable basis."
"This demand will not go away any more than the demand of Mr De Rossa's Irish compatriots for Guinness will go away, wherever they are based."
"The risk is that we will drive it underground even further than has been the case."
"One of the options that the Commission needs to look at most earnestly is the proper management of the trade, which would involve extensive and, unfortunately, expensive, surveys of animal populations, control of selective killing and, as far as the export trade is concerned, proper regulation for public health."
"As Mr Corrie said, driven underground, the implications of this trade for public health are appalling."
"It is a scandal that, in the interests of land management, American multi-millionaires can shoot elephants that need to be culled, whilst people of African origin are not allowed to buy and consume bushmeat in a managed trade."
"I thank Mr De Rossa for his assurance that this report does not and cannot refer to deer and elk management in Europe."
"I would also point out that any references to high-powered rifles are unnecessary."
"There are approximately 20 million AK-47s in Africa, and any control we have over rifles in the European Union will make no difference."
"However, like other colleagues, I urge the Commission to take action soon."
"Mr President, I congratulate Mr De Rossa on his report on the protection and conservation of great apes and other species endangered by the illegal trade in bushmeat."
"This report, as we have been told, arose from a petition signed by 1.9 million people EU-wide, which led the Committee on Petitions to produce its report."
"This was not, may I say, without resistance from certain political groups in this House."
"The Christian Democrats, many of whose press releases extolling the virtues of the De Rossa Report are today littering the press centre in Strasbourg, initially voted against the report being prepared."
"We in the animal welfare and conservation movements welcome the late conversion of British Conservatives to the side of animal welfare in this regard."
"The same is true of the Green and Liberal Groups who to begin with also voted against the report being prepared."
"In the interests of public health, public safety and the protection of endangered species, we will be supporting the demands for the EU to use both carrot and stick to encourage conservation of these endangered species in their indigenous habitats, to enable local communities to find alternative food sources and to prevent the illegal importation of bushmeat into the EU."
"Mr Corrie's mention of the recent seizure in Amsterdam of 2 000 monkey noses indicates all too well the extent of the trade and the suffering and devastation occasioned to these animals."
"We will not be supporting any of the three amendments, which we believe are misconceived and – deliberately or not – mischievous."
"Mr De Rossa's report is concerned with the illegal hunting of endangered species and in no way poses a threat to hunting in the European Union, as the EDD Group amendment claims."
"Apart from Gibraltar, where safeguarding the apes might be a welcome way of deflecting a Spanish threat, Europe has no great apes."
"Equally, the ELDR Group amendment is a contradiction in terms: there is no such thing as a sustainable level of hunting for critically endangered species."
"Mr President, I should also like to thank Mr De Rossa for his report."
"For the record, Mr Ford, the formal proposal to the committee to prepare this report came from me."
"It therefore cannot be said that the Greens opposed it."
"I should like to highlight a couple of issues, one being the role of logging companies."
"There are proposals within the report as to how we could help them to face up to their responsibilities, given that, at times, they use bushmeat as an apparently cheap and readily available food source for their workers and their vehicles are used to carry poached meat."
"The proposal is to incorporate this into the European Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade process, which I welcome."
"Secondly, the issue of importing into the European Union and the highly questionable and grim circumstances surrounding it has already been raised."
"We could do more at this end, in terms of educating consumers and suppliers in the Union, to help them realise what the effect of their actions is on the ecology and development in the countries of origin and to stop people from regarding bushmeat as a luxury delicacy, whereas what we are really looking at is the potential extinction of animals in certain places."
"– Mr President, before introducing the amendment that I have tabled, I should like to state that my group supports the protection and conservation of the great apes, particularly in Africa."
"Although the great apes are already protected by the Washington Convention and cannot therefore be hunted, they should nonetheless be monitored more closely to prevent poaching, following the example of the ABAC programme (Alternatives to Poaching in Central Africa)."
"But, as the rapporteur explains, hunting is not the only reason why these species are dying out, far from it."
"The massive, mechanised deforestation of equatorial Africa and the population explosion across the continent as a whole are key factors in the destruction of the Great Apes’ habitat, without forgetting the unprecedented devastation caused by the Ebola virus in recent years."
"That is why I believe that we need to redefine the notion of the bushmeat crisis, so that it stands for more than just excessive removal of animals from the wild."
"There are many different underlying causes for the disappearance of these species."
"The definition of wild meat is not acceptable either as it stands, in my opinion, because it introduces confusion as to the origin of game."
"I think that in a legislative text – to respond to Mr Ford – any clarification is always useful and I think that in all cases it is extremely important to define the scope very strictly."
"In this report, which concerns tropical and equatorial areas, we should confine ourselves to the term ‘bushmeat’."
"The generic term ‘wild meat’ is much too vague."
"It also encompasses the species of game that are present in the Member States of the European Union."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by again thanking the rapporteur for this very necessary report."
"I regret that Mr Ford wants to make this a political matter, because I believe this is something on which all political parties could work together for the greater good in order to stop this horrible trade."
"As we meet here in Strasbourg, great apes, gorillas, chimpanzees and monkeys are all being hunted to extinction for bushmeat."
"At the current rate, people are paying a premium to eat more great apes each year than are now kept in all the zoos and laboratories of the world."
"The shocking statistic is that if the slaughter continues at its current pace, the remaining wild apes in Africa will be gone within the next 15 to 50 years – a long time, but it will soon go if we do not stop this trade."
"I pay tribute to Dr Brian Carroll of Bristol Zoo, in my own region, who has worked with zoos across the UK to collect a stunning half a million signatures as part of the Europe-wide campaign."
"We are facing a catastrophe that affects both the survival of our closest relatives and the people who rely on forests for their livelihoods."
"The biggest challenge now facing conservationists is to reduce the demand for bushmeat."
"It is essential that we maintain an education programme that will keep people from buying and eating great apes through greater understanding and awareness."
"However, we can do more here in Europe."
"I am horrified by the scale of this sickening trade every year."
"Tonnes of bushmeat are confiscated at Europe's airports."
"We must have stricter controls at all EU ports and airports to stop such meat getting into Europe – witness, colleagues, the devastation caused by foot-and-mouth outbreaks across Europe."
"We had our own inquiry."
"Foot-and-mouth is prevalent in parts of western Africa."
"Smuggled bushmeat could not only spark a new outbreak in Europe, it could also expose our livestock to diseases and epidemics on the African continent."
"Every kilogram of smuggled meat in the EU food chain poses a real threat not only of animal diseases, but also human ones, such as Ebola."
"Colleagues, your support for the conclusions of this temporary committee into the outbreak, and its demand for tougher measures to prevent diseases entering the EU was overwhelming, yet in my own country we have only six sniffer dogs to seek out this hideous trade."
"We are not taking this threat seriously enough and all Member States could do more."
"Endangered wildlife and habitats are a precious and irreplaceable asset."
"We must stop this barbaric trade before it is too late."
"Mr President, I think we should establish from the outset that the reasons why this lucrative illegal trade is flourishing are exactly the same as those at the root of both the illegal narcotics trade and of illegal arms trading."
"Analysis of these activities demands a better understanding of the contribution which, as the Commissioner said, conflict and weak governance in particular make to this problem, and we in the European Union, as donors, should perhaps be more serious about supporting conservation and biodiversity projects."
"Running alongside this, the efforts we make on conflict prevention and the peace facility proposed for the African Union, etc. will play their part in addressing some of the concerns raised here today."
"This is an issue which has been regularly debated in the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly and which has consistently received the support of our ACP parliamentary colleagues."
"They tell us, and we have had discussions with them, about the importance – also emphasised by the Commissioner – their governments must attach to the priority of making sustainable management and conservation of natural resources a clear part of their national indicative programmes."
"That is something in which we have a role to play in the JPA, and in the Committee on Development and Cooperation and elsewhere, because, unless governments make this a priority, I am afraid we are whistling in the wind."
"It must also be said that bushmeat provides a major source of protein."
"In some parts of Nigeria, up to 84% of protein is obtained from bushmeat, which plays a significant part in people's lives."
"Where access to wildlife is restricted, people will have to adapt and continue to adapt in ways that entail even greater risks."
"It is much better to talk about controlling the trade than to suggest we stamp it out."
"If we talk about stamping out the illegal trade in bushmeat, all we will do is drive it underground and make it much more difficult to deal with."
"The importance of bushmeat in the livelihoods of poor people has never been assessed."
"We have made a lot of pronouncements this afternoon, but there has been no clear assessment of the importance of bushmeat in people's livelihoods."
"I would end by saying that better management of the trade might contribute in no small way to our objective of meeting poverty eradication targets."
"Mr President, I too would like to thank Mr De Rossa for this very important report."
"The illegal bushmeat trade is devastating endangered species and habitats in many developing countries."
"I welcome and endorse one recommendation in particular: to step up measures to detect and prevent illegal imports of bushmeat into Europe."
"Incredibly, smuggling illegal meat into Europe through ports and airports is still relatively easy despite the fact that this almost certainly caused the devastating foot-and-mouth epidemic in 2001, to which Mr Parish referred."
"The European Union must set an example here and send a clear message to smugglers that any bushmeat they bring to ports of entry will be detected and they will be prosecuted."
"Regrettably, this violent, profitable trade continues unabated and thousands of tonnes of illegal bushmeat, from West Africa in particular, is slipping undetected into Europe each year, with organised gangs going unpunished."
"It must be said that the United States is showing us the way here: anyone who has recently travelled through a US airport will undoubtedly have been confronted by a hardworking beagle sniffing every piece of luggage for imported foodstuffs."
"I implore the European Commission to get tough with Member States."
"Finally I also urge colleagues to reject irrelevant amendments to this report which seek to defend local European hunting practices and will inevitably weaken its recommendations."
"Mr President, we lacked the imagination, when preparing my statement, to include the aspect of hunting in Europe. I see that quite simply as being outside the scope of what one would normally expect this initiative to cover and fully agree with Mr De Rossa, Mr Corrie and others who have addressed this misunderstanding."
"We have enough real problems to cope with."
"The remarks made by Mrs Mathieu and others about hunting not being the only threat to these species are very important to bear in mind."
"There are two separate aspects: that of a deliberate threat, driven by greed, and that of a threat that is driven by people's need to survive."
"Both are equally dangerous for the species we are talking about."
"In this discussion I see a parallel with the difficult issue of the need for Africans to change and move from a pastoral lifestyle, where they roam the countryside grazing their cattle, but in which there is an imbalance between the number of people and cattle and the square kilometres available."
"It is this pressure on land use, reflecting urbanisation and population growth, which many people do not expect to be a problem in a place as big as Africa."
"However, when one looks at the environmental constraints, such as access to water, Africa is not so big."
"The pressure on forests is one such systemic, ongoing and dramatic pressure which presents perhaps the greatest obstacle to establishing a sustainable alternative because the issue has to do with poverty and with real problems."
"We should mount a strong front to tackle the problem of criminal acts driven by greed."
"Trying to convince logging companies to act within the law and to adhere to regulations, and for this to be more widely recognised by governments, is part of the drive to create a minimum of decency in matters relating to forestry in African countries."
"This is quite clearly part of the action and our policy."
"Finally, there are many aspects to the trade issue."
"One is quite simply our own legitimate defence of our health standards."
"We stopped imports of Nile perch from Lake Victoria for a number of years until we successfully managed – and this is one of my pet cases – to create an effective phytosanitary control."
"These exports are now up and running again and we have recreated thousands of jobs on a sustainable basis."
"I find it a little strange, however, that we have not done anything similar when it comes to bushmeat."
"What people have said in this debate is quite correct: ebola is one threat and there are many other very difficult aspects of this trade which require considerable attention."
"At the same time, many people depend for their survival on being able to hunt and eat bushmeat in their normal, traditional environment."
"We should respect that."
"We have had the debate about the brain drain."
"Maybe we can start discussing the protein drain, where the temptation to get our hands on exotic protein should be countered by focusing greater public attention on the issues involved."
"I would like to thank Parliament and the rapporteur for this initiative."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Mr Ford has the floor for a personal statement in accordance with Rule 122 of the Rules of Procedure."
"Mr President, on a point of order, it was suggested by both Mrs Lambert and more indirectly by Mr Parish that I misled the House when I claimed that the PPE-DE, ELDR and Verts/ALE Groups had tried to block the De Rossa report from appearing on the agenda."
"While I accept Mrs Lambert's personal enthusiasm for this report and the fact that she proposed that it be drawn up, my criticism was of her Group's attitude and that of the other Groups."
"The matter was raised by the Chairman of the Committee on Petitions at a meeting of the Conference of Committee Chairs some time last autumn."
"They were opposed to the Petitions Committee using the Rules of Procedure to produce this report."
"The matter was referred to the meeting of the Chairs of the Political Groups, where initially the only vote in favour of the report was that of Mr Barón Crespo from the PSE Group."
"It took considerable heavy lobbying of the other Groups to persuade their chairmen to change their minds and allow this report to be produced on the important subject we have in front of us today."
"The next item is the debate on the Commission statement on EU aid to Iran following the earthquake."
". Mr President, the magnitude of the Bam earthquake and the degree of devastation that it caused prompted an appeal from the Iranian authorities for international assistance and a massive international and European response within hours of the disaster occurring."
"The toll has now risen to 30 000 dead, with a similar number of people injured, 45 000 homeless, and 85% of Bam destroyed."
"The Commission has been active in providing emergency humanitarian assistance in coordinating the efforts of search-and-rescue teams from EU Member States and from the EEA, candidate and accession countries."
"On Saturday 27 December 2003, the Commission, through its humanitarian aid office ECHO, adopted a primary emergency decision for EUR 2.3 million to address the most urgent needs arising from the earthquake."
"EUR 1 452 129 were granted to the Red Cross family – the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, the Finnish Red Cross and the German Red Cross – to support the relief efforts of the Iranian Red Crescent Society with the provision of food parcels, tents, blankets, heaters, kitchen sets and hygienic kits, and to address health needs through the establishment of a field hospital and basic health units."
"Another EUR 813 577 were allocated to the and for health care and related activities, and finally EUR 34 294 were provided to to set up a satellite-based communication network to facilitate communication and coordination between the relief agencies working in the disaster region."
"Alongside the humanitarian aid response, the EU Civil Protection Monitoring and Information Centre, hosted by the Commission, had initiated, after agreement from the Iranian authorities, the dispatch of urgent response teams."
"Immediately after the earthquake, in the morning of 26 December, the EU Civil Protection Monitoring and Information Centre offered assistance to Iran and distributed an advance warning to its 30 Contact Points in countries participating in the Civil Protection Cooperation Mechanism."
"On 26 December, the first teams left their respective countries and by 27 December, the EU coordination of the search and rescue efforts, headed by the Italian civil protection unit, was operational in Bam."
"In total, 18 countries participated in this joint effort with assistance ranging from search and rescue teams – sniffer dogs, firefighters and other specialists – to the provision of relief items – field hospitals and other equipment."
"As the search-and-rescue phase of the emergency response came to an end, the attention shifted to ensuring that the basic humanitarian needs of the survivors of the earthquake are covered in the next few months."
"On 8 January 2004, both the International Federation of the Red Cross and the Red Crescent and the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs launched appeals to assist in the relief and recovery response in Bam."
"Following a first assessment mission which took place between 29 and 31 December, ECHO dispatched a second experts’ mission to Bam between 5 and 8 January to review the situation, assess further needs and coordinate with the other agencies present on the ground."
"As a result of this second assessment, a number of sectors stand out as priority areas for intervention: health; sanitation and hygiene; psychosocial support and tracing; and a focus on vulnerable groups, notably children and the elderly."
"On the basis of its own assessments and of the UN and Red Cross Appeals, the Commission is considering taking a second decision in favour of the victims of the Bam earthquake in the next few weeks."
"By responding as we did, we were able to use the first EUR 2.3 million to cover all the requests that we had at the time and can now consider new requests."
"It is extremely important that the international community be able to do something that goes beyond the very immediate assistance required in situations such as this."
"– Mr President, the earthquake on 26 December virtually destroyed the city of Bam."
"The extent of the devastation and the resulting human suffering have deeply shocked us all."
"However, one positive thing has come out of this tragedy: the prompt, rapid and comprehensive assistance from all over the world, including the EU, its Member States and even the USA, which Iran accepted."
"Only the assistance offered by Israel was rejected."
"This House wishes to express its gratitude to the Commission for acting so promptly on 27 December."
"This shows the Iranian Government, but above all the Iranian people, how much human solidarity there is with them in their present plight, regardless of the political relations with their country."
"I am convinced that this is also a response to Iran’s signing of the Additional Protocol to the Non-Proliferation Treaty, thus fulfilling the international community’s expectations on this key issue."
"At the same time, however, there is still much cause for criticism on our part, especially on the human rights situation, although we welcome the fact that the EU/Iran human rights dialogue has commenced."
"I myself attended the last meeting in Brussels; it was an open dialogue, not only between the EU delegation and the Iranian side but also within the Iranian delegation itself."
"However, we in the European Parliament were already voicing our concerns back in autumn about the possibility of a crackdown on reformist parliamentarians in advance of the February elections."
"Sadly, that is exactly what happened this week: more than 80 parliamentarians and hundreds of candidates were disqualified by the Guardian Council, including the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr Mirdamadi, the main interlocutor and host of a European Parliament delegation which visited in Iran, who was here with a delegation last year."
"I think we should make it clear that just as we show human solidarity in response to natural disasters, we must also show political solidarity with the reformist movements in Iran which – within the limited parameters that currently exist there – are pressing for more democracy and freer elections."
"That is an important point and I assume that the High Representative, Mr Solana, who is currently in Iran, will find the words to make this position clear."
"I think it would send out the wrong signal if the European Union were to carry on regardless and adopt a business as usualapproach in this situation. That would be very discouraging for those who want to hold a relatively free election in February, which is just next month."
"What is needed now is not only solidarity with the victims in Bam but also solidarity with the reformers in Iran."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I wish to express our deep sympathy and solidarity with the Iranian people."
"This dreadful tragedy has not only destroyed a region and a city; it has also impacted on an entire country and its people."
"I am very gratified – and would like to state this very clearly to Commissioner Nielson – that the Commission, but also Europe as a whole, has displayed this solidarity and responded so swiftly and effectively to the tragedy."
"I also think, however, that in light of this dreadful disaster, it is especially important for Iran to show that it is united and working towards the future."
"My group and I myself are very concerned that in advance of the polls, pre-election disqualifications have occurred which prevent voters from making their own choice."
"The whole point about democracy – and Iran is very proud of its democracy – is that the voters themselves choose who they want to represent them in parliament."
"I very much hope that there is still an opportunity for Iran to reverse this decision and confirm to the public which candidates will be standing for election. The choice must then be the Iranian people’s."
"This is neither the time nor the place to get involved in a discussion about reformist versus conservative movements; I just want to make it very clear, on behalf of my group, that the public must decide."
"I do not think that anyone in Iran should be alarmed about letting the people choose."
"The Iranian people are intelligent enough to make the decision for themselves."
"Secondly, I would like to pay tribute to the fact that Iran – not least in response to the initiative by a number of European foreign ministers – has signed the Additional Protocol at the International Atomic Energy Agency."
"I do understand the fears in some quarters in Iran and the desire to possess the latest nuclear technology. After all, some countries in the vicinity already have nuclear weapons and have established nuclear technology research programmes."
"I am thinking particularly of India, Pakistan and Israel."
"However, the region will not become more secure if even more countries have nuclear weapons."
"After all, we are in favour of disarmament across the board in all these countries, and I think that Iran is doing the right thing by abandoning its efforts to obtain nuclear weapons and is instead developing a different, more rational and, one could argue, a European concept of security."
"We will certainly be very willing to give our support to Iran in this context."
"I know that Iran is making very positive and constructive contributions to regional development; I know this is true of Lebanon and it also seems to be the case in Iraq."
"Naturally, I wish the same could be said of its stance on Israel and Palestine."
"As someone who is always criticising the Israeli Government, I still take the view that all countries in this region and beyond should make their contribution to peace in the Middle East."
"With this in mind, I would like to conclude by reiterating my group’s solidarity with the Iranian people, but would also request and urge the Council to do more to encourage the development of democracy and human rights to their full capacity in Iran, in that country’s own interests."
"Madam President, Commissioner Nielson, it was naturally with great consternation that we heard the appalling news of the earthquake in Bam."
"Right in the middle of the Christmas holidays, the TV screens were filled with horrific pictures of dead and injured people and of thousands of people desperately searching for their relatives in a city in ruins."
"On behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I wish to express our condolences to, and deepest sympathy with, the Iranian people at this difficult time."
"Naturally, the EU should continue its work with the Iranian authorities to help those affected obtain care, roofs over their heads and other necessities."
"We should also help with the reconstruction of the beautiful historic city."
"Our concern for, and solidarity with, the Iranian people also extends to their access to democracy and human rights."
"The Group of the Europe Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is very concerned about these areas."
"There is still a lot to be done, because the Iranian regime is anything but democratic."
"Serious attacks on women, minorities, opposition members and dissidents are unfortunately part of everyday life."
"We are extremely concerned about the latest development and the Council of Guardians’ involvement in the forthcoming election."
"By not accepting thousands of candidates throughout the country – more than half of those who have put their names forward – Iran’s Council of Guardians is again showing its unwillingness to reform the Iranian system of government."
"Classifying the rejects as a bunch of criminals in view of the fact that they have had contacts with, for example, a number of groups disliked by the Council of Guardians rings hollow."
"On that logic, a quarter of the legislators already sitting would be criminals."
"If Iran wants ever to be counted among the democratic states, it must accept that political legitimacy is obtained from the people in free elections, not through the ayatollahs’ capricious interpretation of the will of God."
"Just like everyone else, the Iranian people wants democracy and human rights."
"We in the ELDR Group would call upon the Iranian leaders not to interfere in the election but to allow the candidates to stand so that the election is as fair and open as possible."
"In that connection, I want, like my fellow MEPs, to call upon the Commission to strengthen and develop the human rights dialogue with Iran."
"It must be something more than just polite chit-chat."
"If it is to be meaningful, it must be clear, persistent and consistent and also be evaluated on a regular basis."
"I hope that you, Commissioner Nielson, together with Commissioner Patten and Mr Solana, will be able to act in such a way as to inject new life into these discussions, partly in the light of the work on getting Iran to ratify and implement the Non-Proliferation Agreement."
"Madam President, last Sunday I returned from Iran following a political visit by Irish Members of Parliament to that country."
"During that visit we met the Iranian Foreign Minister, Mr Kharrazi, and other members of the government and parliament to discuss broader EU-Iranian relations at this time."
"The Iranian Government and Iranian Parliament have expressed their gratitude to the EU and to the broader international community for the assistance they have been given to help in the reconstruction of Bam and to help the thousands of displaced persons in this region."
"Basically, the tragedy in Bam was totally horrific, with tens of thousands of people dead and the infrastructure of this very historical city destroyed."
"The bottom line with regard to the reconstruction of Iran from an EU perspective is the following: it is going to take months and years to reconstruct the city and help to rebuild the lives of thousands of people which have simply been destroyed by this horrific earthquake."
"I strongly urge EU governments and the European Commission to make available long-term financial assistance to help the Iranian Government with these difficult regeneration tasks."
"The European Union has committed over EUR 200 million in recent years to help rebuild Afghanistan, and the European Union must take the decision financially to support the Iranian Government for a number of years so as to ensure that the basic social infrastructural and educational needs are addressed in the reconstruction process of Bam."
"Short-term financial assistance simply is not enough."
"Longer-term financial assistance is required, and EU governments must take the political decisions to make these broader financial commitments available to the Iranian Government."
"On a separate matter, I believe that political dialogue should recommence between the European Union and the Iranian Government."
"We are all aware of the difficulties that the international community has had with the Iranian Government concerning its compliance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty."
"However, the Iranian Government has signed protocols to this treaty, measures which we welcome."
"Negotiations should restart between the Union and the Iranian Government in the context of a trade and cooperation agreement between us, and a structured political dialogue between our respective partners should also be set up."
"In building close relations between the Union and Iran – which has a population of over 70 million people – it is best to build on the basis of dialogue and consultation rather than on the basis of political assumption, political prejudice and political coercion."
"Finally, I totally support paragraphs 6, 7, 8 and 9 of the resolution."
"It has come as a horrible shock to learn of the decision to prevent people from standing for election."
"We cannot accept that."
"I am sure that Ayatollah Khamenei will reverse the decision – as it should be – in favour of those who are trying to bring peace and reform to Iran."
"Madam President, I congratulate the Member who exceeded the speaking time, because I believe that exceeding useless restrictions is a good thing."
"I will begin by saying that we are astonished, we are shocked and that we want to fight against a majority of those elected to the current Iranian Parliament who were not – so to speak – previously banned and who have implemented a truly terrible policy since 1997, on the pretext of shortcomings due to the excess fundamentalist power of the Ayatollahs."
"The problem is that this Iran – of candidates and elected representatives who have not been banned – is an Iran that is second only to China in terms of the number of cases of capital punishment."
"President Khatami’s Iran is an Iran where, according to official data, not only do they continue to stone men and women to death, but where, on 3 February 2003, Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi-Shahrudi said to Chris Patten that, at the moment, Iran does not provide for an alternative to stoning to death, and he said this to us!"
"Now, if you will allow me, it is of course a terrible outrage in terms of democracy to prevent these candidates, the afore-mentioned reformists from being elected, but what concerns me is that, if they are elected, they will continue to live with stonings, unjustified death penalties, hypocritical moderatism."
"We in Europe are with Khatami, who acknowledges stonings and more, whilst we are shocked, ladies and gentlemen, that in Nigeria – where there is more than a hint of democracy – there was the real risk of just one woman being stoned; and no more have been stoned."
"So, I would merely like to plead with those tabling this resolution to accept a type of oral amendment, inserting figures on death penalties and those executed, welcoming the fact that those condemned have not been executed."
"I hope that tomorrow we either gather 32 signatures or we accept the oral amendment."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, Iran has just endured two seismic shocks in the space of a few weeks."
"The first, the earthquake in Bam, had 40 000 victims."
"The second, which was of a political nature, disqualifies more than 3 000 candidates from standing in the elections of 20 February."
"Is it improper to compare these two events, one of which is a natural disaster and the other, quite simply, a politico-religious attack?"
"I do not think so."
"The Bam disaster moved the entire world."
"The European Union has, for its part, already released humanitarian aid worth EUR 2.3 million and is planning further aid projects."
"We support these unreservedly, whatever happens, to ease the suffering of the victims and express our solidarity with all of the people of Iran."
"The world is aghast, however, at the decision to ban 3 000 reformist candidates from standing in the next parliamentary elections."
"Europe, confident in the process of democratisation that had been put in place by the Iranian Government, had made progress in bilateral negotiations and agreements were coming into view."
"Admittedly, it is not for us to dictate policy to a country or to interfere in its domestic affairs, but we reserve the right to choose our friends, those with whom we wish to collaborate and who have our confidence."
"If a fair solution is not found to the current crisis, one that is accepted by the Iranian people as a whole, it will not have an impact on the humanitarian aid, but it will have a profound and lasting effect on relations between Iran and the European Union."
"This would be another disaster with incalculable consequences."
"Madam President, first we should congratulate the Commissioner and ECHO for the aid provided."
"Criticisms of EU aid are frequently unfair, and all the reports from Iran suggest that the EUR 2.3 million deployed by the European Union within 72 hours using the primary emergency decision were both well received and well targeted."
"Despite the gravity of the losses, a thousand lives were saved by more than a thousand international search and rescue teams, and this Parliament should join with the head of the UN team in Bam who has described it as the best disaster response he has seen in 20 years."
"When we talk about south-south assistance we should at the same time congratulate the Iranian Red Crescent for mobilising more than 8 000 relief workers, and, despite what Robert Kilroy-Silk may say in the UK, Arab countries, who have offered 400 million for the reconstruction of Bam."
"It is not surprising that a humanitarian disaster at Christmas time provoked such a huge public response amongst the peoples of Europe, but it is right in this debate that we draw attention to the neglected emergencies which have not commanded the same media or public attention – in Angola, for example, where the UN appeal has raised only half of the 300 million sought, or Mozambique, where the figure is 12% of just 1.6 million needed, or Zambia, where only 10% of the required amount has been raised."
"Commissioner, at the very least we need your assurance today that no money to benefit Iran is diverted from these countries, where human lives are just as much at risk."
"Finally, it is right to include in our resolution a message to the Iranians that our international solidarity must be matched by their commitment to international human rights and standards of democracy."
"The procedure agreed by the Iranian Guardian Council for the screening of election candidates does not meet those standards."
"Of course, we in Europe do not seek to attach conditions to our help, but we do join with the many Iranians whose lives have been saved in wanting and expecting free and fair elections for their country."
". Madam President, I wish to begin by saying to Mr Howitt that I can guarantee that we are not diverting money from Angola, Zambia and the other places mentioned to Iran."
"For ECHO, in administrative terms, this is not a dramatic or difficult situation to respond to."
"I have taken note of the political remarks made during the various speeches."
"Politically, I agree that there are other disasters."
"I am also encouraged by what has been said in a number of the contributions here."
"On balance, the attempt to step up dialogue makes a lot of sense."
"It is very important that we continue to keep humanitarian assistance separate from politics."
"We will be discussing with the Iranian authorities how to secure access for all aid workers, issue visa waivers to the various NGOs working there both now and in the next few months, and ensure normal access for the benefit of victims and others in the country."
"Those are some of the points we will be raising as part of the process of delivering humanitarian assistance."
"Political dialogue with Iran – the other part of this afternoon's debate – will be pursued and taken up in the various relevant frameworks."
"I would stress my remark about keeping the issues separate, in order to be consistent, because from time to time we are faced with even more difficult situations where it is even more important to keep to the humanitarian mandate."
"I welcome the remarks made in the course of the debate."
"Finally, as Mr Howitt correctly pointed out, this is one case which illustrates the ability we now have – given the changes made in recent years to the way in which the Commission handles administration – to respond very quickly."
"– Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"I have received six motions for resolution to wind up this debate.(1)"
"The vote will take place on Thursday."
"– The next item is the report (A5-0412/2003) by Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the tuna fleet and industry: situation and future prospects in the EU and worldwide (2003/2017(INI))."
"Before I give you the floor, Mr Varela, I have to tell you that, in accordance with the agenda drawn up by the Conference of Presidents, at 5 p.m. precisely we are going to interrupt the debate to give the floor to the representative of the Commission to make an announcement on services in the internal market."
"As the timing of this agenda is precise and this announcement has to be made at 5 p.m. on the dot, we will interrupt the debate on Mr Varela’s report, which will be resumed after the Commission’s announcement."
". Madam President, I would ask you not to count what I am going to say first as speaking time because I would like, on behalf of all my colleagues, to make a slight protest at this situation."
"I know that it is not your fault, Madam President, but this is an irritating situation because the debate was initially scheduled for the morning, then it was changed to the early afternoon and now it has been left for the night, and this often happens to us with fisheries."
"I would ask that this never happen again because clearly it entirely breaks up the debate."
"I am going to speak until 5 p.m., and I hope that you will at least allow the rapporteur time to speak properly, because I do not believe the Commissioner will have time to answer me."
"He will have to do so at 9 p.m."
"In any event, the members of the Committee on Fisheries believe that this is not good and we hope that it will not happen to us again in the future."
"Thank you very much."
"My political group asked for this report because it believes that the Committee on Fisheries should focus all its attention on the study and analysis of certain fisheries, analysing their situation, their functions, their problems and their future."
"This could be done with various fisheries, but we have decided to begin with tuna fisheries for the simple reason that it is the most globalised species on the planet, both in its extraction and in its processing and marketing. This means that it involves great interests and complex problems at international level."
"In the case of tuna there is a very clear inter-relationship between fleet and industry, and the role of the European Union is essential since our market is the world's top market for this species, and our fleet is also the biggest in the world, and tuna represents 60% of total production of canned fish, the European Union currently being – with a production of some 400 000 tonnes of canned tuna – the world’s top producer."
"This generates a very significant number of jobs – which furthermore is highly localised – in peripheral maritime regions highly dependent on fisheries."
"For specific data I would refer you to my report."
"Our intention is to provide a technical and political consideration of the whole of the sector, both extractive and processing, to analyse its position within the European Union and the world in order to draw conclusions which we can deliver to the Commission and the Council in order to increase awareness and sensitivity towards this important industry and finally to propose a series of specific measures to improve its defence."
"We have begun by defining the species the report is directed at, focusing essentially on tropical tuna, which constitute 90% of what is processed by the canning industry."
"We call for the defence of sustainable and responsible fishing, as the very basis for its future."
"We defend fishing which is respectful of other species, such as dolphins."
"We therefore support the labelling of the AIDCP, the intergovernmental body which includes the European Union amongst its members; we call for transparency and clarity for consumers; we condemn illegal fishing – IUU – the flags of convenience which shelter it and we support the regional fisheries organisations and the Commission's role in them, we propose the creation of other new ones and we also request the maintenance and extension of the network of international tuna fishing agreements, given the highly migratory nature of these species and the guarantee that these international fisheries agreements represent for responsible fishing in the face of private agreements."
"I believe that the consensus reached in the Committee on Fisheries, in which the rapporteur accepted amendments from all political groups and proposed specific compromises, which have been incorporated, as in the case of the support for the amendments from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, demonstrate our genuine interest in supporting fisheries which must be sustainable both ecologically and economically and socially."
"I thank all the Members for their cooperation."
"To greatly summarise the contents of the report, we are calling for assistance for the Community fleet to prevent it from losing competitiveness in the globalised tuna world and we advocate a specific register for this fleet which will not receive aid from a structural point of view following the reform of the fisheries policy."
"It should be given incentives to retain the Community flags in the face of the temptation to take flags of convenience; that a census be created, authorised by the respective RFOs, and that illegal fishing and landings by these fleets be effectively controlled in order to put an end to unfair competition."
"To this end, we are calling for a specific unit within the Fisheries DG on highly migratory species with adequate resources and personnel to defend European interests in these fora at all times."
"We also call on the Commission to create a specific Advisory Committee on tropical tuna."
"With regard to our important canning industry, we are calling for a stable legal framework which allows it to better plan its activity and safeguard its investments."
"And we call for the same requirements for the Community industry as for the industries which export its product to our markets in order that we may compete under equal conditions within a very liberalised Community market which is continuing to open up with concessions to third countries, in particular in South East Asia."
"To this end we also call for the creation of a network of European reference laboratories in order to control the quality of products and technical and sanitary conditions, to which the European Union’s strict rules on the origin of goods must be applied."
"In view of the globalisation of the tuna market, we are facing very complex issues which require constant and priority attention, as happens in relation to the supply of raw material to the Community industry, and we therefore call for a new study of the real supply needs which allow the Community administration to take the appropriate decisions at all times."
"Our report, Commissioner, attempts to help the Commission to act correctly."
"We are therefore asking for specific things, such as: a specific action plan, a global framework for structural support, a defence plan to deal with third States and, to this end, the creation of units and advisory committees as I just said in my speech."
"This is therefore our opinion, it is the European Parliament's opinion, and we hope that the European Commission is now sensitive to it and will act accordingly."
"We in the European Parliament have begun our work and from now on we are going to demand compliance with our requests."
"– Thank you, Mr Varela. I have obviously taken careful note of your protests in response to the announcement that this debate will be interrupted."
"I must also reassure you: the time that you took to express your legitimate protests was not included in your speaking time, so no problem there."
"Moreover, since Commissioner Bolkestein has not yet arrived, I have the pleasure of giving the floor to Commissioner Fischler so that he can respond to your comments straight away."
". Madam President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking you, Mr Varela, very warmly for producing this excellent own-initiative report."
"I generally endorse your analysis of the situation in the tuna industry."
"I take the view that all actors in the tuna industry – from the fishermen to the processing industry – are a chain, and a chain, as we know, is only as strong as its weakest link."
"From the Commission’s perspective, three issues are especially important in supporting the interests of the tuna industry."
"Firstly, we will continue to need access to tuna stocks in third countries’ waters in future."
"Secondly, we must defend the interests of the tuna industry through our mandate in the regional fisheries organisations, and thirdly, we want to utilise our market policies in order to create a safety net for stakeholders."
"On access to tuna stocks in third countries’ waters, our fishing industry can only benefit from the new form of partnership agreements, which this House also supports."
"In your resolution, you call for a study on the state of tuna resources."
"The Commission is at present producing a kind of framework agreement for the assessment of the tuna fish chapters of the various fisheries agreements, and I will gladly take up your proposal within this context."
"On the regional fisheries organisations, I can confirm that I am determined to defend the Community’s interests in sustainable fishing within the regional fisheries organisations."
"We are pursuing several priorities in this context, which also match the priorities set by this Parliament."
"Firstly, we want to clamp down on illegal fishing, because it is nothing but unfair competition and the destructive exploitation of fish stocks."
"Our Community action plan for the eradication of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing was supported both by this Parliament and the Council."
"This is a political priority for the Commission and we have already launched appropriate initiatives in various fisheries organisations."
"Secondly, we must adapt the fleet capacity to match the fishing that is available."
"The Community cannot accept an aggressive expansion of third countries’ fleets at a time when its own fleet is undergoing cuts."
"Thirdly, we need a mid- to long-term strategy for sustainable resource management."
"At our instigation, multiannual framework programmes have been adopted in various regional fisheries organisations."
"Examples are the management plans for Northern bluefin tuna and swordfish in the Atlantic, and the capacity restrictions on the tuna fishing fleet in the Indian Ocean."
"This brings me to market issues."
"First of all, I would like to make it clear that the compensation payments within the framework of the common market organisation must remain a regulatory instrument for crisis situations; they cannot become a kind of long-term intervention mechanism."
"I would also remind you that a separate tariff exemption applies to tuna imports that are processed by Community industry."
"By contrast, imports of canned tuna and semi-processed products, such as tuna fillets, are subject to a tariff rate of 24%."
"This is the highest tariff in the fisheries sector and has been bound and applied for more than thirty years."
"Furthermore, canned tuna and fillets are classified as a sensitive product in international negotiations, which is why very few commercial licences have been granted for them."
"The combination of Community tariffs and trade preferences has clearly enhanced the competitiveness of the tuna industry."
"As you are aware, the Community has already introduced a ban on the import of products derived from illegal fishing."
"The Commission attaches great importance to a multilateral approach here."
"That is why we are also complying with the recommendations of the regional fisheries organisations."
"Secondly, it is also important that we apply the rules of origin and the health rules to imports without discrimination."
"The Commission is keen to continue working with the sector in identifying gaps in the veterinary control system."
"However, the responsibility for control primarily lies with the Member States."
"My final point is this: product labelling is intended to guarantee fair commercial practices."
"In this context, we must distinguish between the responsibilities of the market participants and the competence of regulatory authorities."
"The Commission intends to take up this issue again soon. We will of course consult Parliament and the tuna industry as part of this process."
"I would like to conclude by emphasising that the Commission is keen to engage in dialogue with all the interest groups."
"To this end, we are holding preparatory meetings on the negotiations on fisheries agreements or when determining our positions prior to the meetings of the regional fisheries organisations, which also involve the industry itself."
"This approach has proved extremely successful."
"Madam President, I hope you will not penalise my speaking time if I add my protest to that of Mr Varela."
"As Chairman of the Committee on Fisheries, I am fed up with the Committee's items being kicked around on the agenda from one day to the next."
"It was on the agenda for this morning's debate and here we are now, with half the members of the Committee who have asked to speak in the debate having to come back this evening."
"What way is this to organise diaries?"
"Firstly, I congratulate the rapporteur on this excellent own-initiative report."
"It was Mr Varela's idea that the Fisheries Committee should conduct in-depth investigations into some of the major species of fish, and what could be more appropriate than starting with tuna, a species of global importance now worth in excess of USD 2 billion per year."
"World production of canned tuna is over two million tonnes a year, while the trade in fresh tuna is also burgeoning."
"We held a special hearing in our Committee on this issue, with many industry experts giving evidence."
"In addition, the Sustainable Development Intergroup organised a seminar in Brussels last November entitled 'Tuna Fleet and Industry: Prospects for the Future', at which we had a wide range of international speakers."
"I wish to concentrate on one important aspect of the report, namely the AIDCP – or Agreement on the International Dolphin Conservation Program – to which the EU is a signatory, as is the United States and most of the tuna-producing nations of Central and South America."
"It is the most reliable method for ensuring that tuna is dolphin safe."
"I am grateful to Mr Varela for highlighting this in his report in a very positive way."
"He said in his report, 'the system for protecting dolphins in purse-seine fisheries established by the AIDCP, ... is far removed from other private certification schemes which have hitherto been introduced.'"
"I thoroughly endorse that analysis."
"One of these private certification schemes, promoted by the Californian NGO Earth Island, has dominated the canned tuna market for some years."
"It is estimated that over 97% of all canned tuna in Europe carries their 'dolphin safe' label."
"However, their 'dolphin safe' label is not turtle safe or shark safe."
"The method of fishing supported by Earth Island, in its current form, causes the death of countless turtles, sharks and other species and also kills thousands of young yellowfin tuna, discarded dead into the sea because they are below marketable weight."
"I very much endorse the support that Mr Varela's report has given to the AIDCP label and hope the Commission will push for this label to be used exclusively on canned tuna in the EU."
"Madam President, I regret that the report we are discussing this afternoon, being an own-initiative report, is not subject to the corresponding legislative procedure in the Commission and that the Council of Ministers is not going to give its opinion on it."
"I believe it is an excellent description of the problems worrying the Community tuna fleet, as well as its processing industry."
"It is true, as we have acknowledged many times in the Committee on Fisheries, that tuna is the most globalised segment of the fisheries sector, and that the Community market demands more product – both fresh tuna and processed tuna – than its fleet and its canning sector can provide."
"We therefore believe that Mr Fischler’s commitment to unreservedly defend our tuna sector, our fleet and our canning and processing sector is important, just as the governments of third countries promote actions in favour of their own fisheries sectors."
"By acting in this way, the Commission will defend the European social model and the economic and social cohesion of regions such as mine which largely depend on this industry."
"We join with the rapporteur, Mr Varela, in calling on the Commission to draw up a strategy in relation to tuna, the preservation of the most threatened species, such as bluefin tuna, and of the most vulnerable fishing grounds."
"We want fishing and marketing to respond to sustainable and environmental criteria, as well as food safety principles and that, therefore, control mechanisms be established at borders so that imported products have the same phytosanitary guarantees as those originating from our own fleet and industry."
"This Community strategy we are asking the Commission for is all the more urgent if we consider the vulnerability of our sector to possible unfair competition and the precariousness of many thousands of jobs in our industry, the majority of them carried out by women."
"We therefore urge the Commission to continue exerting pressure at international level in order to ensure that the principles of this responsible fishing are respected, and that it continue to promote controls and inspection, but we hope that in relation to tuna what we have seen on other occasions does not happen: that what weaves by night is unravelled by by day."
"We therefore hope that the criteria which Commissioner Fischler has expressed today turn out to be those which win out."
"Madam President, Mr Varela's report is on a very important and interesting subject – that of the tuna industry."
"I would also like to thank him for taking on board many of the Verts/ALE Group's suggestions."
"Many lessons can be learned from the way in which tuna fishing is managed."
"For instance, regional tuna management bodies such as ICAT have made great progress in combating fishing by vessels flying flags of convenience."
"Another example comes from the Pacific Ocean, where the regional body, the IATTC, has succeeded in dramatically reducing certain types of by-catch, namely dolphins."
"Finally, several tuna bodies are in the throes of establishing limits on the capacity of the fishing fleets that are allowed to be involved in the fishery."
"The initiatives mentioned in Mr Varela's report are very good ones, but the report does not get rid of the remaining problems, especially the overfishing of several species such as bigeye and bluefin tuna, as well as the unacceptable amount of by-catch involving a wide number of species taken via so-called FAD fishing – the favoured method used by EU vessels."
"I believe it is essential that the EU clean up these aspects of its fisheries if it is to be committed to a sustainable fisheries policy."
"Madam President, Commissioner Fischler, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, I would first like to congratulate Mr Varela on his excellent work."
"My group does, of course, fully support his report."
"I would like to highlight two points that we consider to be particularly sensitive: consumer health and employment in the fisheries sector and in the tuna processing sector."
"After years of tests, scientific analyses and expert opinions, we all know that fish consumption is on the increase: fish is healthy, the consumption of fish products – either fresh, smoked, frozen or canned fish – by European citizens increases year after year, and is also due to several effective advertising and information campaigns."
"We also know only too well that in the Member States various requirements, especially those relating to health and hygiene, must, rightly, be met in order to market canned fish products produced in Europe."
"In order to adequately protect consumer health, the same requisites should also be extended to products from third countries where, unfortunately, health regulations in this area are often too lenient or even, in some cases, completely lacking."
"We therefore support and strongly insist on the requests made in points 8 and 10 of the motion for a resolution, which point out, respectively, the need to intensify inspections on third-country products – which are, moreover, already provided for by Directive 91/493/EEC – and the need to create Community laboratories to uphold quality, food safety and consumer safety against what is known as food piracy."
"The – equally important – issue of competitiveness and, therefore of employment, in the tuna fishing sector and the canned tuna industry, is linked to the sensitive issue of protecting consumer health.If, in order to adequately protect the consumer, certain requirements are imposed, including those that I just mentioned relating to health, which involves a considerable amount of money being invested, and if the same requirements are not applied to products from third countries then, with the inevitable entry into the Community market of products at very low prices compared to European products, then competitiveness in the fishing industry and the European canned tuna industry will be unfairly harmed."
"There is a grave risk of job losses in a sector that has already been hit hard in recent years by a worrying socio-economic crisis."
"As a result, we would point out the need to support, with every possible regulatory and economic means, the sector in question, which is an important source of employment also in other Mediterranean regions, including Sicily, where fishing and bluefin tuna processing has for centuries provided economic support to a considerable percentage of the active population."
"With this message of hope we also want to see an assurance of something tangible."
"– Madam President, the excellent own-initiative report by Mr Varela means that we now have a reference document on an activity whose importance tends to be underestimated by Europeans, despite the fact that we have the largest fishing sector in the world."
"This activity generates a huge number of jobs, directly and indirectly, both in Europe and in the developing countries with which we are linked through international agreements and where European industry has made significant investments."
"In fact, what emerges from the very comprehensive analysis carried out by our rapporteur of the various different Community policies that impact on the sector is that we are very far from having an overall and coherent Community strategy of encouraging the development of this activity. On the contrary, it is as if the Community were doing its best to penalise its own tuna fleet and its own processing industry and to favour the fleet and industry in third countries."
"As an example, at a time when we are seeing considerable growth throughout the world in unregulated fishing capacity flying flags that show little respect for international maritime law, the Commission has proposed banning all public aid for new constructions in Europe and making the construction of new vessels dependent on old ones being destroyed without any compensation of any kind."
"It seems to want to encourage Community shipowners to fly third-country flags that they would not otherwise choose."
"In addition, we are lowering customs tariffs considerably on canned tuna from third countries and at the same time subjecting our own processors to ever more requirements, without taking into account the impact of these constraints on the competitiveness of our industry."
"It is therefore time to review these Community policies, which threaten to compromise the future of a sector that has nevertheless enjoyed exemplary success."
"We must not allow this to be threatened by these inconsistent policies and by the lack of an overall vision and definite strategy."
"Madam President, Commissioner Fischler, we must indeed compliment Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, who carried out this excellent work which, at least according to the Commissioner, will also meet with approval in the Commission regarding the aims and objectives that we have set."
"This is certainly something that consoles and encourages us."
"The issue of fishing gear and environmental sustainability in this extremely important fisheries sector were well dealt with, and there are two further issues where – and here I would like to appeal to my fellow Members – we must try to maintain a balance."
"Within the fisheries sector, tuna fishing is extremely important for the European Union in the two areas that it includes: on the one hand, extractive fishing – fleets that fish tuna in our waters and those outside the European Union – and, on the other hand, the important pillar represented by the processing sector, which processes tuna of European origin but also, as has been mentioned, tuna originating, in particular, in the seas of Asia and other seas."
"We must, of course, focus on safety, in particular as regards these productions, but – and on this matter I am glad that the rapporteur agreed with me that we must not proceed rashly – we must also be very careful as regards customs regimes."
"With this report we are calling for a study and for the Commission to carry out an assessment."
"I agree with the Commissioner that one of the preferences is a regime which has to date given results whilst, compared with other countries, we have one of the highest customs duties."
"So, balancing the two pillars of the European fisheries industry – processing and fleets that fish tuna – is an objective that we cannot abandon and which we must focus on."
"I believe that, with the wisdom that distinguishes this House – and the report currently before us is proof of this – we will succeed in guaranteeing both aspects and, thus, a more prosperous and more sustainable tuna fishing industry in the European Union."
"Madam President, tuna is one of the most popular fish in the EU and also one of the most commercially valuable."
"Most people's experience of eating tuna is through access to the canned product."
"However, fresh tuna has become more popular and is readily available to consumers in my country, Scotland."
"That is why paragraph 11 in the resolution, stating that the product's origin should be identified and that there should be full and accurate information for consumers on the type of tuna packed and on the ingredients, is so important."
"As many of my colleagues have said, the accurate labelling of dolphin-friendly tuna is important in order to reassure consumers that what they are eating does not damage vulnerable species."
"This directly links in to the recent proposal by the Commission on cetacean by-catches and the resulting protection of these at-risk species."
"The protection of dolphins and other cetaceans is of concern to many of my constituents, especially many schoolchildren whom I meet."
"That is why inspection of third-country products is important not just in terms of health, but also in terms of consumer information."
"This report highlights conservation-friendly approaches and I welcome it as a basis for sustainable fishing."
"Madam President, may I firstly say that I do not blame you personally, but many colleagues have not been able to speak in the debate because they have left the Chamber while we wait for another Commissioner."
"Commissioner Fischler is sitting patiently, listening to our debate, and half our colleagues have been unable to contribute to it."
"This is no way to organise business."
"This debate should now be finished and persons on the list should be recalled to speak."
"Before I make my points to the rapporteur, I would ask you to deduct the 38 seconds I have just spoken for."
"I should like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for his comprehensive report."
"Many of the points he raises are certainly to be welcomed."
"I was particularly pleased with the emphasis placed on the need to prevent incidental mortality among dolphins and other species associated with tuna fisheries."
"Aside from tuna fishing, many dolphins are being washed up dead in my own area of the South-West because of pair trawling."
"This is therefore an important issue."
"I was also happy to hear the rapporteur insisting that products from third countries should meet the same food safety and quality standards as our own."
"This is something for which we on the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development have campaigned hard with regard to farm products."
"The same should naturally apply to fisheries products."
"Our consumers have a right to safe food, and third-country imports must be of the same high standard."
"Commissioner Fischler spoke about third-country agreements."
"I am always worried about these agreements because, although many new agreements include conservation measures, there is little conservation to be seen in reality."
"What is happening off the coast of Africa is much more than exploitation of waters."
"I believe we are threatening the indigenous fisherman."
"If there are going to be third-country agreements, they will have to be much better monitored and we must be sure that fish are being caught safely and that our money is being spent wisely."
"My final point is that, with regard to labelling catches as tuna-friendly and purchasing dolphin-friendly tuna, we must be sure that practices are genuinely tuna- and dolphin-friendly, that there is no huge by-catch with caught tuna and that people do not purchase such products because they think they are both conservation-friendly and by-catch-friendly, when, in fact, a large number of turtles, sharks and dolphins are evidently being caught."
"This is misleading, and we have to be very careful when using the 'friendly' label."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in view of the critical situation facing the tuna fishing industry, the European Parliament has decided to proceed with an own-initiative report in order to protect both the EU fleet and the tuna processing industry."
"With its abundance of species, tuna has become a commercially and socio-economically significant fishery resource, to the extent that it has recently shown strong growth rates."
"To put this into figures, tuna accounts for more than 60% of canned fish production in the EU, with more than 40 000 people directly employed in the industry."
"With Spain, Italy, France and Portugal leading the way, the European tuna fleet is the most productive in the world, as it accounts for more than 20% of the total catch."
"This is an industrial activity with strong historical traditions."
"Parliament’s sole aim in producing this report is to call for a detailed and through-going study of the current situation and to set out the future prospects for this sector of fishing."
"The report thus begins by focussing on two fundamental problems facing the tuna fishing sector: the loss of competitiveness of the fleet and of the industry in the EU faced with imports from third countries and the sustainable conservation and management of resources."
"It should be recognised that these characteristics are not confined to tuna; they are widespread and apply to almost all types of fishing."
"To ensure that the EU shows unequivocal support for the industry, this report calls for a specific action plan and a structural support framework for the tuna sector."
"With this instrument, the EU must demand that products from third countries meet the same health standards for quality and for food safety as products from the Community."
"Similarly, the European Union once again calls for more frequent product inspections in order to ensure that rules on conservation are adhered to in full."
"As regards the conservation and management of fisheries resources, tuna is a migratory species that is particularly vulnerable to illegal fishing in international waters."
"Consequently, the EU must prevent the transfer of EU-owned vessels to countries flying flags of convenience."
"The capacities of the fishing fleet must also adapt more effectively to the resources available."
"Finally, in conclusion, I should like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the excellent work of the rapporteur, Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, which will certainly make a positive contribution towards setting out future prospects in this sector."
"Madam President, I suppose that those of us who have remained can be thankful to Commissioner Bolkestein for being late."
"At least that has allowed us not to have to come back after 9 p.m."
"I am sure Commissioner Fischler is also pleased about that."
"However, this sort of thing should not happen in this House and we should organise our debates more efficiently."
"I welcome this very good report and congratulate the rapporteur on producing it."
"As others have said, tuna is as important to the southern regions of Europe as cod and hake is to the northern ones, and those of us from the northern region can therefore understand the concerns."
"A very significant percentage of the catch goes to the processing industry, meaning that there are very many dependent jobs both at sea and on shore."
"Up to 60% of the fish caught are canned, as Mrs Stihler has said, and much of that is eaten by us in the northern hemisphere."
"I, like many people, am very fond of it."
"However, there are major issues at stake here and they are of concern to me."
"We can only support sustainable and responsible fishing."
"I agree with Mr Parish and others who expressed concerns about dolphins."
"That is something of concern to many people in my constituency."
"Ultimately, however, our fleets must remain competitive in the long term."
"We must have quality control and the size of fish caught must be closely monitored."
"The Commissioner mentioned three important points, one of which is access to third countries."
"If we are going to have access to third countries – which is probably needed – it must be closely monitored and there must be tighter controls."
"Above all we must rule out illegal fishing and protect those species under threat."
"We need a mechanism for both long- and short-term strategies for the industry, but these must take into account the requirements of the industry and be sensitive to the issue of biomass and tuna stocks."
"We must work for a more sustainable industry in the future."
"– Commissioner Fischler, I do not believe that you wish to respond."
"The debate is therefore closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"I should like to remind Members who would have liked to speak this afternoon but who are absent on account of the slight confusion in proceedings that they may submit their speech in writing."
"Those Members that are present may wish to inform their absent colleagues of this possibility."
"As Commissioner Bolkestein is still not with us, the Commission communication on services in the internal market cannot be made now."
"Given that this is the case, we are going to have to amend the agenda."
"I therefore propose that the Commission communication on services in the internal market be postponed to 9 p.m. this evening."
"To amend the agenda adopted by the Conference of Presidents, I am bound, pursuant to Rule 111(2) of the Rules of Procedure, to submit this proposal to the House for approval."
"We have finally done as you desired, Mr Varela, and I am glad: your report has been examined in full."
". – It is a fact that tuna is the canning industry’s most important product, not only in this Community, but also worldwide."
"A number of countries belonging to this Community have a traditionally strong position in the tuna sector and are vulnerable to changes in the market."
"It is clear, not only from the Committee on Fisheries’ hearing, but also from what my colleague Mr Varela has said, that the time has come to act."
"Third countries, particularly those in Asia, have recently sought to secure for themselves a major chunk of the tuna market, which is a lucrative one."
"I see one explanation for the success of our non-European competitors as being the fact that they have an advantage in terms of costs over the owners of ships belonging to the Community fleet."
"European shipowners have to comply with Community regulations on hygiene, supervision of fishing activity, production conditions, protection of the environment, and social security for their workers."
"Important and right though that is, it costs money."
"In order to prevent shipowners from abandoning the Community flag for the sake of competitive advantage, I call for defensive action."
"Firstly, there is a need for coordination of the Community policy measures that affect the tuna fleet and the canning industry; secondly, additional fisheries agreements are needed; thirdly, if third countries want to sell their products on the EU market, compliance with health and hygiene regulations must be an absolute requirement; and, fourthly, duties on canned tuna must be maintained until such time as import and trade restrictions are lifted."
"What this boils down to is that the EU’s strategy must be a coordinated one and conceived at international level."
"he next item is Question Time (B5-0002/2004)."
"The following questions are addressed to the Commission."
"Violence against elderly people, whether in the home environment or in old people's homes, nursing homes or hospitals, is constantly increasing in all EU Member States."
"What will the Commission do to combat the problem of violence against elderly people throughout Europe?"
"In view of the urgency of the situation, will the Commission ensure that the EU Member States, within four years, adopt the requisite legislation to protect the rights of elderly people and guarantee their unimpaired participation in the life of society?"
". Mr President, in a Europe in which there is an acute demographic problem and the number of elderly people is increasing constantly, it is clear that new problems of policies relating to the elderly will arise."
"I would remind you that the European Commission has already taken account of the age factor in the directive which was tabled and accepted by the Council in 2000 on dealing with all forms of discrimination in the workplace on the basis of age."
"Similarly, I would remind you that, in Article 25 of the Charter on Fundamental Rights, there is a clear reference which recognises the right of the elderly to a dignified life and their right to participate in economic and political life."
"When we come to the more specific matter of violence against the elderly, something which is now a fact of life in several European countries and has to do to a great extent with the change in the family model and with the population of elderly people, which is constantly increasing, I would say that it is very difficult for us to find a legal basis on which to proceed with legislation."
"I should like to remind you that, during the course of discussions in the Constitutional Convention, a huge effort was made to integrate a legal basis into the new Treaty which would give the European Union the possibility to legislate on questions of violence overall, be it against women, children or the elderly."
"In the end no agreement was reached and there is at present no reference even in the Convention proposal for a legal basis for violence."
"So as far as the legal question is concerned, this comes within the jurisdiction of the Member States."
"As far as policies and programmes are concerned, the Commission has the Daphne programme, with a more global approach to questions of violence, and we have a number of important initiatives in the Member States which relate to violence against the elderly."
"The Commission's intention is to fund the Daphne programme as much as it can."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for your reply."
"You are right, of course: it is indeed the Member States that are primarily responsible here."
"As a member of the board of the European Senior Citizens Union (ESCU), I have focussed very intensively on these issues recently, and it has emerged – for our organisation now has members in twenty European states – that there is a growing debate in all the European countries about the situation in homes for the elderly."
"Our question is this: would it not be possible to produce some kind of recommendation on how contracts should be concluded with these homes?"
"We are aware of homes where residents are very often treated with very little respect, are even confined to cots against their will, are prevented from going out, are served their evening meal so early that they very soon feel hungry again but have no chance of getting anything to eat after 8 or 9 p.m., and where if they soil themselves with or without an incontinence pad, they are often left to lie in their own filth for hours at a time, or are treated in an unfriendly manner by staff, are abused verbally and even subjected to violence."
"I believe that guidelines for contracts for homes are essential."
"You know that this is Question Time."
"It is not a time for statements or debates, but we have listened carefully to Mrs Flemming."
"I do not know whether the Commissioner wishes to respond in any way."
". As I said, the Commission does not have the facility to make this sort of intervention."
"It is not justified by any legal basis."
"I think, however, that it is important that, in future, Article 25 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, especially the reference to a dignified life for the elderly, will also constitute a basis for the associations of the elderly to which Mrs Flemming referred, so that they can take recourse to the courts and so that the European Union and, of course, the national authorities, have the facility to intervene in certain cases."
"I welcome Mrs Flemming's question and would also suggest to the Commissioner that there is a way through."
"There is a sphere of competence within the European Union and it is that of health promotion and illness prevention, which includes the illnesses and suffering that can be caused by elder abuse."
"I suggest we take a look at this."
"When I was responsible for this policy area in my home country, we did a lot of research, and a lot of research was done in the USA and other countries, to see how elder abuse could be prevented."
"Very often elder abuse is committed by evil people who are perpetrating crimes, but very often too it is committed by people within families, carers and professional helpers who reach the end of their tether because they do not feel supported."
"People who would never have believed themselves capable of elder abuse suddenly find that the explosion has taken place, and that they have struck out and hurt someone they love."
"I suggest therefore that we look to pool the experience we have in the different Member States in order to establish good practices in this field within the sphere of competence to which I have referred."
". I feel that we can definitely identify areas of cooperation in healthcare policy."
"I would like to inform you that we have already started implementing the method of open coordination in the care of elderly people."
"This is a very good opportunity."
"Member States are already working together in this area."
"Although such measures do not take the form of recommendations, they reflect our final goal."
"I have tried to respond to the specific issue of violence."
"That is rather a different matter."
"It could come under problems in the field of healthcare, but it is a problem not merely confined to healthcare."
"The Member States were supposed to bring the Directive concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector into force by the end of October 2003."
"On 5 December 2003 the Commission announced that it was initiating proceedings against 11 Member States for delays in bringing the directive into force."
"The majority of e-mails are now spam."
"What other concrete measures does the Commission propose to take to ensure that the objectives of the directive are implemented?"
"The reliability of e-mail is impaired and its development has stagnated."
"How will the Commission ensure that the Member States also take the most urgent measures to put pressure on service providers (for example) so that the basic requirement of electronic communications – their free flow – may be guaranteed?"
". It is true that unsolicited commercial e-mail, or 'spam', has reached worrying proportions: over 50% of e-mail traffic, according to many experts, is now 'spam'."
"The Commission also agrees that 'spam' undermines not only privacy and consumer protection, but also productivity at work and overall productivity growth."
"Consumer confidence in e-mail is falling, according to some studies."
"It is, however, a prerequisite for the successful development of e-commerce and the information society in general."
"The Commission is reacting on several fronts."
"Firstly, the European Union has acted on the legislative front by adopting, in 2002, the directive on privacy and electronic communications – as Mr Paasilinna will know because he made a considerable contribution to the discussion."
"Infringement proceedings were launched in November 2003 against a number of Member States that had failed to take the necessary transposition measures."
"Secondly, the Commission knows that legislation is only part of the answer."
"The Commission has discussed with interested parties a series of actions for Member States, industry and consumers to take."
"These actions will complement legislation and seek to make the ban on 'spam' as effective as possible."
"They focus on effective enforcement by Member States, self-regulatory efforts by industry, technical solutions such as filtering and security, and consumer awareness."
"On enforcement in particular, Member States must not only put in place adequate complaint mechanisms, remedies and penalties, but also prosecute 'spammers' effectively and monitor 'spam'."
"Cooperation between industry and public authorities is important in this regard."
"The Commission is also taking steps to improve cross-border cooperation inside the Union by meeting relevant authorities."
"Since a large volume of 'spam' originates outside the European Union, international cooperation will also be essential."
"Several actions are under way in this regard."
"Let me mention some of them."
"Firstly the declaration and action plan agreed at the United Nations World Summit on the Information Society call for appropriate action on 'spam' to be taken at national and international level."
"Secondly the Commission will be hosting an OECD seminar on 'spam' on 2 and 3 February 2004 in Brussels."
"Thirdly, bilateral contacts are ongoing with third countries, including the competent authorities in the United States, since a large volume of 'spam' seems to come from US-based companies."
"These actions are the subject of a communication on 'spam' which the Commission will adopt in the next few days."
"Finally, the Safer Internet Action Plan and, to a greater extent, its likely successor, Safe Internet Plus, will also fund activities relating to 'spam', including 'spam' sent to children."
"To conclude, however, let me stress one element: no one party acting in isolation will be able to solve the problem; success will depend on the firm commitment of all interested parties."
"– Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for his very detailed and, in my opinion, very good and positive reply."
"I wish, however, to ask a further question."
"Recently, those responsible for creating and spreading a virus have used other people’s computers to send out spam."
"This is known as the Trojan Horse principle."
"Although, let us say, 60% of computers might be protected, there are always some which have inadequate protection, and the hackers and crackers can use them as bases and platforms for spreading spam."
"Has the Commission considered how one might respond to this very international problem of a virus and innocent people’s computers being used to turn spam into a problem on a large scale?"
". – This ‘Trojan Horse’ case, which Mr Paasilinna mentions, is one of the nastiest ways of abusing the Internet to cause trouble for people and restrict their ability to work."
"This is one issue we intend to deal with in our communication, which is to be published very soon, and also at a seminar to be held by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development in Brussels in February."
"I hope that Mr Paasilinna will be able to attend."
"At the same time, obviously, as we are now establishing a Network Security Agency, a report on which Mr Paasilinna has already presented here in Parliament, this problem will also feature as part of that whole process."
"We are prepared to give special attention to this Trojan Horse problem and the way it creates spam."
"Innocent people unknowingly become perpetrators of an illegal activity that also contravenes this directive."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I share your view that the issue addressed by Mr Paasilinna is an important one."
"I hope that the European Network and Information Security Agency will also be able to make an assessment of spam and that we shall be able to obtain different assessments of the spam programs."
"When the Commissioner sent an e-mail to a number of Finnish MEPs last week, Parliament’s spam program labelled it as ‘suspected spam’, not however with the label ‘suspected high’, but ‘suspected low’."
"We need an assessment of the way in which the spam programs operate if the protection is to be effective."
"I also hope that we shall together be able to develop tools for revealing the false identities. There are not only Trojan horses, but also many false identities on the Internet."
"Mr President, I shall no doubt have to talk with Parliament’s departments which do not know who the Commissioners are."
"If a Commissioner sends an e-mail to fifteen Members of the European Parliament, this should be assessed as genuine, factual information."
"Given the Commission’s failure to investigate new scientific and other evidence on fluoride in drinking water via the Commission’s Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment (CSTEE) as promised in May 2000, this failure now threatens the credibility of the new Drinking Water Directive (DWD)."
"In order to protect the credibility of the new DWD and the process whereby it was developed, I ask the Commission to make the review of the proposed parametric values for ‘Fluoride’ more transparent. This is necessary to allow belated but proper scrutiny of the reasoning which permits the addition of a priority hazardous chemical in artificial fluoridation schemes in the Drinking Water Directive."
"Further, that pending the availability of a proper and comprehensive scientific review of fluorides artificially added to drinking water within the EU, the Directive should adopt the Precautionary Principle and prohibit outright their use in drinking water intended for human consumption in the Member States."
". Firstly, I thank Mrs Doyle for the question."
"The Drinking Water Directive of 1998 sets quality standards for a range of chemical parameters, including fluoride."
"The parametric value for fluoride in the directive is based on available scientific evidence and is in line with the values recommended by the World Health Organization."
"Secondly, there is general agreement in the scientific community that fluoride in drinking water may have positive or negative effects depending on the concentration."
"The maximum permitted value of 1.5 mg/litre maintains a good balance between positive and negative effects, according to the World Health Organization."
"The Commission feels supported in this assessment by the most recent documents of the World Health Organization from 2003, that is, in a new draft edition of the World Health Organization's 'Guidelines for Drinking-Water Quality'."
"These documents maintain the same value for fluoride."
"At the same time, the issue of artificial fluoridisation of drinking water is the responsibility of Member States and, indeed, the approaches vary from country to country."
"In some countries it is banned and in others it is left to the local authorities to decide."
"However, in any case the maximum permitted value has to be respected."
"Thirdly, in order to assemble most recent knowledge and experience, the Commission organised a seminar on drinking water in October 2003."
"It brought together experts from across the European Union, including those from new Member States and from the World Health Organization, and addressed the issue of fluorides and fluoridisation."
"For fluoride values it has been recognised that the current value of 1.5 mg/litre reflects current scientific knowledge."
"Finally, following a request from the Commission, the Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment evaluated a study concerning the quality of drinking water in selected European cities."
"In its evaluation of 2003 it referred, in line with the scientific position adopted by the World Health Organization, to both the protective and detrimental effects of fluoride, but did not suggest making a change to the value for fluoride in the directive."
"I thank the Commissioner for answering my question here today."
"I am still not satisfied, however."
"In answer to a parliamentary question – PQ 1434/00 – put in May 2000, you said, Commissioner, that you would examine whether there was any significant new evidence on artificial fluoridation."
"This would, you said, include 'obtaining an appropriate update by consulting the Commission's Scientific Committee for Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment'."
"Apparently, you did not consult that committee, you went immediately to the WHO and you are still quoting what it considers to be desirable levels."
"The evidence is extremely shaky in this area."
"Yes, the scientific jury is out, but 13 out of 23 developing countries working under the WHO guidelines have serious problems with fluoride poisoning, or fluorosis, in the dental care of their people."
"In my own country fluorosis is becoming an increasing dental problem, particularly in teenagers."
"I would ask you to look particularly at the problem of neonates and infants, who are being fed milk formula from reconstituted, fluoridated tap water."
"Given that it constitutes a huge proportion of their diet, fluoridated tap water that is not inspected, in which the levels of fluoride are not regularly checked, is a serious health risk to our neonates and infants in Ireland and in parts of the UK where they still fluoridate tap water."
"As well as the ethical question of mass-medicating members of the public, who do not want fluoridation in their tap water, could you comment on the ethical and infant-related issues?"
". We get the scientific advice on this from the World Health Organization."
"We also ask the committee you mentioned."
"It gave us its opinion on fluoride as recently as 2003."
"It said that the concentrations of fluoride normally present in fluoridated drinking water do not present a health risk according to a large number of animal studies and human epidemiology."
"The World Health Organization drinking water guideline is the same as in the EU Directive – 1.5 mg per litre."
"Dental fluorosis occurs at concentrations above 1.5 mg and 2 mg per litre."
"Skeleton fluorosis occurs at higher concentrations – between 3 mg and 6 mg. In Dublin, for example, the water is fluoridated but the parametric value of 1.5 mg per litre was not exceeded and, according to this report, the highest concentration recorded was 0.9 mg."
"We ask every Member State to comply with the existing legislation, which was drawn up in the light of the scientific advice."
"There has been no reason to re-evaluate that advice."
"We have brought together a group from both new and old Member States – all the experts we could call on – and they concluded that they saw no reason to change the directive in this regard."
"It is also a matter for Member States."
"So, in your case Mrs Doyle, it is a matter of trying to change Ireland's policy on this if you think it is wrong and if you think your country is not following the values laid down in the directive."
"We have no reason, from the advice we have sought, to change the parameters that are established in the directive on fluoride in drinking water."
"I very much agree with what my colleague Mrs Doyle said, and I do not actually feel that the Commissioner answered her questions adequately."
"In relation to mass-medication, it is completely unacceptable in terms of freedom of choice that 9 million UK citizens and 2.7 million Irish citizens are being forcibly mass-medicated."
"In Ireland, 91% of submissions were actually against the fluoridation of water."
"Clearly there is a lack of public consent here."
"The EU is not adhering to the precautionary principle, as it is supposed to."
"I would like to see the Commission push for fluoridation of drinking water throughout the EU to be discontinued until there is a proper, adequate assessment of the situation."
"For example, the fact there is a big difference in water consumption between hot countries and cold countries is not taken into account when discussing how much water people drink."
"In hotter countries a lot of people drink a lot more water and therefore they are consuming a lot more, and in some of the new Member States there is fluoride in hot water as well."
"Mrs Doyle's point on infants is a really serious question because infant formula is being mixed with water that has been fluoridated, and I believe that there are serious consequences for children here."
"My opinion is that we should not be using formula anyway."
". The scientific advice both from the World Health Organization and from our own committee takes that into account."
"Fluoride can occur naturally."
"The water in the well in our own backyard, for example, had a very high concentration of fluoride."
"It can occur naturally to such an extent that you are recommended not to use it for your children because it could affect their teeth."
"However, it is up to each Member State to set the rules, as long as they follow the recommendations and the limit values set in the directive."
"We have asked for scientific advice, which we follow very closely."
"We ensure that we are kept up to date with the latest scientific advice."
"As I said, as a result of the findings and the work done in the various working groups, and after calling together all the experts, we have no reason to change – at least for the time being – the recommendations on the limit values in the directive."
"If we receive new scientific evidence or see any reason to change, we will do so."
"Otherwise, however, you will have to try to influence Ireland on its policy on this issue because such policy is decided in each and every Member State."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"We shall proceed to the second part of questions to the three Commissioners here today."
"Will the Commission give its view on the progress made in attaining the objectives of the Tampere Council on Immigration and Asylum, particularly with reference to the issue of managing migration and building closer relationships with sending countries?"
". The honourable Member's question asks the Commission to comment on progress achieved on the implementation of the Tampere objectives concerning the development of a common immigration and asylum policy."
"The question is very timely since we are coming to the end of the first phase of the development of these policies, as detailed in the Tampere agenda."
"Moreover, the five-year deadline set out in the Amsterdam Treaty for the realisation of certain objectives, notably with respect to asylum policy, will be reached on 1 May 2004."
"The annual parliamentary debate on the development of an area of freedom, security and justice, which will take place during the February part-session, will be the first opportunity to discuss with Parliament the assessment of our policies in these fields."
"In June 2004, the Commission intends to present to the European Parliament and to the Council a communication which will evaluate the progress made in implementing the Tampere objectives."
"This communication will include an evaluation of all aspects concerning immigration, asylum, the integration of immigrants in our societies and the development of relations with third countries."
"I hope that this communication will also be able to include some guidelines for what could, in the near future, become a 'Tampere II' agenda."
"Thank you Commissioner for that comprehensive answer."
"I do not want to pre-empt the Commission's June 2004 communication, but would like to ask the Commissioner's personal view on whether he is hopeful that, within that communication, some progress on the links between Member States and the European Union and sending countries will be established."
"He may know that the issue of managed migration is now coming to the fore of the agenda in the European Union, partly due to his work and that of many others."
"I would like to ask his personal opinion on whether he thinks, when the communication is finally published, that he or anyone else will have some positive news to give us on the issue of managed migration and the specific partnerships between our countries and others."
"He may know of examples concerning the United Kingdom and the Philippines, which has sent health workers, and issues of that nature. Does he have anything to say about that?"
"."
"I thank you for that supplementary question because it allows me to say that I hope that Parliament and the Council will, in the interim, have concluded an agreement on the adoption of a regulation concerning the multiannual programme to finance partnerships with third countries in the shared management of migratory fluxes."
"Over the next 5 years EUR 250 million will be allocated for this programme, and we intend to give priority in the assessment of this financial instrument to those countries engaged in negotiating readmission agreements with the European Union."
"The second strand will be a report – which the Commission will present to the Council in April – concerning links between legal and illegal migration, which will above all set out the conclusions of the study currently being undertaken by the Commission into the possibility of establishing some kind of system for coordinating legal migration in the Member States."
"Such a system could be helpful to third countries in their partnerships aiming to combat trafficking in human beings and illegal migration."
"The third strand will be the report that the Commission will present to the Council by June 2005, in which it will consider new ways of enhancing international protection and, above all, the possibility of establishing Europe-wide resettlement schemes and providing improved protection in the region for refugees."
"I hope I will have some progress to report to you in all those areas when I come back in June for the global assessment of the Tampere agenda."
"As ever, I have listened with admiration to the presentation and comments by the Commissioner."
"He spoke about managing migration and legal migration."
"Could he take the opportunity, in the light of the hysteria in some areas of the British press about what will happen in terms of migration when enlargement takes place, to outline some of the initiatives I know he has put in place that will ensure that migration from the new Eastern European members of the European Union will be sensible, and controlled in such a way that it will be mutually beneficial to the citizens of those countries and to the existing Member States of the European Union?"
". I will answer the honourable Member by giving my own example."
"I come from Portugal, which before entering the Union was supposed to be preparing to invade it."
"There were many fears surrounding the Portuguese and the Spanish too, Mr President, if I recall correctly – the Portuguese and Spaniards were about to invade Europe."
"In real terms, our assessment is that joining the Union presents such a huge opportunity for economic development in those countries that join the Union that migratory fluxes are limited."
"There are special rules written into the accession treaties concerning the free movement of workers during transitional periods."
"We therefore have the necessary legal framework to guarantee that everything will be handled carefully, swiftly and in a very reasonable way."
"I hope that message gets through to the British public."
"On 25 June 2003 an agreement was signed in Washington between the European Union and the United States on the extradition of criminals."
"The decision concerning the signature of this agreement was published in the Official Journal of the European Union(1)."
"Can the Commission give its assurance that the agreement does not give the United States the right to request the extradition by a Member State of a person having committed a crime in that Member State which is statute-barred by its legislation, or the right to request extradition by a Member State of a person for a crime for which he has already been sentenced in that Member State?"
"Has the agreement entered into force?"
"If not what is the Commission’s intended timetable of action?"
". Mr President, honourable Members, on 23 June 2003 two agreements were signed between the European Union and the United States, regarding extradition and mutual assistance in criminal matters respectively."
"These agreements were negotiated by the Council Presidency, assisted at all times by the Commission, pursuant to Articles 38 and 24 of the Treaty."
"The extradition agreement does not contain any specific provision that gives the US the right to request the extradition by a Member State of a person having committed a crime in that Member State that is statute-barred by its legislation."
"Member States may, however, invoke grounds for refusal based on matters not covered by the agreement that may be applicable pursuant to bilateral treaties in force between a Member State and the US."
"This is provided for in Article 17 of the extradition agreement between the EU and the US."
"The same criterion applies to your second question; that is, when extradition by a Member State is requested of a person for a crime of which he has already been convicted by that Member State."
"Neither of the two agreements between the EU and the US has yet come into force, with some Member States having stated that they are obliged to abide by national constitutional procedure for such agreements to come into force and that written bilateral instruments are required between each Member State and the US for agreements to apply between the EU and the US."
"These complementary bilateral instruments are currently at the negotiation stage. Once all of the bilateral instruments have been agreed they will have to be ratified by the US Congress."
"Greyhounds raised for racing in Ireland are frequently exported to Spain once they have come to the end of their racing career, where they are treated appallingly and with scant regard for their welfare from the Spanish authorities."
"The Commission will be aware that up until 2002 a certain amount of EU money went towards the funding of greyhound breeding in Ireland."
"As the Commissioner responsible for animal welfare, could the Commission outline what measures are being taken to ensure the welfare of these greyhounds whose breeding was financed partially by the EU?"
"Could the Commission tell us how many of these greyhounds financed by the EU were exported from Ireland to Spain and under what conditions?"
". I thank Mrs McKenna for her question."
"The Commission is very concerned about the welfare of animals and gives it very high priority."
"Community rules exist in respect of animals, including dogs, for their protection during transport."
"Under the protocol on the protection and welfare of animals annexed to the EC Treaty, the Community and Member States must pay full regard to the welfare requirements of animals in formulating and implementing the Community’s agriculture, transport, internal market and research policies, while respecting the legislative or administrative provisions and customs of the Member States relating, in particular, to religious rites, cultural traditions and regional heritage."
"As a consequence of this, the conditions under which dogs such as greyhounds are kept and raced or used for hunting within the Member States are not regulated by Community law."
"These are matters coming solely within the jurisdiction of the Member State concerned."
"As it is the duty of the individual Member States to find a solution to this problem, the Commission can only call upon responsible authorities to eliminate the ill-treatment to which the honourable Member refers."
"In this context it is significant that last year the largest Spanish animal welfare organisation recognised that progress towards improving the welfare of these animals is being achieved, including through the updating of legislation by the autonomous regions."
"In addition, police action has curtailed the cruel methods of killing these dogs at the end of the hunting season."
"While general cruelty to dogs or the use of these animals for racing or hunting comes within the sole competence of the Member States, commercial transport of these animals over distances of more than 50 kilometres falls within the scope of Council Directive 91/628/EEC as amended by Directive 95/29/EC."
"Complaints have been formally brought to the attention of the Irish, Spanish and UK authorities."
"The Irish authorities provided a comprehensive reply on 5 March 2002 outlining the various actions taken to protect greyhounds transported to other Member States and also providing other information on the aspects of greyhound rearing and racing which are outside the scope of Community legislation."
"No basis for infringement proceedings was apparent from the reply from Ireland."
"As far as matters falling within Community competence are concerned, namely the commercial transport of animals, the Spanish authorities indicated that they were not able to trace particular shipments of greyhounds transported from Ireland."
"The Commission continues to make further enquiries."
"The Commission confirms that no Community aid is now available for investment in greyhound rearing or racing."
"While previous operational programmes allowed for aid for investment in greyhound housing and rearing facilities, no Community aid has been paid since 1993."
"As regards non-regulation by Community law, my understanding is that before 2002 a certain amount of EU funding was devoted to greyhound breeding in Ireland once funding for sheep breeding had stopped because there was an over-capacity of sheep."
"If that is the case, the Commission should be concerned about animals whose breeding was partially funded by the EU."
"In Spain the situation has not changed."
"I was talking to someone a few days ago who had been to one of these illegal race tracks in Spain, where they found nine greyhounds from Ireland racing on a course in appalling conditions."
"As regards animals not being traced, I would like the Commission to see if it could look at some sort of strict regulation on greyhound breeding and the export of greyhounds."
"As regards correct identification, a microchip would be very useful in tracing the animal's place of origin."
"The Commission could take an initiative here in passing some sort of law on this, and also making greyhound owners responsible for the animal, not just for the two-and-a-half years in Ireland where the dogs are economically of benefit to the owners, but for the whole of their lives."
"It is unacceptable that these animals are raced to death in places such as Spain and kept in appalling conditions."
"We have to take responsibility for that."
"That is why the Commission must take some sort of initiative to bring in legislation to ensure that this issue is wiped out."
"."
"The honourable Member is perfectly correct: there was funding for this and for the rearing of greyhounds before 1992."
"That ceased, as I said earlier, in 1993 for a number of reasons, partly due to concerns at EU level and in the Commission relating to animal welfare considerations."
"I repeat that this is a competence issue."
"It is not within the competence of the Commission or the European Union to engage in inquiries in Member States relating to issues that are strictly outside the competence of the European Union."
"To seek to try and make a competence for the EU for such an endeavour merely because there was funding prior to 1992 – which has now ceased – is impossible to achieve."
"That means that there is very little that can be done."
"Nonetheless, as I have indicated, in response to enquiries from the Commission, the authorities in both Ireland and Spain, and the major animal welfare organisation in Spain, have indicated that the situation has considerably improved, not least, in Spain, as a result of the introduction of legislation in the areas of the autonomous regions and also because of the greater vigilance of the police authorities in prosecuting infringements."
"For how long has the Commission been aware that the Netherlands is in breach of the EU Plants Directive?"
"What action has the Commission taken, and what future action will it take and when, to ensure compliance without delay?"
"Will the Commission support the principle of compensation for British farmers and growers who have purchased diseased plants and seed from the Netherlands?"
". I thank Mr Bushill-Matthews for his question on this issue."
"The Commission is not aware of specific breaches of the EU Plant Health Directive by the Netherlands."
"Indeed, Council Directive 2000/29/EC, which is the basis of the Community plant health regime, has been fully transposed by the Netherlands."
"I assume that the honourable Member’s question is motivated by the finding of potato ring rot in seed potatoes in Wales, as his question was not directed to any specific issue."
"These potatoes are grown from seeds imported from the Netherlands, as occurred in 2002."
"I can confirm that Directive 93/85/EC on the control of ring rot has also been transposed by the Dutch authorities."
"When notified by the UK authorities of this outbreak, the Commission immediately examined the information supplied by UK with great attention."
"The Commission gave the UK the opportunity to inform other Member States in the latest meetings of the Standing Committee on Plant Health in November and December 2003."
"The origin of the outbreak is, however, still being investigated and it is too early to draw any firm conclusions."
"I would like to underline that the Food and Veterinary Office of the Commission has carried out a series of audit missions in the Member States in recent years in order to clearly assess the situation of potato production in the Community."
"I can assure the honourable Member that the Commission will continue to follow the situation very closely."
"The Commission is at this stage satisfied with the preventive actions taken by the United Kingdom, as a follow-up of the outbreak, as well as with the current investigations launched by both the United Kingdom and the Netherlands in order to identify the possible origins and pathways of the disease."
"Turning to the question on compensation, under existing Community legislation there is a possibility for a financial contribution referred to as 'solidarity' to be granted to Member States."
"It is intended to cover expenditure for the necessary measures to combat organisms harmful to plants introduced from other areas in the Community."
"The Commission has informed the Welsh representation in Brussels of the existence of this contribution and of the practical procedures to follow should it wish to make an application for such compensation."
"Upon receipt of any file, the Commission will verify if Community requirements to grant such a contribution have been met."
"I thank the Commissioner for that very clear answer."
"I would like to extend the question – and my apologies for not making it clear to him earlier – that this is not just about potato ring rot but also about a disease called ramorum dieback or sudden oak death, which was first seen in the EU in the Netherlands in 1997, but has now reached the UK."
"It is found in rhododendrons, camellias and native tree species and, last month, it was found in wild woodland in the UK."
"It is clearly a major problem for our country."
"The biggest exporters of such products are the Dutch plant auctions."
"It has also been alleged that some operators there have been spraying such plants with fungicide in order to mask traces of that particular disease, meaning that the disease shows itself at a later stage."
"I would be grateful if the Commission could look into these allegations, in particular to see whether this breaches the plant health directive, because, clearly, the disease has now crossed the border."
"We wish it to be eradicated where it is and certainly wish too that no other country should suffer as some of our plants and woods are already suffering."
". I would like to assure the honourable Member that I will have my services investigate, and prepare a proper response to, his supplementary question relating to ramorum dieback."
"I will then write to him in due course."
"The Commission will be aware of the importance of surveillance and networking in the areas of cancer, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS, EU funding for which is due to come to an end with the changes in the Health Action Programme."
"There will, therefore, be a gap where tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS are concerned until the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control is established in 2005, and an unquantifiable gap where cancer is concerned."
"What steps has the Commission been able to take to ensure there are no gaps in the surveillance of these important disease areas?"
". Let me first say that surveillance of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and cancer are important health issues for the Community as a whole, and remain important priorities for me."
"However, the responsibility for such surveillance – for cancer screening tests – rests with the Member States."
"The Community’s role is to provide the appropriate framework for coordination of these activities, to facilitate the sharing and spread of good practice and to promote the development of common methodologies and procedures."
"To this end, the Commission provides funding for the setting-up of networks that deliver standardised methods of collection and processing of information on diseases such as AIDS, TB and cancer at Community level."
"Once networks have been developed in this way, their participating structures should be in a position to continue routine network activities."
"The Community should concentrate on the development of networking and the Commission will continue to do so, within the present budgetary possibilities, until the proposed European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control is established."
"The Member States must provide the resources to ensure that surveillance activities are properly pursued in their territory."
"The Commission will continue to promote cooperation and coordination between the Member States through the Communicable Diseases Network."
"The funding decisions referred to by the honourable Member will not therefore lead to a gap in surveillance."
"This is not to say that the Community is not contributing to actions on cancer, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS."
"We are already funding 15 projects on AIDS, amounting to a total contribution of over EUR 4.2 million."
"We also plan to support a project under the 2003 budget to strengthen coordination of surveillance of infections in the northern region, including HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis."
"This will include Russia, Ukraine and Belarus – all areas with worrying infection rates for HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis, and areas where improved surveillance must be a high priority, especially in the context of enlargement."
"On cancer, we plan to fund three projects from the 2003 budget, two on smoking prevention and one on cancer information, to a total of about EUR 4.4 million."
"This is on top of the massive investment that has been made over the last 15 years in cancer prevention, which has already helped to make cancer epidemiology one of the most developed areas of health statistics."
"There were many valuable proposals made for the public health programme in 2003, which the budget available did not allow us to fund."
"I understand the problems faced by those that have been involved in the surveillance networks, the development of which the Commission has financed since 1996."
"The Commission has taken several steps to improve the situation."
"First, we have mobilised experts to provide advice on funding priorities for disease surveillance under the work plan for 2004 and for future funding rounds under the public health programme."
"Secondly, we have disseminated guidance on projects concerning disease-specific surveillance networks to enhance quality and their potential for funding."
"Thirdly, we are giving urgent consideration to the possibilities this year under other funding mechanisms, including under the research programme, for data compilation and processing on HIV/AIDS and TB, as well as on cancer screening."
"We should also remember that the 2003 budget is not the end of the story."
"Future work plans under the public health programme, starting with that of 2004, will have the scope and potential to finance projects on cancer, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS."
"The importance of ensuring continuity of support for key networks in the field of communicable diseases until the proposed European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control is established will be particularly stressed."
"My services are working to ensure that this will be reflected in future funding rounds."
"I hope that this provision, together with the many projects I have described and the coordination of surveillance activities we continue to provide will respond to the question put by the honourable Member."
"Like the Commissioner I think surveillance of these diseases is fundamentally important and that is why I am concerned that there should not be a gap."
"As rapporteur for the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, I know we are not going to have this up and running before 2005 at the most optimistic estimate, so it is the gap between now and then that I am concerned about."
"Of course, the centre will not deal with cancer as it is not a communicable disease."
"It will deal with the other two mentioned."
"I know the Commissioner has been looking for solutions to cancer, because he has discussed that with our committee in the past."
"Nevertheless, I ask him to look very carefully at the organisations who have been doing the surveillance – particularly on tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS – and see how they can be supported over the coming two years."
"We are faced with a double problem in this area: one, as the Commissioner mentioned, is the exponential rise in cases in Eastern Europe, and the second is the fearsome rise we are now seeing, here and across the Atlantic, in a number of newly-diagnosed cases which are multi-drug resistant."
"Potentially, there is thus a dual crisis attacking us from both sides."
". As I indicated earlier to Mr Bowis, I am aware of these concerns and can only stress that responsibility for this entire issue rests with Member States."
"We keep a close watch on this, using monitoring and surveillance mechanisms."
"It will be the sort of issue to which I will be turning my mind during the upcoming discussions on this year's budget over the coming weeks, or perhaps months."
"In November 2003 Spain was forced to halt imports of fresh citrus fruits from Argentina and Brazil after detecting the presence of diseases which could severely damage Community production, including 'citric canker', which is the most harmful organism for Spanish citrus cultivation."
"Spain took emergency measures to prevent the spread of the bacterium concerned, 'xanthomonas campestris (axonopodis) pv. citri', and of two other fungi, 'guignardia citricarpa' and 'Elsinoe spp.'."
"Will the Commission take any precautionary measures with a view to the coming marketing year for citrus fruits from the countries of the Southern Cone in order to protect Community territory from the possible introduction of these organisms, also bearing in mind that this year 'citric canker' was found in Spain for the first time?"
". The Commission fully shares the concern of the honourable Member as regards the threat to the Community citrus crop caused by the harmful organisms intercepted by Spain."
"Following the notification by Spain of the preventive measures it has taken against citrus fruits originating in Argentina and Brazil, and in accordance with the relevant provisions laid down in the Community plant health regime, the Commission initiated discussions on the issue in the meeting of the Standing Committee on Plant Health on 11 and 12 December 2003."
"In the meantime, the Commission has also urgently requested from Argentina and Brazil additional technical information in respect of the situation faced by Spain, and about which the Commission fully shares its concern."
"The Commission and the Member States agreed to review the position at the next meeting of the Standing Committee on 22 January 2004."
"The Commission will then consider any action ensuring that organisms harmful to citrus fruits – like citrus canker, from which the Community is free – are not introduced into and spread within the Community."
"The Commission expects to achieve a satisfactory solution before the next import campaign."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his reply."
"The question I asked was very clear; the Commission’s reply as well."
"The facts are absolutely clear and I am in agreement with the Commission in relation to them."
"The diagnosis is not under discussion; what we are discussing now is the therapy required."
"I am pleased that measures should be taken on 22 January, and I would like to know what type of measures the Commission has planned, because at the moment it is not a question of discussing, but rather it is a question – as in Lenin’s famous tract – of what to do."
"What to do and to do it as soon as possible, because the introduction of a disease of this sort could have harmful consequences which are very difficult to put right if they are not tackled in time."
"Commissioner, I would like to know what the Commission is going to propose at the meeting which is going to take place on 22 and 23 January: the specific measures it is going to propose."
"I would like to know the specific analysis of the specific reality."
". As you know, a number of measures are available under European law to deal with such situations."
"I do not want to pre-empt the outcome of the discussions that will take place on 22 January, but there are a number of measures, including temporary emergency measures, applicable to the next import campaign."
"I am sure you are aware of the kinds of measures that are available."
"They are quite powerful, it is within the competence of Community law to impose them, and these are the kinds of issues that will be considered in the event that the discussion discloses a need to put these measures in place."
"That is as far as I can go at this stage;"
"I would rather not pre-empt those discussions."
". We are aware of the threat to the environment and to consumer health that obsolete pesticides constitute in Ukraine and aware, too, of the magnitude of the challenge that their elimination poses to that country."
"Ukraine has taken a positive step concerning the elimination of some of the obsolete pesticides, in particular those that are persistent organic pollutants, by signing the Stockholm Convention regarding the elimination and reduction of those pollutants."
"The ratification of the Convention is still pending."
"The Commission urges Ukraine to ratify the Convention and to cooperate with the international community to work on this difficult problem."
"Responsibility for dealing with obsolete pesticides is primarily for the country itself."
"While the Commission is prepared to assist Ukraine to the extent possible – and I should just note that our assistance to Ukraine amounts to EUR 126 million a year – current EU assistance programmes do not provide funding for the elimination of obsolete pesticides in Ukraine."
"In fact, environmental issues have not been selected by the Government of Ukraine as a key cooperation area with the European Union."
"However, Tacis small project programmes could accommodate project proposals linked to the elimination of obsolete pesticides."
"Taking into account the amount of pesticides to be eliminated, an EU contribution could only partially alleviate the vast problem."
"As a signatory to the Stockholm Convention, Ukraine is eligible for funding from the interim Global Environmental Facility, which is the financing mechanism of the Convention."
"We have been and continue to be very active in dealing with the consequences of Chernobyl and other environmental disasters, but I should like to ask the Commissioner what more we can do in order to prevent another environmental disaster occurring when something goes wrong with pesticides."
"Could he approach the Ukraine authorities on these issues, since we shall be raising them in Parliament at the next meeting of the EU-Ukraine Parliamentary Cooperation Committee that is to take place next month?"
"What more can he do in terms of contacting the Ukraine Government and looking again at how the Tacis Programme can contribute to that?"
"After the Chernobyl experience we have to prompt Ukraine to do something."
"The Commissioner knows as well as I do how that country functions."
"This will not be its top priority."
"We must tell Ukraine that dealing with these kinds of methods is a top priority for the EU."
"I totally agree with the honourable Member that obsolete pesticides are a real and serious problem, not just in Ukraine; they are a common problem in all too many post-Soviet regions, as well as in some acceding and candidate countries."
"The estimate is that in Ukraine there are perhaps up to 20 000 tonnes of these pesticides in 5000 locations and, as the honourable Member knows, they can affect human health because of the contamination of groundwaters, soil, food and even air."
"The honourable Member mentioned Chernobyl: I was there recently."
"We have dedicated a lot of time and a great deal of money to that extraordinarily difficult and dangerous environmental issue."
"There we are working with the government of Ukraine, which wishes to take that as a priority."
"It has not been easy even in those circumstances."
"What is more difficult for us, is to insist on our priorities through a programme such as Tacis, in which the partner country is supposed to take ownership of the programme we are helping to support."
"I can assure the honourable Member that we will continue to raise this issue and other environmental issues in the relevant subcommittee of the partnership and cooperation agreement."
"We will raise this issue during those meetings and if the government in Ukraine says it would like us to focus some of our spending on this issue, we would be delighted to look at that."
"But the figures involved are very substantial."
"It is reckoned that it would cost at least EUR 100 million for the elimination of the problem I described earlier, and that is why, in our judgment, it is probably more helpful to turn to the global environmental facility in order to secure an objective which the honourable Member is quite right to highlight."
"– I should like to thank the Commissioner for his clarification."
"I too know that it is a problem at the level of the Ukrainian Government, but there are also political forces in the Ukraine that are very clearly facing up to this problem at the moment; they are on the side of the European Parliament, which has stated that this problem must be solved."
"I should like to ask the Commissioner whether he is prepared to give encouragement to those forces in the Ukraine that are currently not in government but may be in future, and help them to look for a solution to this extremely difficult and extremely dangerous problem in the Ukraine."
". The honourable Member is entirely right to say that the issue we are discussing is of considerable concern to many groups in Ukraine, and many of the environmental NGOs which have begun to be active."
"The issue in which he has taken a particular interest – water contamination – has been of considerable concern to many people."
"I can only repeat that we will raise this issue with the Ukrainian authorities."
"We will be willing, if they wish, to consider ways in which we could assist through the Tacis programme."
"However, the need for funds for the overall elimination of pesticides in Ukraine is beyond the present budgetary resources of the European Union, though we can encourage Ukraine to turn to other possible financing sources in order to deal with what is a horrendously difficult problem."
"As the author is not present, Question No 24 lapses."
"How would the Commission respond to concerns about the need to reconcile the objectives of CFSP with supporting development cooperation objectives on poverty eradication?"
". The debate about development issues and security does not result in a single choice about doing either one thing or the other."
"One of the key challenges faced by the European Union is to make better use of all the resources at our disposal in the external relations field."
"This was recognised as one of the major tasks of the European Convention."
"The goal of ensuring greater coherence implies a seamless and coordinated use of the common foreign and security policy and of all other external relations instruments, including the annual Community budget for external actions of approximately EUR 10 billion, of which EUR 6 billion is official development assistance."
"We recognised long ago that development policy and other cooperation programmes provide the most powerful instruments at the Community's disposal for treating the root causes of conflict."
"That is a fact that has been reflected in the recently adopted European Union security strategy."
"The logic is simple, the logic is straightforward: one of the underlying causes of the disastrous conditions in which people in Afghanistan and southern Sudan live, for example, is conflict."
"If we are serious about tackling poverty then we must tackle conflict."
"There is no development without peace."
"That is why, at the request of our African partners, my colleague Mr Nielson and I have recently presented an ambitious proposal for an African peace facility to the tune of about EUR 250 million to support the African Union in its efforts to contribute to peace keeping."
"You might expect a bit of an old hand in development like me – as you are yourself – to be somewhat sceptical about the possibilities that we can deal with, in particular the coherence issues related to development, foreign policy and other policy areas such as agriculture and trade in the European Union."
"So there are still outstanding issues."
"You mentioned the peace facility, which, as an initiative from the European Union, we of course welcome very much indeed, but it is my understanding that certain Member States of the Union are suggesting that funding should go through regional and subregional organisations such as ECOWAS, and I wondered whether you would agree with me that our view should be shared with the African heads of states, who say that finance, organisation, management and decision-making should come through the African Union itself and not be devolved to various other regional organisations?"
"Finally, how would you assess the implications of the failure of the IGC on the proposal – of which you have been very much in favour – related to the creation of a European Foreign Minister to manage some of these issues?"
". Firstly, on the specific point of the peace facility, at a time when we are trying to support and sustain institutionalised African solidarity, it would be quite curious for us not to try to give the maximum support to the institutions of the African Union."
"Therefore I agree with honourable Member on that."
"Secondly, on the question of overall coherence, conceivably, things have changed since I was a British development minister many years ago."
"But I must say that I find that there is more coherence in the Community's programmes than there was when I was a British minister."
"That does not mean that we are perfect: we still have a long way to go, not least in relation to the overall field of external actions."
"I am not just talking about CFSP and official development assistance."
"I hope in the next Commission that there will be two former development ministers doing the job that Mr Nielson and I are currently doing – it would be a help."
"As far as the question of a foreign minister is concerned and the temporary abeyance of the moves towards creating one following the Convention, I still believe that if this person – woman or man – is to emerge in the next few years from the IGC, it is absolutely imperative that we draw on the strengths provided by both the Council and the Commission."
"It does not make very much sense to have a foreign minister who is somehow cauterised from the Commission on the ridiculous argument that her/his activities may be polluted by too much contact with the Commission."
"It is perfectly possible to retain the integrity of the Common Foreign and Security Policy, and the relationship with the Council and Member States while, at the same time, drawing on all the competences for which the Commission is responsible and which, taken together, should give us a real possibility to shape an external actions strategy which meets the demand of the 21st century."
"Foreign and security policy is no longer – if it ever was – the sort of agenda which is simply decided in the chancelleries of European capitals."
"Foreign and security policy, development policy, trade policy, agriculture policy and external policy in the justice and home affairs fields, are all relevant to Europe's impact on the rest of the world and the real positive contribution we can make there."
"– Mr President, how does the Commissioner rate the talks that began yesterday between the United States and Latin America? Will they strengthen or weaken the Community objectives referred to in Mrs Kinnock’s question, and what is the EU’s response to the US initiative?"
". I will be in a better position to answer that question after the meetings to be held in April as part of the ASEM process."
"In April, following the informal Foreign Ministers' meeting at Tullamore in Ireland, we have meetings with our Asian partners in ASEM."
"We also have meetings with the Indonesians and other partner countries."
"I hope they will underline the importance of our partnership."
"Europe is the biggest provider of development assistance and the biggest trading partner in many Asian countries, and it is certainly the biggest provider of external financial investment in most Asian countries."
"I am not convinced that our political impact in those countries is as great as our economic impact and I hope we can change that."
"We have done a great deal to enhance our relationship with China."
"I am keen that we should do the same with India, and I hope that later this year we will be able to produce a strategy document on our relationship with that country."
"We have already produced a strategy document on our relationship with south-east Asia."
"We are starting to move things forward and we have been helped in that by the Parliament, which has supported our opening of five new Commission delegations around Asian countries."
"On 9 December 2003, the Commission and Syria reached an accord on an Association Agreement between Syria and the EU modelled on the agreements with the other Mediterranean partnerships, including a political chapter, an economic and financial chapter, and a social and cultural chapter."
"In the Commission's view, what prospects does the agreement hold out for the two parties?"
"Does the Commission believe that the signing of this agreement in the near future will facilitate regional integration, the creation of a positive climate in which to resolve the political problem of the Arab-Israeli conflict and the democratisation of Syria?"
"What is its view of the diametrically opposed positions of the USA which saw Congress and President Bush (only a few days ago) pass a law which provides for economic and diplomatic sanctions and restrictions on Syria, and does the Commission sympathise with the reasons adduced by the USA for adopting this policy against Syria?"
". The agreement which we have been discussing with our Syrian colleagues but which has not yet been initialled would, in my judgment, provide a solid platform for economic and political reform in Syria."
"The dismantlement of tariffs and the opening of markets will be an important incentive for Syria to undertake legal and institutional reforms."
"The agreement would also help Syria to integrate into the world economy and could be a stepping stone towards other initiatives, such as Syrian membership of the World Trade Organization."
"The provisions on the respect for human rights, on non-proliferation and on cooperation against terrorism would, I trust, strengthen our ability to engage with Syria on these issues."
"As regards the facilitation of regional integration, the agreement would complete the network of Euro-Mediterranean association agreements with our Mediterranean partners."
"It constitutes the final step for the Euro-Mediterranean Free Trade Area envisaged by the Barcelona Declaration."
"We should now continue working together to ensure trade liberalisation between the Mediterranean partner countries themselves."
"The agreement would be the most important element in our policy of constructive engagement with Syria."
"It is our belief that the agreement should strengthen the incentives for reform in Syria, both by creating a more open economy and society and by establishing a political dialogue on issues such as respect for democratic principles and human rights."
"I believe that the United States shares our fundamental objective of integrating Syria into the international community as a country that abides by international law and cooperates, we hope, on non-proliferation and against terrorism."
"The association agreement should be seen as a framework for a long-term engagement with Syria in this respect."
"Commissioner, thank you very much for referring to the objectives and the procedure for achieving the cooperation agreement with Syria."
"However, I wanted to ask you to clarify the last part of my question: do you share the opinions expressed by the United States on relations with Syria and its role in the region and in achieving peace."
"The methodology followed by the European Union is different from that followed by the United States. It may be that the objective is the same within the more general framework, but that the methodology differs."
"Do you share the fears which the United States have specifically expressed?"
"Do these fears have any bearing on the policy of the European Union?"
". I noted that when the American Secretary of State, Mr Colin Powell, whom I much respect and admire, was undertaking his hearings in Congress before he was confirmed as Secretary of State, he made a powerful case – I may not be using exactly the same words he used, but similar ones – against knee-jerk sanctions and against always trying to secure one's political objectives by cutting people off through sanctions."
"He has always been a powerful exponent of constructive and hard-headed engagement."
"I am not saying that he would necessarily agree with us on Syria, but I think that is what we have been trying to do on Syria just as we have been trying to do it on Iran."
"It does not mean that we are simple-witted; it does not mean that there is not a spine to what we are trying to do, but, provided people will engage with us on issues like human rights, terrorism, weapons of mass destruction and trade liberalisation, then we should be prepared to hold out a hand and try to encourage them."
"We have had a series of extremely useful negotiations with Syria over the past few months."
"The Commission has put a great deal of energy and effort into this process, as have the Syrians."
"The Syrians, on issues like tariff dismantling, have moved further and faster in the last few months than most of us thought possible."
"I negotiated, or virtually negotiated, the clause on human rights when I was in Damascus a few months ago, and my excellent officials have been carrying through the negotiations on other things, including weapons of mass destruction."
"Now the proposals that we discussed with the Syrians the Council are being discussed by the Council."
"The Council will have to decide whether we should go back to the Syrians and try to secure more from them than we have done so far."
"I have no doubt that if we can come off with a strong and sensible agreement with Syria – the last piece in the jigsaw puzzle of our Euro-Mediterranean partnership – then everybody will benefit from that: everybody who wants to see a more prosperous future in the region, everybody who wants to avoid a clash of civilisations between the European, North American and Islamic worlds and everybody who wants to see terrorism and insecurity tackled in the most effective and sustainable way."
"Commissioner, the word 'hope' appeared several times in your initial response."
"There seemed to be a certain amount of 'hope' rather than 'expectation'."
"Could you give your estimation as to what you think we can get from Syria as regards its relationship with Lebanon as well as its occupation of that country and its support for Hizbollah?"
". It is fair to say that as part of the negotiations we have had with Syria, we have had an increasingly frank and comprehensive dialogue on regional political issues."
"That includes the situations in southern Lebanon, Palestine and Israel, and the situation on the Golan Heights."
"I expressed hope because – and I hope I am not entirely fatuous in my geo-strategic observations – we want to see more movement from Syria on a number of issues."
"I much prefer talking and trying to secure agreement, to reading what the Syrians' positions are in the newspapers."
"So when I say 'hope', it is a small and fragile word."
"Perhaps it carries too much baggage, but before I leave the European Commission I would very much like to see the signing of an agreement with the Syrians."
"As the time allotted to questions to the Commission has elapsed, Questions Nos 27 to 47 will be replied to in writing.(2)"
"That concludes Question Time to the Commission"
"Madam President, like everyone else, I too can endorse the package that has been assembled as a compromise. I thank the rapporteur for the work he has done on this."
"The process for reaching a compromise has been very useful and speedy. However, like so many others, I endorse it with some reservations."
"Over the last few years we have seen, at least in Western Europe, the levels of phosphate in drinking water fall by between 50% and 80%. It has dropped steadily since the 1980s."
"We are going to see them applied over a wider area, from Limerick – which Mrs Doyle knows very well – to new places such as Latvia, Nicosia and other parts of Central and Eastern Europe. We can expect that all the rivers that drain into the Baltic and the North Sea will become cleaner."
"These new measures, in terms of labelling of detergents and ensuring that they break down into safe components when they are discharged in the water, are not quite enough. This issue could quite simply be resolved and in many ways improved by the removal of phosphates from our laundry wash."
"This is something that we have not managed to do in this proposal. I believe that it is something that Parliament would like to see happen and something which we feel the Commission still has to address."
"Something not mentioned by other colleagues is the continued use of animal tests to assess detergents. The practice cannot be accepted for much longer."
"The Commission must set out a clear timescale for the development of replacement tests. It is long overdue."
"The Commission appears to have missed its chance yet again. Nevertheless I, like everyone else, will support the compromise tomorrow."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as I stated during the debate on first reading, I believe that the regulation before us represents progress, especially for producers, consumers and in terms of environmental protection."
"We are indeed moving towards the welcome modernisation of the legal framework concerning monitoring the biodegradability of detergents, which dates back to the early 1970s."
"Please allow me, however, to register my disappointment as regards two points that I consider to be especially relevant and sensitive."
"My first point is about the need to harmonise legislation on additional labelling, especially the banning of images likely to increase the risk of detergents being ingested, such as images of fruit or other food products."
"These images are particularly dangerous for children, because their eye-catching nature increases the risk of children ingesting them."
"The system currently in force only bans dangerous substances and preparations, which is clearly inadequate. I therefore suggest that we go further to protect consumers, especially the most vulnerable."
"Furthermore, I should like to express my incomprehension at the imposition in the regulation of national, non-harmonised testing methods, without any timetable for their publication being built into the regulation."
"I feel that in all of these aspects the solutions we have found are far from ideal."
"We must remember that fertilisers are a very important source of phosphates: about 50% come from fertilisers."
"The use of phosphates in detergents is effectively banned by means of national legislation or voluntary agreements in Member States that have deemed such measures necessary. National measures currently exist in the majority of Member States and, in some cases, they have been in place for many years."
"The Scientific Committee found that the consultants' report on phosphates was seriously lacking in some respects – for example concerning the impact of alternatives – and it is has identified a number of other areas for which data is still lacking. I want to assure you that the Commission is fully committed to filling these data gaps as rapidly as possible and to proposing whatever measures may be justified on that basis."
"In Africa, more than 4 million AIDS sufferers are in desperate need of treatment and only 50 000 people have access to it. Moreover, AIDS is not the only scourge overwhelming the countries of the South: tuberculosis is on the increase and kills 2 million people every year; malaria is responsible for between 1 and 2 million deaths every year and affects between 300 and 500 million people."
"In fact, we have the means to cure these diseases or to significantly reduce the death rate."
"But the treatment is expensive, too expensive for countries that can only afford to spend derisory sums on their health services, with the result that medicines are for the North and coffins for the South."
"Fortunately, things are starting to change."
"Much progress was made in 2003, giving cause for a glimmer of hope: the WHO initiative to provide treatment for 3 million sufferers by 2005; the agreement reached on 30 August 2003 in Geneva by the members of the WHO; the decision of the South African Government to launch a national treatment programme; the efforts to bring down the price of antiretroviral drugs on the world market and the programme of clinical trials in a partnership between Europe and the developing countries, with a budget of EUR 600 million."
"These initiatives are very encouraging, but they are still far from being enough. The Union itself is being slow to deliver on its financial promises and the Sandbæk report is a timely reminder to the European Union to firm up its commitments, setting it a target that is appropriate to what is at stake."
"It reminds us that the absolute priority has to be access to medicines for all sufferers, in accordance with the Doha Declaration."
"The existence of patents should not therefore constitute a barrier to the manufacture or purchase of vital medicines."
"Furthermore, the report forcibly underlines the fact that the prevention and treatment of transmissible diseases are the concern of everyone, because they constitute a global public good. It sets an ambitious target for the financial contribution of the European Union and its Member States, a target of a billion euros a year."
"Madam President, the battle against AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis has for a long time been one of the principal concerns of the Greens."
"Moreover we welcome the consensus that now prevails regarding this report, which would not have been possible four years ago."
"It is disquieting to learn that deaths are still being counted in millions, particularly if one takes into account the fact that these diseases affect many children or pregnant women. It is sad and devastating to learn that these diseases are still killing even though treatments exist."
"The accessibility of medicines must be guaranteed. It is necessary to facilitate not only a mere reduction in prices, but also the assignment of patents, because that is necessary in order to enable developing countries to produce these products for their people, or import them at low prices."
"The efforts on which we agree must be targeted first and foremost at children and pregnant women."
"Real assistance must be provided for women, who carry within them the future of the continent. This assistance includes, in addition to treatments, information about these infections, and in that respect it is necessary to strengthen the health structures in these countries."
"The adoption of this report will confirm the European Union’s involvement in the struggle for the health of Africa."
"Madam President, when I wrote my report on HIV/AIDS two years ago, I was not sure what the outcome would be. However, I am delighted that the EU, the Commission and this Parliament have done quite a lot, as many speakers, including the Commissioner, have said."
"However, I want you to focus on an African woman who is suffering and dying from HIV/AIDS, TB or malaria. If she were to watch CNN what does she see and hear?"
"She sees the conflicts in Iraq, Congo, Afghanistan, Burundi, Zambia, Zimbabwe and so on. She sees loss of life, billions of euro wasted, including the EUR 75 billion that President Bush has pledged for Iraq's reconstruction."
"This is essential, but it is a lot of money in relation to the US commitment of EUR 15 billion over 5 years for HIV/AIDS, of which 10 000 people are dying every day."
"So, this lady sees terrorism in Istanbul, New York and Saudi Arabia. She sees a natural disaster in Iran – 20 000 people dead, a town flattened – and she says to herself 'I have TB, and yet I do not have ten dollars or ten euro to cure it."
"How does she feel when she sees all these billions of euro that we spend to renovate buildings that have been destroyed and which are then destroyed again? The pledges – which are very worthy indeed – for the reconstruction of Iraq made by countries like the United States amount to EUR 75 billion."
"What is their contribution to the fight against HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria? That is where the European Union has been tremendous, very generous and is showing the way for the rest of the world."
"I also look to the oil-rich countries. What are they doing?"
"If we are to address this issue we have to be serious and put it into context, because the people who are suffering are poor, sick, oppressed, not free to work and live in harsh conditions."
"They have no water or electricity, they have no tools to till their land, and nor are they near the sea. What chance do they have?"
"That is why it is important to EU aid and to go back to the basics of life such as water and access to energy, because these people are already spending their whole day looking for water and firewood to cook their next meal."
"I know the Commissioner is committed. He is brilliant."
"I know this Parliament is behind him. Let us go for it and make sure that this year and beyond we can achieve what we set out to do."
"I should like to focus on the EU contribution to the Global Health Fund. Two amendments have been tabled to make it clear that we are talking about the EUR 1 billion from both the EU and the Member States."
"I am pleased that Mrs Sandbæk will accept that amendment. President Prodi has supported this target."
"It sounds like a lot of money, especially at a time when public finances are tight, but it is not unrealistic. In fact, it is about one third of the increase announced this year for the farm budget in the EU, so it is not unthinkable that we can achieve this amount."
"Mr Khanbhai asked what the woman who had these illnesses would think."
"What would she have thought, turning on her television last week, to see President Bush announcing a multi-billion-dollar space programme of truly astronomical amounts?"
"It is about time that we resolved the problems in this world before flying off in search of others."
"Madam President, NEPAD and its implementation agency, the African Union, offer, as all of us would agree, no quick fix for the problems of Africa."
"Fulfilling the promises will not be easy and Africa and, indeed, outsiders such as ourselves, will have to be in this for the long haul."
"As the report points out, NEPAD was initially and consistently intellectually scarred by inadequate consultation, particularly at grassroots level – it was leader-led. We hope that we will ensure that, as far as the African Union in its future work is concerned, there will be far more consultation at grassroots level with civil society."
"As the Commissioner said, we now move on to working with the African Union, which will now be given the task of working through the policies and implementing them."
"How will the Commission support efforts to build the kind of coherence that will be necessary now between NEPAD and the AU's strategy?"
"Is it of concern for instance that the peer group review mechanism is somehow now being increasingly institutionalised and separated off as a kind of separate secretariat?"
"Should this not be of some concern to us?"
"The Commissioner talked quite rightly about the importance of the peace facility."
"Does the Commission intend to offer commensurate funds for the other work – the self-led development work – of the AU on democracy, human rights and good governance?"
"Will we be offering similar support for that work, which has to go hand in hand with the work that will need to take place on conflict resolution and peace-building?"
"As the report says, it is important that the AU is the legitimate political and mandated institution at this stage."
"Peace and governance cannot be dealt with through declarations such as NEPAD."
"What we need now, as the last speaker said, is much better focus and action."
"– Madam President, I would like to start by thanking Mr Bébéar for producing this excellent own-initiative report."
"The New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) is an ambitious programme, and we should congratulate our African partners on it, for it is indeed a programme developed by Africans for Africans."
"This concept has now been in existence for more than two years, and following the successful establishment of the African Union and the scheduling of the first session of the Pan-African Parliament for the third week in March, the time has come for the proposed mechanisms to be put in effect."
"I would like to focus especially on the African Peer Review Mechanism and explore this in more detail."
"Yet I have the impression that some of its architects are a little scared by their own courage."
"The Commissioner has just mentioned the heroes of NEPAD, but they must be the cowards of NEPAD, for adopting principles such as good governance and human rights means implementing them as well – and implementation means effective control and evaluation of the commitments undertaken."
"We should be targeting our support specifically to those who are genuinely improving their standards and are complying with the mechanism in practice. This is the only way to ensure that we treat Africa individually and not as an entity, which was the Commissioner’s complaint earlier."
"Madam President, we have heard some fine words this evening, but let us recall that the New Partnership for Africa's Development – NEPAD – was a bargain."
"On the one hand the developed countries undertook to provide billions of dollars in new resources, but, for their part, the African governments committed themselves to good governance, democracy and human rights and the rule of law."
"One fact is certain: without good governance in Africa, increased aid will be of only marginal value."
"I note the Commission's estimate, quoted by Mr Bébéar, that illegally acquired funds deposited in mostly foreign banks amount to more than half of African's external debt. I wonder what proportion of this stolen money belongs to Mr Mugabe and his associates."
"After all, it is Mr Mugabe and his ZANU-PF cronies who have systematically pillaged and brutalised the once prosperous country of Zimbabwe, brought lawlessness and starvation on its people and forced so many of them to live in fear and desperation. I hear of terrible new cases every day."
"Unfortunately, many of Zimbabwe's neighbours not only have encouraged the Mugabe regime, but also have allowed Mugabe to dictate the terms of Africa's relationship with us."
"Conditions in Zimbabwe are now spiralling out of control."
"This House has called for effective action by the Council on six separate occasions."
"To date, the Council has failed to heed these calls."
"On Thursday we shall insist yet again that we want effective action now! This means not just the renewal of the EU's targeted sanctions when they expire on 18 February, but also the introduction of tough new measures."
"South Africa, in particular, needs to exercise some real moral and political leadership. After all, South Africa is specifically responsible for the good governance aspects of NEPAD."
"I implore the African Union and the African countries to use all the resources at their disposal to persuade Mugabe and his clique to step aside. We need to set the people of Zimbabwe free."
"There is a great deal one could say about cultural diversity and its importance. This debate does not give us sufficient time."
"It is significant that we should be discussing this subject at 11.50 p.m., Harold Macmillan – the British Prime Minister and grandfather of a current Member here – who, over forty years ago, applied for British membership of the European Union, said that when discussing those things that are precious to a people, you do not sell the family silver."
"That clearly applies to cultural values."
"The rapporteur is therefore correct to state that cultural products and services should not conform to the normal free market of commercial and trade options."
"Can we trust our governments to preserve our national, European and regional cultures?"
"In my own country where, one might say, foreign languages are no longer taught, where history has become simply a background to current affairs and where Shakespeare is apparently too difficult for English students, those who say 'Yes, we may trust our governments to conserve our cultures' would perhaps be foolish."
"The proposals that this should be agreed at international level are correct, but we should also address ourselves directly to our own peoples and our own students."
"We have a great deal to fear from internationalisation, particularly of the television media."
"I hope that Parliament will continue to make positive proposals which are accepted both by the Commission and the Council, but I await a specific reply from the Commissioner on the point I raised initially."
"Madam President, I would like firstly, of course, to congratulate the rapporteur on her initiative, and also congratulate the Commissioner on her speech – and I have taken the liberty of taking some notes on her speech, which I will quote from her when talking about cultural diversity on other occasions."
"I am speaking in this Chamber as a Spaniard, as a member of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and as a Basque."
"I come from a country in which we have our own language, a native language in addition to Castilian, which is Basque, and which has a culture that goes back millennia, as does our language."
"I agree with the rapporteur on the importance of preserving linguistic diversity."
"I also agree that we must monitor the treatment of minority languages, including autochthonous languages."
"In an increasingly united Europe, in an increasingly globalised world, we must pay special attention to cultural diversity."
"The wealth of Europe – and what differentiates us from other regions of the world, as the Commissioner has said – undoubtedly lies in our cultural diversity, and we must try to export that model."
"We must prevent the Union from becoming a means for standardisation, and I would like to point out that the preamble to the draft Constitution spoke of a ‘Europe united in diversity’."
"Nevertheless, we must prevent the appropriation of cultural and linguistic diversity for political purposes."
"We must not accept the idea that the defence of language or culture, which belongs to all of us, can be used as a political weapon, a missile, or even a means for possible discrimination or division between us."
"Neither language nor the defence of language can be a reason for discrimination."
"Let us remember that this aspect is taken up in the draft Constitution."
"We must respect cultural and linguistic diversity, it is true, but we must not impose it."
"Respect for diversity also consists of respecting those people who speak another language."
"Euskera must be preserved in the Basque Country, without question, but we must not impose it or discriminate against those who do not speak it."
"Certain nationalist parties who have tried to use language as a political tool have moved on from racial nationalism to linguistic nationalism."
"I believe that culture is the inheritance of all of us, we must all defend it and nobody must appropriate it for themselves."
"Please allow me to end by quoting from the preamble to the Constitution which reads, ‘while remaining proud of their own national identities and history, the peoples of Europe are determined to transcend their ancient divisions and, united ever more closely, to forge a common destiny’."

"The next item is the Council statement on the programme of the Irish presidency."
"For reasons which I know you will understand, I am especially pleased today to be able to give the floor to An Taoiseach, Mr Ahern, on behalf of the Council."
"Mr President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, it is both an honour and a pleasure to be here today to present to you the priorities for the Irish presidency."
"Before I make this presentation, may I thank you for the reception you gave the President of Ireland, Mrs Mary McAleese, during her visit last November."
"Your warm welcome to her was greatly appreciated in Ireland."
"We have chosen 'Europeans – Working Together' as the theme of our presidency."
"It is a theme which captures a vision of the people of the European Union working as a partnership, striving together to achieve our common goals and objectives."
"We need the cooperation of everybody to achieve our ambitions."
"I know that I can count on the Members of the European Parliament to work with us during our term for the greater good of the European Union."
"This is Ireland’s sixth presidency."
"We are taking on our task at an historic and challenging time, but we have prepared well for what lies ahead."
"The overriding objective of our presidency is to secure outcomes which have a positive impact on the lives of Europe’s people."
"Like every presidency, we aim to write another chapter in the success story that is the European Union."
"This task deserves our full attention and we each have a part to play."
"Parliament is unique among the institutions in having a direct mandate from the people."
"It is central to an effective Union which is successful and which delivers."
"It goes without saying that a good relationship between the Council and Parliament is vital to the Union’s success."
"The elections in June mean that the time in which we can work together will be shorter than usual."
"As a presidency, therefore, we are totally committed to working intensively with Parliament at all levels so that our interaction is as constructive and productive as it can be."
"President Pat Cox – of whose leadership of Parliament we in Ireland are enormously proud – has assured me that you stand ready to play your full part."
"There is important work to be done."
"As Europeans working together, we must ensure that the Union can take advantage of the global economic recovery."
"We must create an environment which fosters more and better jobs for our people."
"We must take the measures necessary to allow our citizens to live and move freely throughout the European Union in safety and security."
"And we must ensure that the Union can play a positive and constructive role in the world."
"The Irish presidency is the first to see the full implementation of the Seville European Council decisions aimed at ensuring a more coherent and strategic approach to our work."
"Our programme is, therefore, consistent with and reflects the priorities in the annual Operational Programme for 2004, prepared with the future Dutch presidency."
"It is also consistent with the Multiannual Strategic Programme for 2004-2006."
"The preparation of the annual and multiannual programmes with the Netherlands and with the four presidencies to follow has been both an innovation and a practical example of 'Europeans – Working Together'."
"This is a time of historic change for the Union."
"We must be prepared for the future."
"We want a Union that is more democratic, more accountable, more transparent and more effective."
"We must ensure that the Union is, and is seen to be, as close as possible to its citizens."
"A new constitution is fundamental to this."
"The European Convention did outstanding work in bringing forward an excellent draft text."
"I pay warm tribute to all who contributed to its proceedings. In particular, I pay tribute to the representatives of the European Parliament who brought to the Convention not only great vitality, but also great insight."
"I fully understand the importance Parliament attaches to bringing the constitutional project to a successful and early conclusion."
"In my contacts with many of you here in Parliament since the Brussels European Council, we have made clear our strong support for a speedy and successful outcome to the Intergovernmental Conference."
"You may rest assured that I have heard that message and I share your view."
"I thank the Italian presidency for the good work it did during its term, and I want to thank it for the support and assistance it has given to our presidency."
"We all hoped that agreement could be reached last month and were disappointed when it was not."
"It now falls to Ireland to try to make further progress."
"We have taken up this challenge and we will do all in our power to see it through."
"We are determined to do whatever we can to encourage and facilitate the earliest possible agreement."
"It remains to be seen whether this will prove possible in our presidency."
"We know what the outstanding issues are."
"Various possible solutions have been proposed."
"But ultimately, if we are to arrive at the necessary compromises, what is needed is sufficient collective political will."
"I am convinced that this is profoundly in the interests of the Union and its citizens, and indeed of the Member States individually – new and old, large and small."
"A new constitution would help the Union respond to the demands and expectations of its citizens."
"It would help the Union play a more coherent and effective role in the wider world."
"On the other hand, excessive delay will damage our credibility and weaken our standing."
"Stalemate is not an option any of us can contemplate."
"I have undertaken to consult intensely and to make a report to the March European Council."
"That process of consultation is well under way."
"I have spoken to many of my colleagues in the European Council already."
"All of them have indicated their commitment to helping us find a way forward."
"I will continue to explore with them how and when this can be achieved."
"I want to be able to make the fullest possible report in March."
"I can assure Parliament that if my consultations suggest that there is a real prospect of agreement, I will immediately move to seize the opportunity."
"I pledge to you again that the Irish presidency will spare no effort to make progress and to facilitate consensus during our term in office."
"This issue will command the highest priority under our presidency."
"The negotiations on the future financial perspectives will be critically important for the future shape and direction of the enlarged Union."
"We also look forward to initiating discussions once the Commission communication is tabled later this month."
"Our aim as the presidency will be to seek initial reactions from Member States and we will be working to secure agreement at the Spring European Council on the calendar and process for the negotiations."
"The Irish presidency has begun in a Union of 15 Member States and will end in a Union of 25."
"It is a particular privilege to hold the presidency at a time when history is being made."
"We greatly look forward to welcoming the new members of the family at an official ceremony in Dublin on 1 May."
"We plan to make this a real welcome in Ireland."
"Community cultural events are being organised and real local involvement and international exchange will occur. We believe that the diversity of Europe’s cultural heritage is something to be shared and celebrated."
"We want the formal enlargement of the European Union to be as smooth and successful as possible."
"Making enlargement work is of the greatest possible importance to us."
"Integrating the new Member States and ensuring that the Council continues to function effectively will be a high priority."
"We will press forward with the future enlargement agenda."
"We will prioritise work in relation to Romania and Bulgaria with the aim of concluding negotiations this year."
"We also welcome Turkey’s efforts to fulfil the necessary criteria with a view to a decision to be taken at the European Council next December."
"I am convinced that the accession of Cyprus continues to provide the context for a comprehensive settlement, which would enable the accession of a united island on 1 May."
"We welcome the signs of progress in recent days."
"As the presidency, we will support fully the central role of the United Nations Secretary-General in this process."
"I urge all parties in the period ahead to demonstrate conclusively their commitment to negotiating a settlement on the basis of his proposals."
"The newly enlarged Union must work for all its people."
"That is why the Irish presidency has placed sustainable growth and social cohesion at the very centre of its work programme."
"Four years ago in Lisbon, we agreed on the goal of making the European Union the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world."
"The Lisbon Agenda is the best mechanism for achieving this goal in a demanding and competitive global context."
"It is the means by which the Member States and the European institutions can work together to develop the European economy, to create more employment, to ensure social protection and to invest in a sustainable future for us all."
"Next year, we will be half way towards the 2010 target date set at the Lisbon European Council in March 2000."
"We have achieved a great deal already."
"We have seen advances in the areas of research and development, financial services, liberalisation of energy markets, telecommunications, environmental protection and regulatory reform."
"It is now much easier for workers and students to move around the European Union, to access jobs and education; it is easier to set up and run a small business; consumers are already enjoying cheaper telephone calls; significant studies have been made in terms of equality and social protection."
"And Europe’s commitment to the environment means a cleaner and safer world for our children and our grandchildren."
"Despite these achievements, it is increasingly clear that unless we increase momentum, we will not make Europe the most competitive economy in the world by 2010."
"We intend to use the Spring European Council this year to give renewed focus and impetus to the Lisbon Agenda."
"We look forward in this context to the publication next week of the Commission's report on the Spring European Council."
