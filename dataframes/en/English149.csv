"This is why I believe that we must implement and consider ambitious ideas and not be afraid to come up with and propose such ideas."
"Last but not least, I want to emphasise the following point, by way of conclusion: do not forget about transparency and better communication with all European institutions."
"Finally, Mr Maystadt, I believe that I can say, on behalf of my fellow Members, that you can count on the European Parliament's support in the future."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at noon."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"We are aware of the importance that borrowing from the European Investment Bank (EIB) can have for development and social progress, given its low rates and long payment periods."
"However, the options which it offers are neither transparent nor clear enough, and neither are the countries and regions that most need to borrow from it those that are most favoured with its loans."
"This report, which we support, therefore contains some criticisms, suggestions and proposals."
"However, we disagree with transforming the EIB into a mere tool for the EU to implement its policies, as well as addressing the problems of social and economic cohesion and social development, which should be considered in the EU budget and EU structural and cohesion funds."
"Obviously, the EIB can monitor and improve these efforts, but it cannot be a substitute for EU budgetary policies."
"The most important requirements are that the activities of the European Investment Bank be even more transparent for the European Parliament and that the financial instruments outsourced by it be used in an even more targeted manner."
"We recommend for consideration the proposal that prudential supervision be introduced for this institution as well in the interest of the precise measurement of the quality of the EIB's financial situation and its results, as well as compliance with effective and successful business practice."
"I would like to stress that we are not making this proposal because we have doubts about the regularity of the EIB's activity but because, in our view, as a general rule, as the G20's London Declaration clearly stated two years ago, 'all systemically important financial institutions, markets, and instruments should be subject to an appropriate degree of regulation and oversight'."
"We suggest calling on the European Commission to provide the European Parliament with the legal analysis of the options for the prudential supervision of the EIB by 30 November 2011, because under the effective legislation, no European institution has the right to supervise the EIB."
"However, in view of the increased role of the EIB, and also because of the extension of EU guarantees to it, changing this urgently is warranted."
"It would be justified to develop increased professional and social supervision, similarly to the practice which has evolved in recent times at other non-bank financial institutions."
"The EIB's lending activity needs to become more selective, more effective and more result-oriented in the future, particularly as regards financing SMEs."
"To this end, information on loans granted must also be collected and published more systematically."
"Vaccination against bluetongue (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Janusz Wojciechowski, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2000/75/EC as regards vaccination against bluetongue - 05499/2011 - C7-0032/2011 -."
"rapporteur. - (PL) Mr President, it is with great satisfaction that I can present my report to Parliament on amendments to the directive as regards vaccination against bluetongue, a disease which poses a huge risk to cattle, sheep and goat breeding in many EU Member States."
"I am particularly happy since, three years ago in this Chamber, during a previous term of office, I had the privilege of presenting a report on a new strategy for animal health based on the principle 'better prevention than cure'."
"Today's amendment to the directive as regards vaccination against bluetongue is a practical realisation of this very principle."
"We are improving protection against this disease, and we are contributing to better animal health."
"Costs relating to their treatment will be lower and the whole vaccination process will be better organised."
"The amendment relates to the fact that the current directive from the year 2000 was adapted to conditions at the time and, in particular, to the vaccinations which were then available on the market."
"Those vaccinations had to be and still have to be administered, but with certain restrictions due to the fact that there is a danger of the virus being transferred from vaccinated animals to those which have not been vaccinated."
"This means that various restrictions are required during the vaccination process, for example, vaccinations being administered in specified areas and restrictions being applied to the movements of animals."
"This represents quite a burden for breeders and, as a result, the efficacy of these vaccinations is limited."
"Science has taken a step forward."
"We have second-generation vaccinations which have been tested and can be administered without any fear of transferring viruses to unvaccinated animals."
"As a result, they can be administered without applying the current restrictions."
"Therefore, administering these vaccinations will be beneficial for breeders, as they will be less of a burden and certainly more effective."
"It will be possible to administer them to a much wider extent."
"Procedures are moving very quickly as far as this matter is concerned."
"The Committee on Agriculture carried out its work shortly after receiving draft legislation from the European Commission, and is now presenting it to Parliament."
"We are hoping that it will be possible to carry out mass vaccinations using the new vaccine during the summer season this year."
"This is the reason for the amendments and this is why Parliament, in its amendments to the report which I have tabled, has included timescales within which the legislation of Member States should be adapted to the requirements of the directive, so that the vaccinations can be carried out this year and we will not have to wait until the next season."
"I would like to remind you of the controversy which has surrounded the report and the amendments to the directive concerning the correlation tables proposed by the Commission."
"In my report, we agree with the introduction of an obligation to include correlation tables which contain information regarding the transposition of the directive into national legislation and which specific provisions transpose provisions of the directive into national legislation."
"This is considered to be a bureaucratic requirement by the administrations of certain Member States, but it should be viewed differently."
"Thanks to the introduction of this requirement, European law will become more transparent."
"It will be easier for citizens to check whether a directive has been transposed into national legislation, and in what way."
"I think this is good practice."
"As far as I am aware, this is the first, or one of the first, directives to be adopted which introduces this requirement, and I think it does so quite rightly."
"This should become standard practice for our legislation."
"Once more, I would like to thank you for allowing me to present the report and I feel that we are improving the lot of the breeders as well as reducing the suffering of animals in the EU."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, the Commission is grateful to Parliament for its support for the proposal to further facilitate vaccination against bluetongue and for its recommendation in relation to this very important issue."
"In particular, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Wojciechowski, for his commitment to this cause."
"Bluetongue has been the cause of a great deal of concern to all farmers in the European Union."
"Until the 1990s, bluetongue was considered exotic to the EU, with outbreaks only occurring sporadically in southern Europe."
"However, recent years have brought several epidemic waves of the disease, affecting many Member States, including in central and northern Europe, causing significant losses to livestock production and disruption of the trade in live animals."
"The past few years have seen a significant improvement in the bluetongue situation across the EU, thanks in no small measure to massive vaccination campaigns largely cofinanced by the European Union."
"The EU cofinanced EUR 150 million in 2008, and allocated EUR 120 million in 2009 and EUR 100 million for the following years."
"Under current rules, vaccination is only allowed in areas that are subject to certain restrictions because of the presence of bluetongue disease."
"The proposed amendments to the directive introduce the possibility of using inactivated vaccines everywhere in the European Union."
"The amendment would allow a wider use of preventive vaccinations against bluetongue and this will ensure better control of the disease and lessen the burden it causes to the agricultural sector."
"Parliament's report is most timely and important for the animal health situation in the European Union."
"The report rightly recognises the need for urgency in order to give Member States sufficient time to vaccinate animals before the next bluetongue season starts."
"We must not lose sight of the fact that, although the bluetongue situation has improved greatly in recent years, the disease has not been eradicated."
"The EU remains at risk for new epidemic waves of bluetongue in the future and it is important that Member States have the opportunity to protect animals against the virus when they are at risk."
"Member States should be able to optimise their vaccination programmes with the aim of reducing the impact of future bluetongue outbreaks in the European Union."
"Indeed, a number of Member States have already indicated that they wish to implement this measure at the earliest opportunity."
"The rapporteur refers to the really very difficult issue of the correlation tables, which are very important for tracking the correct, appropriate transposition of EU legislation into national legal systems."
"This is a longstanding issue and we have had many debates in this House on how to control and monitor the proper transposition of EU law into national legal systems."
"We can see that the correlation tables are the best tool for doing this, monitoring it and assuring appropriate transposition of EU law."
"At the same time, we are very aware that, especially with such urgent issues as the one we are discussing today, we need to work very hard to find a solution between Parliament and the Council in order to avoid unnecessary blockages."
"I hope that the Council will demonstrate sufficient flexibility so that this legislation can be adopted on time before the start of the season in which bluetongue can break out."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as has already been said, the proposal for a directive on vaccination against bluetongue is a very important step towards eradicating this dangerous animal disease."
"It is a disease that affects ruminants such as cattle, sheep and goats."
"It can result in the animals dying."
"The new inactivated vaccines enable the risk of infection to be excluded, so that this vaccine can also be successfully used in areas where the disease has not yet occurred."
"This will allow the Member States to use the vaccinations more effectively, significantly reducing the burden on the agricultural sector as a result of this disease."
"The new vaccines allow the disease to be combated on a genuinely broad front once and for all, and I hope that the Member States and farmers will take this opportunity."
"It provides greater safety, and it is unquestionably a major improvement in animal health."
"The more we contain the spread of bluetongue using the new vaccines, the greater the opportunities to export farm animals for the benefit of the economy."
"In order that the directive may enter into force and the new vaccines may be made available, it is, in fact, important that we take a decision quickly."
"On Monday, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development sent out a clear signal by unanimously adopting the report, and the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) will follow its lead in today's plenary vote."
"I support the rapporteur's call to leave the correlation tables in the report."
"After all, we cannot take decisions in Europe without the Member States providing information on how they are implemented."
"We also need this transparency - and I say this to the Council very clearly - in order to strengthen the credibility of the EU."
"Finally, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his good work and constructive cooperation."
"Many thanks!"
"The report will have our support."
"Mr President, I have a statement rather than a question."
"The vote was not unanimous because I did not vote in favour."
"Mr President, bluetongue has been a constant threat to our livestock and, hence, to public health."
"Hitherto, we used an activated vaccine to fight this disease, the use of which entails the need to restrict the movement of animals to certain areas in order to prevent the virus from spreading to non-infected animals."
"Use of the vaccine, use of vaccination, was therefore limited to areas where infected animals had been detected in the past."
"This was detrimental to the farmers affected, who suffered on two accounts: firstly, because of the disease, and secondly, because of the restrictions."
"All these problems can apparently be avoided through use of a new inactivated vaccine, which, in addition to preventing potential disturbances in the internal livestock market, will also enable the development of new, further-reaching - which is what really matters - prevention strategies for combating this disease."
"It is therefore vital for the livestock industry that we amend the directive to allow the use of this vaccine, and that we do this as soon as possible."
"Ladies and gentlemen, adherence to our Treaties, particularly as regards correlation tables, should not be an excuse for not bringing this regulation into force before the summer."
"Such a delay would only cause further damage to farmers."
"Mr President, I would like to say a big thank you to Mr Wojciechowski for his excellent and efficient work."
"Previous speakers have mentioned what this is actually about: a new effective vaccine."
"I would therefore like to use my few seconds to point out that this is perhaps the first tangible proof of what will happen in our agriculture when the climate changes dramatically."
"In Sweden, where I come from, the idea that we would have a disease like bluetongue in ruminants would have been completely unrealistic four or five years ago."
"It was a sporadic disease in southern Europe."
"Today, it is a reality and we have had our first epidemic."
"It is therefore very important for us now to get going with the vaccination, but it is also extremely important, when we talk about climate, the environment and the future, to realise that it is not only aridity and precipitation that will change."
"A major change in climate will also bring something quite different: disease epidemics and epizootics among both people and animals."
"We must bring this into the equation when we discuss the Europe 2020 strategy, for example."
"What direction do we intend to take?"
"That is also important for us as legislators to understand."
"We can only take decisions on the basis of the knowledge that we have today, but we must have the flexibility to be able to take new decisions when we acquire new knowledge and - in this case - new vaccines."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank Mr Wojciechowski for the speed with which he has been able to bring this report to the House."
"He has worked extremely hard on this."
"I want to go back to the area of the correlation tables."
"The Commissioner said that he hoped it would be good enough, but I have to say to the Commissioner that 'hope' is not enough."
"This is a very serious disease that we need to get control of this summer."
"It is carried by small flies, by what we call midges, and has to be brought under control this summer."
"Mr Wojciechowski has done his bit and he cannot be blamed in any way for any delay."
"It would be very unfortunate if infighting in Brussels or excessive bureaucracy were to result in a delay."
"We certainly need action, because the disease travels extremely fast and we have to be able to vaccinate outside affected areas."
"I have to remind the House that on many occasions, as Mr Wojciechowski and others have said, prevention is better than cure."
"On this occasion, I think we have got to move, and I want the Commission to give us an assurance that bureaucracy will not hold us back."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr President, this is a disease in respect of which farmers should make their own decisions, based on their own particular circumstances."
"As a UK farmer, I will rely on veterinary recommendation and not the opinion of bureaucrats in other countries."
"I appreciate the support of the British taxpayer who funds my vaccines and I am frustrated that the EU needs to be involved at all."
"You gave us this disease."
"Please do not make matters worse."
"We are now discussing this question despite assurances that the Lisbon Treaty did not constitute a fundamental change."
"If that is so, why do so many measures, large and small, like this one, have to be recast to conform to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union?"
"We do not know how the issue of correlation tables is going to be resolved, and this topic perfectly illustrates the confusion that so-called codecision can lead to."
"Whilst the British Government will spend what it takes to conform to your way of thinking, other Member States may view things very differently."
"Mr President, my thanks to the rapporteur for this report."
"While I am generally in favour of the principle behind this report, I would like to add that this vaccine should only be used when the competent authority identifies significant risk to the livestock population."
"In Northern Ireland, both farmers and the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development have worked extremely hard to keep Northern Ireland a free area."
"It is important that the Commission and the Council recognise free area status within the EU and put safeguards in place for these areas."
"However, there still remains a significant risk within Europe that this disease may spread and, as a result, I believe it is necessary that Northern Ireland has the ability to use the vaccines."
"It is imperative that the competent authority monitor movements and impose trade bans where necessary to stop the spread of bluetongue and that good practice is followed by all of the actors."
"It is important that all Member States work constructively together to reduce the risk of the spread of this disease and protect the industry from a major outbreak."
"Communication between Member States and the Commission is a vital part of monitoring and controlling disease outbreaks."
"I would encourage this."
"(RO) Mr President, epidemics, like bluetongue, have a serious impact not only on livestock farmers, but also on consumers and the European economy in general, as a result of causing animal mortality and trade disruption."
"Animal movement restrictions hit hard the economic resources of the locations or regions where they are imposed."
"With a preventive vaccination campaign, for example, under current legislation, a restriction zone must be maintained, even if no incidence of bluetongue has been recorded."
"This is why the measure proposed by the Commission is fair and economically beneficial to producers and consumers."
"At the same time, the measure is in keeping with the principle of using every scientific advance in agriculture."
"I should also mention the important contribution which the European funds have made so far to improving the situation with regard to bluetongue epidemics."
"The Union has cofinanced major vaccination campaigns, amounting to EUR 370 million in the last three years, as also mentioned by the Commissioner."
"I think that cofinancing of the vaccination programmes should also continue in the coming years, given their effectiveness and the new, much simpler legislative framework which we are debating today."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank Mr Wojciechowski and all the shadow rapporteurs for the work carried out on this report, which aims to make the rules on vaccination against bluetongue more flexible."
"The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has made every effort to approve the text as a matter of urgency in order to allow the vaccination campaign to go ahead before the summer."
"The European Commission had presented a proposal which did not take into account the approval of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"In other words, it left decision-making power solely with the Council, totally excluding Parliament."
"After intense discussions, for which I would like to thank Parliament's Legal Service and the secretariat of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, we managed to reach an agreement to change the legal basis, in accordance with Article 43(2) of the Treaty; in other words, within the framework of the ordinary legislative procedure."
"Now we expect the Council to be equally efficient in accepting our position and including the correlation tables, in order to give a prompt response to European livestock farmers."
"Mr President, due to a combination of vaccinations and restrictions on animal movement, the number of outbreaks of bluetongue has fallen significantly in recent years."
"The disease causes intense suffering and death amongst the affected animals and has a measurable negative impact on the rural economy and the farming community."
"I welcome measures allowing Member States to use inactivated vaccination against bluetongue in areas not affected by the disease, and thank the rapporteur for his work on this issue."
"Member States should be allowed the flexibility to be proactive and draw upon technological advances in vaccine production, thus reducing the burden on the agricultural sector posed by this disease and preventing occurrence without negating the disease-free status of the Member States, as was previously the case."
"Vaccination represents an effective veterinary measure in response to bluetongue which, when accompanied by further measures such as surveillance, means that eradication of the disease in Europe is a real possibility."
"Vaccination in controlling and eventually eradicating the disease will result in reduced economic losses and would be of benefit to European livestock."
"Mr President, this legislation will give farmers flexibility, choice and hope, I am glad to say."
"For too long, our vaccination strategy has been held back by the fact that we have not developed sophisticated enough products to allow vaccination of animals outside exclusion zones."
"Being in an exclusion zone can be disastrous for a farmer's livelihood."
"It can also be disastrous not to protect your animals from disease, especially one as damaging and virulent as bluetongue."
"The development of new vaccines and the rules changes which I hope the Parliament will agree today will allow the UK to move to bluetongue-free status."
"It will allow freer movement of animals and save money in rural areas."
"However, it is vitally important that these rules are brought into force as soon as possible."
"Farmers in the West Country need to be able to vaccinate before the end of May to ensure that animals are fully protected."
"All of us here understand the background to the interinstitutional battle raging over correlation tables, but I can tell you that the farmers I represent do not understand it and they rely on us, their elected representatives, to sort it out for them."
"This is an urgent issue and common sense must prevail."
"Let us get on with this now, agree a fast track for urgent issues of this kind, and get on and get our livestock vaccinated."
"(DE) Mr President, bluetongue is an animal epidemic affecting ruminants that has already caused great damage throughout the livestock and production sector."
"Since the break-out of epidemics in a number of Member States in 2000, considerable economic damage has been caused."
"As always, whenever economic losses occur, the financial damage affects those at the bottom of the production chain most."
"In particular, the flourishing trade in breeding cattle collapsed."
"Despite vaccination, exports were completely paralysed in some countries."
"In Austria, too, where cattle breeding has a long tradition, many farmers had their livelihoods threatened."
"We must take the time now to take preventive action."
"The disease has not been eradicated and could re-emerge at any time."
"We need to learn from experience and be able to offer assistance quickly."
"What was true ten years ago no longer applies."
"The old directive on measures to combat bluetongue from 2000 needs to be improved and updated."
"The rules on vaccination that applied at that time need to be adapted to technological developments in order to combat bluetongue more effectively and reduce the burden on farmers."
"The rules of that time were designed for the use of live attenuated vaccines, which were the only vaccines available at the time the directive was adopted 10 years ago."
"Today's vaccines are more advanced."
"We need to take account of this fact."
"I welcome the rapid action on the part of the Commission and of Parliament and advocate the rapid implementation of the new directive."
"As a representative of the farming community, I know how important it is to think in terms of the annual cycle."
"Making a decision quickly will allow us to have a usable and uniform ruling by the autumn, which is in the interests of the Member States and, above all, of breeders and farmers."
"Many thanks to the rapporteur."
"(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have no real objections to the proposals in this legislative resolution, and I would like to congratulate the Commission for this initiative, which seeks to recognise scientific developments and permit the use of vaccines against bluetongue outside areas subject to animal movement restrictions, as this type of vaccine does not present any risk to the undesired circulation of the virus."
"I would also like to congratulate and express my thanks for the work undertaken by the rapporteur for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr Wojciechowski, and its President, Mr De Castro, which has allowed the Council and the Commission to come to a swift agreement with regard to the legal basis of this proposal."
"Unlike what was initially proposed, therefore, legislative powers are shared by Parliament and the Council under the ordinary legislative procedure introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon."
"The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has discussed and approved its report in a short space of time so as to allow today's vote here to take place, and so that the next step towards the agreement with the Council can be taken as soon as possible and thus allow the new provisions of this directive to enter into force."
"I would therefore like to call upon the Council to come to a compromise with the Commission and Parliament's position, which I am sure will be approved here today by a large majority."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, adapting the rules on vaccination for bluetongue is in accordance with the new EU vaccination policy as expressed in the Animal Health strategy 2007-2013 under the slogan 'Prevention is better than cure'."
"A more flexible procedure for the vaccination of livestock is necessary if we are to be able to combat epidemics such as bluetongue more effectively and reduce their impact on farming."
"Greater flexibility and prevention would undoubtedly be desirable for a number of animal epidemics."
"A strict policy of non-vaccination such as we have long pursued in the EU is no longer relevant."
"Consequently, I am of the opinion that we are taking the right step here."
"I would also like to support Mrs Paulsen, who said that we must expect to see other animal epidemics in the near future as a result of climate change."
"This, in turn, suggests that we need a clear strategy, and here of course, we can correctly practise this."
"In this context, I would also like to reiterate that there should be no further discussion of culling in the Commission either."
"In the case of bluetongue, we have, of course, benefited from the fact that we supported research and now have an inactivated vaccine and are able to carry out comprehensive vaccination, which was previously very dangerous and very difficult."
"We are therefore in a new situation here."
"I would also like to thank the rapporteur for having worked so quickly."
"Experience has taught us to expect the first outbreaks in late summer and autumn."
"The countries therefore need to elaborate vaccination strategies and also implement these."
"To Mr Agnew, I would like to say that if you have a good vet, then he will recommend vaccination, because that is what is wanted by the vets that I know and it is what I have heard repeatedly during the discussions."
"Naturally, that is not the end of it."
"The Commission needs to draw up implementing regulations and adapt these to the new process, and that needs to be done just as quickly as here in Parliament."
"I therefore call on the Commission to work quickly so that we can put this scientific progress to use before the end of the year."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to our fellow Member, Mr Wojciechowski, for his report, which reminds us of the importance of appropriate legislation on this matter."
"However, whether the vaccine is live attenuated or inactivated, given the current state of our knowledge, blood tests do not enable us to identify how the pathogenic organism entered the animal's blood - in other words, whether it originated in a vaccine or in the wild."
"Therefore, unless a marked inactivated vaccine - that is, a vaccine of which the pathogenic organism is of vaccine origin - is developed, it will be impossible to distinguish between a vaccinated animal and an animal infected by the virus."
"Yet that is an essential condition if a region or a country is to be declared safe from any contamination."
"There is a great risk, therefore, that countries that are protected from any contamination will put up trade barriers between themselves and countries that use that inactivated vaccine."
"Hence, the European Union has a duty to encourage ongoing research into a marked inactivated vaccine so as to ensure greater biosecurity within the Union, something which will enable us to combine our health and trade approaches more effectively."
"Mr President, it is worth recording the Commissioner's comment that the instance of bluetongue is on the decline: from 48 000 cases in 2008 to 120 in 2010."
"That said, we are still not sure what the trend will be in the future, so the development of this inactivated vaccine and discussion of the technicalities around its use are very welcome."
"It would be useful if the Council were in the Chamber so that we could address the issue of whether it is willing actually to provide the correlation tables that Parliament and the Commission believe to be essential - and perhaps this is something on which the Council could come back to us quite swiftly."
"The prevention of all diseases, and of this one in particular, centres on animal husbandry, on the restriction of animal movement, on protection from vectors and on the issue discussed this morning - namely vaccination."
"(CS) Mr President, the problem with using inactive vaccine for vaccinations outside the closed zone is that animals will show positive results in serological tests, and in order to determine whether animals have been vaccinated or are actually sick, it will be necessary to perform a virological test, which is more expensive."
"This will create problems as regards trade in, and transfers of, animals."
"In view of the fact that it involves the transposition of the directive into national law, the deadline of 30 June 2011 will, for procedural reasons, also be difficult to achieve."
"Personally, I also disagree with changing the date of entry into force of the directive from the earlier date of 20th to the day following its publication."
"We should also understand that drawing up correlation tables will add further to the administrative burden."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that we are taking a step forward in understanding that this is not a problem linked to some areas of Europe, Southern Europe or North Africa."
"However, my view of the measure is a positive one."
"I would like to ask Mr Tarabella whether he or the Commission does not think that the problem of application to veterinary services should also be tackled immediately, so that there could be a measure which would make it possible to eliminate the problem throughout the European Union."
"(DE) Mr President, improving the vaccination arrangements for bluetongue is an extremely important matter."
"The new inactivated vaccines allow producers, for the first time, to exclude the risk of infection with this potentially highly dangerous disease, because the vaccines can now also be used in areas in which bluetongue has not previously been found."
"In view of this, we must repeatedly emphasise that agriculture - including exports of breeding animals - is an important factor in all the countries of Europe."
"Farmers therefore need to be able to take advantage of the latest knowledge in animal health, which has been used to develop these vaccines."
"There are two things that we now particularly need."
"Firstly, we need a rapid solution concerning practice in the European Union."
"Secondly, in my view, we just as urgently need an obligation for the measures introduced in the Member States to be notified; in other words, an obligation on the Member States to report to the Commission."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, I would first like to thank the House for its strong support for this proposal and also for its recognition of the urgency of the matter and the very speedy procedures."
"Several of you referred to the problem of correlation tables."
"I would just like to remind you that the Conference of Presidents injected fresh impetus into tackling this issue, and has accorded it greater importance, notably in recognition of the problem of the transposition of EU legislation into national law."
"I would like to ask whether it is really so difficult for the Member States to notify the Commission of the legal basis on which they transposed the EU regulation into their national legal order."
"Is it really so difficult?"
"I am sure that when they are considering how to transpose legislation, they must do some preparation and decide how they intend to transpose it."
"I think we all recognise the fact - and we have had several debates on this issue - that the European Union suffers when the transposition of EU law is uneven."
"In particular, on an issue as important as the one we are discussing today, incorrect transposition could have detrimental effects."
"At the same time, as I said in my opening remarks, I would emphasise that the Commission is clearly against unnecessary hold-ups."
"We are fully aware of the urgency of this matter."
"Therefore, I hope that, through increased flexibility and intensive negotiations, we can find a solution to this problem."
"The Commission will try to be as helpful as possible so that we can adopt this legislation before the beginning of the season for a potential bluetongue outbreak."
"Concerning the Commission's readiness to implement this measure, I would like to assure Mr Schnellhardt and Mr Uggias that the Commission has done its part."
"Our implementing measures are almost complete."
"What we need is approval of this proposal by the legislator."
"Once we have that, we can proceed very quickly."
"Once again, I would like to thank our rapporteur and to thank the House for its strong support for this measure."
"Mr President, I would like to thank all the Members who took part in the debate and expressed their support for my report."
"Thank you to all the shadow rapporteurs and members of the Committee on Agriculture, thanks to whom we were able to proceed so rapidly and effectively with the report."
"It does not often happen that we are so unanimous in adopting a positive document which is obviously aiming to improve the current situation."
"Regarding the correlation tables which were referred to in the discussion as a possible source of problems, I think that it would be difficult here to sympathise with the administrative bodies or governments of the Member States."
"Creating the tables and sending them to the Commission will really not be much of a problem."
"What is certain is that citizens who want to check whether their Member State's legislation accords with European Union law will have greater problems."
"They are the ones who will have to put in the effort and research if there are no tables, as has been the case until now."
"It is very often difficult to find one's way around EU legislation."
"I think and hope that this instrument will be available to anyone who is interested, not only the Commission, and that it will be a readily accessible document which will be available when needed."
"It will also be a very useful document."
"I appeal to the Council not to take issue with the correlation tables, and if it must, not in this case, so that the new vaccinations can come into force during this season, as expected."
"We cannot allow any delays because this would negate our quick and efficient work."
"Thank you all once again for your cooperation on this report."
"The debate is closed."

"The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on EU tomato imports from Morocco (Petition 1565/2009 by José Maria Pozancos (Spanish)), by Erminia Mazzoni, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions - B7-0211/2011)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the question we submitted as the Committee on Petitions shows that our Committee was not satisfied with the answer that the Commission gave to the issue raised by the Spanish Federation of Associations of Producers and Exporters of Fruits, Vegetables, Flowers and Live Plants."
"In fact, the Commission focused its attention on the responsibility of Member States in setting prices, without considering the specific point made by the petition, which was to report irregular imports of tomatoes and other vegetables from Morocco."
"These alleged irregularities have, in fact, already been noted for some years by the regulatory body OLAF, which has pointed to the abusive application of the method for deduction provided for by Regulation (EC) No 3223/1994, which establishes three different methods of calculation."
"The consequences of this situation are lower revenues for the European Union, unfair competition and breach of market rules, as well as the gradual impoverishment of European producers and exporters, with seriously alarming situations reported, in particular, in Spain, Greece, Portugal, France and Italy."
"The Commission is negotiating a new bilateral agreement with Morocco, and once again this agreement seems to not be taking these alarming facts into consideration, but to be continuing along the path towards implementation of a flow of exports from Morocco to the European Union which is totally unregulated and does not comply with European law."
"I think this is a subject we should focus on."
"It is a subject which relates to and touches on a currently sensitive nerve, which is that of migration flows."
"In fact, this great mass of people coming from the countries along the North African coast, including Morocco, to the European Union often involves farm labourers, as the recent events in Rosarno show."
"We are struggling to receive them."
"Above all, we are struggling as the European Union, and particularly as Italy, to offer them a livelihood."
"Further reducing the potential for agricultural production in our countries, and therefore in France, Spain, Italy and Portugal, which are having serious problems at the moment, would cause all kinds of damage."
"I would like to know what the Commission intends to do."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, if you will allow me, I will try to answer several questions that were raised in this petition."
"I would like to thank Mrs Mazzoni for bringing up this question so we can clarify our position on this matter."
"First, I would like to assure the House that the Commission monitors the quantity of tomatoes imported from Morocco closely, attentively, using a cross-checking system based on designation of quantities imported by Moroccan operators and daily import records kept by national customs authorities."
"The Commission, until today, does not have any proof of systemic fraud or systemic failure of the system that was put in place."
"We have the information concerning one case, to which I will come back a little later."
"This is related to the year 2007, when OLAF indeed emphasised that the system as it stands at present could result in opportunistic behaviour but not necessarily involving irregular behaviour."
"It is recalled that the application of the entry price system and the levying of possible import duties in connection with this mechanism are the exclusive competence of the customs authorities of the Member States."
"Another aspect to this question, which is quite important, is the international context of this matter, something that is really dominated by the Doha Round, which has not yet been completed."
"Any change to the entry price system and its current application mechanism could have a detrimental impact on the results achieved so far."
"The new bilateral agreement with Morocco preserves the interests of the European producers by maintaining the system of monthly tariff quotas of tomatoes and strict control of the quantities imported."
"In addition, the agreement provides for improved cooperation and greater transparency in terms of market data in the fruit and vegetable sector."
"The quantitative increase in the tomatoes quota has been limited to 52 000 tonnes, which is well below traditional trade levels, and the increase is progressive and staggered over four marketing years, thereby preserving current market shares and the traditional supply to the European Union."
"The Commission therefore considers that any change to the current entry price system must respect the terms of the relevant international agreements."
"The Commission ensures that the regulation is properly applied and therefore has carried out the investigation through OLAF."
"This is probably the case Mrs Mazzoni is referring to; whether there are irregularities as a result of incorrect interpretation of the implementing regulation."
"However, it is the responsibility of the national customs authorities to follow up on the results of the investigation."
"Recuperation is in progress but the publication of the data is strictly the responsibility of the competent customs authorities."
"As regards the organisation of surveillance; this was one of the items that was raised by Mrs Mazzoni."
"Here, I have to say that the Commission, as I said, monitors tomato imports from Morocco using a cross-checking system."
"The quantities imported and reported by the Moroccan authorities on a weekly basis are monitored."
"The data is then compared with the data provided by the national customs authorities, who survey the system, and also by Eurostat."
"I think that we have very good and precise information and, if there were some systematic fraud and systematic irregularities, we would definitely spot it and take action."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to express my gratitude to the Committee on Petitions for its hard work following the complaint brought by the Spanish Federation of Associations of Producers and Exporters of Fruits, Vegetables, Flowers and Live Plants, based on the report published by OLAF, the European Anti-Fraud Office, in 2007."
"I believe this report's conclusions are extremely clear and justify only too well action on the part of the European Commission - which should have addressed this matter a long time ago - to clarify the operation of the entry price regime, at least in relation to the tomato sector."
"However, not only having failed to take any action to prevent the different types of fraud made possible by the current Entry Price Regulation, the Commission has negotiated a new agriculture agreement with Morocco without having first resolved the shortcomings of the import regime currently in place."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is time for the European Commission to take its responsibilities seriously, to start investigating where and how fraud is being committed, and, potentially, to demand payment of any unpaid customs duties."
"I believe that there is no way that a new agreement with Morocco should be ratified until all the details we have set out are resolved."
"Our aim is not to hinder new international agreements, but to ensure that such agreements will not seriously damage the interests of European producers, and that the rules laid down in those agreements will be adhered to."
"Where the new agreement with Morocco is concerned, all the European fruit and vegetables sector is demanding is a guarantee that the terms agreed will, in fact, be observed."
"This will only be made possible by reforming the entry price regime."
"We cannot have a new agreement with Morocco until we have a new system for entry prices."
"We will not be able to ratify the agreement that the Commission has already concluded."
"Moreover, if this supervisory role is to be played by the Member States, they should be required to make a significant financial contribution."
"However, it is also true that we have long been calling for a European borders and customs system similar to that of the United States, so as to ensure effective control."
"According to the Spanish farmers who presented a petition to the European Parliament, underpriced imported Moroccan tomatoes pose a threat to European food producers."
"They are referring to the underpriced minimum rate which was set at approximately EUR 46 per 100 kg in a preferential import-export agreement between the EU and Morocco."
"According to EUROSTAT, Morocco exported over 70 000 tonnes of tomatoes in December 2010, which is over double the quota foreseen in the agreement between the EU and Morocco."
"This is what has caused heavy losses to European producers, never mind the losses from customs payments."
"OLAF has already commented on this matter, stating in its 2007 report that there may be irregularities in the importing of tomatoes from Morocco in connection with the underpricing of tomatoes in comparison with the initial price agreed by the EU, which, in effect, allows for the non-payment of additional customs duties."
"In adding my voice to that of other members of the Committee on Petitions, I would, however, like to ask whether the Commission has any intention of revising rules of this kind, and of possibly recovering the unpaid customs duties."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, last October, I tabled a written question to the Commission concerning the discrepancies between the figures in the different EU services on the EU import of tomatoes from Morocco."
"In 2008, there were about 100 000 tonnes in difference between DG TAXUD and Eurostat."
"The Commission answered that it had observed the problem and was solving it, but it is not clear to me whether the Commission will achieve what European citizens and European producers deserve."
"In the European Union, we import tomatoes not only from Morocco but also from other third countries."
"We should find a way for negotiations to be very fair to everyone and not at the expense of the European agriculture sector."
"We should also find a way to control what we are importing from other countries outside the EU, especially in some northern European ports."
"Without effective border controls, the European agriculture sector will have a very difficult future."
"If European production of tomatoes is damaged by the EU-Morocco Agreement, it will be very difficult to regain production on EU soil."
"The rules and the obligations should be applied to everyone, which means fair competition."
"What we cannot accept is the application of different rules and duties to a European producer and an agricultural producer outside the EU."
"Accepting this means accepting the loss in competitiveness of our agricultural sector and a huge effect on the labour force in Europe."
"I am in favour of free trade, but under symmetric conditions of production and information."
"If they do not exist, free trade is not fair trade and competition is not fair competition."
"Finally, I do not think that Parliament should ratify the EU-Morocco Agreement without the inclusion of clauses concerning the labour market, the social dimension and the environment in Morocco."
"If this does not happen, we may lose our European farming activity and our food chain industry."
"Mr President, we raised several warnings during the debate on trade agreements on agricultural produce between Morocco and other Mediterranean countries, such as Egypt and Israel."
"We warned that if these were concluded, they would further increase the pressure faced by farmers in the EU to lower production prices, especially in countries like Portugal, and exacerbate the additional difficulties in disposing of their products."
"We condemn the liberalisation of trade in fruit and vegetables, which are typically Mediterranean products, as this would lead to large supermarkets stocking lower priced products, which are often exempt from the same rules and standards as those imposed on farmers in the EU."
"We would like to point out that the liberalisation of trade for agricultural produce promotes models of intensive production for export which favour big agribusiness at the expense of small and medium-sized farming, family farming, and supply for local and regional markets."
"All this has negative consequences on the sovereignty, security and quality of food, and on the environment."
"This situation was the reason for our warnings, which the Commission has regrettably ignored, and is continuing to do so."
"It has ignored the need to defend the interests of EU producers, ensuring fair prices for production and business continuity, especially for small and medium-sized farming."
"Moreover, we now know that the Commission also ignored the report by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), which denounced irregularities in the importing of tomatoes from Morocco, in a report acknowledging the impact of these imports on lowering tomato prices in the EU market."
"Not content with this, in the new agricultural chapter in the Association Agreement with Morocco, the Commission has decided to further increase tomato imports to the EU."
"When will this liberal fundamentalism, which sacrifices everything to the interests of a few major European corporations and multinational exporters, finally be curbed?"
"How does the Commission intend to make amends to European producers for the damage that it has clearly caused them?"
"We will leave you with these questions."
"(ES) Mr President, the tomato growers of the Canary Islands, Murcia, Andalusia and the Community of Valencia, all of them European Union producers, need the Commission to take robust action with regard to an unfair situation which is causing them serious damage."
"Fraud is being committed, and you know it."
"Thanks to its agreement with the EU, Morocco benefits from an entry price to which it does not adhere."
"In addition, we should not only look at 2007, but also at 2010."
"The Commission is well aware that Spanish tomato growers have to compete with Moroccan growers under unfair conditions, as they must bear much higher production costs stemming from the strict European standards on quality, food safety and workplace safety, as well as restrictions on pesticides which are not required of third countries."
"Even so, our growers, with great effort and commitment to quality, continue to work hard to save their crops."
"Thus, it is unacceptable for the Commission to ignore the malfunctioning of the entry price regime, whose complexity encourages fraud, as the European Anti-Fraud Office itself does, and for the Commission to look the other way when the tomato quotas agreed with Morocco are being contravened."
"It is not enough for the Commission to tell us that surveillance is the responsibility of the Member States."
"If they fail in their duties, the Commission must act."
"It is intolerable for regulations on Moroccan import quotas to be breached, and for the applicable customs duties to go unpaid, without the Commission taking any action."
"The Commission would have us approve a new agreement with Morocco."
"Unless we are given assurances that the price system will be modified to prevent unfair competition between Moroccan and Spanish produce, we will certainly not be supporting that initiative."
"It is your obligation to ensure adherence to agreements, but it is also your obligation to defend the interests of growers in the Canary Islands, Murcia, Valencia, and Andalusia."
"Do it before it is too late."
"(ES) Mr President, calls for the Entry Price Regulation to be modified began in 2003."
"This Parliament, the Member States, Spain and France, with the support of Italy, Greece, and Portugal, have all requested it."
"The reason for this lies in the fact that the regulation is not being properly applied, with certain duties being left unpaid and a biased calculation method being used."
"As a consequence, the sector suffers, we have unfair competition, and the Member States receive less revenue from customs duties."
"The Special Corps of Fruit and Vegetable Inspectors has verified this, pointing out that Article 5 of the regulation allows a biased application and, as has been said earlier in this House, OLAF, the European Anti-Fraud Office, has stated that the calculation method used enables non-payment of additional duties."
"It is up to the Commission to resolve this issue."
"A solution must be provided, to the production system and to the Member States."
"This situation has been going on for 16 years."
"The sector is suffering."
"The European fruit and vegetable sector, along with the Spanish fruit and vegetable sector in Valencia, Murcia and Andalusia, are all suffering, and a solution is needed."
"Consumers are also affected by this situation."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the petition under discussion today has arrived at a time when Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and its Committee on International Trade are debating the new chapter on agriculture in the agreement with Morocco."
"The European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) confirms that there have been irregularities in the calculation of duties on tomato imports and that this has been damaging to European producers, the very same producers who are expressing their concern at the expected increase in tomato and fruit and vegetable imports in general that will take place if the agreement is signed."
"We are obviously sensitive to the concerns brought about by bilateral agreements where the agricultural element is often sacrificed for the sake of broader industrial interests."
"It is not a good way to proceed, and we will continue to repeat this to the European Commission."
"However, I would like to point out that the current economic and political crisis throughout the Maghreb area should lead us to consider this agreement carefully and with greater solidarity."
"(ES) Mr President, as requested by the petitioners from the Spanish Federation of Associations of Producers and Exporters of Fruits, Vegetables, Flowers and Live Plants, the Commission needs to modify - and here I am repeating the request put forward by Spain and other Member States - some of the articles of the regulation to which we are referring."
"Focusing on the calculation method for establishing entry prices, one of the three methods currently used, must be removed, specifically the one known as the 'deductive' method."
"This is the most necessary change, bearing in mind that importers choose the method that, at any given time, allows them to avoid paying additional duties."
"Now that the new agreement with Morocco is pending adoption by this Parliament for its entry into force, the Commission would certainly prove its worth by correcting the system once and for all."
"We are calling for this once again today, as properly working entry prices are the compensation that our growers can reasonably expect when its entry into force is agreed upon."
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that today's debate following the petition presented by the Spanish Federation of Associations of Producers and Exporters of Fruits, Vegetables, Flowers and Live Plants is apt and well-timed, in view of the fact that the commercial agreement with Morocco is being discussed in Parliament at the same time."
"It is clear that the petition raises an issue to which the Commission does not yet seem to have provided an answer."
"This House strongly calls for the answer to be given before the new agreement is signed, because it is not acceptable that European farmers should continue to pay the price of this desire for free trade that is pervading Europe."
"We need to defend and safeguard our farmers, not only with regard to tomato production, but also with regard to all fruit and vegetable production, which would be severely affected by this indiscriminate opening up of the market."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the criticisms that we have heard here this morning in connection with the petition presented are understandable."
"I think there is still a long way to go before we can ensure that a possible general agreement on agricultural products with Morocco receives consensus approval."
"On the one hand, the agreement must respect the need for balance, and not cause serious difficulties for European agricultural producers."
"On the other, it must respect the need for clear and transparent rules of competition on agricultural markets."
"This is the path to follow in order to ensure that the relationship between the European Union and Morocco is a positive one."
"I therefore invite the Commission to look for suitable solutions that do not lose sight of the producers' interests, but which also do not lose sight of a renewed policy of generosity towards Morocco, particularly in view of the events taking place in the Maghreb."
"It would be very useful to understand, and I do not want us to end up effectively importing tomato pickers, instead of agricultural products and tomatoes."
"It is therefore important to carry out a thorough investigation in order to create a new European policy."
"(ES) Mr President, I believe that the 'business as usual' policy has already been the cause of many misfortunes for us in the past."
"Therefore, we must be very cautious, particularly with regard to the current situation in North Africa."
"Precisely because of this, I would like to join in with those who have said that, under the current circumstances, it is scarcely appropriate to move forward with the trade agreement with Morocco."
"As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries, I believe we need thorough clarification of the progress being made in the current framework."
"We must also clearly demand that any tomatoes - or any other produce - entering the European Union arrive under the same conditions as are demanded of local growers."
"In the absence of this assurance, we should - indeed must - rethink the entire framework, and this is what I hope this House will also do."
"Rather than adopting a protectionist policy, I believe there is a need for firm commitment to fair trade."
"We must also be free of any doubts as to what the framework is, so that we are able to know and to act as responsibly as possible."
"(ES) Mr President, I must thank all my fellow Members who have understood the problem of the Mediterranean region, the Spanish delegation, and all those who understand that we in the Canary Islands, Murcia, Valencia and Almeria, in addition to being frustrated at the Commission's failure to honour its agreements, and to having seen many companies forced out of business, remain the entry point for immigrants from sub-Saharan Africa, the entry point for Moroccan immigrants, and a buffer against the crisis."
"This is because we are currently supporting, at a time of utter economic penury, people who come to work and are able to send money home to their families."
"Therefore, I believe that the Commission must also behave responsibly with regard to the competences granted to it by the Treaties."
"I believe the Commission has not given any thought to the need to defend the interests of the public, or to the need to prevent an indiscriminate policy which, moreover, makes us import produce grown in extremely dubious phytosanitary conditions."
"(DE) Mr President, one of the reasons the internal market was established was so as to provide European consumers with better protection."
"Consumers have a right to be able to buy healthy, fairly produced products throughout the European Union."
"Opening up the market - in other words, a controlled import quota - must therefore be subject to at least three requirements being met."
"Firstly, there must be clear control of the quantity of imports permitted."
"This relates mainly to the quantitative aspect."
"Secondly, the quality of the products must also be controlled."
"This also relates to production standards."
"Thirdly, the impact on farmers in the European Union needs to be taken into consideration."
"Business that harms third parties - and here, this generally means business that favours industry to the detriment of agriculture - must be prevented."
"I therefore ask the Commission to subject the agreement with Morocco to further careful scrutiny and not to sign it until it has undergone a further review."
"(FR) Mr President, I should like to thank the Spanish producers who submitted this timely petition to us."
"Indeed, for months now, we in Parliament have been warning the Commission of the danger to our internal market of a number of bilateral agreements."
"Clearly, we are sensitive to the issue of Morocco's development."
"Clearly, we know that creating stability for the Moroccan people in their own country is the best possible solution, and that it will stop us from having to solve numerous immigration problems in the future."
"However, when the Commission tells us that a new agreement will simply ratify a situation, we can plainly see, through the reports by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), that the situation to which the Commission refers is not the real solution."
"Furthermore, I should like to alert the Commission to another point."
"We are told that the negotiated - the renegotiated - agreements will enable us to support Moroccan producers."
"Which producers are we talking about, though?"
"The exporters are primarily large agri-food companies that have set up huge farms in Morocco."
"Small Moroccan producers are not the ones who benefit from our agreements, as they do not have the capacity to produce in conditions acceptable to the European market."
"Let us not confuse the issue, but do not mislead the MEPs either: that is my request to the Commission."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, if you will allow me, I will start with some figures because they were referred to by several speakers in their statements."
"I will use the Comext data for this."
"EU imports of tomatoes from Morocco grew from 185 000 tonnes in the 1999-2000 season to 295 000 tonnes in 2009-2010, following the normal trend of fresh fruit and vegetable imports from all over the world."
"At the same time, total additional EU imports of tomatoes increased from 242 000 tonnes to 493 000 tonnes. I have to underline that Morocco's share of total EU imports actually decreased from 76% to 59%."
"EU tomato production varies between 16 and 18 million tonnes per year, of which 6.5 to 7.5 million tonnes are destined for the fresh market."
"I think that it is very good to bear these figures in mind so that we can keep this discussion and the size of the problem in proportion."
"Regarding the new agreement with Morocco, we in the Commission believe that it is modest and balanced."
"If it is adopted, the Commission will, of course, ensure that all its conditions and rules are fully respected."
"Additional quantities under the tariff rate quota will be kept below the traditional average of supplies to the EU."
"The current average annual level is 300 000 tonnes. With an additional 52 000 tonnes, there will be 285 000 tonnes within the tariff rate quota, so there will still be scope for 15 000 tonnes of imports under the usual erga omnes regime."
"Turning to another problem raised, namely, the claim that we failed to act, I really cannot accept that because we did not find any systemic failure in the system."
"There was one case that was also presented here today in which OLAF investigated the problem and referred the whole file with the findings to the French court, which did not support the full extent of OLAF's findings, but nevertheless, the partial recovery of unpaid duties has started."
"I would also like to assure this House that, regarding control of phytosanitary standards, the Commission is assuring the highest possible control and the highest possible level of standards for every import of fresh fruit and vegetables to the European Union."
"At the same time, I have to say that I understand the vigilance of the Members of the European Parliament and the vigilance of the agricultural sector on these very pertinent issues."
"I would like to assure them that, if the organisations have concrete evidence of fraud, they are invited to bring this to the attention of the Commission, which will carefully analyse it and take appropriate action if needed."
"The debate is closed."

"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to speak briefly just to underline the importance of the Wojciechowski report on bluetongue for an institutional issue which concerns us all."
"As far as the content is concerned, there is no conflict between the Commission, Parliament and the Council."
"However, the inclusion of the correlation tables in the text remains a very sensitive issue."
"Despite the fact that the Council was totally opposed to it, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development decided to vote for a text that includes the correlation tables, which oblige Member States to report on transposition of the directive."
"It is now up to the Council to decide whether to accept the correlation tables and conclude the agreement at first reading, or to answer to European farmers for causing the bluetongue vaccination campaign to be missed this year in order not to give way on this point."
"I believe that this report can act as a precedent in future negotiations with the Council."
"We must be united and determined in calling for maximum transparency from Member States and in defending total compliance with EU law."
"I believe the rapporteur would also like the floor."

"I would merely add my voice to the appeal that the Council should not throw up obstacles to the rapid implementation of the new directive."
"The correlation tables are a start and a precedent which, in my opinion, will create best practice for the future, and will help to monitor more easily the compliance of European law with national law."

"Why, though, did I want to raise this subject again, now that the vote is over?"

"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is an important measure for the agricultural world."
"However, the measure needs to be followed up immediately by a commitment from the Council and national governments to adopt it forthwith, before the end of the season, in order to solve this problem which does not affect just the southern part of Europe, but the whole of Europe, as today's vote has shown."
"Bluetongue affects the sheep and cattle on our farms."
"Therefore, taking action to totally eradicate it is a health policy objective which national governments can best contribute to through this measure by being flexible."
"It also needs to be immediately adopted through transposition of the directive."
"(FI) Madam President, this was an extremely important subject for debate, and I think that it would have been important if Parliament had sent a clear message that we are very worried about what happened."
"We want to show the public that we are doing all we can to make nuclear power plants in Europe and in the world generally as safe as possible."
"We also, however, want to show that we can continue with nuclear power when there is greater certainty over the issue."
"It is a pity, however, that the majority here voted against this, and that the clear message was therefore not sent today."
"(DE) Madam President, I am somewhat disappointed that Parliament was unable to approve this by a majority today in order to learn sensible lessons from the reactor disaster in Japan."
"I consider it beyond question that this must mean organising a clear shift in energy policy away from nuclear energy - in order words, the beginning of a phase-out - at European level."
"Secondly, it should also be obvious that if we carry out stress tests, then any nuclear power plant that fails these tests is required to be removed from the grid."
"Neither of these proposals received a majority in the vote."
"I was therefore unable to support the resolution."
"I hope that we will soon succeed in organising a uniform energy policy that provides us with safe and sensible energy in the future, which means movement towards energy efficiency and renewable energies."
"(SK) Madam President, no one surely doubts that the accident in Fukushima showed the need to tighten up assessments of existing nuclear power plant operations and the construction of new plants."
"It will be necessary to review and adjust legislation, as well as the parameters of the stress tests on European nuclear plants, based on common criteria applied throughout the EU."
"In view of the fact that this is a global problem which knows no borders, there could even be an intercontinental agreement covered by global authorities."
"However, we must not rush into this, as we might throw out the baby with the bathwater."
"It is a matter of resolving purely professional problems, the politicisation of which can only do harm."
"We witness many demagogic claims that have no professional basis whatsoever every day in the media and also here in the European Parliament."
"Since the conclusions of the European Parliament debate fully reflect this conflict of opinions, I have abstained from the final vote on the position of Parliament."
"(FI) Madam President, I could not vote in favour of this resolution either, at least not in its present form when we came to vote on it."
"In Europe, our citizens fear for their safety, and with good reason."
"This should be a priority for us now."
"We need concrete measures to increase people's feelings of safety."
"This resolution divided opinions right across Parliament."
"It should not be a matter of whether we are against or in favour of nuclear power: we insist on minimum standards of safety for Europe as a whole."
"The stress tests proposed by the Commission will not be enough on their own to pacify the public."
"The Commission should investigate alternative energy solutions for the future, at the same time taking into consideration the different energy needs of the EU Member States."
"In my opinion, investing in nuclear power should not mean that there is less research or product development in the area of renewable energy sources."
"(SK) Madam President, the disaster in Fukushima has given rise to justified public fears over the use of nuclear energy, and it is therefore appropriate to think about the current situation in the EU, and to take decisive steps to improve safety, with which I agree, as well as transparency in the operation of nuclear plants and the protection of human health."
"In the current situation, it is not possible, with the best will in the world, to imagine a functioning, competitive electricity market without the contribution of nuclear energy in a balanced energy mix, whether we like it or not."
"The EU and the Member States have a duty to create an energy policy that will ensure the sovereignty, political independence and economic security of every state."
"The instruments for achieving this objective include a suitable energy mix, an adequate level of production capacity, a balance between supply and demand, reductions in the energy intensity of the economy and so on."
"I am not afraid of emphasising that nuclear energy is an important resource for electricity generation, because it contributes to greater energy security, particularly for states with limited reserves of solid fuels."
"I abstained from the final vote because it included a proposal to put through a moratorium on new reactors."
"I certainly disagree with that."
"Madam President, I voted in favour of the amendment insisting on a nuclear-free future for Europe."
"The tragedy of Fukushima underlines the huge danger that nuclear power represents for humanity and for the environment."
"The potential for massive catastrophe and the lack of a safe way to dispose of spent nuclear fuel means that nuclear power does not represent a safe means to develop energy production."
"The tragedy also underlines the fact that private profiteers cannot be trusted with the vital task of energy production and energy distribution."
"Ultimately, the capitalist pursuit of profit, without regard for human life, human safety or the environment, is responsible for this crisis."
"I call for the nationalisation of the energy sector under democratic worker control and management."
"On that basis, we could develop a rational and sustainable plan for energy production, distribution and use, to provide cheap and safe energy for all, while protecting the environment."
"At the centre of that plan, there must be a long-term programme of investment in renewable energy sources leading to the progressive replacement of oil, gas, coal and nuclear power stations."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, after the tragedy of Fukushima, we all need to stop and think."
"Nuclear power is once more in the spotlight, and I believe we need to think above all of the future, of our children's future."
"It is true that we need energy, but we need clean energy and safe energy."
"Safety is all well and good, but it is not enough."
"A moratorium is not enough; we need to go further than that."
"The tragedy of Fukushima tells us that there is no such thing as zero-risk nuclear power stations."
"Above all, it tells us that we need to organise a rapid exit from nuclear power and to focus our attention on renewable, alternative power sources."
"Europe needs a new energy policy in order to halt the construction of new nuclear power stations because of the terrible impact these power stations could have on safety, the environment, the climate and future generations."
"A radical change of perspective is necessary, for a safe future based on saving energy and the use of renewable sources."
"(PL) Madam President, I voted in favour of adopting the resolution."
"The resolution was meant to be an expression of solidarity with the victims of the natural disaster and the nuclear accident which followed it, and also an expression of gratitude and recognition for all those who are risking their own lives to prevent an even greater catastrophe."
"I, too, am full of admiration for the solidarity, courage and determination with which the people of Japan are reacting to this disaster."
"I agree with the conclusion that the European Union must comprehensively review its approach to nuclear safety, but we cannot force Member States to abandon activities aimed at ensuring their own energy security, so I am pleased that we have rejected the unrealistic and dangerous provisions in our resolution."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Italian delegation from Italia dei Valori voted against the text of the resolution on nuclear power, because it was not clear enough to indicate a clear no to nuclear power."
"Unfortunately, all the amendments that could have improved the text and chosen a Europe free of nuclear power, immediately free of existing nuclear power stations and with no future nuclear power stations, were rejected."
"A Europe free of nuclear power is the only possible route if we want to guarantee that our children and future generations will have a future protected from the repetition of catastrophes like Fukushima and Chernobyl."
"These lessons tell us that there is no such thing as theoretical safety."
"That is why we have to say a clear no to the nuclear option and invest in research and innovation in other sources that are truly green, renewable and clean."
"(DE) Madam President, I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution and I find it deeply regrettable that Parliament has not succeeded in reaching a uniform position today."
"I particularly address this to those Members who were demanding more."
"I think it would have been better to vote for the compromise, because I am aware that the European Union contains very differing views on the issue of nuclear energy."
"It is precisely because environmental effects and the impact of disasters know no national boundaries that I would consider it important to adopt and accept the minimum requirements."
"In the first place, we need a uniform safety standard in the European Union."
"Secondly, we need to make provision for any future incidents or disasters; in other words, we need a European disaster recovery plan."
"Thirdly, we should not continue to neglect research in the area of renewable energies, but also in the area of nuclear fusion and into the establishment of storage facilities and the recycling of carbon fuels."
"Madam President, I also am disappointed that this House was not able to send a balanced and reasonable message."
"There is no doubt that the damage to the Fukushima nuclear power plant is a disaster, but the final death toll will not be counted in thousands or hundreds, and perhaps not even in tens."
"As a result of the world's most severe earthquake recorded in that area, there will be an estimated 30 000 to 40 000 deaths due to destroyed roads, bridges, railway lines and buildings."
"Should we demolish all similar structures in the EU, just in case?"
"That is my question."
"Nuclear technology is not at fault in Japan; the location is."
"A panic reaction in Europe is therefore not only ridiculous but it could also damage the environment because there is no credible supply of a low carbon alternative to nuclear energy, and fossil fuels will prosper."
"Do we really want that?"
"(FI) Madam President, everyone in Europe must be concerned about safety, and that is important."
"We have to build systems that are safe."
"Of course, it has to be said that there has been something of an overreaction since Fukushima."
"On the other hand, that is only natural."
"I remember the time when the Estonia sank: some were of the opinion that all ships should be banned, because they are dangerous."
"Well, individuals can have such thoughts."
"Now, though, we need to remember that just one out of 54 nuclear power plants did not get through the test to which the tsunami and earthquake subjected them."
"Despite that, however, we now need to examine things calmly and remember that you cannot generalise on the basis of an individual case."
"In fact, 300 000 Europeans die each year from the effects of fossil fuel emissions, and that is something we should look into first."
"It is very important to ensure that nuclear technology is safe, and I know that in Europe, we will also construct plants safely in the future, and attention needs to be paid to this."
"Nevertheless, there is absolutely no cause for misplaced hysteria on this scale."
"Madam President, can I say I abstained on the votes all of the way through on this."
"This was not because I am not concerned about the issue, as I really am concerned about this issue, but I realise that it has to be nuanced and there are no easy answers."
"I live in Ireland, I represent Dublin, which is on the east coast of Ireland."
"Along the west coast of Britain there are five active nuclear plants; I have no objection to them."
"However, I do think that in the area of nuclear safety and in the interests of good neighbourliness, it would be a good idea to have some form of joint British/Irish - when I say Irish, I mean North-South Irish - safety overview of the workings of those plants so that we would be informed about the risks, if there are any."
"Furthermore, in the event of an accident, we could participate in any evacuation that there might need to be for people in Wales or England, so that we could play our part as a good neighbour."
"Within Member States, where there are neighbour Member State countries with facilities of this kind, there needs to be good neighbourly cooperation."
"That is the reason why I wished to make this explanation."
"(FI) Madam President, in Syria, Bahrain and Yemen, people have tried to stand up for human dignity, transparency, fundamental rights and the right to democracy."
"The European Union has shown willing and ability in protecting Libya's civilian population and supporting the democratic revolution."
"We must avoid double standards and show that we will act in accordance with our values in European Union foreign policy."
"The situation in North Africa and the Middle East is a real acid test of Europe's new External Action Service."
"A viable, fair society needs genuine dialogue and interaction between civil society and the political decision makers."
"The people have to be listened to, and this is something of which we want to remind Syria, Bahrain and Yemen."
"We are not fomenting revolution."
"The satisfaction, safety and welfare of the people are the priority of a state that respects justice."
"With this resolution, we are showing that Europe, in its foreign policy, stands by the values for which it was also established."
"Madam President, I abstained on the vote on the situation in Syria, Bahrain and Yemen."
"The revolutionary movements that started in Tunisia have inspired and encouraged millions of people across North Africa and the Middle East to engage in popular uprisings against the brutal regimes that have dictatorially ruled those countries for decades."
"Those uprisings have once again proven the potential power of the working class and the poor to stand up and defeat their oppressors."
"I denounce the hypocrisy of the leaders of the EU and other Western countries who today condemn the brutal repression that is used by these dictatorial leaders, but who yesterday supported, and provided a lifeline for, their regimes."
"It is now vital that the masses unite across ethnic and religious lines to clean out the corrupt elites and build genuine democratic societies that can provide decent jobs, decent education and end poverty."
"To achieve that, the working class and poor must take control over the economy and wealth that exists in the region and use it in the interests of the majority."
"(PL) Madam President, we have recently witnessed mass demonstrations in countries such as Syria, Bahrain and Yemen."
"The protesters are demanding democracy in public life, the resignation of dictators and also, especially in Syria, the lifting of the state of emergency."
"However, the authorities in these countries are using brute force against the demonstrators, killing many people."
"It is particularly worrying that the whole region is threatened."
"Using force against your own citizens is a violation of every law."
"Using live ammunition is indefensible and demands categorical condemnation."
"I appeal to the governments of these countries to stop the repression, in the name of human rights, including the right to peaceful protest and freedom of speech."
"I call on European institutions and the relevant international organisations to set in motion diplomatic measures in order to protect the demonstrators."
"I hope that, in adopting today's resolution, we will also contribute to the protection of fundamental human rights in these countries."
"(FI) Madam President, the European Union obviously knows that it has to implement its own fundamental values in its policy."
"Human rights are one key area; they must be exported to the Middle East."
"We really need to present a concept and understanding of what human rights mean."
"That is not easy, because Middle Eastern culture is based on different values."
"We in Europe have been brought up in a world of Judaeo-Christian values, whilst theirs come from Islamic thinking."
"In both, people are treated differently, and the notion of a human being is different."
"In any case, Syria has been under emergency law since 1963."
"This has allowed the execution of people without trial."
"Now, this uprising shows us that in Europe, we really need to open our eyes and see that the only success story in the Middle East is its sole democratic state: Israel, where there are human rights, freedom of opinion and democracy."
"We should now exert more of this type of influence on Syria, Bahrain and Yemen, so that they might accept human rights for all and, furthermore, the rights of women and children, thereby, perhaps, taking the path to democracy."
"I am not naïve, however, and I know that in the Islamic world, it is difficult to take these values forward."
"Nevertheless, as Europeans, we should try to export and promote them."
"Madam President, I abstained on the 2010 report on Iceland."
"As a result of the financial and economic crisis, Iceland went from being the fifth richest country in the world to being a country racked by crisis, with the collapse of its banking system, where 40% of households could not pay their bills and pensioners lost their life's savings."
"Last year, 93% of the Icelandic population, in a referendum, rejected the notion of paying more than EUR 3.5 billion to the governments of Britain and the Netherlands."
"Despite some modifications, they are faced with essentially the same deal in the vote to be held on 9 April."
"They should not be bullied into accepting this deal; the deal should be rejected."
"It is not the responsibility of the Icelandic people to pay for the crisis."
"Workers, pensioners and poor people have not created this crisis and must not pay for it; not in Iceland, not in Greece, not in Portugal, not in Spain, not in Ireland nor elsewhere."
"Those international speculators who profited massively from the deregulation of the financial markets must pay."
"(DE) Madam President, I am always pleased when new members join the European Union, which is why I also voted in favour of this motion."
"However, I would like to see all issues being placed clearly on the table during the accession negotiations and being discussed and dealt with beforehand."
"Problems that are not dealt with out of misplaced amicability do not go away."
"It is often a harder, more protracted process to resolve them subsequently and the result is mutual disappointment."
"Let me reiterate: I am always pleased when a new member joins the EU, but every member has not just rights but also responsibilities."
"(FI) Madam President, I apologise for the incident before the vote."
"You were quite right."
"The European Union has promised the Balkan countries an opportunity for enlargement."
"I consider that to be the only guarantee of peace there, as Martti Ahtisaari also said before me."
"For the second consecutive year, the Commission is recommending the commencement of membership talks with regard to Macedonia."
"The European Union cannot hide behind the dispute over Macedonia's name in its accession process."
"The formal membership requirements must, of course, be met, and reforms need to be carried out."
"The dispute over Macedonia's name would not be the first time a new Member State brought insoluble problems with it."
"We should all take a look in the mirror."
"Why should we treat Macedonia any differently?"
"Macedonia's progress, first and foremost, depends on Macedonia itself, but the EU should not shut the door in its face for political reasons like the dispute over its name."
"(DE) Madam President, I also voted in favour of this report and of this resolution - in favour of Macedonia."
"However, if we are being honest about this, then there is one detail that must be mentioned."
"We cannot tell people and ethnic groups in other countries to rename their language because other countries do not like what they call it."
"That is laid down in international law, and as Europeans we must be sure that we remain honest about this."
"I was consequently very annoyed that unfortunately, one amendment was passed that I voted against, which stated that Macedonian should not be allowed to be called Macedonian."
"Macedonia is a country with great prospects in Europe mainly because it also has great economic prospects in the Balkans, a region that has genuine difficulties, is prospering economically, and is conducting the negotiations with élan - which is very positive."
"In view of this positive attitude, I would like to thank all the Members who voted for this resolution, as well as all those who worked with the parliament there as part of the European Parliament delegation."
"We should make these prospects clear to the people there who want to be part of Europe."
"Let us work together to that end."
"(PL) Madam President, the brutal battle for power between the outgoing and the newly-elected President of Côte d'Ivoire which has been raging for over four months is in contravention of every principle on which the modern world functions."
"Bloody battles have led to the deaths of several hundred people living in the country."
"Over a million inhabitants of Côte d'Ivoire have had to leave their homes, and many refugees are still seeking shelter in neighbouring countries."
"Everything should be done to bring those guilty of crimes to justice."
"Above all, it should be investigated whether genocide and crimes against humanity did take place."
"It is also becoming absolutely vital to ensure order and the safety of citizens by bringing all forms of violence to an end."
"Intimidation of the local population and of foreign observers cannot be allowed to happen."
"The results of democratic elections must be complied with in full."
"As a result, the actions of the former president which contravene the will of the nation should be condemned."
"Usurping power, inciting violence and violating human rights demand judgment by the relevant international authorities."
"(FI) Madam President, I willingly voted in favour of this resolution."
"I think that it is very important, in particular, that we adopt a clear and tough position on Belarus, which is an obvious blot on the map of Europe."
"We have to implement measures that allow Belarus to find a path to democracy."
"In particular, however, and with regard to the vote, I would like to go through Amendment 1 to point 10 tabled by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, where they stated that the EU's partner countries have a longterm opportunity to join the EU."
"I voted against that, because I do not think that we should make it automatic, or flirt with the idea that any state can become a member as long as it is a partner."
"We know what the public think of hasty enlargement, and, for that reason, proposals of this nature should not be adopted."
"That is why I voted against this."
"(PL) Madam President, the Eastern Dimension of the European Neighbourhood Policy is a strategic element of the European Union's international relations."
"Further expansion will take place in this direction."
"Therefore, it is essential to increase expenditure in order to develop the democratic structures of these countries."
"Support for initiatives such as Bielsat have a not inconsiderable significance for the independence of the media in Belarus, at the same time as withdrawing assistance for the state-controlled media."
"I would call for active support to be given to local democratic authorities in these countries through partnership programmes."
"Association agreements remain an important tool in stimulating reform, and the more funding and technical support they can provide, the better their results."
"Widening the intellectual base through scholarship programmes also requires additional funds."
"I appeal for an increase in funding to support human rights and the development of civil societies."
"Deepening social integration will help to influence social and political change, and is a vital investment in the future."
"Therefore, I support the resolution."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, 21 documentary references, 21 explanatory comments and 63 points summarising Parliament's requests in the motion for a resolution, making a total of 105 points."
"That seems far too many to be effective."
"On this issue, however, there is no proposal as to how the development of international trade could help achieve stability, and with it tranquillity and peace in the Southern Mediterranean areas."
"International trade has become a form of new foreign policy, and could help to create better living conditions throughout the region."
"The European Union must not neglect anything that could favour the development of proper trade relations, stimulating production in the various industries."
"Any progress in this field will help to promote democracy and human rights, safeguarding the dignity of women, increasing security, stability, prosperity and a fair distribution of income and wealth, and avoiding the tragedy of thousands of people fleeing hunger and emigrating without any real hope."
"Written explanations of vote"
"I am in favour of this report, which amends Directive 2000/75/EC."
"Both the Council and Parliament agree on changing the legal basis due to the fact that the Commission's proposal had been submitted before the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"In my view, these amendments are justified due to the spread of the disease, and because the scientific discovery of a vaccine does not pose the risks that the previous one did."
"I voted in favour of the report by Mr Wojciechowski which, through a series of interesting amendments to the Commission's text, seeks to update and make more flexible a dated piece of legislation that is no longer in step with contingent needs."
"This would help Member States to make more efficient use of vaccination against bluetongue, thereby reducing the incidence of the disease in the farming sector."
"I am pleased with the amendments set out in this directive, which makes the rules relating to vaccination more flexible."
"Thanks to the new technology, 'inactivated vaccines' against bluetongue are available, and do not pose any risk to non-vaccinated animals."
"It is now agreed that vaccination with inactivated vaccines is the best tool for controlling bluetongue and preventing clinical disease in the EU."
"The widespread use of these vaccines during the 2008 and 2009 vaccination campaign resulted in a significant improvement in the health situation."
"I would like to call for the amendment of the existing rules on vaccination set out in Directive 2000/75/EC, in order to take account of recent technological advances in the production of vaccines, to ensure that the spread of the bluetongue virus is better controlled, and to reduce the burdens on the agricultural sector caused by this disease."
"in writing. - I voted for this report."
"However, whilst I believe in the principle of enabling the competent authority, i.e. the Member State, to vaccinate against bluetongue, I am opposed to the principle of including in legislation the requirement to provide tables on transposition into national law."
"In the past, vaccination against bluetongue was carried out using live attenuated vaccines, which called for a series of restrictions on vaccination so as to avoid the spread of the virus to unvaccinated animals."
"However, scientific advances have allowed the creation of new inactivated vaccines."
"Unlike 'live attenuated vaccines', these can be used safely and without any restrictions, as they pose no risk of circulating an active virus."
"Given the serious consequences of bluetongue for livestock faming, all measures that make vaccination easier and more effective should be taken in order to protect farmers from the loss of animals, and, ultimately, in order to protect food security."
"Bluetongue is a disease that mainly affects ruminant animals such as sheep, goats and cows, and may take the form of an epidemic if the environmental and climatic conditions are favourable to it, particularly in late summer and early autumn."
"Although there is no record of any human being infected, it is vital to recognise this disease and seek to implement measures that will eradicate it."
"At EU level, this disease was first seen in the south, and then in the centre and north of Europe."
"Thanks to successive vaccination campaigns cofinanced by the EU, the use of certain vaccines may not eradicate the disease, but allow it to continue to circulate."
"A type of vaccine was therefore developed that ensures the control and prevention of this disease in the EU, but the use of which is restricted under current rules."
"A change to the current directive is therefore needed."
"Given that this proposal for an amendment to the Parliament and Council Directive 2000/75/EC complies with the Animal Health strategy (2007-2013) and points towards a more flexible approach in the vaccination system, thereby contributing to improved control of major animal diseases, I am voting in favour."
"This report aims to update Directive 2000/75/EC, which adopts certain provisions relating to measures for combating and eradicating bluetongue."
"Over recent years, advances have been made in the field of animal vaccination."
"The risks of the so-called 'live attenuated vaccines' are no longer a threat, as new inactivated vaccines are now available."
"These inactivated vaccines, unlike 'live attenuated vaccines', do not pose the risk of an undesired circulation of the virus from the vaccine, and can be used safely outside areas subjected to restrictions."
"This is noted in the report."
"We believe that greater flexibility in bluetongue vaccination, taking account of the technological developments in producing vaccines, will contribute to better control of the disease and reduce the burdens that it brings to bear on the agricultural sector."
"We also believe that the amendments to this directive need to be implemented as quickly as possible, in order to benefit the agricultural sector."
"I voted in favour of this report, because bluetongue is a disease affecting ruminants (such as cattle, sheep and goats)."
"Since the early 2000s, several epidemic waves of disease have occurred in many Member States, including central and northern Europe, causing significant losses in terms of morbidity, mortality and disruption of trade in live animals."
"Hitherto, the provisions for the control and eradication of bluetongue have been based on experience of the use of live attenuated vaccines that were the only vaccines available."
"Those vaccines may lead to undesired circulation of the vaccine virus in unvaccinated animals."
"In the last few years, however, new inactivated vaccines have become available."
"Unlike the 'live attenuated vaccines', these inactivated vaccines do not pose the risk of undesired vaccine virus circulation and can therefore be successfully used outside areas subject to animal movement restrictions."
"This proposal would relax some restrictions, which have become unnecessary in light of the recent developments in vaccine production."
"The new rules would help Member States to make more effective use of vaccination to control bluetongue and reduce the burden on the agricultural sector posed by this disease."
"As a result of technical innovation, newer vaccinations against bluetongue have appeared on the market which were unavailable when the Commission was drawing up its directive."
"This is why I am supporting the rapporteur's view that the regulations governing vaccinations should be updated, which will make it easier for animal breeders to produce healthy animals."
"Making the regulations more flexible and liberalising them will allow for more effective breeding, and, above all, will make the protection of animals against unwanted and dangerous diseases more effective."
"I also fully support this initiative from the point of view of its nature, as, in order to make the legal system more effective, we should simplify it as much as possible and make it more flexible, and the above report fulfils this aim."
"Bluetongue is a horrible animal epidemic affecting ruminants that has caused great damage throughout the livestock sector."
"The economic damage and the losses resulting from the trade coming to a standstill are hitting the farming sector hard."
"In Austria, too, where cattle breeding has a long tradition, many farmers have found their livelihoods threatened."
"It is now important to implement supporting measures and revise the old regulation before the next epidemic breaks out."
"The rules on vaccination that applied at that time need to be adapted to technological developments in order to combat bluetongue more effectively and reduce the burden on farmers."
"I welcome the rapid action at EU level and advocate the fast implementation of the new directive."
"As a representative of the farming community, I know how important it is to think in terms of the annual cycle."
"Making a decision quickly will allow us to have a usable and uniform ruling by the autumn, which is in the interests of the Member States and, above all, of those that keep animals."
"Bluetongue is a disease affecting ruminants."
"Since the early 2000s, it has caused significant losses of animals affected by the disease."
"Europe intervened with Council Directive 2000/75/EC to deal with the problem through provisions regulating the use of 'attenuated vaccines', in order to effectively combat the consequences of the phenomenon."
"The vaccines used hitherto, which were those to which the aforementioned directive applied, led to the risk of transmission of the virus to unvaccinated animals, which is the reason why vaccination was only allowed in specially designated zones."
"Unlike the ones on the market at the time Council Directive 2000/75/EC was introduced, the new vaccines available are 'inactivated vaccines', and do not pose this kind of risk."
"I voted in favour of this report because the new provisions will allow Member States to control the phenomenon, thus reducing the negative impact of this disease on a large number of European livestock farmers."
"I hope that this will help enable the urgent measures to be adopted as soon as possible within the next few months."
"in writing. - I voted for this resolution."
"I support the substance of the Commission proposal."
"It would relax some restrictions, which have become unnecessary in light of the recent developments in vaccine production."
"The new rules would help Member States to make more effective use of vaccination to control bluetongue and reduce the burden on the agricultural sector posed by this disease."
"Vaccination against bluetongue was carried out using live attenuated vaccines, which called for a series of restrictions on vaccination so as to avoid the spread of the virus to unvaccinated animals."
"However, recent technological advances have led to the discovery of new vaccines without the live virus."
"These new vaccines can be used more safely and without any restrictions, as there is no longer any risk of circulating an active virus."
"Given the serious consequences of bluetongue for livestock farms, all measures that facilitate good practice in vaccination should be adopted so as to protect farmers from the loss of animals, which can cause damage that often proves fatal for such farms."
"Animal epidemics can still destroy the livelihoods of farmers."
"One of these is bluetongue, of which there have been repeated epidemics in Northern Europe since 2000 and which can cause particularly great damage."
"Cattle and sheep are particularly badly affected by the disease, which is caused by a virus transmitted by the gnat, a type of midge."
"An illness has also been observed in goats, but the course of the disease is far less dramatic in these than in the case of other species."
"The possibility of vaccination was first permitted in 2000, but was subject to strict rules since untreated animals could also have been infected by the viruses through the vaccine."
"However, now there is a new vaccination method that does not pose this risk, allowing more flexible forms of vaccination to be carried out."
"I voted in favour of the report because I consider it right and proper to protect our livestock from epidemic diseases."
"The flexibility called for will allow farmers to protect their animals."
"For some years, there have been repeated occurrences linked to bluetongue, particularly in Northern Europe."
"This is an animal epidemic affecting ruminants such as cattle, sheep and goats."
"The consequences were serious, both for livestock and for farmers."
"I voted in favour of this report because it advocates the introduction of an innovative vaccine which, unlike its predecessor, carries no risk of healthy animals being infected as a result of vaccination."
"The Commission's proposal on vaccination against bluetongue, which is improved in this report, aims to make the rules on vaccination against bluetongue more flexible, in particular, by allowing the use of inactivated vaccines outside areas subjected to restrictions on the circulation of animals."
"The new rules will help the Member States to make the use of vaccines to control bluetongue more effective and to reduce the burden that this disease places on the agricultural sector."
"Indeed, since 2004, measures to restrict mobility and marketability have necessitated major constraints on the products affected, affecting the normal trade channels within the area subjected to restrictions and resulting in increased costs for producers."
"For this reason, I voted in favour of the report on vaccination against bluetongue."
"in writing. - I voted in favour."
"Bluetongue is a disease affecting ruminants such as cattle, sheep and goats."
"Since the early 2000s, several epidemic waves of disease have occurred in many Member States, including in central and northern Europe, causing significant losses in terms of morbidity, mortality and disruption of trade in live animals."
"Council Directive 2000/75/EC of 20 November 2000 lays down specific provisions for the control and eradication of bluetongue, including rules on vaccination."
"These rules were designed for the use of 'live attenuated vaccines' that were the only vaccines available when the directive was adopted a decade ago."
"Those vaccines may lead to undesired circulation of the vaccine virus in unvaccinated animals."
"For this reason, Directive 2000/75/EC allows vaccination only in specially designated zones in which the disease has occurred and which have been subject to animal movement restrictions."
"In the last few years, however, new inactivated vaccines have become available."
"Unlike the 'live attenuated vaccines', these inactivated vaccines do not pose the risk of undesired vaccine virus circulation and could therefore be successfully used outside areas subject to animal movement restrictions."
"In order to ensure a more effective fight against bluetongue and reduce the burden it poses on the agricultural sector, the current rules on vaccination need to be updated."
"The report voted on today aims to make the current rules more flexible, as inactivated vaccines have now become available."
"These can be used successfully outside areas subject to animal movement restrictions."
"The proposal is in line with the new Animal Health strategy for the European Union (2007-2013) 'Prevention is better than cure', as it involves both a more flexible approach to vaccination and an improvement in the current measures for combating the principal diseases in animals."
"in writing. - The EPLP wholeheartedly supports the report aimed at amending Directive 2000/75/EC with a view to allowing the use of inactivated vaccines against bluetongue outside areas subject to animal movement restrictions."
"The new law ushers in the use of a new bluetongue vaccine for the first time, which takes advantage of developments in science since the previous rules came into force."
"The new vaccine will be an 'inactivated' jab and will allay farmers' fears over the traditional 'live' vaccines."
"The EPLP is delighted that the EU has brought in this new law, which has real benefits for farmers in the UK."
"It reassures farmers who are concerned by the deadly disease and the existing vaccination as the bluetongue season approaches with the warmer weather."
"Farmers will now have a new and safer vaccine available and will be given greater powers over their own vaccination programmes."
"Until now, farmers would have lost the right to vaccinate their animals if the UK was declared entirely free from bluetongue."
"But under the new law, farmers are given the power to keep vaccinating for their own peace of mind, whilst profiting from easier exports."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this report which will assist in the fight against bluetongue disease within the EU."
"in writing. - I voted to change the rules on vaccination against bluetongue disease in order to allow the use of more effective vaccines and to reduce red tape for farmers."
"The new law will have real benefits to farmers across Europe and especially in Wales."
"The UK will be granted bluetongue-free status, but farmers will still be allowed to vaccinate their animals against the deadly disease."
"Giving farmers greater powers to make their own decisions concerning vaccinations is a welcome boost to the farming industry in Wales and will ensure that livestock can be exported without the current restrictions."
"I am in favour of this resolution because its main aim is to ensure the highest level of security for populations following disasters like the one that happened recently in Japan."
"The technical aspects of safe energy trapping should be very carefully considered because a situation like the one that we are seeing now can have even more severe consequences in terms of both human health and the environment, in addition to its material impact."
"I voted against the resolution on the lessons to be drawn for nuclear safety in Europe following the nuclear accident in Japan."
"I voted against the resolution because when voting on the fifth subparagraph, the majority of the European Parliament approved its second part, which calls for a moratorium on the development of nuclear energy and the construction of new nuclear power plants in the European Union."
"This provision was adopted, although my group - the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) - voted against it."
"Having lost the vote on this important issue, I could not vote in favour of this resolution."
"I therefore voted against it, otherwise I would have been voting against my own country Lithuania's energy strategy, the main objective of which is energy independence."
"For some years, Lithuania has been gearing up for the construction of a new nuclear power plant and preparations have been taking place for several years."
"The Fukushima nuclear disaster has had a series of repercussions on European political life."
"The first lesson that the EU has drawn from the Japanese catastrophe has been to take prompt action to tighten safety checks at nuclear power installations by means of stress tests."
"Every nuclear power installation, whether inside or outside Europe, has the potential to be a weapon of destruction."
"I believe that none of us would wish to relive the Chernobyl disaster of 26 April 1986."
"The second lesson is that science and technology may make giant leaps forward in all areas, but they always have to take into account a major constraint, which is nature and its unpredictability."
"It is precisely because of events outside the control of humans that we should diversify our energy sources, including by leveraging the renewable energy sources available to us."
"However, if nuclear power were to be chosen as a source of energy, people should first be informed about the costs, benefits and consequences of such a choice."
"It is important not to forget that this choice of technology must be endorsed by popular consensus, and that the opinion of the people must be listened to and respected."
"in writing. - I voted against this report because of its several flaws, starting with its approach to the nuclear issue."
"After the Japanese tragedy, it is no longer possible to deal with the nuclear argument solely in terms of safety."
"The title of the report is 'on the lessons to be drawn for nuclear safety in Europe following the nuclear accident in Japan', but there is no special lesson to be drawn except that confirming the practical impossibility of controlling both the risks and consequences of a major nuclear accident."
"A resolution on this subject cannot be centred around the issue of nuclear safety without addressing the most important nuclear safeguard, which is an exit strategy from nuclear energy itself."
"We must react to the nuclear accident in Japan."
"That does not mean that we should draw any hasty conclusions."
"We must hold calm, objective discussions on the state of nuclear power in Europe and on the means to ensure maximum security."
"Hence, I support the intention to make European nuclear power stations undergo extensive stress tests, included in the joint resolution."
"As regards the broader issue of energy sources in Europe, may I remind you that we need to bear in mind the target of a 20% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2020, as well as the protection of the EU's energy independence."
"I voted in favour of this resolution, although not all of the amendments proposed by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats were adopted during the vote."
"The resolution text contains particularly important provisions on the nuclear power plants planned for the Kaliningrad region and Belarus."
"The resolution notes that there are major problems with the constructions mentioned concerning nuclear safety standards and compliance with appropriate obligations in accordance with international conventions."
"These problems are not just relevant for Lithuania, which shares its borders with Belarus and the Kaliningrad region, but for the whole of Europe."
"The document also contains important proposals to ensure compliance with the highest nuclear safety requirements and to undertake comprehensive testing in nuclear power plants already operating in the EU, so that it is possible to assess the true safety status of such power plants."
"The EU's response to the disaster in Japan has been the right one: we have responded rapidly, without panicking."
"We have immediately cleared the way for a thorough investigation under European supervision."
"It is crucial that 1. the stress tests are carried out by independent experts and that 2. the results of those tests are acted on rigorously."
"That means that nuclear installations which do not conform to the standards, which continue to fail to make the grade, should be closed down."
"Obviously, power plants elsewhere in Europe, outside of the EU, should be subject to the same independent testing, under the aegis of the International Atomic Energy Agency."
"Any state which refuses to participate in this will be making itself an international pariah, even in terms of international trade."
"Nuclear power has been, and remains, a transitional technology, a technology which we will, unfortunately, have to hang onto for decades to come."
"We will even have to make new investments in order to meet our energy needs and, at the same time, consolidate our climate ambitions."
"During that time, we must do everything possible to reduce the risk of accidents to a level that borders on zero."
"The pro-nuclear lobbies still have a bright future ahead of them!"
"There is no point in going over the context of this resolution, it was totally obvious."
"Yet the European Parliament does not have a position on nuclear power."
"That is a real pity."
"Several clearly identified issues were on the table: that of a moratorium on the construction of new nuclear power plants, the conducting of independent stress tests, the development of renewable forms of energy, and the efforts in the key area of energy efficiency."
"However, the initial good intentions of a joint resolution were quickly smashed to pieces: since each parliamentary group took a position for or against, it became impossible, in the end, to vote for this draft, which has no political message."
"Let us be clear: I had come to expect much more of the European Parliament."
"It is clear that the pro-nuclear lobbies still have a bright future ahead of them and, at the same time, that many MEPs still fail to understand the public's thoughts and feelings on this issue."
"It concerns me that the European Parliament (EP) has today failed to approve the compromise form of the resolution on nuclear safety in Europe, following the nuclear accident in Japan."
"I consider it shameful that the EP is incapable of offering the public its opinion on nuclear power."
"As a result of this disunity, it may be the case that in the forthcoming talks between European bodies over the form of the stress tests for power plants, the EP will be ignored."
"The greens and socialists were evidently unable to accept the fact that their proposals to stop using nuclear power, or to close nuclear plants built before 1980, did not go through."
"I voted against this joint motion for a resolution."
"The compromise resolution was a good starting point, and I supported the amendments in favour of a carefully planned and prepared phase-out of nuclear power, reflecting the fight against global warming."
"I also voted in favour of the amendments calling for investment in research and innovation, in order to promote energy saving and greatly increase the number of renewable forms of energy."
"However, the outcome of the vote - the incoherent vote - forced me to vote against the amended resolution."
"It is now vital to hold an in-depth debate on all these issues and to carry out an energy transition in a spirit of solidarity, taking into account the situation in all the Member States."
"in writing. - I am disappointed by the voting on this resolution."
"We are debating the lessons for nuclear safety in Europe following the crisis in Japan."
"However, my firm conviction is that there is no such thing as safe nuclear power and that the stress tests taking place this year are a distraction from the real issue - the transition to a Europe powered by renewable energy."
"Given the most recent studies, it is clear that it is technically possible that 95% of our energy supplies could come from renewables like wind, tidal, wave, solar and biomass by 2050."
"With that target in mind, and as we are now making long-term energy choices, we should be phasing out nuclear plants over the coming years across Europe."
"I regret that Parliament has not drawn any lessons from what has happened in Japan."
"Continuing to deny the great risks of using nuclear energy is not the best way to serve the public."
"The plenary in Parliament was not able to adopt a resolution, with the unedifying spectacle of groups cancelling each other out and rejecting one another's proposals without being able to adopt anything in common."
"More should have been made of the transnational nature of the risks and consequences of these disasters, and the safety of the people."
"The obvious conclusions should have been to step up nuclear security, test weaknesses, freeze nuclear expansion projects in the EU and invest more effectively in clean energy and in energy conservation."
"Closing one's eyes to what has happened in Japan and pretending that nothing has taken place is insensitive and dangerous."
"Chernobyl and Fukushima have only heightened the call for greater transparency and more information about the risks and the disasters."
"in writing. - I wish to place on the record the fact that I did not participate in the vote on the individual paragraphs of, and amendments to, the joint resolution."
"Even though I have consistently opposed nuclear power, I feel that the discussion was used by extreme opinion on both sides of the nuclear argument and this ensured that a common ground could not be found in Parliament."
"I believe that we must ensure that all facilities are checked to allow for the maximum protection of facilities and, more importantly, for the safety and security of the populations in their locations."
"Obviously, we must ensure security of supply of power in a sustainable way and we have an opportunity to look at alternative sources of power which we can exploit whilst, at the same time, helping the environment."
"This ideological debate, however, must not take away from the immediate concern of assisting the Japanese people in every way possible to recover from this disaster."
"This is why I abstained on the final vote."
"I deeply regret the exploitation for partisan ends of the disaster that has struck Japan."
"The European Parliament has missed an opportunity to send a strong message to the Member States and the European Commission with the aim of improving the safety of nuclear power plants in Europe and in neighbouring countries, in particular, through stress tests."
"For that should be the focus of today's debate, so that we can ensure, on behalf of the public, that a form of energy that is still the main component of the energy mix in most European countries - and will certainly remain so over the next few years until a sustainable, renewable and non-CO2 emitting energy source can replace it and meet our society's electricity needs - is as safe as it can possibly be."
"On 11 March, Japan was hit by a massive earthquake, followed by a tsunami, that has caused the greatest nuclear crisis in the country's history, with the Fukushima nuclear plant suffering serious structural damage and having been in imminent danger since then of triggering a nuclear disaster of major proportions."
"These events led to a wave of reaction in Europe, with Commissioner Oettinger requesting the convocation of an extraordinary meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the German Chancellor deciding to suspend the decision to extend the lifetime of nuclear plants in her country by three months, and the Austrian Minister for the Environment, Mr Berlakivich, demanding that tests be carried out on European plants."
"It is vital that all possible lessons are learned from the Fukushima disaster, particularly with regard to the safety rules imposed on EU nuclear power plants, in order to ensure their safety and, ultimately, that of the European public."
"Again, at this difficult moment, I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere condolences and my solidarity to those affected by the disaster in Japan."
"The problems that occurred in the Fukushima nuclear power plant have put the discussion of energy from nuclear fusion on the agenda, since 30% of energy consumed in the EU has this origin, and there are countries where domestic production is 80%, such as France, and also countries without any nuclear power plants, such as Portugal and Austria."
"It is therefore imperative that the EU promotes a programme to check security in its nuclear power plants, especially by carrying out so-called 'stress tests'."
"These assessments should be based on a model of rigorous and harmonised evaluation, covering all the types of possible risks in a realistic scenario at European level, and they should be conducted by the end of this year, in an independent and coordinated way, encompassing all the existing and planned nuclear facilities in the EU."
"At present, nuclear energy is vital for ensuring the supply of energy with low carbon emissions in Europe."
"However, we must move towards greater energy efficiency and an increase in renewable energy."
"The Commission and the Member States should invest in the modernisation and expansion of European infrastructure in the field of energy, as well as in the interconnection of networks, in order to guarantee a reliable energy supply."
"Ensuring the safety of nuclear installations and preventing the risk of accidents in every way possible are important issues addressed in this resolution, which also calls on the Member States to impose 'a moratorium on the development and commissioning of new nuclear reactors, at least for the period during which the stress tests are conducted and evaluated'."
"However, we need to ensure that the tragedy that occurred in Japan is not an opportunity for the advancement of lobbies, or for progress to be made today only to be reversed in the future."
"Lessons need to be taken seriously and we must learn from this experience in order to diagnose failings and shortfalls in design and operational terms, which could lead to accidents at other facilities."
"This experience also needs to be taken into account as part of future energy developments."
"Experts from specialist bodies within the Member States and also from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) must be part of this assessment, while retaining their role, authority, autonomy and independence."
"As a technical, autonomous and independent body, recommendations regarding this subject should come from the IAEA with the proper support from the EU, and not the other way round."
"It is regrettable that this resolution is being used as a pretext for safeguarding the so-called common energy policy and its objectives of liberalising the energy sector."
"This motion for a resolution was not the best."
"That is why it was rejected, although it had some positive aspects, which is why we abstained."
"Ensuring the safety of nuclear installations and preventing the risk of accidents in every way possible are important issues addressed in this resolution, which also calls on the Member States to impose 'a moratorium on the development and commissioning of new nuclear reactors, at least for the period during which the stress tests are conducted and evaluated'."
"However, we need to ensure that the tragedy that occurred in Japan does not serve as a springboard for economic interest groups to open up new avenues, to the detriment of the interests and safety of the public."
"Instead, it is important to diagnose failings and shortfalls in design and operational terms, which could lead to accidents at other facilities."
"Experts from specialist bodies within the Member States and also from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) should be part of this assessment, while retaining their role, authority, autonomy and independence."
"Lessons need to be taken seriously, and the results of an analysis of this experience incorporated into future energy developments."
"We do not agree with interference in the energy policies of Member States or third countries: as a technical, autonomous and independent body, recommendations regarding this subject should come from the IAEA with the proper support from the EU."
"Japan is facing its greatest post-war disaster."
"The leaders of the country have described the destructive earthquake, combined with the giant tsunami waves and the subsequent nuclear threat, as the worst crisis since the US military dropped the atom bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki."
"Nature has wrought enormous and irreplaceable losses, especially in terms of human life and property."
"However, the situation in the Fukushima nuclear plant remains a threat."
"In an attempt to avert similar threats in the future, it would be right to consider implementing so-called stress tests of nuclear plants in EU Member States."
"These should show the extent to which the power plants are capable of withstanding similar disasters."
"A similar situation to the one in Japan could happen anywhere in Europe."
"It is therefore also desirable to have more stringent monitoring of safety systems at nuclear power plants, strengthening their weak aspects and eliminating any deficiencies."
"It is in the interest of individual countries, and also within their capabilities, to look for a solution to the nuclear issue - whether through safety improvements, or complete decommissioning."
"Cooperation at the European level, however, is essential."
"Although Europe is not threatened by giant tsunami waves, there is the threat in the 21st century of, for example, terrorist attacks, attacks by computer hackers on nuclear power plant systems and so on. From a security perspective, the extent to which power plants can counter such potential threats is very much open to question."
"I did not support the resolution, firstly because it did not contribute anything positive in addition to bans, restrictions and a general aversion to nuclear technology."
"Secondly, it does not indicate any way out of a completely new situation for energy policy as a whole."
"For example, points 19, 20 and 21 could have introduced new ideas and orientations in terms of integrated thinking about energy efficiency, especially efficiency with regard to energy from primary sources, of which we have the greatest reserves, especially fossil fuels."
"Thirdly, the radical suggestions it contains require a national referendum, which, in my country, is to take place at the initiative of the left-wing parties."
"Maybe such a referendum ought to be carried out at EU level."
"Fourthly, my country, as a result of the EU's misguided regulations to date, has been forced to halt essential investments in coal power stations, and now the same lobby is saying that we need to halt investments in nuclear technology."
"So what is left?"
"The resolution points only to energy from renewable sources."
"In my country, the total capacity of these resources would cover 13%, to a maximum of 20%, of essential needs."
"Maybe in Sweden the situation is different, as it has large reserves of hydropower, but not in Poland."
"The case of Fukushima requires a review of the whole of the European Union's current energy policy."
"The excitement that overcame certain political groups following the Fukushima nuclear accident, because they hoped to score political points off the back of it, is unacceptable."
"I do not remember the communists being so virulent after 1986's Chernobyl disaster."
"It is true, then: there is no such thing as 'zero risk' where nuclear power is concerned."
"There is no such thing as zero risk in life full stop."
"We must do all we can to minimise that risk."
"For the moment, however, we do not have any credible alternatives."
"Forcing the Member States urgently to abandon that energy source, to stop building new plants and to shut the others, is completely at odds with the outright rejection of fossil energy, on the pretext that its use would contribute to global warming."
"Nuclear energy or fossil energy: you may favour one over the other, but you cannot rule them both out."
"Neither hydropower nor today's alternative energy sources are capable of meeting our supply needs."
"Those countries that have stopped using nuclear power - but not preaching to the others - are, in fact, very happy that their neighbours, from whom they obtain their supplies, have not made the same choice as them!"
"Stop the hypocrisy."
"The parliamentary resolution on the lessons to be drawn from the nuclear accident in Japan contained some very positive points with regard to the safety of power plants, recommending, for example, 'stress tests' carried out in a coordinated manner at EU level by independent bodies working in accordance with the most exacting standards and completely transparently."
"Furthermore, like everyone else in the French socialist delegation, I supported the amendments in favour of a carefully planned and prepared phasing-out of nuclear power, reflecting the fight against global warming."
"That phasing-out of nuclear power will have to go hand in hand with increased investment in research and innovation, in order to reduce our energy dependence and increase the number of renewable forms of energy in the energy mix of the EU Member States."
"I did, however, vote against the motion as a whole, because it was merely a juxtaposition of viewpoints forming an inconsistent motion."
"After such a disastrous event as Fukushima, the question of the future of a sector as sensitive as nuclear energy requires more than a hastily put together resolution."
"We will now have to take the time necessary to organise a genuinely constructive debate, addressing all of the associated issues while enabling everyone to voice his or her opinion."
"This resolution cannot cover every aspect of the debate on nuclear energy in detail."
"However, I remain convinced that it must be our aim to progressively phase out this source of energy and to use renewable energy to a greater extent."
"Amendment 10 also proposed that in the case of nuclear power stations in border areas, the local and regional bodies must be involved in the decisions on both sides of the border."
"This amendment was not adopted."
"While some aspects of the resolution are indeed positive, Amendment 10 was decisive for me."
"That is why I decided no longer to support this resolution and to abstain."
"I am pleased that the European Parliament rejected this resolution."
"The lessons that we must draw post-Fukushima include recommending the introduction of stress tests, laying down new common safety standards in the EU, and protecting ourselves from every possible scenario."
"However, the introduction of a moratorium on new nuclear power plants for the period during which the stress tests are conducted in the EU is unacceptable."
"It will hinder the development of much safer new-generation plants."
"The aim here is not to establish whether the merits of this energy source should be called into question, and neither is it to succumb to the idealistic, obscurantist values of those who would like to ban it."
"To abandon nuclear energy is to ensure the promotion of highly polluting coal-fired plants; it is to fall back into the hands of the oil companies, with uncertain oil prices and the huge risk of a weakened economy; and hence, it is to spell the end of our energy independence."
"I voted against the joint resolution because of the rejection by the House of two key amendments presented by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament on the development of medium- to long-term strategies for the progressive phasing-out of nuclear power and the definition of binding renewable energy targets."
"The vote against the entire resolution by the House highlights the fact that the nuclear issue is no longer just one of greater safety."
"It is now vital that we begin to think seriously about the energy issue and about investment in renewable energies."
"Japan's tragic experience has shown us just how necessary it is to discuss nuclear power in depth."
"In this sense, the European Parliament's vote is the first step towards a change of direction in energy policy choices on both a European and an international scale."
"The disaster in Japan has awakened people's concern over nuclear safety."
"In the resolution from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, we emphasised that we wanted to make the proposed stress tests mandatory for the Member States and to allow independent experts to manage the implementation of the tests, and that the tests must be transparent."
"We abstained from the vote on the joint resolution, as it also contained a proposal for a moratorium on the development of new nuclear reactors while the stress tests were being carried out."
"Any problems are primarily associated with older reactors with older technology, not with new nuclear reactors with new technology."
"We do not wish to prohibit the development of new technology that will contribute to the EU's objective to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions."
"We are opposed to a ban on the whole idea of nuclear power."
"After the Chernobyl disaster in 1986, Sweden introduced rules that made it illegal to prepare for the construction of nuclear power plants."
"We also believe that Finland and Sweden should invest in nuclear energy research and take a leading role in the development of future generation nuclear reactors."
"The conclusion that can be drawn from the disaster in Japan is that we should not run nuclear power plants for so many years."
"The disaster can be seen more as an inspiration to build new nuclear reactors."
"I voted for the adoption of this resolution and I regret that Parliament was unable to agree on a single motion for a resolution on this topical subject."
"I consider that nuclear energy must remain as an important and safe source of European energy."
"I support the demand for comprehensive stress tests, which must be carried out both in all existing and all planned nuclear power stations, and satisfactory results in respect of which must be the precondition for their remaining in operation."
"I share the concerns expressed in this motion for a resolution that the development of new nuclear projects in Belarus and Russia (the Kaliningrad oblast) gives rise to serious concerns about nuclear safety standards and compliance with the obligations contained in international conventions, and that Europeans, Member States and the European Commission must respond to these concerns in a spirit of solidarity."
"That is why our Union must ensure that these stress tests and the nuclear safety standards that will be defined as a result be applied not only in the EU but also in respect of nuclear power stations already built or still in the planning stage in Europe's neighbouring countries."
"I voted in favour of this resolution."
"Following the nuclear accident in Japan, thousands of people died and disappeared without trace."
"Significant material damage has also been done and the consequences will have long-term implications for people's health."
"Even now, we still feel the consequences of Chernobyl, and therefore today, we must reassess our approach to nuclear safety in the EU and the rest of the world."
"As for improving nuclear projects, in Belarus and Kaliningrad, there are huge problems surrounding nuclear safety standards, and compliance with the appropriate obligations in international conventions, because these problems are not just a matter for the Member States that share borders with these regions, but for the whole of Europe, and EU entities and the European Commission must act together, under the subsidiarity principle."
"The resolution on the EU strategy for the Baltic Sea region and the role of macro-regions in the future cohesion policy states that given the planned development of nuclear energy in the Baltic Sea region, the EU Member States must comply with the most stringent standards of safety and environmental protection, and the European Commission must monitor and check whether neighbouring countries on the EU's external borders follow the same approach and international conventions."
"Nuclear power plants under construction near the EU's external borders must comply with international nuclear safety and environmental protection standards."
"Today, energy efficiency and energy saving, renewable and sustainable energy, and the introduction of Europe-wide electrical energy networks, have become particularly important."
"Moreover, it is important to have a smart power grid able to operate by obtaining energy from decentralised energy generators."
"The serious accident that took place at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station on 11 March 2011, due to the earthquake and subsequent tsunami, resulted in damage and long-term consequences for health through contamination of the environment."
"Following on from warnings from the International Atomic Energy Agency on the state of now obsolete nuclear power installations, it would seem necessary to identify measures able to assess safety levels at installations."
"Collaboration and coordination between Member States are crucial, as crises of this type have repercussions not only for the countries in which they are built, but also on a more widespread level."
"The events that have taken place show that, in order to prevent disasters on this scale, Europe has to implement a series of very stringent measures in order to assess existing safety levels."
"The development of new nuclear power installations in Belarus and Russia requires the Commission to take action by opening up a dialogue with these countries in order to ensure the safety not only of their neighbouring countries, but of Europe as a whole."
"In principle, I support this resolution because it calls for a first step towards phasing out nuclear power throughout the European Union."
"Where the substance of the resolution is concerned, however, I would comment that - as so often with resolutions of this type - it is a case of too little, too slowly."
"In the end, the principle of the lowest common denominator prevails, which certainly cannot be satisfactory in the long term."
"The only correct solution would be to phase out nuclear energy completely throughout the European Union, and to do so as quickly as possible."
"I will do everything I can to work towards this."
"In April, we voted on the joint resolution on the lessons to be drawn for nuclear safety in Europe following the nuclear accident in Japan."
"I voted against this resolution, because apart from the bans and the moratorium on nuclear power development and the suggestion of a gradual withdrawal from nuclear energy (which is unrealistic), it does not add anything positive, and neither does it provide any solutions for the future of the energy industry in general."
"The situation after the tragedy in Fukushima has completely changed the philosophy of the approach to the future of energy production in Europe and Poland."
"In our country, the power industry, 95% of which is based on coal, has already suffered as a result of the adoption of the Climate and Energy Package."
"Investments undertaken in order to build two nuclear power plants have also been stopped."
"The resolution only stresses the importance of energy generated from renewable sources, which in Poland represents only 13%, and at most 20%, of our needs."
"Moreover, a referendum on the nuclear power industry, which is being suggested by the Left, is still to be held in Poland, and therefore, the conclusions drawn from this very resolution are premature."
"I welcomed the fact that the majority voted against the resolution."
"I think that we need to avoid making immediate, far-reaching political decisions about the role of nuclear energy in the energy mix in the medium and long term."
"It is important for us to have a clear picture based on precise data about what happened at the Fukushima nuclear power plant."
"We must not lose sight of the benefits of nuclear energy, which produces low carbon dioxide emissions, incurs relatively lower costs and ensures energy independence."
"Until now, nuclear energy has been the safest form of energy, statistically speaking, with the lowest number of accident victims, compared to other energy sources (for example, gas and oil)."
"It is also vital to respect the decisions of Member States in terms of determining the composition of their own energy mix."
"Nuclear energy has an important role to play in achieving the European Union's targets set by the Europe 2020 strategy and the energy strategy for the current decade."
"I voted against the resolution on nuclear safety in Europe following the nuclear accident in Japan."
"The reason for my voting against it is the resolution's call for a moratorium to be imposed on the development of new nuclear power plants."
"I think that the production of nuclear energy in safe conditions is of paramount importance."
"I agree with carrying out stress tests."
"However, I believe that imposing a moratorium for an indefinable period is inappropriate."
"This period may be extremely important to power plants currently under development, especially from the funding perspective."
"The structure of the energy mix is Member States' responsibility."
"This is why I do not believe that such a decision can be imposed at EU level."
"in writing. - I voted against this resolution because the amendments adopted left us with a text which paid insufficient attention to nuclear safety issues."
"The Fukushima disaster reminded the planet that zero risk for nuclear power does not exist."
"The danger that nuclear energy represents for humanity is absolutely unsustainable, as are the high levels of risk from the waste produced."
"We therefore need to go further in ensuring safety and improving safety testing."
"These two criteria would be a minimum condition for reaching an agreement."
"No exit strategy has yet been guaranteed with a view towards actual changes to European energy policy, which needs to move towards the setting out of alternatives, and a phasing out will enable the nuclear industry in Europe to be progressively abandoned."
"I voted against this resolution as I believe that none of the aforementioned premises are guaranteed."
"The Fukushima disaster reminds the world that there is no such thing as zero risk where nuclear power is concerned."
"Nuclear power poses an unacceptable risk to humankind."
"We must therefore go further than increased safety and safety tests."
"We must draft a European plan to phase out nuclear power forthwith."
"To phase out nuclear power takes time."
"It is a crime against humanity not to start preparing for it now."
"I shall not support this resolution if the amendments calling for nuclear power to be phased out are rejected."
"This motion for a resolution on nuclear safety in Europe was more than necessary."
"It deals with all the dangers posed by nuclear energy and I hope it will provide the impetus for a comprehensive rethink concerning the use of nuclear energy in Europe."
"The numerous amendments tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance were necessary in order to directly address the wide range of risks that exist and to call for a rapid phasing-out of the use of nuclear energy."
"Since I am convinced that man will never succeed in getting the risks posed by nuclear power plants entirely under his control, I advocate this rapid phasing-out and supported the amendments relating to this."
"Since the motion for a resolution is ultimately a step in this direction, I voted in favour of it."
"During voting on the resolution on the safety of nuclear energy following the Fukushima accident, I voted against the draft amendment regarding CO2 reduction objectives for three reasons: a) the issue does not relate to the subject of nuclear safety; b) the objectives set out give disproportionate prominence to the role of the EU in the unilateral reduction of CO2; c) such an ambitious - and in truth, unrealistic - reduction in CO2 would only be acceptable if it were combined with a CO2 tax on imports, which could seriously affect the competitiveness of European industry, as well as leading European companies to relocate their production in countries without CO2 restrictions, with serious effects on the EU economy and employment."
"I voted against the joint motion for a resolution on the lessons to be drawn for nuclear safety in Europe following the nuclear accident in Japan, for the following reasons: at least seven of the tabled amendments are scientifically unrealistic; many parts of the text are simply sound bites without any real substance, and those speaking out against nuclear energy do not present alternative solutions to using it either."
"Last but not least, I must point out that I regret the fact that the European Parliament has not adopted a stance on this issue."
"However the kind of stance to be adopted must be balanced, pragmatic and based on scientifically documented realities and on realistic solutions."
"It is high time for a rethink as regards the use of nuclear energy in Europe."
"We must now start to take action, close down dangerous reactors and, in the medium term, find a way to phase out nuclear energy completely."
"We need to reject once and for all the misplaced belief that man has the dangers posed by nuclear energy under control."
"I therefore voted in favour of this motion for a resolution."
"I voted in favour of the resolution on nuclear safety because, following the recent events in Japan, we cannot afford not to tackle the issue responsibly and with objective criteria."
"I believe it is important for Europe to review its rules on safety in nuclear power installations in order to guarantee absolute safety levels, which can be identified by stress tests, that will show any risks and limits to the use of nuclear power."
"The resolution in itself aims to show that, despite everything, it is possible to learn from catastrophes, and to react clearly and effectively in order to ensure that they do not happen again."
"It also underlines the need to aim at alternative sources of energy, such as renewable energy, while nuclear power remains an indispensable source of low carbon energy."
"I voted against the resolution on the lessons to be drawn for nuclear safety in Europe following the nuclear accident in Japan, because I do not believe that the issue of the future of nuclear power - a crucial one for our fellow citizens - can be resolved by this House in a few hours through amendments adopted without any real debate."
"All the issues must be put on the table, and no options must be ruled out, which is exactly why we need time."
"At stake are the credibility of our Parliament and the wellbeing of our fellow citizens, who would not understand - and rightly so - if we were to commit them to long-term courses of action that we did not discuss calmly and exhaustively beforehand, taking into account the different national situations and the constraints of our common fight against climate change."
"Lastly, I should like to say how sorry I am that, due to extremists on all sides, Parliament has been unable to approve at this time an immediate increase in the safety of nuclear power plants, even though we in our group reached a consensus demanding the most serious, transparent and independent checks possible."
"I am angered that the European Parliament has today rejected the resolution on such a crucial issue as the lessons to be drawn from the Fukushima nuclear disaster."
"As far as our institution is concerned, then, there is no before and after 11 March 2011."
"Yet the strong signals were there!"
"After all, it was not too difficult to agree on some simple principles:"
"The principle of supporting the Commission so that it can conduct these 'stress tests' with the Member States on the 143 nuclear reactors in operation in Europe;"
"The principle of submitting by 15 April a precise timeline on the criteria adopted: independent experts, priority given to the safety of nuclear facilities that are intrinsically more dangerous by virtue of their location in seismic or coastal areas, and safety reports for the public;"
"The principle of immediately shutting down plants that fail the 'stress tests'."
"The European public expects our institution to be responsible and sensible, especially on such a controversial issue as atomic energy."
"It is, perhaps, ultimately not a bad thing for the choice of energy, and hence the choice of whether or not to abandon nuclear power, to remain an exclusively national responsibility."
"in writing. - I voted against."
"I am extremely glad that, in the end, the pro-nuclear lobby has failed."
"It is completely incomprehensible that the PPE Group and others voted against saying that zero risk does not exist, against a progressive phase-out starting now, against going towards a near-100% energy-efficient renewables economy by 2050, against a nuclear-free future for Europe, and so on. The final text was absolutely unacceptable, and I am glad the majority of the House supported us Greens in rejecting the joint resolution."
"The serious nuclear accident at the Fukushima Daiichi power station on 11 March caused the death of thousands of people, as well as unimaginable material damage to the entire Japanese economy."
"This carnage is making every country in the world re-examine its position with regard to the use of atomic energy technologies."
"Unfortunately, in many cases, these choices are being accelerated as a result of the recent tragic events, and there are calls from many quarters for the total and immediate dismantling of nuclear power installations."
"The EU has been reconsidering its approach as a whole to nuclear safety for some time, but it is important to take into account the fact that this technology will continue to be part of the energy mix of various Member States for many years to come."
"In the future, it may be possible to meet our energy needs using renewable energy sources, but this is not yet possible, nor will it be possible for a long time."
"I am in favour of more restrictive safety measures for nuclear power installations, in line with those applicable to the latest generation installations."
"However, I believe the option of stopping nuclear energy production from one day to the next is both short-sighted and pointless."
"It is dictated more by emotion than by real need, and could bring the economies of the world's leading industrialised nations to their knees."
"After the nuclear disaster that has struck Japan, we have no option but to review the European energy plan."
"We need to pay particular attention both to nuclear power stations already in operation and to those in the planning stage."
"The European Union has already provided for stress tests to be carried out on all plants, including those in neighbouring states having existing relations with the Union."
"This resolution also provides for a moratorium on the construction of new power stations to allow for proper evaluation of the associated risks."
"We must be aware that in the decades to come, many countries will still depend on nuclear energy but, at the same time, we cannot allow there to be power plants in Europe that pose a risk to the population."
"Power stations predating 1980 must be decommissioned."
"In some countries, such as Italy, assessments are being carried out to decide whether or not to abandon nuclear energy, and it is essential to implement common decisions, also, at European level."
"What is incredible is the fact that the European Parliament has been unable to pronounce on an issue such as the one under consideration today, which is important and of deep concern to citizens."
"In fact, all the resolutions have been rejected, including the joint resolution, which we endorsed."
"Speaking a few days ago at a meeting of industrialists, Italy's Minister for Finance, Mr Tremonti, coined a new phrase - the 'nuclear debt'."
"The Member States that have invested in nuclear power are the ones with the highest levels of public debt."
"How much does it cost to close first- and second-generation power stations?"
"How much do the stress tests, which we are discussing at such length today, cost?"
"Once a power station is shown to be 'stressed', how much does it cost to 'destress' it?"
"Furthermore, how much does it cost to dispose of radioactive waste?"
"No one has yet told us."
"As the European Union, we could begin to think of different options to show the Member States."
"Moreover, given that the Commission will have to provide us with a road map, why not begin to think of real investment in fourth-generation nuclear power - clean nuclear, or fusion - or even begin to consider an overall energy plan?"
"We expect the Commission Communication to outline a road map on this subject and to try to give the European Union a clear direction at last in this sector."
"The nuclear accident at the Fukushima power station has caused an enormous disaster, with the radioactive contamination also affecting many people who were in the vicinity of the power station and who suffered injuries."
"Many hospitals are refusing to admit and treat them due to the risk of contamination."
"Although the Japanese Prime Minister has announced that the Fukushima power station will be decommissioned, the situation remains unresolved: the cooling system for one of the reactors is out of use and a considerable amount of radioactivity is being released into the environment."
"In the light of this, it is important to ensure that all the necessary humanitarian and financial aid is provided and to lay down international safety rules that are as reliable as possible, in order to prevent other disasters like that in Japan in the future."
"For this reason, I voted against the resolution, because it omitted the amendments calling upon the Member States to draw up possible strategies for abandoning nuclear power and immediately to inform regional and local cross-border authorities of their national programmes if their implementation could have a cross-border effect."
"in writing. - Although this is a sensitive period of time just after the enormous problems with nuclear safety in Japan, nuclear energy remains a major contributor to energy supply cross the EU and globally."
"The views expressed by those in the House seeking to force early closure and abandonment of the policy in this matter made voting for elements of this report very difficult for pragmatic reasons rather than a particularly pro- or anti-nuclear approach."
"I could not support 'aggressive' amendments which could have damaged the energy supply policy of a 'mixed' approach leading to reduced CO2 emissions and the eventual growth in renewables."
"We have not reached any agreement today on this resolution, which was intended to draw lessons from the nuclear disaster in Fukushima."
"The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has, for years, advocated the phasing out of nuclear power, because the risks to humans and the environment are unacceptably high and because there are more than enough alternatives."
"Fukushima, in particular, has demonstrated that."
"It is sad that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe continue to believe in their nuclear dreams, even if, as has now been made clear by Japan and Chernobyl, they will ultimately end in nightmares."
"Despite this, there are still many people who are reluctant to wake up from their bad nuclear dream."
"The only truly safe nuclear power is no nuclear power."
"The amendment which called for the phasing out of nuclear power was voted down."
"A majority in this House appears not to understand that it is perfectly technically and economically feasible, over a period of forty years, to generate our electricity completely sustainably through such measures as energy efficiency and reliance on the sun, wind, geothermal energy, water and biomass."
"For the time being, the nuclear power lobby appears to be gaining ground."
"Hence, my 'no' vote in the final vote."
"in writing. - I voted against the resolution in the final vote as I believe we need to debate this issue in the context of the overall EU energy strategy, not in the context of the Japanese nuclear tragedy."
"The nuclear accident happening in Japan at the moment must be followed by an in-depth debate on the plants located in France and Europe."
"Stress tests must be carried out on all the nuclear power plants in operation, particularly when they are located in seismic zones."
"I am thinking, in particular, of the Fessenheim power plant in the Upper Rhine."
"Furthermore, I believe that imposing a moratorium with no time limit on the development and commissioning of new nuclear reactors is not an economically viable solution and may threaten many jobs, while also dangerously weakening our energy production."
"I voted for this European Parliament resolution on the lessons to be drawn for nuclear safety in Europe following the nuclear accident in Japan, as its objective is to increase nuclear safety in the EU and not to ban the production and use of nuclear energy."
"This is why I voted against all the amendments aimed at removing nuclear energy from Europe's energy mix."
"Although I did not vote for imposing a moratorium on the construction of new nuclear reactors, I felt that, if such a moratorium were imposed, it ought to be limited only to the period of the 'stress test' which nuclear reactors in the EU will be undergoing."
"This would allow the construction of new reactors to benefit from the conclusions of the stress tests, ensuring that nuclear safety will increase."
"At the moment, nuclear energy accounts for 30% of Europe's energy mix."
"The European Union depends, to a large extent, on Member States' energy mix to fulfil its '20-20-20' target."
"We cannot decide to get rid of nuclear energy without establishing what sustainable energy sources will be available which can meet the EU's energy demand in the years ahead, at prices which citizens can afford."
"The EU must invest in energy efficiency measures, particularly in buildings and transport, as well as in the use of renewable energy sources."
"in writing. - The nuclear crisis in Japan set into motion a number of ideas that amount to an irrational tsunami."
"Nuclear energy is now demonised and there is growing pressure demanding a complete switch from nuclear to so-called alternative sources of energy."
"But this school of thought is bordering on outright superstition."
"The nuclear reactor of Fukushima was hit by an unprecedented combination of catastrophes."
"This proves that nature is unpredictable and that tsunamis cannot be banned, but it does not prove that nuclear energy is at fault."
"Nuclear energy has a much safer record than any other source of energy."
"While oil arguably generates exploitation, dependence, wars and dictatorships, nuclear energy is historically much safer."
"Our main concern with nuclear energy should indeed be risk assessment and unitary safety procedures at a European level."
"With these criteria fulfilled and observed, nuclear energy could put an end or severely limit the politics of energy dependence."
"And while natural disasters cannot be prevented, nuclear energy is not a serious risk per se."
"The real danger does not come from well serviced nuclear reactors, but from nuclear reactors under the wrong political control."
"In other words, look at Iran, not Japan."
"in writing. - I feel that this resolution was a knee-jerk reaction to the tragic situation in Japan, and did not allow enough time for debate of the issues surrounding the safety of nuclear power plants in the EU."
"Nuclear power is a vital source of energy across Europe, with some Member States getting as much as 75% of their electricity from nuclear power, and a review of the safety of nuclear power plants should be a priority, including stress tests on existing plants."
"This should not, however, lead to closures of existing power plants where there are no safety concerns or prevent the opening of new nuclear installations to replace out-of-date plants."
"We need a grown-up debate on these issues to ensure that there is a balanced mix of renewable and other low carbon sources of energy to ensure that the lights stay on across Europe."
"in writing. - After the defeat of the joint motion for a resolution, I voted in favour of this text which, while not perfect, struck a good balance between nuclear safety and a pragmatic approach to the issue."
"in writing. - I voted for this Verts/ALE Group resolution because all the other resolutions on the subject had fallen."
"I backed it to show support for the safety recommendations but was uncomfortable with the more extreme anti-nuclear sentiments it espoused."
"in writing. - I voted against this resolution, which I found almost naively pro-nuclear."
"I voted in favour of this resolution."
"Demonstrators in Bahrain, Syria and Yemen have expressed legitimate democratic aspirations and strong popular demand for political, economic and social reforms aimed at achieving genuine democracy, fighting corruption, ensuring respect for the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms, reducing social inequalities and creating better economic and social conditions."
"The governments of these countries responded to the people's legitimate aspirations with violent repression, arbitrary arrests and torture, resulting in serious loss of life, injuries and imprisonments."
"The violence used by the governments of these countries against their own populations must have direct repercussions on their bilateral relations with the European Union."
"The EU can, and must, use numerous tools to deter such actions, such as asset freezes, travel bans, etc. The EU must review its policies towards those countries and make full and effective use of the existing support given through the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument, the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights and the Instrument for Stability, in order to urgently assist the countries and civil societies in the Middle East and in the Gulf in their transition towards democracy and respect for human rights."
"Tunisia, Egypt and Libya were the top news stories at the start of 2011."
"However, those states are not the only ones with democratic aspirations."
"Large-scale movements have also emerged in Bahrain, Yemen and Syria."
"There too, unfortunately, the ruling authorities have responded through the prism of repression and violence."
"That is unacceptable."
"A state cannot use violence against its own people and not be penalised by the European Union in the context of its bilateral relations."
"Through this resolution, the European Union supports the people of Syria in their aspiration to genuinely lift the state of emergency in place since 1963, expresses its solidarity with all of the people in these countries, and calls on the European Union to redefine its relations according to the progress made in reforms."
"I think that the European Union needs to promote democratic values more than ever and show solidarity with the peoples in the Southern Mediterranean countries in their aspiration for a democratic society."
"The situation in the Arab countries reminds me of the fall of the Communist regimes in Central and Eastern Europe."
"We, too, went through similar events and can understand these peoples' demands, which makes it our moral duty to show our solidarity with them."
"The protests which have been going on in these countries for the last few weeks provide clear proof that the undemocratic regimes are not meeting the population's expectations and that they cannot offer these societies political stability and prosperity."
"The High Representative and Commission should firmly oppose the use of violence against demonstrators and exert pressure on the authorities in Syria, Yemen and Bahrain to commit to constructive political dialogue with the aim of resolving the situation."
"Furthermore, I think that the conclusion of the Association Agreement between the EU and Syria should be subject to the Syrian authorities' willingness to carry out reforms aimed at establishing democracy."
"The Union has this instrument available and I believe that it should use it as much as possible to support the establishment of democracy in the Arab countries."
"The recent protests in several Arab countries show that non-democratic and authoritarian regimes cannot ensure credible stability, and that democratic values have a key role in economic and political partnerships."
"I call on the authorities in Bahrain, Syria and Yemen to comply with international law on human rights and fundamental freedoms."
"It is vital that they start an open and significant process of political dialogue involving all democratic political forces and civil society as soon as possible, with the aim of preparing the way for real democracy, for the lifting of states of emergency, and for the implementation of real, ambitious and significant political, economic and social reforms, which are essential to long-term stability and development."
"Bahrain is at risk of becoming the site of a confrontation between Iran and Saudi Arabia."
"In this situation, we cannot overlook the religious element in the developments in the region, at a time when the Shi'ite opposition is supported by Iran, while the Sunni dynasty enjoys the support of the monarchies in the area."
"Moreover, the close ties between Iran, Syria, Hamas and Hezbollah, as well as the religious tensions between the Sunnis and Alawites in Syria, should make us exercise caution because there is a huge risk that the escalation in violence will also push Syria towards civil war, with outside interference."
"The Hama massacre in 1982, which included 20 000 Syrians among its victims, is a tragic warning in this regard, just as are the failures in Somalia, Afghanistan and Iraq in terms of the way in which the West must act in a region whose very distinctive features cannot be ignored."
"I believe that we need more diplomacy and less armed force, more concern for defending human rights and the protection of civilians and less concern for the electoral potential of external intervention, as well as greater attention on the poverty and corruption which these societies are faced with, especially in Yemen."
"I voted in favour of this resolution as I condemn the violent repression of peaceful demonstrators carried out by security forces in Bahrain, Syria and Yemen."
"I would like to express my support for, and solidarity with, the people of these countries, who, motivated by legitimate democratic aspirations, are showing great courage and determination."
"Syria, Bahrain and Yemen have been rocked by protests, which have been savagely repressed."
"I call on their governments to embark on fruitful dialogue with the demonstrators."
"The violence meted out to these peoples will not indefinitely stop them claiming what they believe to be theirs by right."
"It will only delay them taking up these rights, make positions more extreme, and encourage more demanding reactions in the future."
"Machiavelli himself, who theorised at length about how it is preferable to be feared than to be loved, warned the princes of the world that it was unnecessary and damaging to make themselves hated."
"It would be better for the authorities in these states to undertake concrete reforms, and to allow their nationals to enjoy standards of democracy, freedom and justice similar to the best in the world."
"The example set throughout its existence gives the European Union a historical duty to speak out against all human rights violations and to fight for peoples' right to self-determination, both through denunciation, and through development aid."
"The current situation in Bahrain - which is of strategic importance with regard to the equilibrium in the Gulf - and which, underneath the appearance of normality, is very tense, with the ongoing detention of people who are accused of nothing more than violating the right to free expression."
"In Syria, protests in several cities have been brutally put down despite EU calls for rights of freedom of expression and association to be respected."
"Finally, in Yemen, the situation is deeply worrying and has already been condemned by the EU because of the repression of demonstrators, to which we cannot be indifferent."
"I therefore agree with the measures proposed in this resolution, not least the condemnation of those responsible for massacres in these countries, and hope that they have an effect in as short a time as possible so that the humiliation of their people can stop."
"I also welcome the initiative to call on the UN Commission on Human Rights to condemn these violations of fundamental rights."
"We are facing another example of the hypocrisy of the majority of this Parliament. Firstly, because they are grouping different situations and countries together in the same resolution."
"They are doing this intentionally, proposing transition 'dialogue' to help their allies (Bahrain and Yemen), and pressuring those who do not defend their interests (Syria)."
"There are marked differences with what happened in Libya, where dialogue was replaced by military aggression, making any possibility of a peaceful solution to the conflict impossible."
"The objectives are clear: to camouflage the movement of troops from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates into Bahrain to assist the oligarchic regime there, with the support of the United States - a country that keeps its main Persian Gulf fleet in Bahrain - and to repress the Bahraini people's fight for social change and democracy."
"The same is happening in Yemen, where they are coming out in defence of a regime that is violently repressing its people, and their fight for democratic change and improved living conditions, in order to protect an ally in the so-called 'war on terror'."
"This resolution is another example of the hypocrisy of the majority of Parliament. To begin with, because they are lumping different situations and countries together in the same resolution."
"They are doing this intentionally, proposing transition 'dialogue' to help their allies (Bahrain and Yemen), and pressuring those who do not defend their interests (Syria)."
"Is there a case for asking why 'dialogue' was not advocated in Libya, rather than bombing?"
"The objectives are clear: to camouflage the movement of troops from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates into Bahrain to assist the oligarchic regime there, with the support of the United States - a country that keeps its main Persian Gulf fleet in Bahrain - and to repress the Bahraini people's fight for social change and democracy."
"The same in Yemen, where they are coming out in defence of a regime that is violently repressing its people, and their fight for democratic change and improved living conditions, in order to protect an ally in the so-called 'war on terror'."
"There is now an attempt to conceal outside interference in Syria, through the financing and arming of what are being called 'peaceful protests' in a country that has had an anti-imperialist attitude, condemning Israeli and US policy in the region."
"I voted in favour of this document, because following similar developments in other Arab countries, demonstrators in Bahrain, Syria and Yemen have expressed legitimate democratic aspirations and strong popular demands for political, economic and social reforms aimed at achieving genuine democracy, fighting corruption and nepotism, ensuring respect for the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms, reducing social inequalities and creating better economic and social conditions."
"Therefore, the European Union and its Member States should support the peaceful democratic aspirations of people in Bahrain, Syria and Yemen, and the governments of these countries must not react by increasing violent repression."
"It is impossible to justify serious crimes such as extrajudicial killings, abductions and disappearances, arbitrary arrests, torture and unfair trials."
"in writing. - I voted for this resolution."
"I believe the EU must reassess its bilateral relations with Syria, Bahrain and Yemen in the light of their violent repression of demonstrators, and talks on a future Association Agreement with Syria must be suspended."
"I am also concerned about the presence of international troops in Bahrain and call for an investigation into the deaths of 54 protestors in Yemen."
"Double standards continue to dominate the external policy of the majority who govern the EU."
"This resolution is a perfect example of that."
"It rightly criticises Ali Abdullah Saleh and Bashar al-Assad, but not the King of Bahrain."
"The dead and wounded victims of the repression of the Yemeni and Syrian governments are mentioned, but not those of Bahrain."
"There is no justification for showing such respect."
"I refuse to support this hypocritical text which, on the pretext of condemning some, pardons the others."
"Syria, Bahrain and Yemen have found themselves in the grip of a series of popular revolts that are being forcibly put down."
"In my opinion, this is not the best way of handling the situation, as violence only begets more violence."
"The governments of these countries need to seek means of dialogue with the leaders of the demonstrations in order to be able to move towards levels of understanding that will prevent deaths and bloodbaths."
"The authorities in these states should concern themselves with undertaking concrete reforms that allow their citizens access to democracy, freedom and justice, similar to what exists in most countries."
"I voted in favour of this resolution as I believe that the European Union is in a position to endeavour, through diplomacy, to promote a process of democratic and peaceful change in Bahrain, Yemen and Syria."
"I am on the side of the peoples of these countries, who want, as we all do, improved economic conditions, reduced social inequalities, the combating of corruption and nepotism, the implementation of democratic reforms, and the guaranteeing of fundamental human rights."
"in writing. - In favour."
"I support this claim by the EP that strongly condemns the violent repression by security forces of peaceful demonstrators in Bahrain, Syria and Yemen, and extends its condolences to the families of the victims; expresses its solidarity with the people in those countries, applauds their courage and determination, and strongly supports their legitimate democratic aspirations."
"It also urges the authorities of Bahrain, Syria and Yemen to refrain from the use of violence against protestors and to respect their right to freedom of assembly and expression; condemns the interference by the authorities in Bahrain and Yemen in the provision of medical treatment and the denial and limiting of access to health facilities; stresses that those responsible for the loss of life and injuries caused should be held accountable and brought to justice; and calls on the authorities to immediately release all political prisoners, human rights defenders and journalists and all those detained in relation to their peaceful activities in the context of the protests."
"The current state of affairs in several African countries, and also in Bahrain, Syria and Yemen, is the result of the people's legitimate aspiration for political, economic and social reforms aimed at bringing about a genuine democracy."
"It is well known that repressive laws restricting citizens in the exercise of their civil and political rights have always been in force in those countries."
"As a result, there is a strong desire among the people for political and social reforms."
"Unfortunately, the governments are reacting to these legitimate demands with violent repression and the application of anti-terrorism laws intended to justify the extrajudicial execution, torture, abduction and disappearance of many demonstrators."
"Today, the number of deaths, casualties and arrests in Syria, Bahrain and Yemen is extremely high."
"The excessive use of force by the governments against demonstrators has violated every single international convention on civil and political rights."
"I join with the rapporteur in condemning the violent crackdown on peaceful demonstrators by the security forces in those countries, crushing their legitimate democratic aspirations."
"We must express our complete solidarity and support the courage and determination that these peoples are demonstrating to the entire world."
"in writing. - The situation in Syria, Bahrain and Yemen is an unpredictable ongoing process and not a bloody but unstoppable march toward democracy."
"The political background in Syria and Yemen has been, for a long time, authoritarian or outright dictatorial."
"Yet this is not making the opposition a fully democratic alternative."
"Especially in Yemen, a lawless, fragmented polity, the forces gathering under the opposition umbrella are hosting or could give way to terrorist or radical anti-democratic forces."
"In the past, 'stability' in the foreign policy for the Middle East was a substitute for inaction or the status quo."
"It was certainly an overrated concept."
"Now it could become underrated."
"The European and largely the democratic interest would be better served by a rational, non-emotional approach."
"The need for democracy in countries with a long record of political oppression should not become the undoing of future democratic process."
"This does not mean that the Assad or Saleh regimes should be propped up, but it means that the solution should be a negotiated exit strategy rather than a violent and uncontrolled regime change."
"Caution and clear headed policies are much more appropriate in countries and regions that could turn from one system of oppression to another."
"The European Parliament today adopted a resolution calling for the EU's relations with Syria, Bahrain and Yemen to be reassessed in order to take account of the popular uprisings in those countries."
"If I thought that that was really the intention of the European institutions, it would have my full support."
"The key element of this resolution is the call for 'the suspension of further negotiations over the signing of the still pending Association Agreement between the EU and Syria' and the fact that 'the conclusion of such an agreement should depend on the capacity of the Syrian authorities to carry out the expected democratic reforms in tangible form'."
"Point duly noted."
"However, I have to point out, and the resolution itself admits it, that 'the signing of this Agreement has been delayed at Syria's request since October 2009'."
"One can only wonder, then, what impact this declaration will really have."
"I therefore abstained on this text."
"This vote by our Parliament, which follows several resolutions since the Jasmine Revolution in Tunisia, is proof that the events in the Arab world are a wave, the size and longevity of which no one can predict."
"Admittedly, the situation is different in each of the countries, but ultimately, these popular movements are the expression of an unshakeable desire for democracy, freedom and justice."
"The European Union must not allow people's legitimate and peacefully expressed demands to be repressed through the use of violence, which unfortunately appears to be the only response of regimes with their backs against the wall."
"Europe must express itself firmly, in particular, through the High Representative/Vice-President of the Commission, so as to confirm its support for the public demonstrations, which are calling for the fundamental values that are promoted and defended by the Union to be respected in those countries."
"Our Parliament, which is regarded as a temple of democracy, must reiterate its solidarity with these peoples and must support them in their democratic transition process."
"It is therefore essential for us to review our relations with the countries of North Africa, the Near East and the Middle East so that, together, we can successfully build an area of stability, peace and prosperity."
"I am voting for this motion for a resolution."
"I believe that it is important to increase the effectiveness of development aid, and that there is a need for a coherent policy of support in areas such as trade and development cooperation, climate change, agriculture, etc. The EU needs to follow a common position towards the least developed countries (LDCs), and should not allow economic and financial crises to compromise the development of partnerships with the LDCs."
"It is essential that the global commitment to addressing the specific needs of the LDCs, as regards the sustainability of development in all of its economic, social and environmental aspects, and to supporting them in their efforts to eradicate poverty, be reaffirmed during this conference."
"Ahead of the Istanbul conference in May, the EU has reaffirmed its support for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in developing countries, and once more confirmed its commitment to provide specific aid programmes."
"Although notable progress has been recorded in some countries and regions, the goal of halving the level of poverty in the world is still far from being achieved."
"Eleven million children still die every year from treatable diseases, the greater part of them before the age of five; one person in four has no access to drinking water; 114 million children still have no access to primary education; approximately 600 million women are still illiterate; and just as many people have no access to progress."
"The failure to achieve the goals established in 2001 will not discourage the industrialised nations, which, on the contrary, will continue to ensure that countries that need aid are at the top of the international agenda, promoting the supply of new targeted sources of finance and the creation of cooperation programmes."
"Raising these countries up again and giving a future to thousands of people requires commitment, great political determination and consistent mobilisation of financial resources, all conditions that the EU satisfies."
"in writing. - I voted against the joint motion on the Fourth United Nations conference on least developed countries because the motion is not focused enough on the problem of international aid ineffectiveness."
"The motion, and the statement by the Commission during the parliamentary debate, ignore the current critical discussion on the last 50 years of international aid to the countries of the global South, and ignore the lessons to be drawn by past failures and successes."
"Why the monumental failure of the aid to Africa?"
"Why the monumental failure of the World Bank policies on development and poverty reduction?"
"Why the huge scandal of foreign aid delivery to Afghanistan during the last 10 years?"
"Why the huge success of the poverty elimination policies in China, Vietnam and Brazil?"
"If we are not able to answer these difficult questions, we will never be able to use the EUR 60 billion in development aid for the benefit of the least developed countries."
"I agreed with this resolution."
"The Fourth United Nations conference on the least developed countries should focus on policy coherence for development, because it is an important factor for reducing poverty."
"In addition to the existing challenges, the situation in the LDCs has been exacerbated by the recent global financial, food, climate change and energy crises."
"Therefore, this UN conference should be result-oriented, on the basis of clear indicators and the objective of reducing the number of LDCs by half by 2020, combined with efficient and transparent monitoring and follow-up mechanisms."
"It is deplorable that 48 countries are currently classified as least developed countries (LDCs), and that 75% of the 800 million inhabitants of these countries live on less than USD 2 per day."
"The long-term goal for development cooperation should be that of creating the conditions for sustainable economic development, and the fair redistribution of wealth."
"Peace and security are vital to the effectiveness of development policy, and the EU should coordinate its approach better, with the aim of resolving stability problems in the LDCs and supporting efforts to build the capacities needed for the construction of peaceful, democratic and inclusive states."
"It is also essential to give priority to food security, to agriculture, to infrastructure, to capacity building, and, in particular, to economic growth and access to technology, as well as to the human and social development of the LDCs."
"With the previous conferences having focused on principles, I hope that the fourth UN conference will be geared towards determining results and devising clear indicators for halving the number of less developed countries by 2020."
"Out of the 51 underdeveloped countries, where 78% of the population live on less than USD 1.25 a day, only three have moved out of this category in recent years."
"The situation is worrying as these countries are the most vulnerable to ordeals such as the financial and food crises and climate change, while also facing extreme poverty, a lack of infrastructure and rising unemployment."
"This reality highlights that, unfortunately, the international community has not fulfilled the commitments set out in the Brussels Action Programme."
"I hope that during the conference, where I will be representing the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, we will focus on achieving consistency in terms of development policies and methods for implementing innovative funding mechanisms, with the aim of providing more effective help to those countries which need to be encouraged to implement suitable policies."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of this resolution, as I believe that the Fourth United Nations conference on the least developed countries needs to put forward measures to make the integration of these countries into the global economy possible, and to improve their access to EU markets."
"The European Commission should consider increasing aid to these countries in order to minimise costs resulting from the liberalisation of their markets."
"Despite the technical and financial assistance provided over the years to the least developed countries (LDCs), it is essential to recognise that these countries have not succeeded in lifting themselves out of this status, and still have permanent weaknesses and needs."
"It is only fair to mention the exceptional circumstances in Cape Verde, as the adopted resolution does, as the country has succeeded, despite a lack of resources, in overcoming some of the difficulties that it faced, and improving its population's living conditions."
"I would therefore congratulate the Cape Verdean people, their government and their parties on this, as they have been able to take action in a responsible and respectable manner: this Portuguese-speaking country is today an example to be followed by the LDCs."
"Despite limitations on trade and problems with training and access to information, to resources and to units of production, it cannot be emphasised enough that the underdevelopment of the LDCs results mainly from their decision makers' lack of skill and their institutions' inefficiency, as their people are so capable in other respects."
"The Fourth United Nations conference on the least developed countries (LDC-IV) will take place in Istanbul, Turkey, on 9-13 May this year."
"The EU, which has always led the way in supporting developing countries through poverty eradication programmes - for which financial allocations have trebled over the last few years - is very involved in the organisation of this meeting."
"Parliament will also be represented by a delegation delivering well thought-out proposals, although its observer status will not allow it great visibility, and I hope that this represents a significant boost in winning the 'battle' of sustainable development and equitable growth for these countries."
"Given that all countries have responsibilities for supporting the least developed countries (LDCs), in order to meet the Millennium Development Goals, I agree with the proposals included in this joint motion for a resolution, and I would like to see the goal of halving the number of LDCs by 2020 achieved."
"LDC-IV needs to support concrete measures that help to find solutions to the LDCs' development needs, to combat poverty, and to ensure a decent income and existence."
"In the context of the Fourth United Nations conference on the least developed countries, it is appropriate to consider the Millennium Development Goals adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 2000 and to assess their implementation, specifically: eradicating poverty and hunger; promoting equality between men and women; increasing and improving mother/infant health care; combating HIV/AIDS; developing environmental sustainability; and achieving universal primary education."
"With regard to development policy, the disparity between the EU's words and actions is clear."
"We have the resources at our disposal to eradicate poverty."
"These are even increased by the benefits of scientific and technological development."
"Nonetheless, what we are seeing is an increase in poverty at global level."
"This is the result of the system that dominates the world: capitalism, which is intrinsically unfair and unequal."
"We would emphasise the importance of the alternative resolution tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, as well as the amendments tabled to the joint resolution - and unfortunately rejected by the majority - that focus on, inter alia, issues such as: food sovereignty, agricultural development, and the need to put an end to the EU's blackmailing of a number of developing countries on the basis of so-called Economic Partnership Agreements."
"It is essential to support the poorest and most fragile countries on the planet, which include nearly 50 countries, whose people are suffering the effects of successive failures to implement the conclusions of successive United Nations conferences."
"In most cases, this situation is due to colonialism, and to the exploitation of their riches and peoples."
"It is not the inevitability of fate, nor inescapable natural limitations or constraints that make these countries poor."
"Quite the contrary: several of them are rich, very rich, in natural resources."
"In other cases, it is the continuation of capitalist exploitation, with the injustice and inhumanity of a system - which is the world's dominant mode of economic and social organisation - that is sustained by asymmetrical relationships, which create and sustain inequalities."
"It is the result of free trade, of financial deregulation, of the illicit but permitted flight of capital to tax havens, and of war and conflicts fed by disputes over natural resources."
"It is in breaking with the foundations of this system, and in a genuine and solidarity-based policy of cooperation and development aid, that the possibility of the emancipation of these people and the development of these countries lies."
"More than 40 countries in the world belong to the category of least developed countries."
"I welcome the EU's attempt to participate actively at the top-level UN conference, and I expect concrete commitments from this."
"During the past 10 years, the poorest countries have recorded greater progress than in the previous decade."
"Despite this, however, many problems persist: increasing dependence on imported goods, poverty, the low level of human capital and vulnerability to climate change and natural disasters."
"These problems must be resolved from all sides, but two points are particularly important."
"First, these countries have to get investment flowing into the productive sectors of the economy."
"Secondly, it is necessary to help build democratic structures in these countries, enabling them to decide independently on strategic priorities without foreign interference."
"Commodity market fluctuations and the consequences arising from these are a specific issue that must be resolved."
"From the long-term perspective, the answer is to diversify the economy."
"From the short-term and medium-term perspective, it is important to control price shocks, especially in the area of foodstuffs."
"With regard to the position of the EU, it is important to focus on coherent external policies."
"The Commission document of 16 February is exhaustive, but it must take a more critical approach."
"We need to acknowledge that not all EU activities in the area of trade or direct foreign investments are in line with development policy."
"In my opinion, they should be subordinated to it."
"I voted in favour of this document, because since the Third United Nations conference on the least developed countries (LDC-III) and the adoption of the Brussels Action Programme, some positive steps have been taken, for example, the 'Everything But Arms' initiative and the increases in Official Development Assistance, which doubled between 2000 and 2008, and direct foreign investment, which rose from USD 6 to USD 33 billion, enabling 19 countries to achieve a growth rate of 3%."
"LDC-IV should be result-oriented, on the basis of clear indicators and the objective of reducing the number of LDCs by half by 2020, combined with efficient and transparent monitoring and follow-up mechanisms."
"I would stress the need to give priority to food security, agriculture, infrastructure, capacity building, inclusive economic growth, access to technologies and human and social development in the LDCs."
"in writing. - I voted for this resolution."
"I believe that LDC-IV should focus on policy coherence for development as an important factor for policy shift, at national and international level, and call, therefore, for policy making in all areas - such as trade, fisheries, the environment, agriculture, climate change, energy, investment and finance - to support the development needs of LDCs in order to fight poverty and guarantee decent incomes and livelihoods."
"I urge the EU to honour its commitments in terms of market access and debt alleviation and to reaffirm the importance of reaching the ODA target of 0.15% to 0.20% of GNI for the LDCs, mobilising, for this purpose, domestic resources and, as a complementary measure, innovative financing mechanisms."
"I believe that the Fourth United Nations conference on the least developed countries needs to put forward the measures necessary to make the integration of these countries into the global economy possible, and to improve their access to EU markets."
"However, despite everyone's efforts, the objectives have not been achieved, although Cape Verde stands out here, as it has achieved some success and increased its citizens' quality of life to higher levels than the other least developed countries."
"The economic crisis in the developed world has brought in its wake trade restrictions which, in turn, are putting an economic stranglehold on less developed countries."
"Families on the verge of absolute poverty have seen a 15% rise over the last six months in food prices which, according to World Bank data, have risen by 29% compared with 2009."
"Consequently, the recent official request submitted by the poor countries for export restrictions to be lifted cannot be ignored."
"The economic crisis is certainly hampering negotiations; however, tough negotiations on the back of people living in absolute poverty are, at best, morally questionable."
"This specific motion for a resolution, which I supported, emphasises and highlights specific policies to reverse this situation, both at national and at international level in numerous sectors, such as trade, fisheries, the environment, the agricultural sector, climate change, energy, investments and the financial sector."
"The European Parliament aims to make its contribution to the Fourth United Nations conference on the least developed countries through this resolution."
"I support this contribution, as I also believe that this conference should foster coherent development policies by promoting measures in all areas - such as trade, fisheries, the environment, agriculture, climate change, energy, investment and finance - in order to provide strong support for the development needs of the least developed countries (LDCs), to combat poverty, and to ensure decent incomes and subsistence."
"Like the resolution that I voted for, I would also like to emphasise that, in 2007, Cape Verde was one of three countries that pulled themselves out of LDC status."
"This is a country with few resources, but which was able to work for growth and combat poverty."
"I therefore wish to congratulate the people of Cape Verde and their government."
"in writing. - In favour."
"With this resolution, the EP: 1."
"Considers that LDC-IV should be result-oriented, on the basis of clear indicators and the objective of reducing the number of LDCs by half by 2020, combined with efficient and transparent monitoring and follow-up mechanisms; 2."
"Believes that LDC-IV should focus on policy coherence for development as an important factor for policy shift, at national and international level; calls, therefore, for policy making in all areas - such as trade, fisheries, the environment, agriculture, climate change, energy, investment and finance - to support the development needs of LDCs in order to fight poverty and guarantee decent incomes and livelihoods; 3."
"Urges the EU to honour its commitments in terms of market access and debt alleviation; reaffirms the importance of reaching the ODA target of 0.15 to 0.20% of GNI for the LDCs, mobilising, for this purpose, domestic resources and, as a complementary measure, innovative financing mechanisms."
"As of today, there are 48 countries in the world that are classed as least developed, with approximately 800 million people who live on less than USD 2 per day."
"Between 2000 and 2010, the average human development index rating for the least developed countries grew by a mere 0.04%."
"This feeble increase is progressively distancing them from the eight Millennium Development Goals set by the United Nations in 2000."
"Fortunately, following the Third United Nations conference, some positive steps were taken in the area of official development assistance, enabling some 19 countries to achieve a growth rate of 3%."
"I share the rapporteur's opinion in emphasising the importance of the Fourth United Nations conference."
"The principal goals must focus on development policy, agriculture and fisheries, and must seek to obtain concrete results and innovative financing."
"I hope that the contribution to sustainable development will also translate into support for health, education and the promotion of democracy, and hold fast to respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms as essential components of the European Union's development policy."
"There are currently 48 least developed countries (LDCs), which means that every fifth country in the world falls into this category."
"The category of LDC was created by the UN General Assembly in the early 1970s, which was more than 40 years ago."
"Since then, the number of LDCs has increased twofold, and only three (Botswana, Maldives and Cape Verde) have been able to graduate from the group."
"This shows that poverty is spreading, and the effectiveness of activities undertaken so far is barely perceptible."
"The critical situation has been exacerbated further by the economic crisis. Its effects have affected LDCs to a large extent and caused a further deepening of the problems occurring there."
"These arise, in particular, from debt, high food and fuel prices and climate change."
"I therefore supported the resolution on the Fourth United Nations conference on LDCs with full conviction and awareness of its importance."
"There is a need for a deep, comprehensive analysis and diagnosis of the situation of LDCs and concrete proposals for solutions aimed at improving the living conditions of the citizens of these countries in the short term, and at leaving the group in the long term."
"As a member of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, I would like to draw particular attention to the lack of control mechanisms for work which has been undertaken."
"We do not lack the political will and willingness to help, but unfortunately, we do not monitor our efforts adequately, and the result is that they are not very effective."
"As one of the authors of the resolution on the Fourth United Nations conference on the least developed countries (LDCs), I believe that it is absolutely crucial for the European Parliament to demonstrate an unwavering commitment to the inhabitants of the LDCs."
"The increase in the number of states falling into that category (since 1971, the number of LDCs has risen from 25 to 48) requires the international community to redouble its efforts to meet the objective of halving the number of LDCs by 2020."
"From this point of view, it is essential to ensure true policy coherence between policies directly affecting the LDCs, such as development aid, trade, fisheries, the environment, agriculture, climate change, energy, investment and finance, in order to reduce poverty and guarantee decent incomes and livelihoods for the inhabitants of the LDCs."
"I voted in favour of the European Parliament resolution on the Fourth United Nations conference on the least developed countries."
"In that resolution, the European Parliament upholds the principle of coherence between the various EU policies in the field of development aid and cooperation."
"This means that in the EU's relations with the least developed countries, policy in all areas - including trade, fisheries, the environment, agriculture, climate change, energy, investment and finance - must be designed in such a way as to support their development needs."
"Furthermore, the resolution recalls the importance of reaching the ODA target of 0.15 to 0.20% of GNI for the LDCs, and warns of the adverse impact of farmland acquisition, such as the expropriation of small farmers and the unsustainable use of land and water."
"The principle of coherence is designed to prevent statements of good intentions that are never translated into action, and conflicting sectoral policies."
"It now remains to implement it."
"I wanted to use my vote to reiterate my firm commitment to the fight against poverty, whether against its causes or against its effects."
"An inexorable gap is opening up between the least developed countries and the world economy, creating a vicious circle in which the victims are the populations."
"We are all responsible for the delays in achieving the Millennium Development Goals, which makes coordinated action by the EU and the UN a matter of urgency."
"The priority areas are well known: food security, access to water and healthcare, and literacy."
"The solutions are also well known, but I regret that the statements of good intentions are rarely translated into action."
"And yet it is by working towards a better distribution of wealth, supporting LDCs on the path to growth and democracy, and combating the frenzied speculation on commodity prices, that these extremely vulnerable countries will be able to escape the vicious circle of poverty."
"This is not only a responsibility; it is a security requirement for the Union, because poverty is unfortunately often a source of instability."
"I am voting for this report, as I support Iceland's accession to the EU, provided that the government succeeds in securing the support of its citizens for this national political commitment."
"I voted in favour of this resolution."
"I welcome the prospect of Iceland joining the EU, because Iceland has a strong democratic tradition and civic culture, which will enable it to be admitted into the band of EU Member States unhindered."
"I believe that Iceland's accession to the EU would enhance the Union's prospects of playing a more active and constructive role in Northern Europe and in the Arctic, contributing to multilateral governance and sustainable policy solutions in the region."
"Iceland is already an active participant in the Nordic Council as well as in the EU's Northern Dimension Policy, the Barents Euro-Arctic Council and the Arctic Council, which is the main multilateral forum for cooperation in the Arctic."
"Iceland's accession to the EU would further anchor the European presence in the Arctic Council."
"Iceland can also bring a valuable contribution to EU environmental and energy policies due to its experience in the field of renewable energies, particularly as regards the utilisation of geothermal energy, protection of the environment and measures to deal with climate change."
"I voted for the 2010 progress report on Iceland drafted by my colleague, Cristian Preda, because I think the time has come for this state's EU prospects to be assessed."
"Throughout the negotiations with the EU, the Icelandic authorities have demonstrated a genuine commitment to this process and a strong political will to fulfil all the accession criteria in good time."
"First of all, Iceland has a long tradition of democracy."
"The protection of human rights and cooperation with leading international organisations are top-priority items on Iceland's political agenda."
"On the economic front, the authorities have already devised a pre-accession strategy to ensure the diversification of their business sectors and their exit from the recession."
"I think that Iceland is capable of assuming the obligations which derive from being an EU Member State."
"I should mention that at present, the conditions have been met for 10 negotiating chapters."
"In this context, I welcome the European Commission's initiative to start accession negotiations with Iceland this June."
"This report provides a good overview of the current state of relations between the European Union and Iceland."
"Ever since the Treaty of Paris, we have maintained friendly, close and cooperative links with that country. It has been hard hit by the economic, financial and banking crisis."
"Reforms must be undertaken, and we must encourage them."
"Since the start of the accession process, we have begun an open and constructive dialogue with the Icelandic Government, which has also expressed a desire to join the euro area."
"Enlargement to include Iceland will allow for greater European policy coherence in the Arctic region, especially where fisheries, maritime transport, scientific research and environmental conservation are concerned."
"However, Europe is not a crutch or a cure for an economic crisis."
"It is up to Iceland to clearly subscribe to a genuine project of integration with the rest of Europe."
"I welcome the prospect of having a country with a strong democratic tradition and a solid civic culture as a new EU Member State."
"Iceland has been achieving good results in safeguarding human rights and ensuring a high level of cooperation with international mechanisms for the protection of human rights."
"Iceland's accession to the EU will therefore strengthen the Union's role in promoting and defending human rights and fundamental freedoms throughout the world."
"Through its experience, Iceland may also make a valuable contribution to EU policy in the field of renewable energy, particularly in the areas of the exploitation of geothermal energy, environmental protection and combating climate change."
"Iceland's accession to the EU will improve the EU's prospects of playing a more active and constructive role in northern Europe and the Arctic, through contributions to multilateral governance and sustainable political solutions for the region."
"in writing. - I voted against this report."
"In the rush to enlargement, I fear that this Parliament and the EU institutions are ignoring issues of strategic importance to Member States."
"It is very regrettable that, yet again, Iceland and the Faroe Islands have massively inflated their proposed catches of mackerel in 2011, endangering the stock and endangering the viability of our pelagic fishing industry."
"This outrageous behaviour exposes the lie that Iceland is at the forefront of sustainable fisheries management."
"Last summer, in response to Iceland's intransigent stance on this matter, we were told that the Commission was considering suspending negotiations about Iceland's accession to the EU, yet little seems to have happened on this front."
"Iceland's membership of the 'EU Club' cannot and must not be taken forward while Iceland blatantly ignores the rules of that club."
"As one newspaper headline put it, are we really going to contemplate Iceland turning from collapsing its banks to making our most valuable fishery disappear?"
"I voted in favour of the '2010 progress report on Iceland' as I believe that we need to support the accession of one of the oldest European democracies to the EU, provided that the necessary requirements are met, such as the abolition of whaling and the trading of products extracted from whales."
"Of all the countries whose accession to the European Union is being proposed, Iceland is the best prepared to do so, and to take on board the values and principles that guide Union action."
"I believe that the Union will gain from the Icelandic contribution."
"In general, Iceland has the same standards, and in some cases higher, than those aimed at within the Union."
"I believe that the adjustments that still need to be made will not be of the kind to delay the accession process too greatly."
"This motion for a resolution relates to the 2010 progress report on Iceland's advances towards European Union membership."
"Negotiations on Iceland's accession started in July 2010."
"I believe that the necessary conditions need to be created for completing Iceland's accession process and ensuring the success of this accession: this is a country with a strong democratic tradition and a robust civic culture, and its accession will strengthen the Union's role in promoting the defence of human rights and fundamental freedoms throughout the world."
"Iceland belongs to the European Free Trade Association, and has a market economy that could provide certain advantages to the EU, specifically in the area of renewable energy."
"Nonetheless, Iceland needs to provide evidence of real interest, and to cooperate on the resolution of outstanding issues in the fisheries management sector."
"According to the report that has been tabled, some progress has been made, but there is still a long way to go, particularly with regard to the fisheries sector."
"I hope that these outstanding issues can be quickly resolved, so that Iceland's accession process is a success."
"Our position in principle regarding the processes for new countries' accession to the European Union is well known: when this decision is made, it must be based on the will of the people involved, which should be respected."
"We therefore await the position of the people of Iceland on accession, so that we can take this position into account in the future."
"Besides this principle, we also abstained from this vote because of the fundamental basis of EU enlargement processes, given the capitalist nature of the integration process and the objectives that it pursues."
"Once the outlying regions resulting from previous enlargements having been exhausted, there is a need to grow further and to reach new markets."
"We are unhappy about some of the requirements that the European Union is making of Iceland, including those in this report. for example, the requirements to liberalise a number of sectors, in particular, the financial sector, which is all the more serious as this was one of the sectors responsible for the crisis that occurred there, escape from which was only possible because of clear state intervention."
"We abstained from this vote because of our position on the enlargement of the European Union."
"We await the position of the people of Iceland on accession, so that we can take this position into account in the future."
"That said, we are unhappy about some of the requirements that the European Union is making of Iceland, including those in this report, which we disagree with entirely: for example, the requirements to liberalise a number of sectors, in particular, the financial sector, which is all the more serious as this was one of the sectors responsible for the crisis that occurred there, escape from which was only possible because of clear state and popular intervention."
"We await future developments, specifically the referendum on 9 April 2011, for a clearer position on the country's membership."
"I wish to explain why I am abstaining on this text, as I do whenever a report concerning accession negotiations with a European country is voted on here."
"It is not because I dispute Iceland's right to enter the European Union; it is because I believe that it is not a good idea for it to join. Indeed, the vast majority of people in Iceland seem to hold the same view."
"The decision to apply for membership was taken in a moment of panic, following the collapse of the Icelandic banking system, in order to benefit from European support."
"Everyone knows that Iceland wants to adopt the euro without being a member of the European Union, which is stupid when we know what implications that has, and that Iceland is a member of the European Economic Area and of the Schengen area."
"It will be up to the Icelandic people to decide in the end, anyway. And I hope that if they do say no, they will be heard."
"I voted in favour of this document, because accession negotiations with Iceland were launched in July 2010 and it is essential to create the conditions to complete the accession process with Iceland and ensure that its accession is a success."
"Iceland can bring a valuable contribution to EU policies due to its experience in the field of renewable energies, particularly as regards the utilisation of geothermal energy, protection of the environment and measures to deal with climate change."
"Iceland's accession to the EU would enhance the Union's prospects of playing a more active and constructive role in Northern Europe and in the Arctic, contributing to multilateral governance and sustainable policy solutions in the region."
"It is also crucial to give EU citizens clear and comprehensive fact-based information on the implications of Iceland's accession."
"Efforts must be made to that end, and I believe it is equally important to listen to and address citizens' concerns and questions and to respond to their views and interests."
"I had to give my wholehearted support to the resolution on the 2010 progress report on Iceland put to the vote in Parliament."
"In the year just gone, Iceland demonstrated its willingness to comply on many fronts with European policy and with the principles that inspire it."
"Its strong civic and democratic tradition, the progress made in strengthening the independence of the judiciary, and the particular attention paid to the economic aspect, which is increasingly on course to meet the criteria laid down by Europe, make it a country whose accession to the EU can only be considered positively, not least because it would strengthen the Union's role within the Arctic Council."
"The safeguarding of human rights, the strengthening of the legislative environment with regard to freedom of expression and access to information, and the high rates of investment in education, research and development, aimed at tackling the high level of youth unemployment, demonstrate the industriousness of the country and its firm desire to align itself with Europe."
"It will be up to the people of Iceland to have the final say: they will have to vote in a referendum, and I hope that they will opt in favour of joining our great European family."
"in writing. - I voted for this resolution which, among other things, 'welcomes the agreement achieved between the representatives of the governments of Iceland, the Netherlands and the UK on the Icesave issue, notably on guaranteeing the repayment of costs incurred in payment of minimum guarantees to depositors in branches of Landsbanki Islands hf. in the UK and the Netherlands; welcomes the approval by a three-quarters majority of the agreement by the Icelandic Parliament on 17 February 2011'; and 'takes note of the decision of the President of Iceland to refer the bill to a referendum and hopes for an end to the infringement procedure which started on 26 May 2010, brought by the EFTA Surveillance Authority against the government of Iceland'."
"This text condemns the refusal by the Icelandic people to repay the debts run up by private banks, even though they voted by a very large majority against that repayment."
"It obliges them rigorously to apply the Copenhagen criteria."
"It welcomes the IMF plans for the country."
"It proposes a Commission-led campaign in Iceland, on the model of the Irish campaign, in anticipation of the national referendum on EU membership."
"I voted against these repeated shows of strength against the Icelandic people, and the text's crude logic of liberal normalisation."
"Iceland has been taking concrete steps towards future EU accession, and is best placed among accession candidates to fulfil the requirements for accession."
"However, the recent issue with regard to payment to the Netherlands and the United Kingdom of funds lost by citizens of those countries who had investments in a failed Icelandic bank could create obstacles to the country's accession."
"Iceland is already cooperating closely with the European Union as a member of the European Economic Area, of the Schengen Agreements and the Dublin Regulation."
"Iceland is also achieving very good results where the protection of human rights is concerned."
"There is a high level of investment in areas such as education, research and development, which makes Iceland well-placed internationally in these areas."
"However, the consent of the Icelandic population is required before we can talk about the accession of Iceland to the EU."
"It would be advisable to stop any propaganda by the EU aimed at convincing the Icelanders of the benefits of accession."
"In economic terms, an OECD report from May 2010 says that Iceland has succeeded in consolidating its economy and, despite the financial crisis, its per capita income still leads the world."
"The project therefore has my support."
"First of all, I would like to make it clear that the possible accession of Iceland to the Union is subject to the consent of the Icelandic people."
"The decision must be left to the people and must not be influenced further by the EU."
"As far as the progress report is concerned, Iceland stands up to international comparison in numerous areas and in others, even leads the field: I am thinking here of areas such as per capita income, education, research and development, and the safeguarding of human rights."
"I therefore voted in favour of this motion for a resolution."
"Iceland is one of the oldest European democracies."
"Of the countries seeking accession to the European Union, it is surely the best prepared country, not only because it has similar democratic principles and values to the Union's Member States, but also because it has the same or higher development standards."
"I voted in favour of this 2010 progress report as I believe that, once the necessary accession requirements have been met, among which I would emphasise the abolition of whaling and the trading of products extracted from whales, the EU will gain from the accession of this country."
"However, the question of this country's accession should be duly framed within the Union's common policies, the common fisheries policy in particular."
"On account of the relative weight that the fisheries sector has within the Icelandic economy, difficulties with harmonising policies intrinsic to the sector may arise."
"in writing. - In favour."
"With this resolution, the EP, among other things: Welcomes the prospect of having as a new EU member a country with a strong democratic tradition and civic culture; underlines that Iceland's accession to the EU will further enhance the Union's role as a world-wide promoter and defender of human rights and fundamental freedoms; commends Iceland for its good record in safeguarding human rights and ensuring a high level of cooperation with international mechanisms for the protection of human rights; supports the ongoing work to strengthen the legislative environment with regard to freedom of expression and access to information; welcomes, in this respect, the Icelandic Modern Media Initiative, enabling both Iceland and the EU to position themselves strongly as regards legal protection of the freedoms of expression and information."
"Iceland has been a candidate country for European Union membership since 2010."
"I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution because I am convinced that that country has a solid democratic tradition and civic culture, and that its accession will further enhance the EU's role as a worldwide promoter and defender of human rights and fundamental freedoms."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this report as I support Iceland's accession to the EU."
"I am voting for this resolution, which recommends the implementation of the Association and Stabilisation Agreement with the EU, but regrets that the Council is not considering the opening of negotiations as recommended by the Commission."
"I would also like to express my concern about growing ethnic tensions, and about the lack of political dialogue and freedom of the press."
"Political parties should put an end to the boycott of the national parliament, and enter a dialogue with the institutions."
"I also regret the fact that the dispute with Greece continues to block the country's path towards accession to the EU."
"The bilateral issues need to be resolved by the parties concerned in the spirit of good neighbourliness, above all, taking European interests into account."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this motion to wind up the debate on statements by the European Council and the Commission on the 2010 progress report on the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM)."
"I believe it is a very balanced motion."
"It expresses concern about the current political situation in FYROM, including the boycott of the national parliament by the opposition parties, and about the risk that these developments could adversely affect the country's EU agenda."
"The motion also congratulates the country on the anniversary of the Ohrid Agreement, which remains the cornerstone of its inter-ethnic relations, and calls on the government to foster a comprehensive dialogue between the ethnic communities."
"I also appreciated the positive evaluation in the motion on FYROM's continuous efforts to stabilise the region."
"As a member of the European Parliament's delegation for the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, I am keeping a close eye on the progress of that country and of its application to join the European Union."
"Although it still has work to do in the areas of politics, the judiciary, public administration, the fight against corruption, and freedom of expression, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has made significant progress in areas such as decentralisation, education, and prison system reform."
"The bilateral problems between that country and Greece must not hinder the start of accession negotiations."
"I voted in favour of opening those negotiations."
"Moreover, I would point out that early elections will be held in the country in June."
"I therefore call on all the political parties to join together and work in close cooperation so as to ensure their country's accession to the European Union."
"I agreed with this report."
"In 2005, the European Council granted candidate status to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia but has failed ever since to set a date for the opening of negotiations, in spite of the substantial progress made by that country on its path towards the EU."
"Despite the progress made, there is still political instability in Macedonia, which could affect the European integration process."
"A lack of dialogue between the government and opposition parties in the country is preventing an agreement on the implementation of structural reforms from being reached."
"The reform of the judiciary is not fully completed, the media and public administration have been politicised and the unresolved issue of the integration of ethnic groups is preventing Macedonia from achieving further progress and implementing the necessary reforms to ensure the principles of the rule of law and democracy."
"I believe that the Macedonian Government must involve the opposition parties more in decision making and ensure an open and constructive dialogue on all the problems that this country is currently facing."
"I voted for the 2010 progress report on the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia because I think that the Balkans' EU perspective is vital to ensuring the region's stability."
"In this context, cooperation with Greece is of paramount importance."
"The dispute about the former Yugoslav Republic's name plays a key role in the discussions on the accession negotiations, as it is one of the obstacles preventing the negotiations from starting."
"Good neighbourly relations are essential during the process of transition to EU Member State status."
"This is why the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Greece must find a solution to the issue about what to call the state."
"So far, Greece has proved itself to be a trustworthy discussion partner with regard to the other chapters."
"It is high time for both states to reach an agreement so that the future accession negotiations are conducted with the support of all EU Member States."
"In this regard, the call for neutral external mediators may be helpful, such as the involvement of the UN Secretary-General in the dispute."
"In line with previous resolutions by Parliament, I regret that the Council has not taken a decision on opening accession negotiations, as recommended by the Commission for the second year running."
"The process of EU enlargement is a powerful tool for peace, stability and reconciliation in this region."
"I am particularly concerned about the persistently high levels of unemployment, particularly among young people, a problem that is shared by many countries in the region."
"I would like to call upon the government to rapidly implement more effective measures to improve public investment focused on employment policies and the use of the workforce in good quality, stable and decent jobs."
"I am, however, pleased with the recent adoption of the Energy Act, which is aimed at liberalising the country's electricity market and is in accordance with the relevant European directives."
"I welcome the adoption of the national strategy for sustainable development, but more efforts need to be made towards enforcing legislation in the environmental field, and there needs to be adequate funding set aside for this purpose."
"I would like to call for closer cooperation on transnational environmental issues based on EU standards, particularly in the area of water quality, waste management and the protection of nature."
"The Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left is in favour of enlargement towards the Western Balkans in principle, provided that its people so wish."
"I abstained from voting on this specific report, because there are problematic points, apart from anything else, in connection with the proposed economic reforms and how the issue of the name is to be addressed."
"From experience of enlargement to date, cooperation with the countries of the Western Balkans and their integration process, especially at a time of economic crisis, should contribute towards the sustainable development and economic and social prosperity of the citizens in the enlargement countries and the Union."
"However, the report insists on rewarding choices such as the deployment of troops in Afghanistan and elsewhere or the promotion of economic policies, such as privatisations which are exacerbating the recession by increasing unemployment and social inequalities and cutting social rights."
"Also, the integration process should be conducted with respect for international law and international procedures."
"In this particular case, as regards the question of the name, the report should encourage respect and support for the procedure to find a commonly acceptable solution, under the aegis of the UN."
"I voted in favour of this resolution, as it once again recommends that the Council make a decision on opening accession negotiations to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia."
"The Council granted this state the status of a candidate country in 2005, but since then, it has not set a date for opening negotiations, despite the substantial progress that this country has made on its path towards the EU."
"in writing. - (PT) There have been some delays in the process of integrating the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia."
"In spite of this, Macedonia has made progress in seeking to adopt the Community acquis and to provide its institutions with reliable structures and good practice, as advocated by the EU."
"The political crisis that has plagued the country amply demonstrates that much remains to be done and that there is a long way to go before it objectively fulfils all the criteria for a real prospect of accession."
"I would like to call upon Greece and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to seek to overcome their differences and show that they are faithful to the generous founding EU spirit, which we all need so very much today."
"This motion for a resolution focuses on the progress that the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has made towards integration into the EU over the last year."
"On 16 December 2005, the Council granted the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia candidate country for accession status."
"In 2008, the principles, priorities and conditions for accession were set out, and these are being monitored by the Commission."
"Although the assessment was positive, there are aspects that need to be stepped up, such as dialogue with Greece on the status of the new Member State, the reform of public administration and the judicial system, combating organised crime and corruption, respect for freedom of expression, and institutional cooperation."
"The current political situation, which includes the boycott of the national parliament by opposition parties, may adversely affect the country's priorities with regard to the EU."
"The interested parties have to resolve bilateral issues in a spirit of good neighbourliness."
"All players must increase their efforts and show responsibility and determination in resolving all outstanding issues which are hampering the process of accession for the candidate country and the EU's own policy in the region."
"I voted in favour of this document because in 2005, the European Council granted candidate status to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia but has failed ever since to set a date for the opening of negotiations, in spite of the substantial progress made by that country on its path towards the EU; because bilateral issues should not represent and be used as an obstacle in the accession process, although they should be settled before membership; and because the continuation of the accession process would contribute to the stability of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and would further strengthen inter-ethnic dialogue."
"Bilateral issues need to be resolved by the parties concerned in a good neighbourly spirit and taking overall EU interests into account."
"All the key players and parties concerned should step up their efforts and demonstrate responsibility and determination to solve all outstanding issues which are not only hindering the accession process of the candidate country, and the EU's own policy in the region, but could also have repercussions on inter-ethnic relations, regional stability and economic development."
"The document urges the authorities responsible to strengthen the independence and freedom of the media, applying equal standards to all of them and improving the transparency of their ownership."
"I am concerned that there is insufficient dialogue between the government and opposition parties and a general climate of distrust and confrontation."
"It is necessary to continue reform of the judiciary in order to ensure its professionalism, efficiency and independence from political pressures, expand the fight against corruption and improve the business environment."
"The process of EU enlargement is a powerful stimulus for the encouragement of the peace, stability and reconciliation process in the Balkans."
"Macedonia has made significant progress in the democratisation of the state, due directly to the political will to become a full member of the family of European nations."
"The European Commission has evaluated this progress and, for the second year running now, has called upon the European Council to open accession negotiations with Macedonia."
"Also for the second year running, the Council has not taken this decision."
"This gives rise to the impression that one of the unfounded obstacles to the opening of these negotiations are mutual bones of contention, including relations with Greece."
"These disputes must not block the accession process for Macedonia, all the more so since continuing the accession process would promote stability and strengthen yet further the dialogue between the ethnic communities in Macedonia."
"Of course, Macedonia has a great deal to do yet in order to reform governmental and judicial institutions, successfully combat organised crime and corruption, and develop democratic dialogues in society."
"Of course, the acceptance of any new Member State, Macedonia included, into the EU will only take place when all the requirements have been satisfied, and only with the unambiguous agreement of the EU institutions and EU Member States."
"That is precisely why it is important to begin the accession negotiation process, which, I am convinced, will encourage positive changes in Macedonia and the region as a whole."
"The motion for a resolution on the 2010 progress report on the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, on which Parliament has voted, has been approved by a large majority and with the agreement of several political groups."
"I applaud the efforts made by that country to align itself with European standards."
"Judicial reform, the fight against corruption, and public administration and prison reform are some of the important achievements as regards compliance with the acquis communautaire."
"Equally worthy of praise is the focus on granting local autonomy and adopting an anti-discrimination law, as well as on making a commitment to gender equality."
"Freedom of expression and the independence of the media continue to be a problem, however."
"Moreover, the growing tensions between different ethnic groups in the country are a cause for concern."
"I therefore believe that, despite the positive results, attention must continue to be paid to the institutional question, which is very fragile and is being put to the test."
"I hope, in conclusion, that the process of rapprochement with Europe will be strengthened by means of action aimed at filling the gaps that still exist today."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of the resolution in order to acknowledge Macedonia's progress towards European integration and highlight the remaining goals to be achieved for the benefit of its people."
"It is essential to send Macedonia a positive signal regarding its future within the European Union in order to maintain the European momentum and further the political dialogue that has been initiated."
"The name issue existing between Macedonia and Greece is exclusively a bilateral issue that should not interfere with the opening of accession negotiations."
"Moreover, under the 13 September 1995 Interim Accord between Greece and Macedonia, Greece agreed not to object to the application of Macedonia to international institutions, this covering also the EU-Macedonia negotiations process."
"In the Committee on Foreign Affairs, I contributed amendments concerning the public administration, the justice system and anti-corruption action."
"The adoption of a national strategy for public administration reform and the creation of the stabilisation and association agreement's subcommittee are positive steps to ensure the capacities and professionalism of the public administration."
"I stress that the unification of jurisprudence and publishing of all court decisions are highly important for predictability of the judiciary and public trust in the system."
"in writing. - I voted for the report on Macedonia and welcome the continued efforts in the fight against corruption, manifested, amongst other things, by implementation of the second round of GRECO recommendations and the entry into force of the amendments to the Criminal Code."
"I encourage the authorities to continue implementing legislation to combat corruption and improving the independence, efficiency and resources of the judiciary."
"However, corruption remains prevalent and I call for further intensive efforts to eradicate it."
"I stress the urgency of effective and impartial enforcement of anti-corruption legislation, in particular, on the financing of political parties and on conflicts of interest."
"I draw attention to the importance of ensuring that the court system functions free of political interference and welcome the efforts to increase the efficiency and transparency of the court system."
"I stress the need to build up an enforcement record for prosecutions and convictions against which progress can be measured and call for the unification of jurisprudence in order to ensure a predictable judicial system and public trust."
"In the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, violation of the independence of the press, of the independence of the judiciary and of the Skopje 2014 urban development plan are everyday occurrences."
"At the same time, political dialogue has now ground to a halt."
"With the unresolved question of the name being added to this unfortunate internal environment, it is clear that the European prospects of this country are being severely tried."
"This resolution calls on the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to do its utmost to liberalise its economy and its electricity market."
"It gives the country lessons in democracy and even in journalism."
"I voted against this arrogant and shoddy text."
"The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has experienced some obstacles on its path towards EU accession."
"Despite making progress in the adoption of the entire Community acquis, giving its institutions reliable structures and best practice, there is still a long way to go."
"Much remains to be done, as shown by the political crisis that has been plaguing the state."
"On 9 April 2001, Macedonia was the first country in the Western Balkans to enter into a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU."
"The status of reforms since 2001 can be judged positively in many respects."
"Where the judiciary is concerned, legal provisions have been passed to ensure both independence from political pressure and efficiency."
"The improvements to the transparency of the court system, particularly as regards dealing with the backlog of cases in most courts, are also to be welcomed."
"The country can already be seen to be making progress towards the transition to a functioning market economy, although there is still a long way to go."
"Only the dispute with Greece over its name is blocking Macedonia's accession to the EU, and it is to be hoped that this can be resolved in the near future."
"However, I abstained from voting because some aspects of the report are very unbalanced."
"I voted in favour of the 2010 monitoring report on the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia."
"The process of accession for the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has experienced significant delays, despite the political and socio-economic progress that the country has made."
"I hope that the existing differences and regional problems can be overcome to the benefit of the common European good."
"in writing. - In favour."
"This resolution basically says that the EP shares the assessment by the Commission's 2010 progress report on the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and regrets that the Council has not taken a decision on the opening of accession negotiations, as recommended by the Commission for a second year in a row and in line with previous Parliament resolutions."
"It is concerned at the current political situation, including the boycott of the national parliament by the opposition parties, and by the risk that these developments could adversely affect the country's EU agenda and recalls its previous recommendation to the Council to start the negotiations immediately."
"I voted in favour of this report because I believe that the moment has come to open genuine and proper accession negotiations with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia."
"In fact, since the European Council of 16 December 2005 awarded that country the status of candidate country for EU membership, no significant steps forward have been taken on the issue."
"This must be traced back, primarily, to a series of problems within the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, in particular, as regards the opposition parties' boycott of the national parliament."
"This and other problems, such as the presence of free and independent media, deemed necessary for the development of a stable democracy, must be cleared up as soon as possible so that both parties can set out once more on the road to enlargement of the EU to the East."
"I voted against this particular report because, as I said earlier in plenary, I consider that, given the serious allegations made in the Sunday Times on 20 March against the rapporteur, Mr Zoran Thaler, who initially tabled the text which was then put to the vote in the Committee on Foreign Affairs on 16 March, before the revelations against him, and who may enjoy a presumption of innocence, and the fact that a new rapporteur has been reported, this motion for a resolution does not enjoy a presumption of credibility."
"In my opinion, it would be a mistake, for the integrity and credibility of the House, to vote on this motion before the results of enquiries are released following the opening of the conciliation procedure."
"I am in favour of this resolution because the crisis situation in Côte d'Ivoire should be brought to a swift end, as it has already resulted in a large number of deaths."
"The international community recognises the democratic victory of Mr Ouattara, and it must now redouble its efforts in helping him to take up power in a peaceful manner."
"As this is a serious situation which not only jeopardises the electoral choices legitimately made by the people, but also has repercussions on the breaching of human rights, the EU must act in a diplomatic way, with all the mechanisms that it has at its disposal, so as to help to bring the situation back to normal and, most importantly, to prevent more deaths."
"I voted in favour of this resolution because over the past four months, Côte d'Ivoire has been plunged into a deep political crisis stemming from the refusal of the incumbent President, Laurent Gbagbo, to relinquish power to the legitimate President, Alassane Ouattara, despite the fact that the latter won the November 2010 presidential poll and has been recognised as the victor by the international community, following validation of the results by the United Nations."
"According to UN sources, hundreds of lives have been lost in Côte d'Ivoire since December 2010 and the actual number of casualties is likely to be much higher, as the violence taking place in the interior of the country is not always reported in the press."
"Attacks are being intentionally directed against UN peacekeepers and institutions."
"I agree with the need for swift international political action to address the humanitarian situation in Côte d'Ivoire and prevent a new migration crisis in the region."
"The Commission and the Member States must coordinate their efforts with other international donors in order to respond to the urgent needs of the population of Côte d'Ivoire and its neighbouring countries."
"I support the sanctions, comprising a visa ban and an asset freeze, imposed by the United Nations Security Council, the African Union and the Council of the European Union on all persons and entities that oppose the legitimate President's authority, and the fact that these sanctions are to remain in place until the return of legitimate authorities to power."
"I strongly condemn the attempts made by ex-President Gbagbo and his supporters to violently usurp the will of the people of Côte d'Ivoire, and I would like to join in the call for Mr Gbagbo to leave power immediately."
"It is regrettable that the people of Côte d'Ivoire have had to pay such a high price in order to ensure respect for their democratic will, which they expressed in the presidential elections in November 2010."
"I would like to express my full support for President Ouattara, his government and the people of Côte d'Ivoire in their task of reconciliation, recovery and sustainable development."
"I would like to call for the opening of negotiations to restore order, peace, stability and security to the country in the difficult task of promoting national reunification."
"I voted in favour of the resolution on the situation in Côte d'Ivoire, condemning the violent attempts by former President, Mr Gbagbo, to usurp power, and stressing the need for him to leave power immediately in favour of the democratically elected President, Mr Ouattara, so as to restore peace and democracy to the country."
"Despite the grandiose vision of Félix Houphouët-Boigny, Côte d'Ivoire today is a country torn apart by the conflict between Mr Gbagbo and Mr Ouattara, and which is threatening to go on indefinitely."
"The people of Côte d'Ivoire have watched the military advances of the respective factions with concern and dread, fearing for the breakdown of security and the further destabilisation of the country."
"Côte d'Ivoire is another example of the danger posed by dictatorial leaderships that continue over time and which leave an institutional vacuum and an absence of democratic practice and the exercise of freedoms once they are gone."
"In line with the example that it has given throughout its existence, the European Union has a historic duty to speak out against all violations of human rights and to foster respect for the right to the self-determination of peoples, both through denunciation and through development programmes."
"We have recently seen an upsurge in violence and verified massacres in Côte d'Ivoire, where the process of democratisation is not being accepted by all Ivorians."
"Parliament has adopted several resolutions on the political situation in this country, especially on 16 December 2010."
"Other EU and international institutions, such as the UN Security Council and the Authority of Heads of States of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), have condemned the violation of human rights in this country following the non-acceptance of the election results, which were certified by the UN, by the deposed President, Mr Gbagbo, which has led to a wave of violence in the country, resulting in hundreds of deaths and about a million refugees."
"I therefore agree with the measures presented here and am voting in favour of this proposal, as I believe that Parliament should advocate a foreign policy based on values, and not solely on economic interests."
"We did not vote for this resolution, and we remain concerned about the situation of war in Côte d'Ivoire, the country's economic paralysis and the high levels of violence that are affecting the people, which has turned into a humanitarian crisis."
"We know that there are longstanding reasons for the grave situation that is taking place there, particularly the poverty and social inequality which were the legacy of former colonialism or the structural adjustment plans imposed for years by the IMF."
"These last four months of misery following the elections have shown how regrettable it is that the international community, including the EU, has not made sufficient use of diplomatic channels for a peaceful political solution to the crisis."
"The role of France is particularly unfortunate, as it has preferred military intervention to using diplomatic channels."
"We therefore insist that the war and violence by all parties must be brought to an end, and we urge the EU to act accordingly."
"This resolution is a master class in bad faith."
"It accomplishes the amazing feat of never talking negatively about Mr Ouattara's camp, the extent of whose atrocities the United Nations is nevertheless in the process of verifying on the ground."
"Yet it is true that Mr Ouattara, a Muslim of non-Ivorian origin trained at the IMF in Washington, can only elicit your support."
"The resolution praises the work of the United Nations Operations in Côte d'Ivoire (UNOCI) to the skies, even though the UN itself was obliged to ask France for assistance to safeguard its mission and, in particular, to ensure the protection of foreign nationals."
"A fine demonstration of effectiveness and usefulness that is!"
"As for the attention you are paying to ensuring that the election result is upheld, it would be good if you paid the same sustained attention when European nations reject the treaties that you put to them."
"Indeed, you only support the results that suit you."
"Such a short-sighted, black-and-white approach cannot be endorsed, and nor can a resolution that is even more badly informed than the European newspaper articles on which it appears to be based."
"I voted in favour of this document, because over the past four months, Côte d'Ivoire has been plunged into a deep political crisis stemming from the refusal by incumbent President, Laurent Gbagbo, to relinquish power to the legitimate President, Alassane Ouattara, despite the fact that the latter won the November 2010 presidential poll and has been recognised as the victor by the international community, following validation of the results by the United Nations."
"All diplomatic efforts to devise a peaceful solution to the post-election political deadlock, including those of the African Union, the Economic Community of West African States and the President of South Africa, have been unsuccessful."
"Since mid-February, fighting has intensified both in the capital and in the west of the country, with alarming reports indicating the increasing use of heavy artillery against civilians."
"Atrocities have been committed in Côte d'Ivoire, including cases of sexual violence, enforced disappearances, extrajudicial executions and the excessive and indiscriminate use of force against civilians, which amount to crimes against humanity."
"Parliament therefore calls on President Ouattara to facilitate peace and national reconciliation."
"The serious political and institutional crisis that has rocked Côte d'Ivoire for several months now has given rise to a wave of violence that seems to have no end in sight."
"I strongly condemn the attempt by ex-President Gbagbo to violently overturn a legitimate election result, which saw him defeated by Alassane Ouattara."
"For some months now, Côte d'Ivoire has been the scene of urban guerrilla warfare between the supporters of the outgoing President and the people."
"I believe that Europe, especially in situations such as this, in which basic human rights and the very ideal of democracy are being seriously jeopardised, must make its voice heard loud and clear by condemning such acts and showing its strong disapproval and indignation."
"in writing. - I welcome this resolution which urges all the political forces in Côte d'Ivoire to respect the will of the people expressed freely in the results of the presidential elections of 28 November 2010 that were announced by the CEI and certified by the UNSG Special Representative, and which recognised Alassane Dramane Ouattara as President-elect of Côte d'Ivoire."
"The resolution asks all Ivorian parties, in particular, to refrain from, prevent, and protect civilians from all forms of illegal coercion and abuses of Human Rights."
"The resolution also condemns, in the strongest possible terms, the attempts by ex-President Gbagbo and his supporters to usurp the will of the Ivorian people by fomenting violence and undermining the integrity of the electoral process."
"It stresses, in this respect, that results of democratic elections must be fully respected by all participants, including the defeated candidates, and underlines that failure to uphold these results would further put at risk both peace and stability in Côte d'Ivoire;"
"Respect for democracy is an inalienable principle of the EU."
"We must therefore strongly condemn the events in Côte d'Ivoire."
"The use of violence against civilians in Côte d'Ivoire by Mr Gbagbo after losing the elections is unacceptable, and he must resign and hand over power immediately."
"Those who are responsible must not go unpunished, and we must do everything in our power to identify and prosecute them, at an international level if need be, for crimes against the civilian population, whereby the EU will be able to provide the necessary support for the investigations."
"Following the election results in Côte d'Ivoire, President Gbagbo - who had been democratically voted out - was not prepared to accept his removal from office."
"Neither attempts at negotiation nor international criticism were successful, resulting in a crisis involving incidents of violent conflict."
"It is important to maintain international pressure, for example, by condemning the human rights abuses and crimes against humanitarian law in the strongest possible terms and by imposing sanctions."
"Efforts in respect of abducted civilians, who include EU citizens, are equally important."
"However, this resolution looks only at the atrocities committed by the troops of the defeated President Gbagbo, and not at the charges made against the troops of the newly elected President Ouattara."
"Where acts of violence are concerned, it should make no difference who committed them."
"The serious human rights abuses and acts of violence committed by the defeated President Gbagbo must be condemned by the EU in the strongest possible terms."
"If humanitarian law continues to be broken, specific sanctions must be imposed."
"However, it is also important that violent crimes on both sides are punished; in other words, also those of which the new President Ouattara has been accused."
"For the victims of violent assaults, it is of little concern who ordered the violence."
"In this respect, I consider the resolution too one-sided."
"Given the political crisis, with the serious social consequences which this country is experiencing, I welcome the commitment undertaken by the EU, and expressed by Commissioner Georgieva, to help resolve the humanitarian crisis."
"in writing. - In favour."
"I join my voice to those who: 1."
"Regret that the post election political deadlock was not solved peacefully and all diplomatic efforts to this end have not been successful; 2."
"Condemn the tragic loss of life and properties in the post election violence and calls on MM Gbagbo and Ouattara to ensure the respect of human rights and the rule of law; and 3."
"Call upon M Ouattara and M Gbagbo to take their responsibility in order to prevent any violence and post battle reprisals in the country and demonstrate their commitment to peaceful democratic transition."
"In the last four months, Côte d'Ivoire has plunged into a deep political crisis."
"The refusal by outgoing President, Laurent Gbagbo, to cede power to Alassane Ouattara, the winner of the presidential election of November 2010, has sparked off a spiral of violence throughout the country that shows no sign of abating."
"Fighting has intensified since mid-February both in the capital and in the western part of the country, and alarming news of the increasing use of heavy artillery against civilians continues to reach us."
"Up to now, diplomatic efforts by the international community have come to nought, despite the validation of the election result by the United Nations."
"The time has come to condemn the attempts by ex-President Gbagbo and his supporters to violently subvert the wish of the Ivorian people."
"Laurent Gbagbo must resign immediately and cede power to Alassane Ouattara, the legitimately elected President."
"For four months, Côte d'Ivoire has been plunged in a deep political crisis caused by the refusal of ex-President Laurent Gbagbo to hand over power to the legitimate President, Alassane Ouattara."
"This situation is having particularly disastrous humanitarian consequences."
"The post-election violence has created over a million internally displaced persons and refugees."
"What is more, this mass influx of refugees could reignite the obvious tensions in that region."
"This crisis is therefore liable to continue."
"While I welcome the Commission's decision to increase its humanitarian aid fivefold, thereby taking European aid up to EUR 30 million, it is essential for the European Union to do all it can to help the most vulnerable population groups and to monitor their changing needs."
"I was anxious to support this resolution, which clearly condemns the atrocities committed against the civilian population by the militias loyal to the outgoing Ivorian President, Laurent Gbagbo."
"Ending the conflict by diplomatic means would have been preferable, but the level of violence reached in Abidjan and the hard-line, self-destructive attitude of the deposed President demanded UN intervention in order to protect the civilians and to help the legitimate President, Alassane Ouattara, assume power."
"This resolution therefore supports the intervention of French forces under UN control, which helps to enforce the law and the election result, and to protect the lives of civilians and European nationals."
"When the rule of law has been re-established, the legitimate Ivorian authorities, with the support of the international community, will have to ensure that the losing candidate in Côte d'Ivoire's recent presidential elections, Laurent Gbagbo, together with all the officials suspected of human rights violations, are tried for their actions."
"Lastly, I believe the EU must continue to honour its commitment to provide long-term support to Côte d'Ivoire in order to aid national reconciliation and to help rebuild and stabilise the country."
"I am voting for this report, as it has important objectives like the liberalisation of visas, free trade agreements, contacts with civil society and the non-use of force as regards EU involvement in conflicts, as well as self-determination and territorial integrity."
"Since it was launched in 2004, the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) has led to a strengthening of relations with partner countries."
"The Eastern Partnership (EaP) is a meaningful political framework for deepening relations with partner countries, based on principles of shared ownership and responsibility."
"The priorities of the EaP include the development of democracy, good governance and stability, economic integration and convergence with EU policies, particularly as regards the environment, climate change and energy security."
"The implementation of the ENP faces certain obstacles; therefore, the ENP review must include clearly defined priorities for action, clear benchmarking and performance-based differentiation."
"The ENP must continue to be founded on the principles of democracy, the rule of law, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and must support the political, social and economic reforms of our closest partners."
"I voted for the initiative from the Commission and Council to review the European Neighbourhood Policy - Eastern Dimension."
"This policy has produced results thanks to its flexibility and it now needs to be adapted to the new realities in Europe."
"This is precisely why it needs to be adjusted better to the specific circumstances of each country included in the programme."
"I think that the most important consideration should be the commitment of partner states rather than geographical location."
"However, people are at the heart of the reforms carried out in a state."
"The countries in the east and south must enjoy the same opportunities, making it necessary to rebalance the Neighbourhood Policy."
"Former Soviet states also need cooperation with the EU, a sentiment supported too by Joe Biden during his recent visit to Chişinău."
"I should point out that the Republic of Moldova is the leading reformer within the Eastern Partnership."
"I voted in favour of this resolution because the review of the Eastern Dimension of the European Neighbourhood Policy includes such major objectives as democratic processes, good governance and stability, economic integration, the environment, climate change and energy security."
"The European Parliament is of the opinion that combating corruption, in particular, in the judiciary and the police, should be a top priority for the EU in the development of its relations with the eastern partners."
"Furthermore, it is necessary to intensify efforts to combat international organised crime networks and to increase police and judicial cooperation with competent EU agencies."
"It is very important for the organisations of civil society to actively carry on their work, particularly in the field of human rights, promoting democratic processes and ensuring media freedom."
"I would like to emphasise the importance of freedom of expression and of free and independent media, including the Internet, for the development of democracies."
"I would also like to stress the importance of trade unions and social dialogue as part of the democratic development of the eastern partners."
"The Commission's reports on the ENP not only depict the real benefits of the policy of good neighbourliness, but also its challenges."
"The ENP needs to be revised and a different approach adopted to the way in which the European Union responds to the progress made by neighbouring countries in terms of socio-economic reforms by giving them financial and political support and adapting it to the specific needs of each country."
"The Eastern Partnership offers a political framework for consolidating relations between the EU and its eastern neighbours and the continuation of the socio-economic reforms in partner countries."
"The progress made by each country must be assessed using a comparative analysis based on predefined criteria, but not without factoring in each country's specific features."
"'A European perspective including Article 49 of the Treaty on European Union' could constitute a driving force for reforms in these countries."
"Parliament must play an important role both in establishing the assessment criteria and in strengthening freedom and democracy in the neighbouring partner countries."
"In the first place, I would like to congratulate my fellow Member, Mr Siwiec, on the excellent work that he has done and on the collaboration, or, better, the synthesis of ideas that we have achieved, on the general principle of the revision of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP)."
"Besides what I have already said about the resolution on the Southern Dimension, for which I was the rapporteur, I would like to stress the need for both ENP dimensions to favour a 'bottom-up' approach in the future, and to emphasise that only greater involvement by local communities and civil society will ensure maximum effectiveness in the implementation of the ENP by the EU."
"I also hope that the EU will not favour short-term stability at the expense of the best interests and constant defence of the public, and their individual and collective freedom, with a particular focus on women's rights, as I stated in my speech."
"Although I am immensely pleased with the results obtained in these two reports, I do rather regret the fact that Parliament and the Commission have not made the most of this opportunity, for once, to differentiate the countries of the ENP to the east from the countries that will potentially become our EU southern ENP partners."
"The aim of the resolution on the Eastern Dimension of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) is to recommend that the next strategic review of the ENP strengthens the differentiation between states based on their respective ambition and commitments, when followed by real progress and concrete steps."
"The specificities of each partner should be taken into consideration, including its goals and potential."
"Fundamental European values, including democracy, rule of law and respect for human rights and basic freedoms, the independence of the judiciary and the fight against corruption are the basis upon which the ENP was established, and these should be the main measure for evaluating the role of the eastern partners."
"Freedom of the press and the fight against corruption should be a priority for the EU when building relations with these countries, and this should be reflected in the overall framework for institutional development."
"The EU's goals are very broad and are based on an extension to neighbouring countries in order to create a large area for the free movement of people and goods."
"In these circumstances, the EU's European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) has a vital role in its strategy for development and growth."
"Several instruments and resolutions have been adopted to this end, particularly the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI) and the crucial choices of the common foreign and security policy."
"I am therefore pleased with the adoption of this report and the proposed measures, particularly the strengthening of funding and cooperation from various sectors, along with the holding of a second summit of the Eastern Partnership during the second half of 2011."
"I would like to point out the need for the EU to step up its dialogue with civil society organisations in these countries, fostering free trade and promoting stability, encouraging the sharing of experience and mobility between the Member States and those countries, and promoting multilateral dialogue."
"I voted in favour of this resolution, because the review of the Eastern Dimension of the European Neighbourhood Policy includes such fundamental goals as democracy, the rule of law, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, a market economy, sustainable development and good governance."
"It stresses that the ENP is still a framework of strategic importance for deepening and strengthening relations with our closest partners so as to support their political, social and economic reforms, and underlines the importance of maintaining the principle of joint ownership in the design and implementation of programmes and actions."
"The Eastern Partnership has been launched as a political framework for the advancement of the Eastern Dimension of the ENP, which seeks to deepen and strengthen the relations between the EU and its eastern neighbours, furthering political association, economic integration and legislative approximation, while supporting political and socio-economic reforms in the partner countries."
"I would like to stress that economic reforms must go hand in hand with political reforms and that good governance can only be achieved through an open and transparent decision-making process based on democratic institutions."
"It is particularly important to foster further regional cooperation in the Black Sea space and enhance EU policies towards the Black Sea region, in particular, by launching a fully-fledged EU strategy for the Black Sea and ensuring that there are the necessary financial and human resources for its effective implementation."
"in writing. - I have always encouraged the Eastern Neighbourhood Policy of the European Union and this can be seen from my previous activities."
"I endorse the review of the European Neighbourhood Policy, mainly because it is needed to make a substantial contribution to ensuring that human rights and political principles are more strongly integrated into the analysis of the political situation in third countries."
"It underlines the positive developments concerning human rights and democratisation in some partner countries and some negative developments in others, particularly in Belarus."
"I also found important the fact that it pays particular attention to the mobility of students, academics, researchers and businessmen by ensuring that sufficient resources are available and by strengthening existing scholarship programmes."
"For all these reasons, I support the review of the European Neighbourhood Policy."
"The review of the neighbourhood policy must continue to resolve the specific problems which the regions located at the European Union's border have to face."
"I think that significant administrative capacity is required to be able to tackle such diverse problems."
"Apart from the demographic challenges, climate change, economic competitiveness and quality of life, the regions which share borders with non-Member States have to deal with a series of consequences resulting from problems which are not being resolved properly."
"This is the case with the way in which natural disasters are managed, for instance."
"Interventions in emergency situations are extremely difficult if the neighbouring countries do not have the capacity to respond, and no region can respond to the whole situation on its own."
"This is why I have proposed that the regions located at the EU border, which have borders with at least two non-EU states, should be regarded as 'platform' regions and supported accordingly."
"The neighbourhood policy needs to take into account the capacity of the regions located within the EU, but which have external borders, to tackle the problems which are much more complex."
"Commensurate financial support must be provided for this."
"in writing. - I voted for this resolution and encourage the countries in the region to cooperate more closely with each other and to engage in an enhanced and prolonged dialogue, at all relevant levels, regarding areas such as freedom, security and justice and, in particular, border management, migration and asylum, the fight against organised crime, trafficking in human beings, illegal immigration, terrorism, money laundering and drugs trafficking, as well as police and judicial cooperation."
"The resolution recalls that good neighbourly relations are one of the most important preconditions for progress by ENP countries towards EU membership."
"The new European Neighbourhood Policy that we have been promised is just more of the same, with a few extra glimmers of democratic lucidity."
"When it comes to the Eastern Dimension, everything is there: free trade areas, support for the Nabucco and AGRI projects, and outsourcing the 'management of migration flows'."
"Nothing has changed."
"I voted against."
"The EU is neither a state nor a democracy, yet it is already behaving like an imperialist power."
"Originally, the three countries of the South Caucasus were excluded from the European Neighbourhood Policy and were only included in the action radius of the Neighbourhood Policy."
"Action Plans to deepen bilateral relations are an important instrument of the European Neighbourhood Policy which are brokered individually for each country, since in practice, every country follows its own path."
"The region of the South Caucasus, in particular, is characterised by a series of conflicts, the final solution of which is judged even by experts to be extremely difficult in some cases."
"In this context, it is important to repeatedly make it clear that the EU's Neighbourhood Policy does not automatically lead towards accession (as in the enlargement process)."
"Rather, it is concerned with security policy aspects and increasing stability."
"This is not expressed sufficiently in the resolution, which is why I did not vote in favour."
"The European Neighbourhood Policy is an instrument for ensuring stability and promoting peaceful and democratic structures, as well as for deepening bilateral relations with the countries surrounding the EU."
"In the countries of the South Caucasus, in particular, there is much to do, especially since the region is repeatedly the subject of conflict."
"What the European Neighbourhood Policy is not, and nor should it be, is a preliminary stage of enlargement policy."
"I feel that this is not made clear, and consequently, I cannot support the motion."
"The European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) has shown itself to be an effective foreign policy instrument, promoting the strengthening of relations with third countries, with certain tangible benefits."
"The ultimate goal of an effective neighbourhood policy is to guarantee peace."
"The Eastern Partnership is a political framework which is important for deepening relations with and between partner countries, based on the principle of shared duties and responsibilities."
"I voted in favour of this resolution as I also believe that strengthening relations between all countries, as is recommended here, requires greater common commitment and further progress towards good governance and democratic standards."
"I voted in favour of this resolution, which reaffirms the need to revise the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) based on upholding the EU's fundamental values and principles and on greater involvement by civil society and local communities, and which highlights the importance of the ENP's Eastern Dimension as an instrument for strengthening EU relations with its neighbours to the east, with a view to supporting political, social and economic reforms in those countries and deepening its commitment to shared values and principles such as democracy, the rule of law, respect for human rights and good governance, within the context of European integration."
"in writing. - In favour."
"I join my voice to those that welcome the progress in relations between the EU and neighbouring countries within the ENP and reaffirm the values, principles and commitments upon which the ENP has been built, which include democracy, the rule of law, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, a market economy, sustainable development and good governance; consider that the ENP is still a framework of strategic importance for deepening and strengthening relations with our closest partners so as to support their political, social and economic reforms, and underline the importance of maintaining the principle of joint ownership in the design and implementation of programmes and actions."
"Under Article 8 of the Treaty on European Union, the Union shall develop a special relationship with neighbouring countries, aiming to establish an area of prosperity and good neighbourliness."
"As we have seen, European Neighbourhood Policy has very much led to a strengthening of relations with partner countries and brought many tangible benefits for the common good."
"Challenges still remain, however, and the focus should now be on the priorities for action, with more effective benchmarks, in particular, as regards the Eastern Partnership."
"The partnership with our Eastern neighbours represents a political framework of great importance for Europe's wellbeing, and its work platform is focused on four themes: democracy, good governance, economic integration and convergence with European policies."
"Unfortunately, at this time, the conflicts that have arisen in these countries are seriously undermining their economic, social and political development, and constitute a serious obstacle to cooperation and regional security, as shown by the recent uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt."
"I should like to see a strategic review of European Neighbourhood Policy that is based on the Union's values, which are against oppressive regimes, and that supports the legitimate democratic aspirations of the Eastern peoples."
"Since its creation, the European Neighbourhood Policy has brought tangible benefits to all parties involved."
"It creates a framework for cooperation, which is of strategic importance for supporting the political, social and economic reforms of our closest partners."
"The Eastern Partnership is focused on the development of democracy, good governance and stability, economic integration and on achieving closer relations with EU policy."
"Since the creation of the ENP, progress has been noticeable in the field of human rights, the democratisation of public life and economic reforms in many partner countries."
"It is only Belarus that participates to a limited degree in the cooperation with the EU, and its further participation in the ENP should be conditional on its willingness to respect the fundamental principles of democracy and freedom."
"Attention must be paid to the fight against corruption, electoral law and the way in which elections are held, so that they are in conformity with the standards of international law."
"Support should be expressed for the EURONEST Parliamentary Assembly by highlighting its role in strengthening democracy and the development of cooperation with the countries of the Eastern Partnership."
"The resolution of the European Parliament on the review of the European Neighbourhood Policy is to meet the challenges that have emerged in recent months in our neighbourhood, both in the Eastern and the Southern Dimension."
"These events have demonstrated the inadequacy of the existing EU involvement in the neighbourhood."
"The paradigm shift proposed by the European Parliament from 'stability first' to 'democratisation and human rights first' in EU policy is necessary."
"There should be no more pretending that the political status quo, i.e. maintaining authoritarian regimes, is better for Europe and its security."
"The time has come for solidarity with our neighbours."
"Despite the differences, most countries in the neighbourhood share common characteristics: limited freedom, or no freedom at all, and a lack of success in modernisation."
"The allocation of additional, generous funds in order to build a stable EU neighbourhood seems unavoidable."
"The ENP should therefore continue to be founded on the principle of conditionality, bilateral and multilateral cooperation and should be extended by the pursuit of institutional integration, liberalisation of the visa regime, opening up the European market and support for civil society."
"It is worth recalling again the position of Poland, the advocate of the EU's successive enlargements, which urged the Member States two years ago, in partnership with Sweden, to strengthen the Eastern Dimension of the ENP in the form of the Eastern Partnership initiative."
"In the face of current events, Poland's role takes on a symbolic meaning."
"Poland, which has historical experience in transformation of its political-economic system, may serve as a good guide and model for both eastern and southern EU neighbours in the current policy."
"The European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) has shown itself to be a key EU foreign policy instrument, fostering closer relations between the partner countries and providing benefits for both parties."
"The amendments that have resulted from the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon are intended to give greater consistency, efficiency and legitimacy to the EU's external dimension."
"However, it is vital to review and point out the mistakes of the past."
"The review of the ENP and the Eastern Partnership should set out priorities for specific action from each partner, along with benchmarks and differentiation based on performance and the results achieved."
"A 'bottom-up' approach, with support for civil society and the processes of democratisation, is a prerequisite for long-term sustainability and growth."
"A strong focus on training, education, research and mobility is needed in order to address the socio-economic problems of the region."
"Lastly, I would like to highlight the support that the EU has given to Belarusian civil society in the strengthening of democratic and social reforms so as to enable its participation in the ENP and other sectoral policies."
"I am in favour of the statements that make the commitment that new developments, past mistakes and support for democratic transformation should be taken into consideration, along with economic and social reforms in the region, combating corruption, and the promotion of human rights and basic freedoms."
"Most importantly, a multilateral dimension should be developed and synergies created between the bilateral and multilateral dimensions of this partnership, including the revitalisation of the Union for the Mediterranean (UFM) and the strengthening of the role of trade unions among the civilian population."
"It is also important to point out the need to increase the funds allocated to this policy, and to make better use of them."
"We need to rethink our policy on the Southern Mediterranean."
"The European Neighbourhood Policy was supposed to promote the values of democracy and human rights, yet the events that have been taking place in the Southern Mediterranean since the start of the year show that we failed on that score."
"Admittedly, cooperation in areas such as education and modernisation of the economy has borne fruit."
"The same cannot be said of good governance, judicial reform and democracy, which are nonetheless headline objectives of the European Neighbourhood Policy."
"This text has the merit of proposing solutions for radically rethinking this policy."
"I hope that the European Commission and the Council will be able to take inspiration from it."
"Important strategic amendments were made to the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) today in the plenary debate in Strasbourg."
"This has shown that Europe can be proactive if it wants to be, and that it can remain united around an ideal."
"We have proven this once again today."
"I am pleased to see this, in a resolution for which I had the honour of being the rapporteur."
"Indeed, I was pleased to notice that Commissioner Füle welcomed almost all of our proposals, as the whole Chamber could see during the debate which preceded this vote."
"I now challenge the Commission to demonstrate the ambition that this moment demands in its review process on 10 May, with a neighbourhood policy that is tailor-made to each state, with clear benchmarks and careful consideration."
"This will allow a future Mediterranean Economic Area with the new democracies in the south, and I hope that the good atmosphere and cooperation that have marked the work on this subject will lead to the permanent involvement of Parliament in planning and evaluating this policy."
"I think it is absolutely vital that the EU should favour a bottom-up approach in the future for its neighbourhood policy, for the reasons outlined in this resolution."
"in writing. - I voted against this motion."
"Whilst it is essential that we try to encourage peace and democracy in the Mediterranean, it is absolutely clear that the strategy behind the European Neighbourhood Policy has so far failed."
"This policy costs taxpayers in the region of one and a half billion euro per year, yet it has manifestly failed to deliver."
"We are currently facing a refugee crisis in the area and many regimes are turning on their own people."
"There is no doubt in my mind that we will soon be asked to approve further funding."
"Without clear objectives and a programme of work, this muddled policy will continue to fail the most vulnerable in the region."
"It is equally clear that the High Representative has been ineffective in coordinating a response to the continuing security and humanitarian situation."
"The recent events in the Southern Mediterranean region, which began with Tunisia in December 2010, have brought a new urgency to the review of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP)."
"Parliament should monitor the processes of democratic transition in the Southern Mediterranean countries and, along with the other European institutions, support this transition as swiftly and peacefully as possible, providing important support through the instruments at its disposal, which are aimed at promoting political, economic and social reforms."
"The strengthening of democracy, rule of law, good governance, the fight against corruption and respect for human rights and basic freedoms are essential elements in the political dialogue between the EU and its southern neighbours."
"Given these events, the Union for the Mediterranean deserves to be revived, and should be strengthened with a view to the Southern Dimension of the ENP."
"I am pleased with the quality of this resolution and its adoption, and I would like to offer my congratulations to my colleague, Mr David."
"The EU's goals are very broad and are based on an extension to neighbouring countries in order to create a large area for the free movement of people and goods."
"In these circumstances, the EU's European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) has a vital role in its strategy for development and growth."
"Several instruments and resolutions have been adopted to this end, particularly the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI) and the crucial choices of the common foreign and security policy."
"However, the review of the ENP now has a greater importance in the context of the events in the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean."
"The EU should draw lessons from the events in the south, particularly in Tunisia and Egypt, and revise its democracy and human rights support policy so as to create an implementation mechanism for the human rights clauses in all agreements with third countries."
"The revision of the ENP should give priority to criteria relating to the independence of the judiciary, respect for basic freedoms, pluralism and freedom of the press, and the fight against corruption."
"In the light of the recent events in the Mediterranean basin and of their direct and indirect consequences for European countries, we must carry out a swift and thorough review of European Neighbourhood Policy."
"Europe's new strategy must be based on a redefinition of the resources available for the Mediterranean, provide for an increase in financial commitments to facilitate political, economic and social reform in the countries of the region, and press for resources relating to immigration."
"Moreover, as regards the radical changes affecting our southern neighbours, I believe that the moment has come to adopt a new European approach with the aim not only of defending democracy but also of taking concrete measures to alleviate migratory pressures and to guarantee the security of energy supply."
"In this context, it is essential to lay the foundations, as soon as possible, for a new and strengthened partnership with our neighbouring countries to the south: a partnership aimed at promoting the stability, economic development and democratic transition of the area."
"With this in mind, I believe that the European Union must play a key role in the geopolitical context of the region."
"I voted in favour of this document because it highlights the importance of setting up a task force, involving Parliament, in response to the calls for monitoring of the democratic transition processes made by actors for democratic change, in particular, as regards free and democratic elections and institution building, including an independent judiciary."
"It also calls on the EU to lend strong support to the process of political and economic reform in the region by using all existing instruments within the framework of the Eastern Neighbourhood Policy and, wherever necessary, by adopting new ones in order to assist in the most effective way possible the process of democratic transition, with a focus on respect for fundamental freedoms, good governance, the independence of the judiciary and the fight against corruption, thus responding to the needs and expectations of the peoples of our southern neighbours."
"We must ensure that we provide better targeted assistance, particularly aimed at civil society and local communities, in keeping with the bottom-up approach."
"However, any increase in the funds allocated should be based on an accurate assessment of needs and consistent with an increase in the effectiveness of the programmes implemented, tailored and prioritised according to the requirements of each beneficiary country."
"in writing. - I voted for this resolution which recalls, in the light of current events in the Southern Mediterranean, particularly in Tunisia and Egypt, the ENP's failure to promote and safeguard human rights in third countries; urges the EU to draw lessons from those events and to revise its democracy and human rights support policy so as to create an implementation mechanism for the human rights clause included in all agreements with third countries; insists that the review of the ENP must prioritise criteria relating to the independence of the judiciary, respect for fundamental freedoms, pluralism and freedom of the press and the fight against corruption; and calls for better coordination with the Union's other policies vis-à-vis those countries."
"The new European Neighbourhood Policy that we have been promised is just more of the same, with the addition of a few necessary democratic considerations."
"For the rest, the agreements negotiated with dictatorships are set to live on: free trade areas, outsourcing the 'management of migration flows', the EU's energy security - everything is there."
"The EU could not care less about burgeoning democracies."
"I voted against."
"For some years, the EU has focused in its neighbourhood policy on economic liberalisation, hoping that this will have positive political side-effects."
"The dynamism of economic reforms has long been undermined by authoritarian regimes by means of increased state repression."
"Whether the European Neighbourhood Policy can really contribute to greater stability is questionable in view of the escalation of events in Libya."
"In the Maghreb countries, it seems that the hopes of the Barcelona Process may be fulfilled in part, albeit with side-effects that the EU had not anticipated and for which it was not prepared - even though they are commonly associated with processes of transformation."
"The Barcelona Process in itself is a good thing, and I also took this into consideration when voting."
"The European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) has shown itself to be an effective foreign policy instrument."
"Through the interparliamentary delegations and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Union for the Mediterranean, Parliament should assume its responsibility to promote the idea that the stability and prosperity of Europe are closely linked to democratic governance and the economic and social progress of the southern neighbour countries, and to promote political debate, real freedom, democratic reforms and the rule of law in neighbouring partner countries."
"For these reasons, which were expressed in the resolution, I voted in favour."
"The recent protests in several countries in the EU's southern neighbourhood, particularly Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya, have clearly shown the need for the EU to amend its neighbourhood policy, giving it more ambitious and effective instruments that will allow it to encourage and support the political, economic and social reforms which are being demanded."
"It is therefore vital that the revision of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) reflects these developments and allows an adequate response to the challenges that these present, with an emphasis on the uncompromising defence of democratic values and fundamental rights and freedoms, with a commitment to greater involvement by civil society and local communities."
"Mr David, the rapporteur, states this very well in his report, and I would like to commend him on his excellent work."
"in writing. - In favour."
"The EP reaffirms the values, principles and commitments upon which the ENP has been built, which include democracy, the rule of law, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and respect for women's rights, good governance, the market economy and sustainable development, and reiterates that the ENP has to become a valid framework for the deepening and strengthening of relations with our closest partners so as to encourage and support their political, social and economic reforms, which are designed to establish and consolidate democracy, progress and social and economic opportunities for all; emphasises the importance of maintaining the principles of shared responsibility and joint ownership in the conception and implementation of ENP programmes; considers that since its launch in 2004, the ENP, as a single policy framework and through its performance-driven differentiation and tailor-made assistance, has brought tangible benefits both for ENP partners and the EU."
"Under Article 8 of the Treaty on European Union, the Union shall develop a special relationship with neighbouring countries, aiming to establish an area of prosperity and good neighbourliness."
"Respect for, and the promotion of, democracy and human rights, especially those of women, are fundamental principles of the European Union and must constitute common values shared with partner countries of the European Neighbourhood Policy."
"Today's popular uprisings in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya are the consequence of the people's general discontent with their own totalitarian regimes, and it is spreading throughout the entire eastern region."
"In view of this changed social and political landscape, the EU must make effective adjustments to its neighbourhood policy in order to give effective support to the reform process in the areas of human rights and democracy."
"The EU must define in detail the strategic priorities pursued in the partnerships with its eastern and southern neighbours."
"I should like to see the Union take action sustained by the will to initiate a process of democratisation, in particular, with regard to greater participation by women in public life and better planning of socio-economic development."
"I voted in favour of this report because current events should encourage us to reform the neighbourhood policy, not just to refocus it."
"In economic, trade and political terms, respect for rights and freedoms should be, at the same time, conditions and objectives of our cooperation."
"The financial assistance that the EU provides to this end should be markedly increased and should fulfil those same conditions and objectives."
"We should also relaunch the Union for the Mediterranean on a moral basis in terms of its requirements and on a practical basis in terms of its achievements."
"Our cooperation should no longer be restricted to exchanges with the ruling authorities: the European Union should make it a priority to speak to the various members of civil society and to encourage the emergence and organisation of political pluralism in that region."
"By encouraging the introduction of legitimate, organised changeovers of power, we will not face a dilemma between unconditional support to governments for the sake of stability and chaos."
"Moreover, by basing our cooperation on values this time, we will give it the popular legitimacy and the continuity necessary to meet the historic challenges of that region."
"In today's vote, I supported the resolution concerning the review of the European Neighbourhood Policy with respect to both the Eastern and Southern Dimensions."
"These resolutions are particularly important given the recent course of events in the southern region."
"In particular, we must take into account the strong demands from the public in several southern neighbours of the EU for the overthrow of dictatorships and for pursuing democracy."
"The strategic review of the European Neighbourhood Policy must fully take these events into account and reflect on them."
"Both resolutions, in relation both to the Southern and Eastern Dimensions, are important for mutually beneficial cooperation between the EU and its various neighbouring countries in order to ensure the necessary developments in relation to democracy, human rights and also the economy and security."
"Europe's stability and wellbeing are closely tied to the success of the ENP's southern neighbours in democratic governance as well as their economic and social success, and it is therefore important to support the principles of political debate, full liberties, democratic reforms and the rule of law in the partner countries of the neighbourhood policy. Thank you."
"The uprisings in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya came as such a surprise to Europe that everyone agrees that it ought to review the terms of its cooperation with the countries of the Mediterranean."
"Several options are already open to us when it comes to providing long-term support for the democratic transition, economic development and regional integration of our southern neighbours."
"The EU has two tools at its disposal: the Union for the Mediterranean and the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument."
"Both have shown their weaknesses, but a genuine political commitment could rectify our mistakes."
"I therefore support this resolution, which provides a clear framework and specific objectives for the next European Neighbourhood Policy."
"I would, however, draw my fellow Members' attention to the cross-border dimension of this policy."
"Accounting as it does for a mere 5% of the ENPI's total budget, it is overlooked by central government and its programming is subject to alarming delays."
"However, this dimension may act as a catalyst for many structural initiatives for cooperation in the Mediterranean."
"Establishing a genuine EU-Mediterranean partnership means not only taking the aspirations of the peoples into greater account, but also providing real investment in concrete projects."
"I supported the resolution on the review of the European Neighbourhood Policy - Southern Dimension."
"From the position of a member of the Committee on Women's Rights, I would like to draw particular attention to the importance of gender equality policies as an inseparable element of human rights, which is also a fundamental principle of the European Union."
"Women's rights must be a priority item in talks with the countries of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP)."
"According to the resolution, women's rights should be included in revisions of codified law (constitutional law, criminal law, family law and all bodies of civil law), and should be included in the dialogue on human rights conducted with the ENP partner countries."
"We should also focus on measures which will deepen the social integration of women."
"We need programmes that promote the education of women, and we need to promote their employment and increase their participation in public life."
"The effects of measures to improve gender equality in the ENP countries should be continuously monitored and supervised, and failures in this area should be categorically condemned, and even punished."
"I opt for not strengthening the EU's relations with those third countries that do not sufficiently incorporate women into their policies and institutions in matters related to the organisation of civil society (in particular, human rights organisations and women's organisations)."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this report, which has significant importance, given recent events in the EU's southern neighbourhood."
"It is vital that the renewed policy supports democratisation and genuine reforms in the countries concerned."
"The events in North Africa and the Middle East are indicative of the ineffectiveness of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), but also of the new challenges facing the EU as a regional player."
"The creation of an area of prosperity and good neighbourliness based on EU values should continue to be the basis for relations with ENP partner countries - in this particular case, with the Mediterranean countries."
"In the first place, I believe that it is essential to review the indicative programmes for 2011-2013, taking into account the most urgent needs and, at the same time, making the financial instruments, in particular, the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI) and the European initiative for democracy and human rights (EIDHR), more flexible in order to provide direct support to civil society organisations."
"I would also like to call for the Union for the Mediterranean to be strengthened both in terms of funding and in terms of commitment by the Member States, as a favoured forum for the exchange of best practice, where a clear Mediterranean policy should be established, based on partnership policy, the principle of 'ownership' and conditionality."
"Lastly, I believe that solutions urgently need to be found to bring an end to the war in Libya, and also to prepare a package of measures for rebuilding the country after the conflict has ended."
"I welcome the adoption of this resolution by our Parliament, which is taking stock and deciding on the future direction of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership."
"My commitment to a rapprochement between the two shores of the Mediterranean led me to make a number of proposals, which I am delighted to say have been approved by my fellow Members."
"In particular, I stressed the need to review the European Neighbourhood Policy in the light of the events in the Arab world, by stepping up dialogue with civil society, encouraging the exchange of good practice, guaranteeing respect for human rights in our association agreements and supporting the democratic transition process in those countries."
"The ENP offers us a wonderful opportunity to promote our values and to strengthen our relations with the countries on Europe's doorstep."
"For that reason, I hope that our partnership with our neighbours in the Southern Mediterranean will become a priority of our foreign policy."
"I shall be vigilant in ensuring that we work on an equal footing and that sufficient resources are devoted to achieving our goal of making the Mediterranean region an area of peace, prosperity and cooperation."
"I am in favour of this resolution because it upholds the most basic civil rights, particularly those relating to freedom of expression."
"This type of behaviour should have consequences for the relationship between the EU and any state that perpetrates such attacks on freedom."
"Without strong political pressure on these countries, it will be difficult to bring about peace."
"The EU should always be at the forefront of combating these kinds of attacks and should remain alert to future developments in the region."
"I voted in favour of this resolution on the use of sexual violence in conflicts in North Africa and the Middle East."
"Women who have actively participated in the uprisings for more democracy, rights and freedoms in North Africa and the Middle East deserve our respect and support."
"The European Union cannot be silent when these brave fighters for democracy and freedom are cruelly treated."
"We therefore call on the Commission and the Member State governments to strongly oppose the use of sexual assaults, intimidation and targeting of women in Libya and Egypt, because these countries' incumbent regimes have resorted to sexual violence against women as a weapon in the conflicts that arose during these revolutions."
"The Egyptian authorities must take urgent steps to end torture, investigate all cases of abuse against peaceful demonstrators, and stop prosecuting civilians before military tribunals."
"I strongly believe that the changes taking place in North Africa and the Middle East must contribute towards the end of discrimination of women and their full participation in society on equal terms with men."
"The acts of violence committed against women and children in the last few weeks, during the conflicts that have broken out in North Africa, are no surprise because, unfortunately, women living through armed conflicts have increasingly become a target for humiliation, torture, possession and control, the intention being to wholly or partly destroy a particular group."
"It goes further than that, however: no one has the right to violate the dignity of women merely because they have the courage to demand the right to express their thoughts, actively participating in the construction of a peaceful and democratic world and demanding, above all, the right to gender equality."
"Inflicting inhumane and degrading treatment, such as electric shocks, 'virginity tests', physical and psychological violence, rape and slavery, is an unacceptable practice to which we must say 'Enough'."
"As far as the events in these North African countries are concerned, it is only right that the people responsible for these serious violations be punished, as in any other conflict in the world, because we are dealing here not just with civilians but, what is more reprehensible still, also with soldiers."
"I sincerely hope that the EU will succeed in applying pressure so that these countries rapidly ratify a series of international judicial instruments, including the Statute of the International Criminal Court and the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees."
"I voted in favour of this resolution because there is an urgent need to halt the use of violence and sexual abuse against women."
"The European Commission and the Member States should strongly condemn sexual abuse, intimidation, torture and violence against women in Libya and Egypt."
"We must call on Egypt's Supreme Military Council to take immediate measures to stop these violent crimes against women."
"We must ensure that all security and armed forces are clearly instructed that crimes and torture cannot be tolerated, will be fully investigated, and the perpetrators held accountable."
"Furthermore, everyone should be able to express their views on the democratic future of their country without being detained, tortured or subjected to degrading and discriminatory treatment."
"Women have had a key voice in the riots calling for more democracy, rights and freedoms in North Africa and the Middle East."
"Unfortunately, the regimes in Libya and Egypt use violence as a way to intimidate and degrade women, making them more vulnerable."
"I strongly condemn the acts committed by the Egyptian army against female protesters arrested in Tahrir Square."
"Immediate steps must be taken as a matter of urgency to put a stop to this degrading treatment, and to ensure that all the security and army forces are clearly told that torture and other forms of ill-treatment will be the subject of a thorough investigation."
"It is up to the Egyptian authorities to take urgent measures to put a stop to torture, investigate all cases of abuse against peaceful protesters, and to bring an end to the trials of civilians before military tribunals."
"I urge the Commission and the governments of the Member States to vigorously oppose the use of sexual aggression, intimidation and harassment of women in Libya and Egypt."
"I voted in favour of this resolution as it strongly condemns the regimes in Libya and Egypt for resorting to sexual aggression in the course of the conflict which is part of the current revolutions."
"Women have played a key role in these riots, fighting and risking their lives for more democracy, rights and freedoms."
"It is vital to ensure that the changes that are happening in North Africa and the Middle East contribute to bringing an end to discrimination against women, and to their full participation in society, on an equal footing with men."
"Unfortunately, we are all aware that periods of upheaval and armed conflicts exacerbate situations of violence against women and children, and lead to a rise in cases of sexual abuse."
"This practice is absolutely reprehensible, as are the use of torture, gang rape, 'virginity tests', threats and abuse, whether physical or psychological, directed at women as a way of intimidating or frightening them, or limiting their rights to political participation, as is happening in Egypt and Libya."
"The EU, and Parliament in particular, should be a bastion of protection for fundamental rights and human dignity, and clearly and unequivocally denounce all violations of these values."
"I strongly condemn the practice of violence against women, and also children, in the recent conflicts in the Middle East and North Africa, and I would like to call for the most appropriate measures to be taken to protect their most fundamental rights and dignity."
"The fight against the violation of human rights is the main goal of the EU and its institutions."
"In view of this, the use of sexual violence in any conflict has given rise to the strongest renunciation and condemnation by these organisations."
"Indeed, many resolutions have been adopted by Parliament denouncing violence against women."
"This joint motion for a resolution focuses on this violence, in particular, sexual violence, perpetrated against women in North Africa and the Middle East."
"The reports of violence in the context of war and repression that have reached us are utterly gruesome and have caused great disgust and indignation."
"The perpetrators of such behaviour cannot go unpunished, even when protected by dictators or under the pretext of backward mentalities."
"I am therefore voting in favour of this report, which condemns any kind of violence against women in any region, calls for severe penalties for the perpetrators, and establishes EU support for the process of empowering women as a priority, especially those who have had the courage to participate in the so-called 'Arab Spring', and encouraging their full participation in civic life in the countries where they live."
"In the discussion which took place on the use of sexual violence in conflicts in North Africa and the Middle East, the Commission pledged to steadfastly advocate bringing an end to sexual violence and slavery, which are recognised as crimes against humanity and war crimes under the Geneva Convention."
"As stated in the draft resolution that we submitted, it is vital to insist upon effective diplomatic action that vigorously opposes the use of sexual aggression, intimidation and harassment of women in North Africa and the Middle East, or in any other place."
"We would also like to stress the importance of recognising the role of women in the revolutions, and stress the need to guarantee women's rights, including their participation in the new democratic, legal, economic and political structures of these countries, ending the centuries-old discrimination that they have suffered."
"I voted in favour of this resolution on the use of sexual violence in conflicts in North Africa and the Middle East."
"It calls on the Commission and the Member States to strongly oppose the use of sexual assaults, intimidation and the targeting of women in Libya and Egypt."
"I believe that everyone should be able to express their views on the democratic future of their country without being detained, tortured or subjected to degrading and discriminatory treatment."
"The role of women in the revolutions and democratisation processes should be acknowledged, and the specific threats they face and the need to support and defend their rights should be underlined."
"in writing. - I supported this resolution, which calls on the Commission and the Member State governments to strongly oppose the use of sexual assaults on, and intimidation and targeting of, women in Libya and Egypt and strongly condemns forced 'virginity tests' inflicted by the Egyptian army on women protesters arrested in Tahrir Square and considers this practice as unacceptable, as it amounts to a form of torture; calls on Egypt's Supreme Military Council to take immediate measures to stop this degrading treatment and to ensure that all security and army forces are clearly instructed that torture and other ill-treatment, including forced 'virginity tests', cannot be tolerated and will be fully investigated"
"In warlike conflicts, it is often the women and children who are the real victims."
"It has long been known that rape and torture are frequent occurrences."
"The situation is no different in Libya and Egypt, according to reports from foreign journalists concerned."
"In Egypt, female demonstrators were arrested and subjected to virginity tests, which were also documented."
"In Libya, soldiers carried out rapes and torture."
"A further aggravating factor is that the women who told their stories must now expect severe reprisals, such as being accused of defamation."
"Once again, a severe abuse of human rights is taking place here about which something should be done, including by the Western powers."
"I voted in favour of the resolution because the EU must not close its eyes to these atrocities either and it is only right to demand of the governments in Egypt and Libya that these cases are investigated without exception and the perpetrators held accountable, in order that the countries may continue along the path towards democracy and freedom."
"In the course of the unrest in Egypt and Libya, there were reports in the international media of tragic assaults and acts of violence repeatedly being carried out against women."
"Torture and rape often go unpunished because the authorities quietly drop the cases or, worse still, accusations of 'defamation' are made against the women themselves."
"The roles of victim and perpetrator are reversed for the benefit of a patriarchal society."
"The EU must not stand idly by; the EU must do more to protect women and children, as well as the principle of the rule of law for everyone, in Egypt and in Libya."
"I therefore voted in favour of this motion for a resolution."
"The joint motion for a resolution on the use of sexual violence in conflicts in North Africa and the Middle East roundly condemns the crimes identified in Egypt and Libya."
"The targeting of women in both countries and the complaints about 'virginity tests' conducted by the military on women rounded up in Tahrir Square and subsequently subjected to rape and torture, so that they could then be tried before military courts for failing 'virginity tests', are inhumane and criminal acts in complete breach of the Geneva Convention on crimes against humanity and war crimes."
"In addition to its round condemnation, the motion for a resolution, which I supported, calls on the Commission and the governments of the Member States to strongly oppose the use of sexual assaults on, and intimidation and targeting of, women in Libya and Egypt and to take specific and coordinated action to put an immediate stop to these practices."
"I voted in favour of this resolution as it condemns gender-based violence and, of course, the use of sexual violence in conflicts."
"I agree with the need expressed in the resolution to give priority to human rights in measures taken under the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) as an integral part of the democratisation process, and also with the need for the EU to share with these countries the experience that it has in equality policies and the fight against gender-based violence."
"The uprisings in North Africa and the Middle East have seen women play an active role in demanding their shared desire for democracy and fundamental rights."
"Unfortunately, the regimes in power in Libya and Egypt have resorted as ever to sexual assault as a weapon with which to target women."
"We must denounce the use of sexual violence as an instrument for intimidating and humiliating women, without forgetting that the power vacuum that has now emerged could lead to a deterioration in their rights."
"One significant case is that of a Libyan woman who, in March, told some journalists in a Tripoli hotel that she had been a victim of gang rape by soldiers."
"Today, that young woman has been sued for defamation by the same men who raped her."
"We must act by strongly denouncing the disproportionate impact of armed conflicts on women and enhancing their peace building role."
"I trust that the EU's denunciation of violence against women and children, particularly during armed conflicts, and of all forms of discrimination against them, within the meaning of the Geneva Convention, will be made in the strongest possible terms."
"I wholeheartedly supported the resolution on combating sexual violence in the conflicts in North Africa and the Middle East."
"Mass sexual violence against women is a permanent part of armed conflicts in North Africa and the Middle East."
"The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) gives, among others, the example of Kenya, a relatively stable country, in which pre-election riots led to a doubling of the number of victims of sexual violence in a matter of days."
"Sexual violence is becoming an epidemic."
"In fact, it has become one of the tactics of war."
"The European Union must not remain neutral on this issue."
"It is therefore essential to include gender mainstreaming in the mainstream of European Neighbourhood Policy and in the centre of our efforts towards creating an effective and structured approach to gender equality in the countries covered by the policy."
"Human rights, an inseparable element of which is the equality of men and women, should constitute an essential element of democratic processes in third countries."
"It is shocking that despite the prevalence of sexual violence in Africa, governments do not include fighting it among their priorities, as we can see, for example, in the case of South Africa."
"The EU should focus its efforts specifically on women."
"The proposals included in the resolution for the enhanced social integration of women, the promotion of their employment, the fight against illiteracy among women and traditional harmful practices are very important."
"Education for women and girls must include knowledge of the rights to which they are entitled."
"During the recent events in North Africa, the ruling regimes in Libya and Egypt used sexual assault as a weapon for intimidating and persecuting women who took part in the uprisings there."
"It is vital, firstly, that the perpetrators of these acts are tried for their crimes and, secondly, that the women who suffered such atrocities are protected from any reprisals."
"I myself have been to the Kivu region in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, where this heinous practice is regularly used by soldiers and members of armed groups."
"I can testify to the extreme suffering of the women rape victims and to the impunity of the perpetrators of these atrocities."
"The international community must do everything it takes to ensure that the perpetrators of these crimes do not go unpunished."
"The revelations concerning the honour crimes and the humiliation suffered by women during the uprisings in the Arab world have shocked and disturbed me, and I am pleased that our Parliament has denounced the atrocities committed against them."
"Europe cannot allow such violations of human rights and of its most fundamental values to be committed with impunity on its doorstep, in partner countries, and against the backdrop of peaceful demonstrations."
"I therefore insist that these barbaric acts be investigated and that those responsible be punished."
"Our resolution addresses an essential requirement for the future of those countries: that of giving women a central role in the democratisation process in Arab societies."
"Women played a leading, silent, underestimated even, role in the liberation movements, and I think it was essential to pay tribute to it in this text."
"Europe has pledged to support the countries of North Africa, the Near East and the Middle East in their democratic process."
"It is now up to us to ensure that we include in that approach guarantees with regard to respect for human rights and equality between men and women."
"I am in favour of this report, which deals appropriately with important issues such as the new Statute of the European Investment Bank (EIB) following the Treaty of Lisbon, project bonds, the implications for the planned financing of the EIB during the economic crisis, its financing after 2013 and its activities outside the EU, in particular, development projects, greening projects and how to be stronger with respect to offshore financial centres."
"I voted in favour of this report."
"The European Investment Bank plays a critical role in supporting SMEs, particularly during this financial crisis and economic downturn."
"Given the huge importance of SMEs to the European economy, it was agreed that from 2008 to 2011, SMEs should receive loans totalling over EUR 30 billion."
"The European Progress Microfinance Facility was set up in March 2010 with some EUR 200 million in funding from the Commission and the Bank."
"However, SMEs still face difficulties trying to obtain credit."
"As stated in the Bank Watch report, SMEs, particularly those in Central and Eastern European Member States, are unable to take advantage of the assistance intended for them."
"The EIB must lay down clear financing conditions and more strict lending effectiveness criteria for its financial intermediaries providing loans."
"National financial intermediaries were given a period of two years to provide loans, but as the report states, some financial intermediaries granted only a small portion of the loans or did not grant any at all, although the financial resources were in their accounts."
"Furthermore, the EIB's website still lacks publicly available data regarding the use and beneficiaries of allocated funding."
"I believe that the EIB must enhance transparency in its lending through financial intermediaries and report annually on its lending to SMEs, including an evaluation of the accessibility and effectiveness of this and lists of loan beneficiaries."
"In the first place, I would like to congratulate the European Investment Bank (EIB) on all the work that it has carried out, particularly its support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) through funding that has steadily increased since 2008, and also through the creation of the European Progress Microfinance Facility in March 2010."
"I also believe that the commitment to the idea of project bonds, which is aimed at enhancing the credit rating of bonds issued by companies themselves, and where these bonds are used to finance European transport, energy and IT infrastructures, is a positive step."
"At this point, it is desirable that both the Commission and the EIB should submit concrete proposals for project bonds."
"It is also worth highlighting the important work that the EIB may carry out under the EU 2020 strategy, by simplifying procedures and maximising multiplier factors in order to attract public and private sector investors."
"With regard to EIB financing outside the EU, I believe that a Memorandum of Understanding signed by the EIB, the EBRD and the Commission is desirable, so as to strengthen cooperation in all the countries where they operate, with the dual aim of making their lending policies both consistent with one another and consistent with the EU's political objectives."
"The European Investment Bank (EIB), created in 1958 under the Treaty of Rome, is a financial community of the EU which primarily aims to contribute to the balanced development of the EU through economic integration and territorial cohesion."
"I welcome the changes introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon, which give greater flexibility to EIB financing."
"I recall the amendments introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon, clarifying the aims of the funding granted by the EIB to third countries, which should support the general principles governing the EU's interactions with the rest of the world, as specified in Article 3(5) TEU, and which, under that assurance, should support the objectives of EU external action. This financial institution is obliged to submit a document with the balance of its activities to Parliament every year."
"This motion for a resolution focuses on the analysis of the 2009 report."
"This document refers not only to the improvements that resulted from the adoption of the new statutes, but also to the activities of the EIB."
"We recognise the importance that borrowing from the European Investment Bank (EIB) can have for development and social progress, given its low rates and long payment periods."
"However, its options are not always sufficiently transparent and clear."
"In addition, neither are the countries and regions that most need to borrow from it those that are most favoured with its loans."
"This report, which we support, therefore contains some criticisms, suggestions and proposals."
"However, we disagree with transforming the EIB into a mere tool for the EU to implement its policies, as well as addressing the problems of social and economic cohesion and social development, which should be considered in the EU budget and EU structural and cohesion funds."
"Obviously, the EIB can monitor and improve these efforts, but it cannot be a substitute for EU budgetary policies."
"The European Investment Bank (EIB) currently plays an irreplaceable role in providing finance in the EU and elsewhere."
"The submitted report takes a positive view of the fact that the EIB acted correctly in supporting SMEs in the EU during the crisis."
"It is true that the bank formally committed EUR 30 billion over a four-year period to supporting SMEs."
"However, the problem is that not all of the money even reached the SMEs."
"In specific terms, only about half of the funds committed reached SMEs in the V4 region in the first period."
"The EIB gave banks an inexplicably long period of two years to distribute the funds, and also failed to stipulate any sanctions against banks in the event that this deadline was not met."
"The banks of Central Europe, hard hit by the crisis, were only too pleased to 'hold on to' these funds."
"What was billed as support for SMEs therefore became, in reality, support for the Central European branches of foreign banks."
"There is reason enough to think that this was not by accident, but by design."
"To conclude briefly - the EIB is also having problems in the area of development."
"It needs to take on more employees specialised in development."
"The EIB is currently under-staffed, despite its impact on so-called developing countries."
"I also agree with the rapporteur that the EIB must make strict changes to its funding via intermediaries, as this may end up in tax havens."
"I welcome the fact that the European Parliament appraises the annual report of the European Investment Bank (EIB), albeit from a distinctly bird's-eye view."
"The EIB is playing a decisive role in fighting the crisis."
"For me, however, the issues of transparency and measurable results remain doubtful."
"The EIB's activity focuses on the three areas where the crisis hit hardest: small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), convergence regions and climate action."
"SMEs play a key role in the recovery of the European economy and the fight against unemployment, and therefore it would be expedient to make it easier for them to access the capital required for developments."
"In this respect, it would be useful if we could see an assessment of the accessibility and effectiveness of the loans in question every year, which would ensure the transparency of the final purpose of the loans and improve the administrative process."
"Also in this respect, I believe it is vitally important that the EIB updates and tightens its policy on offshore financial centres."
"The EIB plays a very important role in enhancing the European Union's convergence, and due to the technical aid and cofinancing offered by it, the regions under the convergence objectives are able to use an ever larger proportion of the funds available to them."
"For this reason, I believe that further increasing this role is practical and to be supported."
"Lastly, I suggest that the proposal that transparent regulatory supervision should be introduced in the interests of the quality of the EIB's financial situation, the precise measurement of its results, and compliance with effective and successful business practice, deserves consideration."
"I approve of the fact that in this period of crisis, the activities of the European Investment Bank should be focused on helping small and medium-sized enterprises, which are the backbone of our society."
"The involvement of and dialogue with local financial intermediaries is welcome."
"What is very important in my opinion is the emphasis placed on renewable energy as regards the candidate countries."
"For this reason, I am voting in favour of the report."
"I voted in favour of this resolution because the European Parliament welcomes the changes brought about by the Treaty of Lisbon, allowing more flexibility in EIB financing, including: equity participations as a complement to the ordinary activities of the Bank; the possibility to establish subsidiaries and other entities, in order to regulate the so-called special activities and to provide wider technical assistance services; and the strengthening of the Audit Committee."
"It recommends considering the suggestion that prudential regulatory supervision should be introduced concerning the quality of the EIB's financial situation, the precise measurement of its results and compliance with the rules of sound business practice."
"It also welcomes the idea of project bonds, aimed at enhancing the credit rating of bonds issued by companies themselves within the framework of the Europe 2020 strategy and which are used to finance European transport, energy and IT infrastructures and the greening of the economy."
"Such project bond issuance would impact positively on the availability of capital for growth- and job-enhancing sustainable investments complementing national and Cohesion Fund investment."
"in writing. - I voted for this report which recommends the following steps to strengthen the EIB's role in development: (a) the allocation of a greater number of dedicated and specialist staff with expertise in development issues and developing countries, as well as an increase in the local presence of staff in third countries, (b) increasing the share of the participation of local actors in the projects, (c) additional dedicated capital in the area of projects targeting development, (d) the allocation of more grants, (e) exploring the possibility of grouping the EIB's activities in third countries together under a single separate entity."
"I should like to record my satisfaction that the Cutaş report on the 2009 annual report of the European Investment Bank (EIB) has been approved."
"I would emphasise the excellent work done by the EIB in support of small and medium-sized enterprises in a period of economic difficulty and difficult access to loans."
"I am, moreover, in favour of the development by the EIB, in conjunction with the European Commission, of project bonds for use in financing large infrastructure projects relating to transport, energy and telecommunications, which are essential for achieving the goals of growth and cohesion within the Union."
"The 2009 annual report of the European Investment Bank (EIB) highlights the essential role which the EIB has played in supporting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), especially at this time of financial crisis and economic recession."
"The EIB has focused on three areas which the crisis in Europe has hit hardest, namely: SMEs, convergence regions and climate action."
"The importance of the SMEs for the European economy is unquestionable, so I welcome the increase in EIB financing for the SMEs in the 2008-2010 period, which totalled EUR 30.8 billion, and the establishment of the European Microfinance Facility, which has been granted about EUR 200 million by the Commission and the EIB."
"in writing. - In favour."
"Although it is not a text that we, as Greens, would have drafted ourselves, we thought the text acceptable enough to vote in favour of it."
"The document that has been approved today highlights the clear need for additional support by the European Investment Bank (EIB) in areas strategic to the recovery of the European economy: small and medium-sized enterprises, midcaps and infrastructure and other key growth- and employment-enhancing projects as part of the Europe 2020 strategy."
"The report urges the EIB to invest in freight transport in the European railway sector as well as in other Trans-European Networks of freight transport with a focus on the Mediterranean, Black Sea and Baltic Sea ports, in order to link them definitively to European markets."
"The EIB should, moreover, provide more support for the building of the TEN-T network, with the aim of generating a leverage effect for more investment, from both the public and the private sector."
"In order to achieve this objective, project bonds can act as a complementary investment instrument alongside the budget in the TEN-T fund."
"Corrections to votes and voting intentions: see Minutes"
"Approval of the minutes of the previous sitting: see Minutes"
"1."
"The case of Ai Weiwei in China"
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolution on the case of Ai Weiwei in China."
"author. - Mr President, this is the first time that I have participated in a Thursday afternoon debate, so there are some lessons I think I can pick up for the Conference of Presidents with regard to making the plenary session more attractive."
"I am pleased that this point has been put on the agenda, because the case of Mr Ai Weiwei is quite dramatic, as the latest information we have is that there is certainly no intention on the part of the Chinese authorities to release him."
"The best thing we can do is to approve the urgent resolution we have agreed together with all the groups so that we can increase pressure on the Chinese authorities."
"I have to tell you that I have my doubts that this resolution will change anything in the attitude of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese authorities."
"What we are, in fact, doing on human rights with the Chinese is a game."
"We are talking about human rights, they are saying they will open a dialogue and we think that things have changed."
"Nothing shall change."
"That is the reality."
"We have the Nobel prize-winner who could not attend the meeting in Oslo."
"We now have Mr Ai Weiwei, who is a well-known artist and was one of the last dissidents who had the possibility to say something."
"The only thing we can say is in an urgent resolution in which we deplore what is happening."
"In any case, I had hoped that we could ask why we should continue to participate in fora that the Chinese Communist Party organises with our political parties."
"I deplore that there was not enough support from the other groups to come to an agreement on that."
"We could at least have agreed on a principle of not continuing to participate in fora with the Chinese Communist Party, if Mr Weiwei and other dissidents were not released."
"For that reason at least, I hoped for the support of all the groups here - with the other amendment the Greens tabled, even if the best part of it was eliminated."
"Yes, it is true, they tabled a fantastic amendment and then eliminated the best part!"
"OK, it was not their fault, but apparently the fault of others."
"(Interruption by the President)"
"I may be taking a minute more than I usually do, but for Mr Ai Weiwei, it will take ten years longer, apparently."
"If we can speak in favour of somebody who may be in gaol for years, one minute longer is not too much, Mr President!"
"(DE) Mr President, I do not know how often Mr Verhofstadt is here."
"I wanted to ask him whether he should not perhaps come more often, since he would then see that the sessions here are always very attractive."
"It is just that unfortunately, there are some people who do not come, but that is something that can be changed."
"The sessions are extremely attractive."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I vividly recall the first time that I saw a work by the Chinese artist Ai Weiwei."
"At that time, in about 2000, I was a lecturer in Art History in Lisbon, and there, in an anthology of modern artists, was his enormous chandelier, the size of a room, overturned and broken."
"It was at once extremely beautiful and somewhat poignant and sad."
"This image somehow also reflects an image of China: able to show itself as sumptuous, rich, developed, and capable of presenting itself to the world, as in the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games."
"It is a sophisticated China, yet one with something seriously broken inside."
"That something is the will, free speech and the spirit of the Chinese people themselves."
"Today, we have met to discuss the case of the artist Ai Weiwei, and we have asked the Chinese authorities to release him, to let him speak with his lawyer and his wife, and to make any accusations, if there are any which are true, and not charges trumped up on the spot."
"Above all, we have gathered here to say that this artist's spirit of creativity, imagination and humour will surely survive much longer than that of his gaolers."
"author. - Mr President, once again, we are debating China, and its government's intolerance of dissent."
"As we know from our debate last month on the Communist regime's vandalism of the ancient city of Kashgar, China vigorously tries to suppress cultural expression that does not conform to what its Communist rulers deem appropriate."
"Ai Weiwei is an heir to China's magnificent and ancient artistic traditions."
"He has also used his artistic talents to raise awareness of China's dismal human rights record and dearth of political freedom."
"Clearly, there is also a lack of freedom of expression in China."
"How else can the regime explain Mr Ai's arrest on economic crimes and because he failed to complete the correct departure procedures for travelling to Taiwan."
"This is plainly a smokescreen."
"In fact, the real reason was later elucidated by the state-run Global Times newspaper in a menacing editorial, which said that Mr Ai would pay a price for his resistance."
"We abhor the Chinese Government's disgraceful treatment of this distinguished artist."
"We in this House call for his immediate release, and we express regret, once again, that China goes to such extreme lengths against those who dare speak out for their basic human rights."
"Mr President, more than a year ago, we spoke in this Chamber about Liu Xiaobo being sentenced to prison."
"Here we are now discussing a second signatory of Charter 08 who has been detained by the Chinese authorities."
"As has already been said, Ai Weiwei is not only a very famous artist, but also one of the biggest critics of the Communist regime."
"He was arrested on Sunday and there is no prospect of his release."
"Indeed, in addition to this, we saw today that the Chinese authorities maintained that his arrest was an economic and not a political matter, which is blatantly a barefaced lie."
"As is well known, Ai Weiwei was prevented from attending the Nobel Prize award ceremony."
"His arrest is part of a wider trend in cracking down on human rights activists."
"We have included in our resolution a whole list of people whom, I believe, Lady Ashton must mention whenever she has the opportunity."
"I believe that we need to reassess our dialogue on human rights more generally."
"author. - Mr President, it is no coincidence that the increasingly repressive measures against Chinese journalists, dissidents, human rights activists and lawyers is taking place in the aftermath, or during the turmoil, of the North African revolutions."
"The word 'jasmine' has been banned from the Chinese Internet recently."
"Today's news, which Mr Preda highlighted, is very significant because now, we see how dictators copy from each other and compare notes."
"We can see that the methods that Russia used against Khodorkovsky and Lebedev have been used by Venezuela and Kazakhstan against businessmen who come too close to political influence, who want to establish opposition parties: they are all punished in the name of economic crimes."
"Punishment of economic crime is the name they give to political repression."
"We have to be aware that this has not happened much before in China: this is a turning point that does not bode well."
"It is important that Members of the European Parliament raise the persecuted activists' names when they travel to China and when meeting their Chinese counterparts, and that they insist on a prison visit."
"We know that many of those who are persecuted suffer terrible torture in Chinese prisons, sometimes in what we call 'black gaols' which are completely unidentified places."
"This is a reminder to all European Parliament delegations that all of them are entitled and obliged to exercise their duty in respect of human rights when they visit countries."
"We call for the immediate release of Ai Weiwei."
"The disappearance of Ai Weiwei must be understood within the context of the increasingly desperate political repression carried out by the Chinese authorities."
"All this is happening due to their fear that the revolutionary spirit of the Arab world will infect Chinese society."
"However, the EU can make a difference."
"Violations of human rights by the Chinese authorities must be a constant theme in its political dialogue with China, and this dialogue should be rethought to ensure that there are concrete results, in particular, the review of court rulings that have kept human rights activists in gaol."
"Negotiations on the new framework agreement cannot leave aside the issue of human rights, subjugating everything to commercial interests."
"When pursuing its economic interests, the EU itself has a responsibility to support activists like Ai Weiwei, Liu Xiaobo and Hu Jun, who have fought courageously for urgent political reform in China, against oppression, and for human rights and fundamental freedoms."
"China, as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, has particular obligations regarding human rights, contained in the UN Charter, and it must be accountable for these not only to its citizens, but also to the rest of the world."
"Mr President, I am very pleased that we in the European Parliament were able to add a current breach of human rights so quickly to the list of urgent petitions."
"As we know, the case of Ai Weiwei is not actually the only serious breach of human rights of which the Chinese Communist Party is continually guilty, but, as Mrs Hautala has already previously mentioned here, the democracy movement in China has received a new boost from the uprisings in North Africa."
"Over the past few weeks, officials have stepped up their surveillance of critics of the government and many dissidents, activists and human rights lawyers have been either put under house arrest or taken into police custody."
"As Amnesty International has said, Ai Weiwei's arrest is an alarming turn of events in the increased incidence of counterblows against dissidents by the Chinese authorities."
"Economic interests must not now be allowed to blur the issue of human rights and prevent the call for the immediate release of prisoners of conscience."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Beijing's justification for the arrest of the artist Ai Weiwei for economic crimes is not convincing, and neither is the need to treat a free, dissident artist so harshly."
"It is not convincing since this arrest is one of hundreds of arrests of opponents and part of the systematic repression of all signs of dissent."
"At a time when uprisings are breaking out in the Arab world, we think back to the images of cruel violence in Tiananmen Square against young Chinese who, just like today's Jasmine revolutionaries, were demanding freedom and democracy."
"China has opened up to the West in economic terms without, however, linking production to respect for the environment and safety at work, and it is unable to embrace democracy and pluralism in any form whatsoever."
"This is not interference on our part in Chinese internal affairs, as Beijing maintains, but the appeal of men and women, of movements and parties that intend to build a world free of intolerance on every continent."
"The Beijing government should watch what is happening in the world to grasp that, if it does not change, it will be historic events and Chinese citizens that will change China."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, reports on the worrying human rights situation in the People's Republic of China have become more and more frequent."
"In Parliament, we have this issue on our agenda for almost every session."
"Like the usual cycles of repression, the recent crackdown has already lasted for a while, which might be signalling a power struggle between reformers and hardliners in the Communist Party."
"The Chinese Government has made it harder to access foreign websites, blocked encryption software used to jump what is colloquially known as 'the great firewall of China', obstructed access to Googlemail and intensified arrests, including that of the internationally renowned artist and critic of the regime, Ai Weiwei."
"Resolute action is needed. I therefore call on the High Representative, Baroness Ashton, to make a démarche with Beijing."
"Ai Weiwei must be released now."
"Mr President, Ai Weiwei was - and this is the very sad truth - one of the last remaining courageous critics of the Chinese leadership."
"His arrest was, without doubt, not just the culmination of a whole wave of arrests of critics, but also a message to all the others that not even international prominence can provide protection from being put back in prison by the Chinese authorities or from even disappearing completely."
"At the same time, our representations are regularly ignored in the human rights dialogue that the European Union is conducting with the Chinese representatives at all levels - with a friendly smile, but ignored and dismissed nonetheless."
"For us, the question arises as to what strategy we can use in response to this."
"I believe we must respond in our own China delegation and make it very clear on our next visit to China that we want to visit these critics too, that we want to see them - for otherwise there is no longer any point in continuing our human rights dialogue."
"We have no desire to keep talking to a brick wall."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - Mr President, I condemn the arrest of Ai Weiwei and call for his immediate release."
"His detention is part of the most severe police crackdown in China in decades."
"Since 2008, China's internal security budget has, incredibly, grown larger than its military budget."
"It now stands at an incredible USD 95 billion."
"This pays for a massive apparatus of State repression, including over 40 000 policemen whose sole job is to police the Internet for dissent."
"This repression is being stepped up because the regime fears the spread of revolution from the Middle East and North Africa."
"The regime is right to be afraid."
"The revolutions there demonstrate that a risen working class and the risen poor are more powerful than even the most brutal repressive methods, the most repressive regimes."
"Mass struggle is needed, in particular, the creation of independent, democratic mass organisations of the working class."
"The struggle against dictatorship must be linked to the struggle for genuine socialist change in China, whereby the vast wealth and resources in China are taken into democratic public ownership and the economy is democratically planned to raise the living standards of ordinary people."
"(DE) Mr President, as an artist, Ai Weiwei has given faces to the child victims of the Sichuan earthquake."
"As a civil rights activist, he has given a face to Charter 08."
"He is now giving a face to those people who have disappeared into the gaols and prisons of China - thousands of them anonymous."
"A hundred of them are known to us and here in this House, we must give a voice to these people who stand up for human rights but who have been temporarily silenced."
"I therefore say quite clearly that of course, these human rights debates and the dialogue are necessary."
"I understand those who say they have no desire to keep talking to a brick wall."
"If we stop talking to this brick wall, however, then the dictators will have got what they wanted."
"There was a great reformer, Zhou Enlai."
"Zhou Enlai was no democrat, but he was a Chinese patriot and he opened up his country."
"What we need is a democratic Zhou Enlai to arrange for a democratic opening up of his country."
"If the country fails to implement democratic reforms, it will end up in the same sort of crises as it suffered in the 1930s."
"It is in the Chinese interest to help bring about a breakthrough in human rights and we must therefore support these initiatives as well."
"(FI) Mr President, the artist Ai Weiwei, who has achieved international recognition, is someone who has enriched Chinese culture and art."
"Instead of rewarding him and treating him with respect, China has locked him up in prison."
"Human rights are not just a European concept: they are universal principles underlying human dignity."
"The representatives of the European Union's External Action Service and the Delegation of the EU to China must highlight the case of Ai Weiwei with the Chinese authorities at the highest diplomatic level."
"The human rights dialogue with China, however, must not simply be allowed to remain at the level of diplomatic speeches."
"Given the repeated breaches of human rights and a human rights situation that has failed, the European Union must draw its conclusions and reconsider its relations with China."
"The human rights dialogue must not simply be empty words: positive steps need to be taken, and there must be followup and twoway discussion."
"Besides, culture and art are a resource that enriches society and takes it forward, both here in the West, but also in the East, the South and the North too."
"A Uachtaráin, China is an enigma."
"On the one hand, it has modernised and taken on many Western practices, as we saw at the Olympics, which I had the privilege of attending, and indeed they were a great success."
"But while it has westernised in some ways, it is archaic in others, in particular, in relation to fundamental rights, especially freedom of opinion."
"The case of Ai Weiwei is a perfect example."
"Here is a world-renowned artist, arrested on 3 April for no apparent reason."
"Nobody has heard much about him since and this, of course, is totally and utterly unacceptable."
"We call here today for his return to his wife, his friends and assistants."
"Because one thing is for sure - and the Chinese should take note of this - Ai Weiwei will be remembered and renowned long after those who were responsible for his arrest are forgotten."
"(DE) Mr President, I think that what the Chinese are doing here is a deliberate political provocation, or to put it another way, a political test."
"It is intended to test the strength, the resolve and the credibility of democratic countries."
"It is an attack on human rights."
"It is true that there must be dialogue, but precisely for that reason we must make it clear to the People's Republic of China that further economic cooperation must go hand in hand with further democratisation of their country."
"We therefore demand the release of Ai Weiwei."
"By the way, whenever dictators want to avoid being accused of political trials, they always play the tax evasion or economic crimes card."
"It was the case in the former GDR, it is the case in Russia, and unfortunately, it is also the case in the People's Republic of China."
"That is why I emphatically endorse this resolution."
"(DE) Mr President, I would first like to agree with Mr Verhofstadt."
"It is indeed shameful that these human rights debates, which are actually very important to us Europeans who believe in values, always take place on Thursday afternoons when most people have already left."
"I would like that noted in the record once more."
"It is something that we must change."
"Right now, however, we are talking about China and there we are more or less powerless, as has already been said."
"Mrs Lichtenberger spoke of a brick wall."
"Mr Posselt, I do not believe by the way that it is really in the Chinese interest - as you said - to help bring about a breakthrough in human rights."
"It is apparently not in the interest of the Chinese Government, although it is undoubtedly in the interest of the Chinese people."
"We are talking today about many people: Ai Weiwei and Liu Xiaobo have already been mentioned."
"We have frequently debated in the past how we can bring about a human rights breakthrough."
"It is not just a matter of instructing Baroness Ashton to speak out against the human rights abuses in China at every opportunity."
"All our foreign ministers and representatives must do so, and we need to stick together."
"I think that is the only way that we can actually have a small influence on China."
"Otherwise, as a strong economic power, China will play us off against each other and we will achieve nothing whatsoever."
"That would be a very bad thing, especially for the people concerned."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, the detention of the distinguished Chinese artist, Ai Weiwei, at Beijing Airport on 3 April as he was attempting to travel to Hong Kong, has rightly drawn international concern."
"The delegation of the European Union to China and a public statement immediately condemned the increasing use of arbitrary detention against human rights defenders, lawyers and activists in China, and underline the EU's concerns regarding Ai Weiwei."
"At the moment, we have no information concerning Mr Ai's whereabouts, and I wish to emphasise today that the EU's view on arbitrary detention and disappearance is that it constitutes a grave violation of human rights and is unacceptable in all circumstances."
"We call for the immediate release of Ai Weiwei."
"Moreover, as the resolution before this House makes clear, the detention of Ai Weiwei is only one among many recent incidents of arbitrary detention and disappearance in China."
"Several prominent Chinese lawyers who frequently act for defendants in human rights cases are reported to have been arrested by police officials since February and have not been seen since."
"Concerns about their treatment are only intensified by the ongoing disappearance of the lawyer Gao Zhisheng who, with the exception of a brief reappearance in April 2010, has now been missing for over two years."
"The High Representative is worried about reports based on interviews with Mr Gao in April 2010 that during his initial period of disappearance, he was detained incommunicado in a variety of unauthorised places of detention and subjected to improper treatment."
"There are, moreover, reports that in recent weeks, a significant number of bloggers and political activists have either been charged with criminal offences, such as subverting state power, or have been detained without charge."
"I can assure this House that the Vice-President/High Representative, Catherine Ashton, is following developments very closely and will raise these issues with the Chinese authorities at the earliest opportunity, and that the EU will also make known its concern to the Chinese authorities at the next round of the EU-China human rights dialogue, for which we have proposed dates in May."
"Allow me to support the statement by Mrs Meissner that what is really needed is one voice, a unified message, which comes not only from the EU institutions, but from all EU Member States."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place shortly."
"2."
"Ban on the elections for the Tibetan government in exile in Nepal"
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolution on the ban on the elections for the Tibetan government in exile in Nepal."
"Mr President, I believe we have all been following with approval and admiration the efforts of the Tibetan people to win the right to run their own country."
"The many attempts of the government in exile or the Dalai Lama, spiritual leader of the Tibetans, to find a sensible solution through negotiation with the Chinese ruling power, have always ended in failure."
"The Chinese clearly do not regard the Tibetans as partners in a shared state, but as an obstacle preventing them from taking full possession of an occupied territory."
"The position of the Nepalese Government is therefore complicated."
"On the one hand, it must comply with its international obligations and guarantee universal rights to the Tibetan community, but on the other, it cannot disregard the opinion of its enormous neighbour."
"The position of the Nepalese Government vis-à-vis the elections to the Tibetan Government in exile clearly tells us who is the real global player in this region."
"For the Nepalese Government, it is China."
"We Europeans can make symbolic gestures and declare our reservations regarding the weak Nepalese Government."
"However, if we really want to bring about a change the position of the Tibetan people, our partner in the dialogue must be the Chinese Government, as it is the political leader in the region, influencing the rules of regional politics."
"We can, of course, make a declaration to the Nepalese Government, but that will not solve the problem."
"author. - Mr President, since the abolition of the Nepalese monarchy and the election of a Maoist-led government in Kathmandu, Nepal and China have inevitably grown much closer."
"It is no surprise, therefore, that the Nepalese authorities prevented Tibetan refugees living in Nepal from voting for a prime minister and a parliament in exile."
"Indeed, a similar election plan for last October was disrupted by Nepalese police, undoubtedly in response to pressure from Beijing."
"The fact that China has sought to interfere with an unofficial election taking place in another sovereign neighbouring state is an indication of its leaders' contempt for democracy and their paranoia about Tibet."
"It is obviously irrelevant to China that time and time again, the Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual leader, has stressed that he seeks maximum autonomy for Tibet, not independence."
"I hope that the High Representative - who is not here today - will raise this episode with China and also with Nepal, whose own nascent democracy is kept afloat partly by EU taxpayers' money in the form of financial aid."
"I also wish to take this opportunity to salute the courage, fortitude and peaceful resistance of the Tibetan people whose example is an inspiration to us all."
"Nepal is indeed in a delicate position, geopolitically and geographically speaking, but it should seek inspiration from its democratic neighbour to the south, India, rather than from the repressive dictatorship which exists to its north, namely the PRC."
"Democracy will, I hope, one day be the norm throughout the whole of Asia."
"Mr Tannock, you used only one and a half minutes."
"Next time, I will give you an extra half minute!"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, obviously it is not enough that the suppression of Tibetan culture within China has been increasing more and more since the 2008 Olympic Games."
"Since then, things have, in fact, only got worse."
"There has not been a single step forward."
"Now pressure is also being exerted abroad to make it as difficult as possible, or downright impossible, for Tibetans to exercise even their right to vote for a parliament in exile."
"We have seen for some years already how enormous pressure is being exerted on Nepal - whether this concerns accepting refugees or matters such as voting rights for Tibetans."
"However, we should be pleased that such things are guaranteed."
"The European Union should learn from this."
"The Chinese leadership is exerting pressure on its sister party, even on Nepal as a whole, in order that action is taken against the Tibetans - and Nepal caves in."
"We must concentrate our efforts to counter this, and that includes the withdrawal of any aid."
"author. - Mr President, there are three points that I would like to make concerning the ALDE amendments to this resolution."
"First of all, the justification for the amendments is based on the causal nature of the occupation of Tibet by the People's Republic of China in the thwarting of the Tibetan elections in Nepal."
"Although the resolution addressed the issue of the ban on elections for the Tibetan Government in exile in Nepal, it cannot be ripped out of the wider context of the status of Tibet."
"Secondly, if there were no reference to the Chinese occupation of Tibet, which is the very cause and reason for Beijing putting pressure on the Nepalese Government, it would be like talking about the First World War without mentioning the assassination of Franz Ferdinand."
"Finally, the call for meaningful autonomy for Tibet is the only constructive proposal that the European Parliament can make to avoid a reoccurrence of the ban on the Tibetan elections in Nepal."
"I call on colleagues to support it."
"Mr President, the country I come from has a great deal of rich experience when it comes to governments in exile."
"Between 1939 and 1990, a total of 15 Polish prime ministers and six presidents ruled from political exile."
"Poles did not give up the pursuit of democracy, and finally the red colour of solidarity was able to combine with the white of the ballot paper to give birth to a new, democratic state in 1989."
"Today, the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal, too, has a chance for a new beginning thanks to the constitution, which will come into force on 28 May."
"It would be a pity if Nepal spoiled this celebration by continuing to limit the rights of the Tibetan minority and got a red card from the international community as a result."
"I consider preventing the participation of Tibetans from Nepal in the recent elections of the Prime Minister in exile an unacceptable violation of fundamental civil rights."
"The European Union should use all diplomatic and financial means in order to neutralise the pressure on Nepal by China and, in the long term, to ensure that the Tibetans have the right to vote, associate and demonstrate their views."
"Just as in the case of Poland, where it was not possible to prevent the work of the 21 representatives of government who were in exile, so will the Dalai Lama's successors, I am convinced, not stop their activities."
"Nepal and China should bear this in mind."
"Mr President, on 20 March, around 80 000 exiled Tibetans worldwide participated in the direct election of a new prime minister and the members of the government."
"Members of the European Parliament, including members of the European Parliament Tibet Intergroup, attended as election observers."
"My experience in Switzerland was the same as that of my fellow Members in other countries: the elections were conducted fairly, in secret and absolutely in accordance with democratic rules."
"The only exception was in Nepal, where security forces - under pressure from the Chinese Government - prevented tens of thousands of Tibetans from taking part in the elections."
"In so doing, they continued the deliberate measures taken last year, when ballot boxes were confiscated and voting sites shut down."
"Yet Nepal is not a vassal state."
"The government in Kathmandu must prove that it can liberate itself from Chinese influence."
"Basic rights include freedom of speech, freedom of assembly and, not least, electoral freedom."
"Commissioner, the European External Action Service must insist vigorously that these human rights are upheld."
"Mr President, the ban imposed by the Nepalese authorities on organising the elections for a Tibetan government in exile raises a question mark about the human rights situation in this state."
"I would like to point out that members of the Tibetan community organised this process with the aim of making their institutions democratic."
"Such an initiative must be facilitated, wherever it might take place."
"It is now time for Nepal to show that its democracy is working both domestically and internationally, especially so that the votes cast can be sent to the Central Electoral Commission by 15 April to be validated."
"I appeal to the Nepalese Government to take advantage of this opportunity to remedy the situation on fundamental rights in its country."
"This aspect is vital for ensuring an effective neighbourhood policy."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we must fight for democratic rights everywhere, not just in our own neighbourhood, not just in North Africa."
"We must have a standard European policy towards non-democratically elected governments, against governments which do not respect democratic rights."
"Mr Verhofstadt said that, to a certain extent, we are hypocrites."
"It is true because, often, we do not rank any principles above trade."
"One typical example is the Mercosur agreement, in which, for the sake of opening up trade, we are happily sacrificing 11% of the Amazon and millions of European farmers."
"The Commission is to blame in all of this, Commissioner."
"The Commissioner for Trade is often indifferent towards other European policies."
"However, if we continue like this, we shall continue to be hypocrites."
"Nepal must respect the democratic rights of refugees from Tibet and the European Union must use every means at its disposal and must raise the issue within all frameworks, not just in connection with human rights."
"This is not only Baroness Ashton's affair; it is also Mr De Gucht's and the entire Commission's affair."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, bullied by the Chinese authorities for too many years, today it is Nepal that is depriving the Tibetans of a fundamental political right: the right to vote."
"If one thing is certain, it is that Beijing has found a new ally in its harassment of the Tibetan people, and that new ally is Nepal."
"In reality, though, all this goes far beyond the elections because, for several years now, the Nepalese Government, under pressure from the Chinese authorities, has been placing ever more restrictions on the freedom of expression of Tibetans living in exile on its soil."
"Last June, Kathmandu handed over Tibetan refugees to the Chinese authorities."
"Preventive arrests and the ban on demonstrations, assembly and even movement, have become a common occurrence for Tibetans living in Nepal."
"Our Parliament must therefore stop being hypocritical and not just be indignant but also strongly condemn these acts of repression by Nepal and, more generally, the very many - too many - violations of human rights and of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights."
"Moreover, we call on Nepal to stop this harassment and ill-treatment of political refugees, and simply to respect their rights."
"When we consider Nepal's history as a host country - something which it has always been for Tibetans until recently - it is ultimately very sad to see what that government is inflicting on political refugees."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, I believe it is simply outrageous that the Tibetans living in Kathmandu did not get permission to vote in the elections because of pressure from China."
"The pressure China is putting on Nepal, preventing refugees from enjoying a minimum level of rights under international law, is something that we as the European Union should condemn."
"We should also express our concern at the fact that the Chinese are preventing another country from providing people with humanitarian aid."
"It is important that the High Representative, through the EU delegation in Kathmandu, should closely monitor the situation."
"This is something we have been requesting for a long time now."
"Bearing in mind the current situation, we cannot wait any longer."
"The pressure from China is something that we have to do everything we can to counter, and if we do not do it right now, when we are trying to launch this dialogue with the Chinese, I am afraid that we will never do it."
"Mr President, I believe that it is bad enough that the Tibetans do not have the right to self-determination in the land of their birth, but there is also pressure for them to be denied their most basic democratic rights outside their country, as many of them painfully chose exile, or were forced into it."
"One of the arguments that was always used by those who were critical of Tibetan resistance was that this resistance, focused on the figure of the Dalai Lama, had many non-democratic aspects."
"Now that the Tibetan resistance is in the process of democratisation, it is extremely unfortunate that Nepal, a country where so many Tibetans live, has prevented the democratic elections from being conducted in a normal way."
"However, I would also ask you to appreciate one thing: often, our governments are the first to yield to pressure by the Chinese Government to create a reality that agrees with the dreams and wishes of the Chinese leaders."
"We have to understand that in Nepal, the government probably wanted to do the same thing."
"Therefore, if we want to put pressure on the Nepalese Government to act differently, we also have to start by putting pressure on our own governments to show that they have some backbone in their discussions with the Chinese authorities."
"(RO) Mr President, the Nepalese authorities prevented, under pressure from the Chinese Government, around 20 000 Tibetans in Nepal from voting in the elections for the prime minister of the Tibetan Government in exile."
"The right to vote, as well as the right to free elections and peaceful demonstration, are fundamental rights for every individual and for communities."
"The more obstacles there are preventing people from exercising these rights, the greater their determination to exercise them."
"I firmly believe that the desire of Tibetans in Nepal to elect their Head of Government in exile is also greater."
"Indeed, the attempts by the Nepalese and Chinese authorities to rule them by fear have had exactly the opposite result."
"I call on the European Union's High Representative to express clearly these demands and measures from the European Parliament when in dialogue with the Nepalese and Chinese authorities."
"(FI) Mr President, China has increased its pressure on the Tibetan Government in exile."
"Over 10 000 Tibetans in Nepal were not permitted to vote for a prime minister and members for the parliament of the government in exile."
"Under pressure from China, Nepal's main parties support the socalled One China policy, and they consider Tibet to be an inseparable part of China."
"For these reasons, the Tibetan refugees in Nepal are kept under strict control at all times."
"Although this resolution deals with the election ban, in the background is China's occupation of Tibet."
"China's authority and the pressure it exerts are growing all the time as its economic influence grows."
"This, like the previous resolution on Ai Weiwei, shows how dismal the policy being pursued by the Chinese Communist Party is."
"As the Commissioner said, Europe must be unanimous in its policy towards China."
"Mr President, I was not going to take the floor on this, but because the Dalai Lama will visit my country next Thursday and will speak in my own constituency in the University of Limerick, where I am sure he will have much to say on this and other issues."
"Obviously, the behaviour of the Nepalese home ministry in confiscating ballot boxes is totally reprehensible."
"As for what happened in Kathmandu - a place renowned in song and story, and that even makes it sadder - up to 10 000 votes were not allowed to be counted."
"All we can hope is that we in the European Union, by expressing our voice unanimously, can bring some pressure to bear, not just in Nepal, but on their masters, the Chinese, to try and be a little more understanding, especially in relation to Tibet and the Dalai Lama."
"Finally, I want to say that he will be as welcome in Ireland as the Queen of England and President Obama, who are also coming."
"(FI) Mr President, the right to participate in democratic elections is a universal fundamental right."
"The elections now under way are important for the preservation of Tibetan identity and culture."
"The Tibetans are voting for a new spiritual leader, as the current Dalai Lama steps down."
"Back in 2009, we agreed that the EU would support democracy and participatory governance in its foreign relations."
"We need to be consistent and stand behind this policy of ours."
"Obviously, Nepal is siding with China, under pressure."
"Nepal needs to be reminded of its international human rights obligations to safeguard the democratic rights of the Tibetans, and it should not prevent free elections from going ahead."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, as you know, some 20 000 Tibetans live in Nepal, most of them from the old days."
"They have enjoyed freedom of economic activity, the right to reside in Nepal and, until recently, also some political space to debate the future of Tibet amongst themselves."
"The recent elections on 20 March were an important event for the community outside Tibet and represent a significant step forward in a long reform process envisaged by the Dalai Lama."
"Against this background, we note with concern that the Nepalese authorities are tightening their grip on the political activities of Tibetans in Nepal."
"On 20 March, more than 10 000 of them were effectively stopped from voting by the authorities."
"This is not the first time this has happened."
"During an earlier round of voting in Nepal on 3 October last year, the polls were subject to a crack-down by the Nepalese authorities, which seized ballot boxes and closed the Tibetan community's voting sites."
"The European Union, through its delegation in Kathmandu and the embassies of the EU Member States, has been monitoring these developments in close contact with the Tibetan community and the government."
"The EU takes the view that Tibetan refugees should be allowed to exercise their right to freedom of association in accordance with international human rights standards."
"This should be done in a way which permits the smooth implementation of these rights."
"Access to Nepal's territory should be maintained, and the gentlemen's agreement between the government of Nepal and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees should be honoured."
"New Tibetan arrivals apprehended by the Nepalese authorities en route to Kathmandu should be transferred to the UNHCR's care promptly and without hindrance."
"Pre-1990 Tibetans who are recognised as refugees by the Nepalese Government should be provided with adequate Nepalese registration."
"I would like to ensure this House that the EU will continue to raise this issue with the authorities and continue its monitoring and reporting on future developments."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place shortly."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Tibet's Dalai Lama has taken a decision to retire from political life and continue as the spiritual leader of his people."
"He is, of course, one of the best known of all leaders, and people all over the world have derived strength and consolation from his ideas about goodness, understanding and pacifism."
"His spiritual role will remain in place, but his political duties will now be transferred to the Prime Minister of Tibet's government in exile."
"That, however, will not be without its problems."
"Owing to growing pressure from the Chinese Government, the 20 000 or so Tibetans living in Nepal have not been allowed to vote."
"The Nepalese Government has said that the demonstrations by Tibetans go against the 'One China' policy and has confirmed that it will not allow 'antiBeijing activities' on its soil."
"It has therefore imposed a voting ban on Tibetan groups."
"This comes as no surprise, since the Nepalese authorities have been repeatedly guilty of breaching the freedom of expression and human rights of Tibetans in exile."
"This is despite the fact that Nepal has signed the UN international human rights agreements relating to civil and political rights."
"From its delegation in Kathmandu, the European External Action Service should carefully monitor the political situation in Nepal and, in particular, the treatment of Tibetan refugees, and ensure that their rights are being respected."
"Adherence to democratic principles is important if Tibetan identity is to be preserved and strengthened, both within and outside Tibet."
"The whole world is well aware of how complicated the situation of the Tibetan people is, who, for decades, have been demanding not so much independence any more, but at least respect from the Chinese Government for the fundamental rights of autonomy."
"A nation with such a rich and unique culture lives under a constant threat from a powerful neighbour."
"Now that the Dalai Lama has resigned from political leadership in favour of a new generation of democratic leaders, the Tibetans have been faced with an opportunity to strengthen democratic traditions, despite the fact that the Tibetan Government is still forced to operate in exile."
"However, thousands of Tibetans living in Nepal have been deprived of this right."
"The pressure from China seems to be very effective, and what have so far been peaceful demonstrations in defence of freedom of expression and fundamental rights may become a situation which is difficult to control, and this will certainly have international repercussions."
"After all, we can imagine how effectively the Chinese Government will want to deal with those who 'disturb the peace' in Tibet."
"Recent events should remind the world that the rights of the Tibetan people are constantly being violated and that the issue of Tibet is not a closed chapter, because the Tibetans will certainly continue to insist on respect for their independence, and they will do so with ever-increasing clamour."
"3."
"Zimbabwe"
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolution on Zimbabwe."
"Mr President, this is not the first time we have discussed the method of governing employed by Robert Mugabe and his party."
"In July 2008, the European Parliament adopted a resolution implementing sanctions against Robert Mugabe and his entourage."
"The reason for this decision was, just like today, serious violations of human rights by the ruling administration."
"New cases of intimidation, arrests and also the uninvestigated disappearance of political rivals of the ruling party confirm to us that Robert Mugabe and his political party know that a fair and transparent political contest would strip them of power and raise the prospect of penalties for terrorising the population and pillaging the wealth of the country over many years."
"We can surely all agree on the adoption of the draft resolution, in the hope that measures initiated by the EU may assist the people of Zimbabwe, who are terrorised by their government, to reverse, with the assistance of civic and opposition leaders, the current difficult situation in the country by means that are as peaceful as possible."
"For the European Union to accredit an ambassador of Robert Mugabe in this situation would surely be seen as an affront to decent people."
"Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, let us try, at least through our political behaviour, to promote important political changes in Southern Africa."
"author. - Mr President, since I have been in this Parliament, some twelve years now, we have been trying to help the people of Zimbabwe have better lives and greater optimism for the future."
"We have been clear on two points."
"Firstly, that as long as Robert Mugabe remained in power, protected by a small self-serving element in Zanu-PF and the security forces, pillaging the nation's wealth for their own enrichment, there was little prospect of real change."
"Secondly, that it was up to the people of Zimbabwe, with the support of their African neighbours - and here I name South Africa in particular of course - to bring about the necessary change."
"Maybe, just maybe, there is at last some movement in the right direction."
"You know when Mugabe is worried: he starts to panic."
"His police and militia start attacking anyone they see as opponents."
"The MDC is supposed to be in a power-sharing coalition, but in the past few days, MDC Ministers and MPs, as well as human rights activists, have been beaten up and arrested."
"I suppose Mugabe is increasingly nervous on two counts."
"He has seen what has happened to his friend and main bankroller, Gaddafi; and just a week ago, on 31 March, the Southern African Development Community, which includes South Africa and all Zimbabwe's neighbours, at last voiced its grave concern at the resurgence of violence in Zimbabwe."
"It has called for an end to that violence and for all elements of the global political agreement to be implemented."
"It has appointed a team to work out a road map to peaceful, free and fair elections in Zimbabwe, and today, that team is in Harare."
"We are calling on European governments and the EU to intensify their engagement to use all their political influence in Southern Africa to help bring about rapid change for the better in Zimbabwe and pave the way for properly monitored elections to be held in an atmosphere free from intimidation."
"Until there is evidence of real change, the restrictive measures specifically targeting Mugabe and his close allies must remain in place."
"In this regard, there is no way that the EU should accredit Mugabe's unilaterally appointed envoy as ambassador."
"Once the people of Zimbabwe have their freedom restored, and genuine democracy and the rule of law established, I feel sure that the international community, including the EU, stands ready to come forward with generous assistance."
"Mr President, I have been involved with the situation in Zimbabwe for some ten years now, by my reckoning."
"I used to work for a development organisation in Amsterdam and, every now and then, we would bring Zimbabwean human rights activists to the Netherlands, to Europe, in order to give them some breathing space."
"Not just so they could get to know other activists and swap stories, but also to give them an opportunity to get away from Zimbabwe for a little while."
"One of the people I met at that time was Abel Chikomo, whom we have also mentioned in this resolution."
"A human rights activist who has never lost his enthusiasm, his motivation, for the cause in all these years."
"It is because of people like him that we are adopting these kinds of resolutions because, to be honest, I do not think that Mr Mugabe is losing any sleep over this."
"What these resolutions are about is ensuring that he and his colleagues from the MDC have renewed motivation to continue their work."
"What could we possibly aim to do with these resolutions other than enforcing sanctions?"
"I would therefore insist that we tighten the Kimberley Process for the trade in conflict diamonds to such an extent that diamonds from Zimbabwe are prevented from being offered for sale at all, because they are the reason why the government has been violating human rights, oppressing people, using child labour and so forth. Our involvement in Zimbabwe is well known, but we should continue to mention it, again and again, precisely because of people like Abel Chikomo."
"author. - Mr President, it is a matter of grave concern that the human rights situation in Zimbabwe has worsened during the last months in particular, and this concern relates to Zanu-PF's deliberate obstruction of the Zimbabwean government of national unity."
"The European Parliament must demand an immediate end to the persecution of the political opposition to Zanu-PF, of civil activists who are being arrested and tortured, and of NGOs, which have been raided and whose members have been detained arbitrarily."
"The EU should keep its restrictive measures against individuals and entities with links to the Mugabe regime in place until there is real evidence of a change for the better in Zimbabwe."
"The Zimbabwean people should also be given freedom of expression without the fear of violent persecution, arbitrary imprisonment or torture, and those who have been committing systematic political harassment should be prosecuted."
"The wave of oppression that is breaking over Zimbabwe is a clear sign of the trouble that will precede the coming elections."
"The international community and, in particular, the political players in the region, such as the Southern African Development Community, cannot tolerate the harassment and arbitrary arrests carried out by Zanu-PF and the security forces against civil society activists and members and supporters of the MDC, and they have to demand greater respect for human rights before the elections take place."
"Police raids on offices of human rights organisations, such as the Zimbabwe Human Rights Forum and several others, allegedly in searches for subversive material, and the arrests of various NGO workers and members of the MDC itself, along with students and young activists, which have intensified since February, are tactics in an unacceptable campaign of intimidation."
"Instead of launching a campaign of terror against those who refuse to sign a petition against the restrictive measures imposed by the EU on leaders linked to Mugabe, the leaders of Zanu-PF should pay more attention to the lessons to be drawn from the Arab Spring, and allow truly free elections to take place."
"deputising for the author. - Mr President, firstly, I want to say that I am speaking on behalf of my colleague, Alain Cadec, who was to be the speaker here this afternoon."
"Of the three topics we are discussing, this is by far the worst and probably the most recurring, as speakers have said."
"Robert Mugabe has been strutting the world stage for far too long now and has been behaving in a most dictatorial and brutal fashion towards his own people, and particularly towards opponents within his country."
"The government of national unity, which was set up in 2009 to bring about democracy, is obviously not working, due to his efforts to ensure that it does not."
"The intimidation, arbitrary arrests and disappearances - which is probably another way of saying summary executions - of opponents, particularly in recent months, is quite unacceptable."
"Even NGOs have not escaped: their offices have been raided and their staff have been detained, so it is quite obvious that action needs to be taken against this dictator."
"As Mr Van Orden said, at least the African Union is now beginning to form some class of opposition to him, and that gives us here in the European Union an opportunity to side with it and to bring every possible diplomatic force that we have at our disposal to bear on this issue to ensure, firstly, that Mr Mugabe stops the arrests and the executions, and secondly, that the constitution is accepted for the freedom of the Zimbabwean people, which will lead to free elections and the establishment of a truly democratic government in Zimbabwe."
"Mr President, we all know that the 2008 agreement, implemented in 2009, for the sharing of power between Robert Mugabe and Morgan Tsvangirai, or between Zanu-PF and the MDC, was not an ideal agreement, nor was it an agreement to bring about an ideal world, but it was the only possible agreement to try to improve the situation of human rights and democracy in Zimbabwe."
"The fact is that Mr Mugabe and his allies have done everything they can to ensure that this agreement does not work."
"They have used pressure and intimidation in attempts to break the opposition movement, which now has a majority in the lower house of parliament."
"Just a few minutes ago, it was reported that there have been attacks and violence towards people who had gathered around a memorial where there were MDC militants."
"It is vital that the EU does not avert its gaze from what is happening in Zimbabwe, that it does not allow Mr Mugabe to get away with this final trick of appointing an ambassador without going through his country's constitutional mechanisms, and that it also ensures that the sale of diamonds does not profit Mr Mugabe and his allies."
"Mr President, not everyone in Zimbabwe will be happy about today's debate, since in a few days' time, 18 April will be Independence Day in Zimbabwe."
"Those who do wrong things in this country will have their celebration spoiled."
"Agreements concerning the distribution of power are often problematic."
"This is due to the fact that generally, they do not reflect the result of a democratic decision of the citizens, but a compromise forced by the situation."
"This was precisely the case in Zimbabwe."
"However, agreements on the power sharing can be acceptable and may have a positive impact on society if certain conditions are met."
"One of them is the improvement of the human rights situation."
"That is why we are dealing with human rights in this country."
"For example, it is questionable whether the restrictive measures represent a necessary and effective tool."
"However, we must not allow people who do not want to sign a petition calling for the abolition of these measures to be beaten and harassed."
"That is why we defend those who struggle for human rights."
"Mr President, Mugabe's party and its mechanisms, as my fellow Members said, are currently threatening, torturing and striking out against anyone fighting for democracy, democratic freedoms and the transition to a smooth democratic regime in Zimbabwe."
"We are responsible for what is happening in Africa."
"We have intervened on numerous occasions in the history of democracy on this continent, especially at the beginning when these new countries were being created, and we have obstructed democratic procedures when they threatened our interests."
"As such, we have a double duty to help Zimbabwe acquire a democratically elected government."
"Emotionally, this situation is extremely important to Greeks."
"We had a very harsh dictatorship from 1967 to 1974 and, at that time, any condemnation from the Council of Europe or an international organisation gave hope to the citizens fighting in Greece."
"That is why we must not brook any relations with illegally appointed representatives of Zimbabwe and former associates of the Mugabe regime, and the European Union, together with the countries in its region, must guarantee the transition of Zimbabwe to democracy and the application of the Kimberley Process."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, the EU supports the Kimberley Process, which aims to eliminate African conflict diamonds - or so-called blood diamonds - from the global market."
"However, recent developments in Zimbabwe are worrying."
"The Chairman of the Kimberley Process, Mr Mathieu Yamba from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, has decided unilaterally, and without consultation, to allow the marketing of diamonds from Zimbabwe's Marange mine."
"This mine, which was debated in the House last year, was seized by President Robert Mugabe and his cronies."
"Hundreds of people were dispossessed of their homes and there are reliable reports of his security forces torturing, raping, and even killing, local residents."
"The sale of diamonds from the Marange mine will help Mugabe to further consolidate his tyrannical hold on Zimbabwe and, indeed, enrich his Zanu-PF thugs."
"I therefore urge the European Union, as a party to the Kimberley Process, to raise this scandal at the highest level and insist on the restoration of consensus-based decision making in the Kimberley Process."
"More generally, I have long been calling for a similar system, a certification, to cover other natural resources extracted in Africa in order to prevent brutal governments or guerrilla groups from selling minerals to fund arms purchases."
"I am pleased to be working alongside the London-based, internationally renowned, human rights NGO Global Witness in this endeavour, in which the US Administration is leading the way with the passing of the Dodd-Frank Act."
"(RO) Mr President, let me begin by saying that whenever I hear talk of Robert Mugabe, I see the Romanian dictator, Nicolae Ceauşescu, before me."
"In actual fact, in the 1980s, Mugabe was a regular guest of Ceauşescu's, along with Gaddafi."
"I am grateful to Mr Van Orden because he reminded me of the link between Mugabe and Gaddafi."
"In fact, I think that Mugabe has learnt something from Ceauşescu, namely, hatred for civil society activists."
"The 46 members of civil society who were arrested on 19 February by the security forces in Zimbabwe are currently charged with treason."
"They are now at risk of being sentenced to death."
"This is the penalty."
"Their only 'crime' is that they discussed what happened in Egypt and Tunisia."
"The solution for the Mugabe regime is basically to hold fair and free elections."
"Let us hope that this will be possible on this occasion."
"(FI) Mr President, in February, the EU Foreign Affairs Council adopted conclusions concerning the situation in Zimbabwe."
"The period for EU sanctions to be in effect would be continued, because no adequate progress had really been made in the country's internal reforms."
"The lifting of restrictions will require tangible progress to be made in the implementation of the political power sharing agreement of 2008."
"That apparent power sharing agreement was unable to prevent Mugabe's security forces from continuing to persecute his opponents, and right now, they are being arrested, tortured and murdered, even right up to ministerial level."
"Since EU sanctions are not targeted at the people of Zimbabwe, the EU at present is still the country's biggest provider of aid, which it grants, in particular, for agriculture and food production."
"The EU must continue to put pressure on Mugabe, and if there is a decision to hold elections, the EU should be involved as an observer."
"(PL) Mr President, since our last debate on Zimbabwe in October last year, the situation in this country in southern Africa has not changed."
"Unemployment has reached 90%, average life expectancy is 44 years, and the citizens of this country have no access to basic healthcare services."
"It is obvious that the political agreement reached two years ago by President Mugabe and Prime Minister Tsvangirai has failed to meet the hopes placed in it and that a new, fully democratic solution is needed."
"The internal situation in Zimbabwe has not changed in the last six months, but the external situation has."
"Today, we are debating a country in the context of the 'Spring of Nations' in Africa, and although Harare is 6 000 kilometres away from Tunis, the most recent case of Côte d'Ivoire shows that sometimes, democracy knows no barriers at all."
"The European Parliament therefore urges the government of Zimbabwe to take into account the current international situation and the strong reorientation in domestic politics and, above all, to cease repression of the political opposition, to release its representatives from the prisons and allow them to participate in the elections."
"Six months ago, I said that a poor country like Zimbabwe cannot afford to look for alternative problems."
"Today, I think that the African 'Spring of Nations' puts an additional strain on the political debt of President Mugabe."
"(RO) Mr President, as a member of the Delegation for relations with the Pan-African Parliament, I firmly believe that the European Union, and Lady Ashton in particular, should take a strong stand against the actions of the Mugabe regime involving the intimidation and harassment of human rights activists, and encourage respect for public rights and freedoms, including the freedom of expression and assembly, which Zimbabwe has formally committed to at a global level."
"Zimbabwe must abide by its international commitments, including the African Charter of Human and Peoples' Rights, by repealing all its national laws which contravene the international texts on the protection of human rights."
"I also sincerely believe that countries in the region, and mainly South Africa, could get involved in supporting the return to democracy and respect for human rights in Zimbabwe."
"(RO) Mr President, the events currently going on in Zimbabwe sound an alarm bell for the human rights situation on the African continent."
"With the prospect of the elections in June, President Mugabe is conducting a campaign of intimidation against his rival candidates."
"Hundreds of government officials, human rights activists and opponents of the regime have been arrested during the last two months."
"This situation is unacceptable."
"In addition, the drafting of a democratic constitution has been postponed for a year by Mugabe."
"The new fundamental law would have guaranteed that the elections were held in transparent circumstances."
"I should point out that the country's economic situation is deeply affected."
"The President supports nationalisation of the mining sector, which is the main economic sector in Zimbabwe."
"Such a measure is harmful as it is precisely the foreign investments in this sector which have maintained the state's stability in the wake of the economic crisis."
"(FI) Mr President, in Zimbabwe, President Mugabe and the Zanu-PF Party have not managed to keep to the terms of the Global Political Agreement concluded in 2009."
"Zimbabwe has been unable to move towards democracy."
"On the contrary, in the past few months, there has been a clear increase in the intimidation of political opponents and the number of arbitrary arrests and disappearances."
"Efforts to create stability will not bear fruit in a political climate like the present one."
"Zimbabwe is still a country where you can be abused or tortured for your political opinions."
"The legislative system, which suppresses free and open journalism, restricts the right to freedom of speech."
"Journalists are harassed."
"Everything should be done to support the country's progress towards genuine democracy and economic development."
"It is only right and fitting that, in February this year, the European Council decided to extend restrictive measures concerning people and organisations connected with the Mugabe administration and to keep a record of the blacklist."
"I also think that these should be continued until there is real evidence of genuine change in Zimbabwe."
"However, the measures should only be targeted at Zimbabwe's corrupt government and must not be allowed to exacerbate the plight of the Zimbabwean people."
"(DE) Mr President, back when I was a child, I received letters from what was then Rhodesia."
"Three of my grandfather's sisters were Catholic nuns in the then Rhodesia and in South Africa."
"They never wrote of the people of Rhodesia having to go hungry."
"What we hear from this country today is simply intolerable."
"Rhodesia, and later Zimbabwe, were the bread basket of southern Africa."
"Mr Mugabe - a communist socialist dictator - has managed to turn this bread basket into a famine zone."
"I would like to thank all the fellow Members who have put this matter back on the agenda."
"It is intolerable that this dictator, Mr Mugabe, has been allowed to terrorise the people of Zimbabwe for so long."
"I believe that the key to ending this lies in southern Africa."
"I regret to say that for as long as South Africa fails to put this dictator in his place, he will continue to terrorise his people."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, I think we would all agree that Zimbabwe and its human rights violations have been on our agenda for far too long."
"Every glimpse of hope of some positive development is immediately crushed by outbursts of political repression and violence."
"This is exactly what happened again just a couple of months ago."
"The European Union therefore had to proceed to renew its restrictive measures, for the eighth time, in February this year."
"By this clear gesture, we wanted to underline the critical importance of an agreement between the government parties on the necessary steps leading to elections in the country."
"In this context, the EU emphasised its willingness to revise its decision in response to further concrete developments on the ground."
"The EU is deeply concerned at the upsurge in political violence seen in recent months in Zimbabwe."
"On 11 March, together with 21 embassies and representations, the EU issued a statement to express its concerns over the increase in what appears to be politically motivated intimidation and violence."
"In this context, the EU welcomes the outcome of the recent SADC summit on 31 March 2011."
"The SADC communiqué calls for an immediate end to violence, intimidation, hate speech and harassment, and calls upon the government of Zimbabwe to complete all necessary steps to hold an election."
"It offers assistance so that elections can be organised in accordance with SADC principles and guidelines governing democratic elections."
"For that reason, the SADC will appoint officials to join the South African facilitation team and work with the joint monitoring and implementation committee."
"The EU believes that strengthened facilitation and mediation efforts by SADC and South Africa are key to preventing further instability in Zimbabwe."
"The EU welcomes the region's efforts to mediate in the Zimbabwean crisis."
"South Africa, in its capacity as facilitator, together with the SADC, as guarantor of the Global Political Agreement, has decided to accredit the Zimbabwean Ambassador."
"At this point in time, keeping a formal channel of communication open with Zimbabwe and maintaining a dialogue with the inclusive government is vital, and we should not jeopardise the position of the EU Ambassador in Harare."
"The EU will act and proceed in close coordination with all EU Member States."
"The EU remains the largest provider of development assistance to Zimbabwe."
"We want to clearly express that we are tough on the regime, but we try to assist the people."
"With the disbursement of approximately 365 million since the establishment of the Global Political Agreement in 2009, we are - as I said - the largest donor."
"Resources are only channelled through UN bodies and specialised NGOs."
"Since 2009, the EU has also supported governance reforms, as stipulated in the Global Political Agreement, including the constitutional reform process."
"The EU also funds human rights programmes, including programmes from human rights defenders."
"We just have to hope that all the international pressure will finally lead to free and fair elections in Zimbabwe and to the gradual normalisation of the very difficult situation in this country."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"In recent months, many opponents of the Mugabe regime as well as NGO representatives have been arbitrarily arrested by the Zimbabwean authorities."
"Mr Mugabe's party has systematically prevented Zimbabwe's government of national unity, formed in 2009, from paving the way for a democratic transition and credible elections."
"There must be an immediate end to all political violence perpetrated by Mr Mugabe's supporters."
"The European Union and its Member States must actively engage with the African Union and the Southern African Development Community so as to ensure that future elections are not held in a climate of intimidation and violence."
"I welcome the fact that the European Parliament resolution calls on all Zimbabwe's political parties to work together in drafting a new democratic constitution, acceptable to all the people of Zimbabwe, prior to the next elections."
"Once again, we see that intimidation, arrest, violence and even torture are the weapons used by Mugabe against his political opponents and civil society."
"The forces loyal to Mugabe have intimidated opposition ministers in the government of national unity."
"They have harassed leaders of human rights organisations and arrested 46 representatives of civil society on the charge of treason, with some of them having been beaten and even tortured while under arrest."
"A sustainable structure cannot be built based on fear and terror or against civil and political liberties."
"I call on the European Union's High Representative to support the efforts to hold free elections in Zimbabwe, devoid of violence and intimidation."
"A legitimate government is required which will respect rights and fundamental freedoms, in other words, show respect for human beings."
"Tightening the European Union's restrictions on Mugabe's people must be one measure."
"Debates on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law (debate)"

"The case of Ai Weiwei in China ("
"2."
"Ban on the elections for the Tibetan government in exile in Nepal ("

"Approval of the minutes of the previous sitting: see Minutes"
"Statements by the President"
"I would like to start by making a few comments."
"Today we are celebrating Europe Day."
"I have spent most of the day in Florence which, as you know, is the home of the European University Institute and where the Festival of Europe is taking place."
"A conference on the subject of the state of the European Union took place there too, and I met students from the European University Institute."
"We are celebrating the 61st anniversary of Robert Schuman's momentous declaration which paved the way for the creation of the European Union, and we have now achieved a great deal together."
"Robert Schuman would have been proud of our accomplishments."
"Our founding fathers knew that crises exist in order to be overcome and to help us build solid foundations for the future, so today, 9 May, remembering the past, we are working on the present and looking forward to the future with hope."
"Secondly, the European Union is, today, a full participant in international affairs."
"This was confirmed on 3 May by the United Nations General Assembly, which accepted the participation of the European Union in the work of the United Nations by an overwhelming majority."
"Representatives of the European Union will be able to speak at the General Assembly and submit amendments agreed by the Member States of the EU."
"This is a joint achievement of the Member States, the Commission and Council, but also of the European Parliament."
"Our voice and actions must remain united."
"Our joint action is particularly important, as we face the need to decide on further action in North Africa, where tensions are rising, as well as in Syria and Bahrain."
"Item three: on 17 May, we will be observing the International Day Against Homophobia in the European Union."
"The European Union is fighting discrimination on all fronts, in Europe as well as beyond."
"Homophobia is not an exception."
"Unfortunately, people all over the world are still being persecuted, tortured and even killed."
"The obligation to protect the discriminated is embodied in our most important legal acts - in the Treaty and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"We will keep to this obligation."
"And finally, item number four: the European Parliament totally condemns the execution of one of the men sentenced to death by the army tribunal in the Gaza Strip for cooperation with Israel."
"The European Union is always against the death penalty."
"A return to carrying out executions undermines efforts for a lasting reconciliation in Palestine."
"Request for the defence of parliamentary immunity"
"Now for some administrative announcements."
"Mr de Magistris has submitted two requests for the exercise of immunity and privileges in two court cases in which he is involved in Cosenza and Milan respectively."
"Mr Uspaskich has submitted a request for the exercise of immunity and privileges in a court case in which he is currently involved in Vilnius."
"Mr Tudor has submitted a request for the exercise of immunity and privileges."
"Pursuant to Rule 6(3), these requests will be sent to the committee responsible, the Committee on Legal Affairs."
"(IT) Mr President, this is not a point of order;"
"I simply could not understand what you just said."
"If I am right, Mr de Magistris has requested the defence of his immunity."
"There must be some misunderstanding."
"Since Mr de Magistris is the champion of the battle against immunity in my country, it was probably misinterpreted."
"I think it unlikely that Mr de Magistris would have requested the defence of his immunity."
"I must have misunderstood and I should therefore like some clarification on this matter."
"As I said, it was a request to defend his immunity."
"It will be decided by our committee as usual, pursuant to Rule 6(3)."

"(ES) Mr President, I am sure this is because of how recent it is, but you have not mentioned yesterday's serious event in Cuba: it seems that a Cuban dissident, Juan Wilfredo Soto García, was murdered by the police in a public park in Santa Clara, Cuba."
"Mr President, I believe, given Parliament's sensitivity to the issue of human rights, that you should demand, at the very least, an independent investigation to shed light on the murder of this Cuban dissident."
"Thank you for your remark."
"If such an event has indeed taken place, we will adopt the same position as you have suggested."
"Thank you for calling attention to this."

"Order of business"
"The final draft agenda, as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at a meeting on Thursday, 5 May 2011, pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure, has been distributed."
"The following amendments have been proposed:"
"[Wednesday]:"
"There is an amendment which will shortly be presented by Mr Speroni."
"Regarding the debate on foreign, security and defence policy, the Europe of Freedom and Democracy Group has requested that the statement on the situation in Syria and Camp Ashraf by the High Representative and Vice-President of the Commission should include the Coptic Christian community in Egypt."
"This is an amendment for Wednesday, for the morning session at 09:00 when Mrs Ashton will be present."
"Mr Speroni will now present the amendment."
"Thank you."
"Mr President, we did not want to fundamentally change - or rather propose to fundamentally change - the order of business by adding or replacing an item; we are simply asking to expand the topic on which the Vice-President will be reporting."
"We are simply asking that Syria, Camp Ashraf and the matter of the Christian minority, and, above all, the Coptic minority, in Egypt, be added to the topic under discussion."
"We are talking about a sensitive area and a topic that concerns the protection of minorities, which is why I ask my fellow Members to approve this proposal."
"(FR) Mr President, I fully support that request but I asked you for the floor in order to speak about Tuesday's order of business."
"I do not know whether you can give me the floor now or whether you wish to give it to me after the decision on Mr Speroni's proposal."
"We must now close our initial discussion on the point regarding Wednesday."
"(IT) Mr President, I am taking the floor in order to support Mr Speroni's request, precisely because the situation dominated by clashes involving the Coptic community is an illustration of the risks associated with what is happening in Egypt."
"I therefore call for this request to be supported, precisely because this is not a question of defending the Coptic community's demonstration of its identity."
"Rather, it is proof of the complex situation in Egypt."
"I therefore believe that close monitoring by the European Parliament - especially through Commissioner Ashton's statement - is absolutely necessary."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, everyone has been shocked at what has happened in Egypt."
"We have to be sensible, though."
"Six points are going to be discussed with Baroness Ashton."
"You have Syria, Ashraf, you have the Gualtieri report, the Albertini report, you have the problem of Europe as a global actor in the United Nations."
"It really does not make sense."
"I believe that we should ask the Committee on Foreign Affairs to discuss the situation in Egypt, including everything that has gone on between the minorities, to draft an own-initiative report, and then simply to hold a debate on Egypt with Baroness Ashton one month later."
"We need a proper debate on what is happening in Egypt."
"If you add a sixth point, one person will discuss it, and the other people will discuss something else."
"You will not focus the debate on Egypt by discussing six points with Baroness Ashton."
"Therefore, I understand your emotion, but to add something that will not be discussed on Wednesday morning anyway is not the solution."
"(FR) Mr President, I shall be brief: the Conference of Presidents has scheduled a vote on the possible lifting of my parliamentary immunity for tomorrow, Tuesday."
"I do not wish to elaborate on the matter but, on the specific issue of the order of business, I would even so like to say that I am a little shocked - to put it mildly - that, as no debate has been scheduled, I cannot present my point of view to the House, even for two or three minutes."
"I believe there is a case for presenting it, because it seems to me that the rapporteur has recycled the argument cited last time by Mrs Wallis, who concluded that my parliamentary immunity should be lifted, something that the Court of Justice condemned in very clear terms."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"That is not a point of order."
"(FR) Mr President, I call for a debate, I call for two or three minutes' speaking time."
"That is an item on the order of business as far as I am aware."
"Two or three minutes to defend an MEP's honour: that is all that I am asking for."
"Is it possible that, one day, this Parliament might respect the right of defence of one of its Members, and not just in Guatemala or Indonesia, but inside this Chamber?"
"Mr Gollnisch, we are acting in accordance with Rule 7(8) of the Rules of Procedure, and it states there quite clearly how to proceed in such matters."
"Any comments that you may have concerning the order of business must be submitted at least one hour before the session which we have just opened."
"I repeat, this is in Rule 7(8) of our Rules of Procedure."
"(FR) Mr President, the Conference of Presidents has scheduled a debate on Wednesday afternoon on the Italian and French Governments' proposal to cast aside the Schengen agreements."
"Please excuse me, it is actually scheduled for Tuesday afternoon, at 15:00."
"The Conference of Presidents decided that Mr Barroso should attend, and I should like to know from the information available whether he will be there."
"Why is this very important to us?"
"It is important because the first person to have adopted a position after the summit meeting between Mr Sarkozy and Mr Berlusconi was the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, whereas the Commissioners subsequently expressed a different view."
"Given that it is actually the job of the Commission President to represent the Commission, we are anxious for Mr Barroso to be present at 15:00 on Tuesday afternoon."
"I apologise for having mixed up Tuesday and Wednesday."
"Mr Cohn-Bendit, thank you for your remarks."
"I will check it."
"I have no other information right now but I can check it for you."
"A special gesture!"
"I declare the order of business for the week adopted."
"European fisheries sector crisis due to rise in oil prices (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on:"

"the oral question to the Commission on the crisis in the European fisheries sector due to the rise in oil prices, by Isabella Lövin, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance - B7-0313/2011)."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, Parliament has only one seat: Strasbourg!"
"Since February 2011, the price of oil has been steadily rising, and has recently exceeded the USD 100 mark."
"Fishermen in every European coastal region are being hit hard by this oil price rise."
"Indeed, fishing operating costs are soaring while the price of oil is rising."
"Small-scale fishing, in particular, is severely affected."
"Fishermen's incomes are also dependent on the price of oil."
"Professionals everywhere are telling me that they are concerned about the rise in oil prices."
"I want us to act together to ensure that businesses can carry out their work despite the rise in operating costs."
"With this question and the resolution that will follow, I call on the Member States to help fishing professionals, where necessary, to continue their work without distorting competition."
"Hence, I am calling for the de minimis aid threshold to be increased from EUR 30 000 to EUR 60 000 per firm."
"This in no way means increasing Parliament's budget or the European budget."
"De minimis aid is aid that the Member States may grant to their businesses if they believe it will not distort competition."
"I am calling for a little more flexibility for the Member States."
"I am also calling for the Commission to analyse my request thoroughly and to understand the concerns of an entire sector, which must be preserved and developed."
"The fishing community consists of men and women who need a decent income, whom we must support."
"As a result, among other things, of the rise in imported fishery and aquaculture products on the European market, that sector is becoming increasingly fragile."
"This is not just about economic profit."
"It is in our interests to preserve this activity; by doing so, we can develop our territory and coastal regions, ensure the European Union's food security and safeguard jobs in the sector."
"Mr President, the situation in the fisheries sector is very serious."
"The fuel price is high, yet the price of fish is low, at a record low, in fact."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would draw your attention to the fishing of plaice."
"Plaice fishing is important for my country, the Netherlands, but also for France, Belgium, England and Denmark."
"A few years ago, plaice stocks were very low, as a result of which duty-free importation of other flatfish was permitted."
"Cheap alternatives, less tasty too, but that is beside the point."
"However, today we have enough plaice and yet, the duty-free importation of cheap flatfish is continuing."
"As a result, fresh plaice is sold at far below the cost price or withdrawn from the market and auctioned off."
"What a regrettable situation!"
"The duty-free importation of plaice fillets must stop, Mr President."
"It is not only fishermen, but also the processing industry and the market who want that."
"Why?"
"The survival of fishermen is essential for traders, otherwise traders will not be able to offer plaice in their range in the future."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we urgently need concrete measures."
"This crisis demands that Europe take decisive action."
"I call on you to vote for such action."
"(DE) (The speaker directs a blue card question to Mr Cadec under Rule 149 of the Rules of Procedure) Mr President, I have a question for Mr Cadec regarding his opening remarks, namely, with regard to the supposed single seat of the European Parliament."
"Mr Cadec, you might perhaps have noticed that Parliament sometimes meets in Brussels too, that committees have their meetings in Brussels, or that administration is, to a certain extent, carried out in Luxembourg."
"I merely wanted to make you aware of the fact that this situation is perhaps not quite as you imagine it to be."
"Mr President, I just wanted to point out that the Treaties are clear on this issue: the seat of the European Parliament, of this Chamber in which we find ourselves today and throughout this week, is Strasbourg and only Strasbourg."
"Of course, we work in Brussels."
"I am there two weeks a month and like you, ladies and gentlemen, I have a good time there and I do a lot of work there."
"However, the seat of Parliament - of this Chamber - is Strasbourg, and it must remain so."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for many companies in the European Union, the continual rise in fuel prices represents an additional burden."
"European fishermen in particular are suffering as a result of this price rise because they cannot simply compensate for the additional costs by increasing their catch or by charging better prices."
"The current political situation in North Africa and the Middle East has exacerbated the problem."
"We therefore need to investigate the effects of the rise in fuel prices on the economy and employment in the EU."
"Which sectors are particularly at risk and what sort of support could be provided without it distorting competition?"
"We therefore call on the Commission to look into this."
"It is important that we support the European fishing industry, among other things, in order not to increase our dependence on imports from third countries."
"We are on the verge of reforming the common fisheries policy and therefore, we are under a particular obligation to be cautious and not to act prematurely with regard to this matter either."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, European fisheries are in a state of deep crisis, as my fellow Members have said."
"Fishermen in all European seas complain about the painful drop in income, which may be severe enough to threaten their existence."
"Yet, why is the income of our fishermen decreasing?"
"As far as I can see, there are three reasons for this."
"Firstly, there is the decline in fish stocks; secondly, the general fall in prices in precisely the area where fish stocks are healthy and supply is too high; and thirdly - and this is what we are concerned about today - operating costs are higher as a result of rising crude oil prices."
"We politicians need to step in here."
"We must do what we can to help."
"I would stress that we can only do what we can."
"The motion for a resolution tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) promises more than we can deliver."
"It demands an increase of 100% in the de minimis aid ceiling from EUR 30 000 to EUR 60 000, which is to be used to fund fuel subsidies."
"However, fuel subsidies are something that many Member States really cannot afford."
"Therefore, most fishermen would not be helped by this at all."
"Moreover, the other two problems would still remain: firstly, overfishing would actually increase and, secondly, it would not solve the problem of market prices."
"Where financial support for fisheries is concerned, I can see a much greater problem."
"The Member States do not use the resources of the European Fisheries Fund, although the European Union pays 50%."
"Something urgently needs to change in this regard in the interests of our fishermen."
"Ladies and gentlemen, let us work together to produce a differentiated text by Thursday and jointly come up with a sensible, sustainable and less showy fisheries policy."
"author. - Mr President, I would also like to thank my colleague, Mr Cadec, for giving us the opportunity to discuss very fundamental questions."
"First of all, when it comes to the increase in oil prices, there are actually two sectors which are exempt from all energy taxes already and those are aviation and shipping - including fisheries."
"So, compared to all other sectors in the European Union, fisheries are proportionally less affected by the rise in oil prices since they are already exempt from all the taxation."
"This is already a hidden subsidy which has contributed to making it possible for European fisheries to go on fishing depleted fish stocks; and the segments in the fisheries sector which have the highest consumption of fossil fuels are, in fact, the most destructive ones, such as beam trawlers and bottom trawlers."
"So the de minimis has already been increased tenfold in 2008; this is also a large subsidiary to the sector."
"Yet, at the same time, we are making lots of promises in the international arena to reduce CO2 emissions, in fact, by 80-95% by 2050; we have also promised in Nagoya to eliminate environmentally harmful subsidies by 2020; in the WTO negotiation context, we are also focusing on how to eliminate the distortion of fishery subsidies."
"I would think that, if the EU were to introduce an increased de minimis at this point in time, it is likely to undermine the EU leadership in the ongoing negotiation process, sending a signal round the world that other countries, too, could increase their fishery subsidies on fuel, which would lead to a vicious circle, increasing the pressure on the world's fish stocks."
"This is absolutely not what we need at this time: we need to turn around the trend, and this would send completely the wrong signal."
"The market must take the increase in prices, and this is what the Commission must focus on in the CFP reform."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the Commission is aware of the current situation in the fishing sector."
"Fuel prices are one reason for the problems we have, but they are not the only reason."
"With reference to fuel prices, in order to address this situation, the Commission encourages the Member States to use fully the possibilities offered by the European Fisheries Fund."
"We have not used those possibilities."
"Up to now, the Member States have used less than 20% of the overall allocation."
"The high fuel prices could be best addressed by the use of those EFF measures that help to restructure the fishing fleet and add more value to fisheries products, thus improving prices."
"It is likely that fuel prices will remain high in the coming years."
"Of course, last week the prices fell, but nevertheless we can expect prices to remain high."
"Therefore, the Commission is reflecting, in the framework of the reform of the common fisheries policy and the Financial Regulation, on how to further incentivise less fuel-intensive fishing."
"The objective will be to encourage the adjustment of the sector and to increase its resilience to fuel prices."
"However, such an approach needs to respect the principle that financial assistance may not, under any circumstances, increase fishing effort."
"The best way to increase the resilience of the fisheries sector to fuel prices is to ensure that fishing levels are in line with maximum sustainable yield."
"This will lead to more abundant fish stocks in the mid-term."
"More fish mean more fishing opportunities, and that means higher revenues for the sector in general."
"With reference to the increase of the de minimis threshold, this is not a new issue."
"The Commission conducted a study, back in 2008, analysing the effect of moving from the ceiling of EUR 30 000 to EUR 100 000 per beneficiary."
"The study concluded that we could not accept this proposal, mainly for three reasons."
"First, because such an increase would distort fishing operations towards more fuel-intensive technologies with greater negative impact on the marine environment."
"Second, because larger and more fuel-intensive vessels would receive more funding than smaller and less fuel-intensive vessels."
"I do not think that anybody here would like to encourage the bigger vessels to use more fuel."
"The third reason is much more important, and some Members of Parliament have already mentioned it."
"Many Member States are now forced to implement austerity measures."
"Therefore, there would only be limited political support from Member States for a proposal that could lead to an increase in public expenditure."
"Even if the de minimis threshold was increased, many Member States would not have the money to actually exploit this new opportunity to spend taxpayers' money."
"If only some Member States paid higher de minimis aid, this would distort competition and result in an uneven playing field for the fleets of different Member States."
"This is the most important reason of all."
"As to the reduction of the fuel tax exemption of the fishing industry raised by the Greens, we cannot accept that."
"This issue cannot be tackled appropriately by EU legislation alone, but needs to be discussed at a global level."
"Taxing fuel taken up in EU ports alone would lead to massive competitive distortions, to the detriment of EU fleets."
"It would also harm EU ports, as many vessels would simply buy fuel outside the European Union."
"That is why we urge the Member States to use our Funds."
"Mr President, while we are waiting for proposed reforms of the common fisheries policy (CFP), the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) wishes to express its alarm, once again, at the economic state of the fisheries sector."
"Until the proposal for its new common organisation of markets is tabled, the sector will continue to have almost no room for manoeuvre when setting prices."
"The rules on imports, many of which originate with illegal fishing, remain unfair competition for EU production: new monitoring obligations require companies to mobilise more of their resources and the general crisis does not exactly encourage increased consumption of quality products."
"To this must be added the upward trend in fuel prices, which is once again threatening companies that have already managed to survive the crisis of 2008."
"Far-reaching reforms of the CFP are envisaged and, in light of that, and in a context of ever decreasing structural aid, many companies could need liquidity to restructure or adapt themselves with a view to 2013."
"That is why we have tabled this oral question and this motion for a resolution before the House, given that this aid does not cost the EU budget anything and that, furthermore, the increase in aid being requested falls far short of the de minimis aid received by other sectors, such as transport or agriculture."
"We do not want to see ourselves in a situation like that in 2008, when we debated the package of measures adopted in extremis by Commissioner Borg."
"I would also like to say something to you, Commissioner: it is true that there are some Member States that will and others that will not be able to give this aid, and that, according to you, this will create disparity."
"However, greater disparity is created by the fact that some Member States do not cofinance the European Fisheries Fund, and that is something that is generally accepted."
"What needs to be proposed is aid, and any Member States wishing to defend their sectors will also be able to defend them."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, fishermen have told us that it is becoming harder for them to make a living from their work."
"On top of the particularly painful situation for them of a reduction in fishing quotas and plans for exit from the fleet, there is now the added problem of soaring oil prices."
"Although the price has fallen slightly, it continues to fluctuate, and for two years now, this situation has been affecting the daily lives of all our European fishermen, in particular, in the small-scale and coastal fishing sector."
"This situation is extremely worrying, and we are anxious to show fishermen that we are fully behind them."
"To do so, we call on the European Commission to raise the threshold of de minimis aid that can be granted to them to help them cope with this crisis."
"This is simply a temporary measure, justified by an urgent situation."
"The Commission already reacted to a similar phenomenon in 2007, and in the face of this new peak, we wish to know what concrete measures - you have already given details of some of them - it intends to take."
"We also feel it is crucial, as Mrs Fraga Estévez said, to verify that the Member States are using all of the funds currently set aside by the regulation."
"At a time when the future common fisheries policy appears to be taking shape, I believe that our fishermen are not resistant to change; quite the contrary."
"Many of them told me that they were willing to make an effort, particularly in terms of preserving stocks."
"This is, in fact, a collective responsibility."
"In order to make that effort, they must not fall victim to factors outside their work over which they have absolutely no control."
"A swift and effective response by you, Commissioner, on this point would send a signal that would also help strengthen what we know are historically fragile links between the Commission and the profession."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, today, the call is for subsidies for fishermen because of the increase in fuel prices, tomorrow, it will be farmers and, after that, lorry drivers and then airline operators, and then what about the owners of petrol stations?"
"Their profits have gone down because fuel prices have gone up."
"All of us are suffering because fuel prices have gone up."
"Let us subsidise each other!"
"This is all nonsense."
"It is American pork-barrel politics - special pleading for sectoral interests - brought into the European Parliament."
"But what this debate does reveal is that, while everyone says we should have sustainable fishing policies, in practice, when it comes down to it, some people do not understand the word 'sustainability'."
"They do not actually know what it means."
"The Commission has made it quite clear that they understand that the fishing industry is not economically viable in some respects, but that is not the result of extra fuel prices."
"It is because of the unsustainable fishing practices of decades."
"If the market is constrained, if fishermen are not able to directly pass on the costs of fish to their consumers, then that is something that we should investigate."
"We should ensure that there is a direct link between the price of fish and the cost to consumers, but simply subsidising unsustainable practices is not the way to reduce the over-fishing which has caused the economic problems in the first place."
"The Commissioner told Parliament's committee one month ago, when Mr Cadec put this question to her, that she was not mindful to support subsidies to compensate for the extra cost of fuel."
"She has repeated that today and I, for one, am delighted to hear her words."
"Mr President, a common fisheries policy primarily based on the protection of the environment must allow the management and development of European fisheries to be maintained at a sustainable level."
"Fishing is a particularly important part of the economy, but it should also be stressed that fishing has a cultural value, which is passed on from generation to generation."
"Therefore, retaining this value should become an aim of the common fisheries policy."
"From an economic point of view, it is essential for maintaining appropriate economic balance."
"With regard to the drastic increase in fuel prices in Europe which has contributed to the collapse of the industry, the common fisheries policy should include a mechanism which would protect fishermen against an uncontrolled rise in prices in situations like these."
"The European Union cannot allow another branch of the European maritime industry to migrate to the Far East, as in the case of shipbuilding and maritime transport."
"We should note that Iceland - precisely because it has reservations concerning CFP - does not want to join the European Union."
"In view of the above, we should speed up the reform of CFP considerably and act in order to protect the environment and ensure appropriate protection for fishermen."
"Once again, the question arises whether we should introduce regionalisation for the fisheries industry, and exert more influence on CFP on the part of individual states, albeit in a balanced way."
"Once again, it should be stressed that as a result of the crisis and economic instability, CFP will no longer function and will leave the fishermen to their fate."
"Mr President, I have to say that I am fairly satisfied with Mrs Damanaki's response on this issue of the consequences of rising oil prices for fishermen."
"This is really about political consistency within the European Union, and about a serious structural trend, namely, the rise in the price of oil on account of its scarcity - and every one of us here knows that it is here to stay."
"We therefore cannot provide a short-term, circumstantial solution by increasing subsidies in line with the fluctuations in oil prices."
"This is a question of political logic."
"The European Union must remain firm with regard to the principles and objectives it has set itself; namely, combating global warming as a priority issue and reducing greenhouse gas emissions caused by fossil fuels."
"It should therefore avoid sending the opposite signal and conducting a contradictory policy."
"Ensuring the survival of a doomed energy system will not help fishermen; they, too, will inevitably be doomed as a result of it."
"Instead, they should be given the opportunity to redeploy their fisheries resources and to refocus their factors of production on energy-saving tools."
"Subsidies should be channelled into these areas and not into short-term support determined by fluctuating oil prices."
"(PL) Mr President, today we are facing an issue which we have already tackled once, in 2008."
"At the time, the European Parliament expressed its solidarity with the fishermen and called on the Commission to draw up specific proposals with the intention of relieving the situation in regions which relied mostly on fishing."
"Statistics clearly show that from 2003, the cost of fishing in the European Union has increased more than threefold, and the sudden jump in fuel costs means that fishermen currently have to invest 40% more of their funds so that fresh fish can reach their customers as quickly as possible."
"The phenomenon of the sudden increase in fuel costs on world markets in the past few months is, without question, the most significant reason for the sudden deterioration in the situation."
"The increase in fuel prices translates directly into a fall in fishermen's profits, as the fishermen's boats are driven by diesel engines."
"So we have a vicious circle."
"The fishermen, in trying to make up for the increase in fuel prices, are increasing the volume of their catches and sailing further to fishing grounds, which, in turn, means that their boats use more fuel."
"This is why there is an urgent need for the European Commission to take further steps and to lift the de minimis aid ceiling, as my political group proposes, from EUR 30 000 to EUR 60 000 per firm for the three-year period."
"This is a sensible proposal which, in the current situation, would guarantee help for a sector wrestling with financial difficulties, and ensure social and economic development."
"(ES) Mr President, the fact that we have found time for this issue during this sitting, whose agenda is hardly short of matters to debate, gives an idea of the importance that this House attaches to the increase in oil prices and how it affects the fisheries sector."
"The price per barrel has increased by 63% since 2007; it is true that it has decreased today, but I do not think it has fallen enough to be sustainable."
"We in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament are concerned by the crisis affecting the sector, and we are convinced that the solution involves an EU response including actions that Members and the governments of the various Member States had already been demanding."
"We therefore call for this situation to be tackled using an effective and impartial mechanism enabling emergency measures at EU level."
"In 2007, de minimis measures were adopted."
"We are not just asking you for de minimis measures, Commissioner Damanaki: we ask that you look into opening up the European Fisheries Fund (EFF), and that you allow it to become more flexible, because of the inability - which you have acknowledged - of some Member States to contribute money and solve the problem."
"Let us hope that the Commission is able to explore new avenues, concrete proposals, so as to be able to use the EFF to help the hardest-hit sections of the fleet, which are small-scale and artisanal coastal fishers, and those operating from remote ports."
"I would ask, Commissioner, that you study the possibility of introducing to the CFP, as you have proposed, new measures limiting fishing's fuel dependence, which is excessive."
"I would also ask you to commit to the necessary improvement in product sales."
"All this must be viewed from the sustainability standpoint you have been talking about, as well as from the environmental and social standpoints, but must also be viewed from the other side, which is also important: that is, the human side, for fishers who are suffering enormously."
"We believe that this is an emergency measure and we think that short-term flexibility measures could give a breathing space to a sector that has been hit quite hard."
"(ES) Mr President, there is an urgent need for concrete measures to reduce the impact that the increase in fuel prices is having on the fisheries sector."
"This sector is working with increasingly scarce resources, receives increasingly low prices, and is faced with significant competition from third countries, which definitely distort the market."
"I therefore support any necessary measures that do not incur any cost to European budgets."
"However, given the sector's dependence on fossil fuels, and with a view to the new reform, consideration should be given to efforts accompanied by an innovation policy, in addition to the efforts already made to date, so as to make the fishing fleet more energy efficient."
"This is because supporting investigation in this area is also a commitment to profitability and an opportunity for sectors linked to the energy market, such as shipbuilding, to have a future and be able to reinvent themselves."
"(RO) Mr President, we must realise that high crude oil prices are here to stay and that we will never go back to the days of USD 30-40 per barrel."
"The era of cheap crude oil has gone."
"In 2011, the minimum average price is still going to be USD 80-100 per barrel."
"In these circumstances, the adverse impact on the economy is expected to continue."
"New measures need to be implemented in the fisheries sector, bearing in mind, in particular, that European fishermen are facing strong global competition."
"Fishing is the only viable economic activity in many regions and is important in terms of maintaining the number of jobs."
"As I have indicated, we must expect oil prices to remain high and this economic climate to affect primarily those involved in small-scale fishing."
"This context raises the following important question: what future do the common fisheries policy and European Fisheries Fund have?"
"If this fund is not being used very much, it means that it needs to be reviewed and reformed."
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there will indeed be no fisheries unless we stop the collapse in our fisheries, in our fish stocks."
"However, it is also important for us to look at what is currently happening as regards our fishermen."
"It is true that small-scale fishermen, coastal fishermen, are suffering greatly at the moment."
"We are discussing extending a measure to which, in practice, they rarely have access."
"As a result of the economic crisis, most Mediterranean countries will be unable to use de minimis aid."
"This is a fact."
"On the other hand, we need to see how we can use the European Fisheries Fund to support and help the countries which are in the throes of serious economic crisis to overcome these problems, so that they can help their fishermen."
"I personally am in favour of extending de minimis aid on certain conditions: we must focus on small-scale fishermen, on small-scale and coastal fisheries; we must focus on fishermen who apply proper, sustainable fishing practices; and finally, we must focus on ensuring that financing does not result in an increase in fishing effort and these measures do not put the environmental and social viability of European fisheries at risk."
"We must also focus on ensuring that European fisheries are not discouraged from becoming more efficient."
"I agree with you Commissioner; we must see how we can make greater use of the European Fisheries Fund and, in particular, how we can help countries which no longer have the funds to make their own contribution make a more active contribution."
"(BG) Mr President, we laid down a number of conditions and demands for ensuring sustainable, responsible fishing in the new common fisheries policy."
"At the same time, fishermen are dependent on the vagaries of the weather and unfair competition."
"During recent years, they have also been faced with another huge problem - ever-rising oil prices."
"All these factors have made it almost impossible to pursue this form of employment."
"The de minimis principle is intended to apply until 2013."
"It is time to review it, if we are really thinking about the prospects ahead for the sector."
"Fuel prices have trebled, which has naturally raised the question whether EU legislation is adequate and suitable for the economic reality and meets European fishermen's needs."
"In this regard, I am waiting for the Commission to review the current applicable ceiling of EUR 30 000 and to increase its amount significantly."
"However, there is also another issue at stake."
"The Commission must also abandon its pure control functions relating to the granting of State aid and actively encourage Member States to use it."
"Why is this important?"
"Some countries in the European Union prefer not to mention this facility because it means an additional burden on their domestic budgets."
"On the other hand, when they exert pressure on the fisheries sector, they use Brussels to justify themselves."
"Just a cursory analysis indicates that Bulgaria's fishermen do not even know that such a facility and regulation exist."
"Organisations from the sector have made a number of requests for State aid to be granted in support of the sector, but they are completely unaware of the de minimis regulation."
"States are concerned about granting this facility now when the blow from high oil prices needs to be softened, which raises the question not only about high prices, but also about the sector's survival in general."
"On the other hand, there is also the problem with the onerous procedures involved with using European funds, including under the de minimis regulation."
"This is why I want to add my question to those raised by my fellow Members, and I thank Mr Cadec for initiating this debate today: how will the European Commission encourage Member States to use the facilities under the de minimis regulation?"
"What measures is the Commission thinking of taking to achieve a balance between control over the use of the funds and the accessibility of these funds to European fishermen?"
"(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, rising oil prices is a structural trend resulting from production limits coming up against increasing global demand."
"Its volatility in recent years has hit hard and made it difficult to adjust gradually."
"We therefore need a response to put a stop to cost increases in the area of fisheries, which are often sudden, and to the deterioration of the sector's already complicated situation."
"When the regulation introducing de minimis aid was adopted in 2007, it was thought that it would not affect trade or distort competition."
"There is a need to evaluate these aspects and to move toward a more ambitious solution, created with the Marine Strategy Framework Directive and the Europe 2020 strategy in mind, and as part of the process of reforming the common fisheries policy."
"I believe that a coherent response should increase the sector's capacity for structural adjustment and, at the same time, help its most vulnerable members, particularly small and medium-sized producers."
"Relieving the sector's situation in the short term, with measures like that proposed by the Commissioner of mobilising and encouraging the mobilisation of the European Fisheries Fund, seems positive to me, and I believe it should be compatible with other measures and long-term action toward greater stability."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, EU fishermen are, as we know, confronted with three major problems: firstly, the very complex, unpopular quota system has forced them to adopt very restrictive practices."
"Secondly, the lack of training opportunities and the profession's perceived loss of prestige are causing significant recruitment problems."
"Thirdly, and this is the issue we are discussing today, the rise in oil prices is making operating conditions in this crisis-hit sector even more difficult."
"Between 2008 and 2010, French fishermen, for example, lost EUR 100-200 in income per week as a result of fluctuating oil prices, even though their turnover remained the same."
"As an elected representative from a port town, I strongly support my fellow Members in demanding that the Commission authorise an increase in the de minimis aid ceilings."
"This measure would relieve the pressure on fishermen, thereby enabling them to make a decent living from their work."
"However, contrary to what has also been said, it would not affect the replenishment of stocks."
"The future reform of the common fisheries policy will have to seek the support of fishermen. To show them today, on Europe Day in particular, that the European Union is alert to their needs would already be a good start, Commissioner."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the significant rises in fuel prices have seriously exacerbated the crisis faced by the fisheries sector, not least its economic viability, and the already scant incomes of those working in the sector have been significantly reduced."
"The current sales dynamic does not permit fluctuations in the cost of factors of production, including fuel, to impact on fish prices, and current import policy, inter alia, contributes to this."
"Average first-sale prices have stagnated or declined over several years, without this being reflected in reduced prices for end consumers."
"The current common organisation of the market (COM) for fisheries products has not contributed sufficiently to improving first-sale prices, nor towards better distribution of added value across the sector's value chain."
"The economic situation of a large number of companies has deteriorated in recent years, leading to many of them going out of business, with a real risk that thousands of fishing businesses will go under and that thousands of jobs will be lost because of the rise in fuel prices."
"The coastal and small-scale fishing sectors are particularly vulnerable, and represent more than 90% of the fleet in some Member States, such as Portugal."
"Under these circumstances, the Commission's attitude of inertia and its refusal to take the necessary measures - a stance you have confirmed here today, Commissioner - is absolutely disgraceful."
"The Commission can only think of one solution for the problems facing the fisheries sector: indiscriminately cutting the number of ships, which amounts to curing the illness by killing the patient."
"It is important to say that when such cuts were made in the past, without taking into account fleets' particularities, the state of fish stocks in each case and each country's consumption needs, they did not solve any of the problems with which the sector is now faced."
"It merely caused EU-level concentration of ownership and activity in the sector."
"Emergency measures therefore need to be adopted that give an immediate and suitable response to the sector's socio-economic needs, such as the creation of a guarantee fund, paid for at Union level, that ensures the stability of fuel prices and the use of all financial possibilities and margins of the EU budget to finance extraordinary support measures for the sector."
"However, taking into account the structural trend of oil price increases and, on the other hand, the demands of environmental sustainability, there is also a need for measures ensuring the medium- and long-term viability of the sector."
"Mechanisms are needed to improve first-sale prices, and to promote fair and appropriate distribution of added value across the sector's value chain."
"The European Fisheries Fund (EFF) needs to effectively and substantially support the renewal and modernisation of fishing fleets, not least by making the different types of fishing more selective, and by replacing engines for reasons of safety, of environmental protection and of fuel efficiency."
"As well as any tax measures that could be adopted at Member State level, EU-level solutions are needed so as not to exacerbate the inequalities that already exist today between Member States and which are increasing because of the serious social and economic crisis, which is hitting the most vulnerable economies particularly hard."
"(ES) Mr President, the best thing about asking a question is that you get an answer, even if, in this case, it could be considered disappointing in some ways."
"The fisheries sector is clearly in crisis: fishers' incomes are lower every day, making it difficult to continue working in this field in many cases."
"We are not talking about stealth subsidies or unsustainable practices: we are talking about problems that require our full support."
"We suggest it time and again, and reiterating a fair demand, as Mr Cadec has done, cannot be reproached: he is being consistent."
"Nobody has suggested increasing fishing efforts."
"We do not understand why measures that are immediately relevant to exceptional situations have to be rejected."
"We are just suggesting that the Commission not turn its back on a sector that urgently needs aid, and this aid can, today, be an increase in de minimis aid."
"(PT) I also want to add my voice to all those here who have expressed concerns with fishers' low incomes, exacerbated by the historic high in fuel prices, particularly over the last few months."
"As has rightly been mentioned here, fuel costs have a very acute impact on the survival of our small and medium-sized shipping companies, seriously exacerbating already fragile incomes from fishing, in particular."
"Spiralling fuel prices are also having profoundly negative effects on us: reduced numbers of voyages; penury-level incomes for fishers, exacerbated by low first-sale prices; increased imports to Europe of shellfish and seafood products from third countries; and people ceasing to work in the sector because of the resulting financial difficulties, leading to further job losses."
"In order to prevent this crisis becoming any worse, therefore, we need to take action regarding the fisheries sector's problems; swift and far-reaching action."
"The Commission should, therefore, respond positively, with short- and long-term measures, to tackle the adverse conditions faced by the sector and the serious losses in income being experienced by our fishers."
"Mr President, let us be clear: there is an urgent need for the European fishing fleets to restructure so as to move away from energy-intensive, environmentally destructive fishing vessels and gear and to adopt more benign practices that require less energy and are more sustainable in the long-term: environmentally, socially and economically."
"This is why I think that granting more public money to the fisheries sector in response to increased fuel prices would send the wrong signal during the reform of the common fisheries policy and would provide an incentive for vessel owners to use more powerful and more fuel-consuming engines."
"This is why I think it is a huge mistake."
"It has already been explained that there is no conjunctural or structural problem, and - let us be clear on this point too - current figures show that 70% of European fish stocks are overfished, so any measure we can take to reduce this overfishing would be a good measure."
"Any measure that has the opposite effect would be an extremely bad measure to take."
"(FR) Mr President, I have just heard two of my fellow Members address issues to do with the problem of sustainability and with the fact that we need to subsidise some professions because they cannot earn enough to survive."
"Yet we must do the exact opposite."
"Fishermen are asking for only one thing: to be able to make a living from their work and to be able to do their job."
"Therefore, if oil is a periodic problem now, it will be so in the future too."
"We need to invest in research into cheaper engines that consume less oil."
"The reform under way today, though, involves destroying all the small fishermen, all those who consume less oil, so as to make the richest even richer."
"So true is this that, reform after reform, we are seeing a steady fall in the price of fish, even though, in the fishmonger's, it has never been so dear, with some types of fish actually being out of the price range of consumers."
"The important thing is to reform the quota system, but also to reform and examine practices within the profession that mean that small operators are endlessly suffering while large operators are becoming ever richer!"
"Mr President, the rise in fuel prices has created yet another problem for fishermen but it is only the latest problem, not the first."
"For the British fishing fleet, the biggest problem is membership of the EU."
"The UK provides the EU with 70% of its fishing but is allowed only 13% of its quotas."
"Would it not be fair for the UK to receive a more proportionate share?"
"In particular, the weight of cod landed in Britain has fallen from 300 000 tonnes, before joining what was then the EEC, to just 7 000 tonnes today."
"British fishermen are facing further losses in the number of days at sea and are slowly being driven out of business."
"In the long term, British fishermen want withdrawal from the EU; in the short term, they demand fair treatment under the common fisheries policy."
"British fishermen, as representatives of the host country, must have an increase in the number of days at sea."
"We have heard of unsustainable fishing, but British waters are not being overfished by British fleets; the problem is that British waters have been thrown open to all."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I can say in replying to the Members that I can understand all your concerns."
"I share your concerns about the poor income of our fishermen, especially of the owners of small vessels in coastal regions."
"But is this problem caused by the increase in fuel prices?"
"Are you sure about that?"
"We have discussed this problem again and again and we recognised that we had this problem even before prices were raised."
"Of course I can understand that the increase in fuel prices could worsen the problem, but the main reason for the problem has always been overfishing - the fishing over the set limits which cannot leave stocks in a healthy state."
"We have discussed it and this is the main problem we have to solve through our CFP reform."
"Of course, now we are discussing fuel prices."
"This is a problem and we must discuss how we can face it."
"The only way to face this problem on a permanent basis is to improve the resilience of our sector to the increase in fuel prices."
"This is the only way, because we cannot be sure about the evolution of fuel prices."
"Let me give you an example of what could happen: in Belgium, they improved the engines in their fleet after the last crisis and now they have reduced spending on fuel in their fleets by 20 percent."
"So this is the way to go and this is what we are trying to do."
"Nevertheless, referring to your proposals, there is a proposal to the Commission to increase the de minimis ceiling."
"Let us look at this problem."
"What is this ceiling?"
"This is the ceiling of the aid that Member States can give to their sector."
"If the Commission now increases this ceiling, it means that only the Member States with a healthy budget can give this."
"So this would result in creating an uneven playing field in our sector, favouring the richest countries."
"Let me put it clearly so that we understand the situation."
"Also, if we increase the ceiling, only the bigger vessels will gain any advantage from it."
"I am surprised that some Members of Parliament - who I would not have expected to say this - are asking me to increase this ceiling."
"The Member States can give their own State aid."
"The richer Member States can already give it now."
"Regarding the funds, let me explain."
"The Member States use only 20% of our funding."
"Some Members of Parliament say to me that our funding is the problem because they cannot use it in the way they want; but we have flexibility; the Member States can reallocate their funding - every Member State can do this."
"Only Italy has asked us for a reallocation and we approved it."
"So why do you not try to persuade the Member States - the governments of your countries - to use the funds properly?"
"If we really want to help, and if there is a problem with absorption of the funding, I am here to facilitate it for everybody, but until now, no such effort has been made."
"To answer the questions in a very direct way: yes, the funding is there; yes, the Member States can use it; and, yes, the Member States can give from their own resources to this de minimis ceiling."
"So if I change the situation, the only result it will have is to distort fair competition between the Member States and between the small and bigger vessels."
"We have to understand this."
"Of course there is a problem in general and, referring to our reform, we can discuss what we can do to help our small-scale fisheries, in particular."
"We can also discuss every other proposal, but this proposal to increase the de minimis ceiling is one that cannot help."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at noon on Thursday, 12 May 2011."
"European fishers, and especially those who live in the Member States facing the greatest financial difficulties, like Portugal, are in a difficult economic situation which has been exacerbated by the rise in fuel prices."
"In order to tackle this situation, the Commission needs to adopt emergency measures to help fishers."
"To this end, the Commission should allow the subsidies that the Member States can award fishers to be increased temporarily, for three years, from EUR 30 000 to 60 000."
"Further to this, the European Fisheries Fund (EFF) should award grants to fishers, in particular, in order to make fishing techniques more selective and to replace engines, for reasons of safety, of environmental protection and/or of fuel efficiency."
"These measures should pay particular attention to small-scale and coastal fishing."
"Finally, it is crucial that there be regulation mechanisms to improve first-sale prices, and to promote the fair and appropriate distribution of added value along the fisheries sector value chain, in a way that acknowledges the prices paid to producers."
", in writing. - The current high oil prices have had a severe impact on operating costs of fishermen, even forcing some to stop work."
"Following the adoption of a motion this week, I am delighted that the Parliament calls on the Commission to introduce emergency measures, including raising the current ceiling for State aid from EUR 30 000 to EUR 60 000 per company for a transitional period of three years."
"Radio spectrum policy (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Gunnar Hökmark, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on radio spectrum policy - C7-0270/2010 -."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, this report is about making Europe number one, so it is quite appropriate that we are having this discussion here tonight."
"In 1950, when Schuman proposed the founding of this Union, it was about coal and steel; today, it is about information technology and knowledge that will be crucial for the future of Europe."
"I am happy to say that the report we are presenting here today has emerged from extremely good cooperation with the shadow rapporteurs, Ms Trautmann, Mr Rohde, Mr Chichester and Mr Lamberts, who have supported the proposal."
"I am very grateful for this because we are discussing today a proposal that can enable Europe to recover the lead in mobile telephony, mobile Internet and modern information technology."
"For me, the discussion about the various proposals in this report is about the choice of whether Europe is to be number one or number three."
"For me, the choice is simple."
"Sometimes, when we talk about the world's biggest economies, we talk about the US and China, all of us forgetting that the European Union is the biggest economy, although we do not have the biggest markets."
"It is up to us today to discuss whether we are going to take the steps that can make a change."
"If we are to do so, then, in order to secure the lead in area after area with regard to telecoms and the development of broadband, I want Europe to have the best broadband capacity and the highest speeds, because then we will be home to the development of all the new services that will be crucial to the modern economy and to our competitiveness."
"I want Europe to be home to the next generation of Googles, Yahoos, Apples and all other companies that are manifestations of both competitiveness and innovation."
"We can be that, but it is also possible that other economies like America, China, or India will take the lead, so we have a choice to make."
"In this report, I have proposed that we stick to the date of 2013 with regard to the 800 MHz band."
"In addition, I have proposed that we be more ambitious and say that the European Union should free up 1 200 MHz in the 1.5 GHz band and the 2.3 GHz band, and that we should also start the discussion about the 700 MHz band - because if we do not start it now, we will not have the opportunity to take decisions in the future - and we should use the 5 GHz band for common licence-free use for all short-distance mobile Internet communications."
"Here we have the proposal."
"I would like the strongest possible support from Parliament because then, we can discuss this with the Member States and raise with them the issue of whether they all want to be number one or whether they are happy to be number three."
"I think that choice is simple and I am looking forward to this debate and to the vote on Wednesday."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, this is a clear wake-up call and I think that this is really the language that Europe needs."
"I must say a word of thanks from my side, in particular, to the rapporteur, Mr Hökmark, for the hard work that he has done on the first radio spectrum policy programme."
"This is about information and technology and it is about making up your mind what position Europe should take: the far East, the far West, in between, there are a couple of important players in this game, but Europe can indeed be the number one."
"The programme is essential for a digital Europe and for the European economy and for our society as a whole."
"It is quite clear from this report that Parliament shares the Commission's view on the importance of a coordinated and effective spectrum policy to meet broadband targets."
"And indeed it is vital to maintain and improve Europe's economic and competitive position and to maximise its social and cultural impact by enabling innovative services for the benefit of citizens."
"And I would like to add the term 'cultural' impact, as this is quite important."
"If we are talking about the Internet, it is one of the main instruments to give more opportunities to the members of Europe's community to have the inside knowledge and inside view of cultural impact."
"What was rightly mentioned is that this is a moment of choice."
"It is not any more a question of nice words, but now is the moment of truth and now we have to take our responsibilities."
"You cannot get a number one position, which is indeed the leader's role, if you are not taking the choices that need to be taken."
"Talking about the cultural aspects, it is that cultural element that I want to emphasise first because I know that this has been a significant preoccupation of Members of your Parliament."
"By the way, I see a lot of synergies between the use of spectrum for the distribution of content and culture, especially talking about audiovisual media content and for wireless broadband."
"Digital television and wireless broadband can develop successfully in parallel and we should not forget that broadband Internet access also offers high cultural and social value."
"In addition, wireless is essential in areas currently deprived of such access."
"The proposal not only protects the existence, but also ensures the future development, of those valuable cultural and economic services which, by the way, produce rich media content and feed future data highways with attractive cultural offerings."
"Of course, remaining obstacles such as interference on air or on cable TV will have to be solved; there is no doubt about that."
"We are all aware that broadcasting knows no borders."
"European Union policies will need appropriate support in international negotiations and Member States may also need assistance to negotiate with neighbouring non-EU countries."
"Just through preparing the whole debate, I am, of course, already in contact with certain ministers in certain Member States that are even more confronted with the neighbouring country aspects."
"Turning to the content of the report, the Commission can support, sometimes subject to small modifications, almost all of Parliament's approach."
"The Commission particularly welcomes and agrees with the position taken in the report on a couple of issues."
"Firstly, the importance of spectrum for the Digital Agenda to provide all citizens with high broadband access."
"No doubt about that, we are completely on your side."
"Number two: keeping under review the possibilities for additional spectrum to meet the growing consumer demand for wireless broadband."
"Completely on your side and, even if your speed is perhaps a little bit higher, be assured that we are aware that that is the next step."
"Thirdly, confirming 2013 as the date to free the 800 MHz digital dividend band, while recognising the need for derogations until 2015."
"So 2013 is the goal, but with a possibility of derogations until 2015, in exceptional technical circumstances as well as further derogations due to coordination issues with third countries, which I was touching upon earlier."
"Fourthly, the coverage of other important Union policies beyond electronic communications: here, I am talking about the environment, transport or research and the need to make a substantial amount of spectrum available."
"Fifthly, the importance of an efficient inventory of spectrum use, which is an essential part of building an effective and forward-looking policy programme."
"Sixthly, the need to coordinate the promotion of EU policies at an international level and to support the Member States in their negotiations with non-EU countries."
"There are a number of other important issues where the report is supportive or reinforces the Commission proposal, and that is encouraging."
"On certain amendments, however, the Commission has to be a bit more nuanced."
"On restructuring, the presentation of principles and objectives should not reduce the visibility of the principle of efficient use of spectrum, which should apply to all sectors to the greatest extent possible."
"Another nuanced issue: while I understand the addition of the need to ensure sufficient spectrum for audiovisual services, that should not single out specific modes of delivery."
"Another nuance between the Commission and the rapporteur's report concerns competition."
"Reserving spectrum for new entrants may be an appropriate tool in certain cases, but with a view to avoiding unnecessary procedures; we would then be close to each other."
"Another issue again involving just a nuance: while the compensation of migration costs by Member States is a very important issue - no doubt about that - it must be in conformity with State aid rules."
"I think there is no difference between our points of view; it is something that has to be mentioned."
"The Commission has slight difficulties in accepting just two proposals."
"Number one: for spectrum already technically harmonised, an obligation to authorise its use by 2012 should not be replaced by the softer obligation to make such spectrum available."
"Existing positions already require this, and we need to move to effective licensing of the spectrum: going forward and not going backward."
"A second issue that is different and that we have difficulty in accepting concerns spectrum for broadband satellite access; the Commission wants to be able to actually ensure its availability."
"On both of those issues - to authorise and to ensure availability on both of those issues - there must be a solution to be found and I am certain that it could be found."
"Just a couple of remarks to conclude."
"Both Parliament and Commission recognise that an early adoption of the proposal is desirable, considering the importance of the work ahead to implement this programme."
"A clear statement is needed, the sooner the better."
"The Commission will do its best to support the process and I am absolutely confident that Parliament will engage in an early dialogue with the Council to reach a rapid and a successful conclusion."
"Time is running out."
"Time is not our friend in this and, at the end of the day, if we want to have a solution and if we are backing the number one position called for by Mr Hökmark, then we need to go as quickly as possible in that direction."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, political initiatives for developing fast Internet connections across the board are, in principle, to be welcomed."
"However, the spectrum is a scarce resource and, above all, it is a public good."
"It was therefore a particular concern of the Committee on Culture and Education that it be made clear that the spectrum is, and remains, essential for the fulfilment of a wide range of societal, cultural and social functions."
"For this reason, it was particularly important to us that the requirements of the telecoms package for safeguarding media pluralism and cultural diversity were not thrown out by the back door."
"Both public and private broadcasting are essential guarantors of media pluralism and diversity of opinion in Europe."
"We must ensure that they can continue to fulfil their vital functions unimpeded in future, too."
"The Committee on Culture and Education had therefore proposed that the 790 band not be opened in the first instance, but unfortunately, the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy did not follow our suggestion."
"Although it is mentioned in several places that the interests of broadcasting are to be taken into consideration, the Committee on Culture and Education would have liked there to have been much clearer wording in this regard."
"It was particularly important to us that, before spectrum allocation, clear regulations be laid down to prevent theatres and anyone using wireless microphones, for example, from being saddled with the cost of paying for a frequency change or for new technology."
"We are all called on to continue to ensure a fair balance of interests for all parties concerned."
"I hope that we will succeed in doing so in future, too."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to start by congratulating the rapporteur, our colleague, Mr Hökmark, because his work is excellent and, in addition to being excellent, it has great vision for the future, which I think makes it particularly valuable."
"However, please also allow me to thank, as he did, all the shadow rapporteurs."
"The result of all this work was the unanimous backing that this report received in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy."
"Of course, the report before us is guided by an objective, which is none other than a way of making the European economy more competitive in a global world."
"That is the key objective of this report and I therefore believe that it is extraordinarily appropriate."
"I am not going to go into the details, but I would like to focus on two or three aspects that I consider key."
"First of all, we are in a situation - and this report points this out - in which wireless broadband through the 800 MHz allocation for mobile communications across Europe will be a reality."
"However the report goes much further: it is thinking more about the future."
"We are talking about the 700 MHz frequency band, which also has an extraordinary capacity for mobile telephony and its development."
"I believe that is why we also have to view and evaluate the proposals made in the report very positively."
"It is not a trivial issue: the spectrum relating to economic activities currently represents 3% of European gross domestic product (GDP) and that is just the start."
"I should like to mention the importance of video's exponential growth as an element of communication between different people, and between different institutions and companies."
"Right now, video represents 40% of world traffic and that is only the start: by 2014, it will represent 91% of end-user traffic."
"As such, the report positions itself realistically in a vision of an extraordinary future, so I believe that we should give it our full support the day after tomorrow."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are going to give our verdict at first reading on the draft radio spectrum policy programme, and I should like to thank the Commission for having supported and transformed this proposal, which was first tabled during our debates on the telecoms package."
"I should also like to commend our rapporteur, Mr Hökmark, as well as my fellow shadow rapporteurs, for our good cooperation on a report which reveals some major political issues hidden behind its highly technical aspects."
"We have had numerous debates, which have really made me see that Parliament and the Commission do, quite naturally, share the same opinion and ambition."
"The opinion is that spectrum is a scarce resource that does not recognise borders."
"Everyone seems to agree on this point."
"However, it is on the solutions to be found to improve its management and on the general ambition that some differences can be observed, in particular with the Member States, which I do not deny have historically had a certain sovereign responsibility."
"Although not all the compromises tabled and adopted in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy are as balanced as I personally would have liked, I support very sincerely the general move to develop a spectrum management approach that is more integrated, realistic and responsive to the social, cultural and economic needs of our fellow citizens."
"This is a common thread in all the positions adopted by our Parliament, Commissioner, be it on the own-initiative report by my colleague, Mrs Toia, or on the proposals that I myself defended as one of the rapporteurs for the telecoms package."
"With regard to the radio spectrum policy programme, my group and I placed particular emphasis on several points in our amendments."
"They include, therefore, introducing transparency so as to learn how spectrum is currently allocated and managed - that is, the inventory principle - and also finding innovative and original solutions to the electronic communications sector's growing demand for use of frequencies."
"They need to be qualitative, not just quantitative, solutions."
"By emphasising spectral efficiency, we will remedy this situation without limiting the diversity of services available on the spectrum."
"In doing so, we are also using spectrum as a vehicle for bridging the digital divide and developing new services that are within the reach not only of large telecommunications companies but also of SMEs and start-ups, which will need them."
"I believe that this economic dimension is essential."
"To conclude, I should like to say a few words about the next stage."
"As you said yourself, it was clear from the start that a first-reading agreement was out of the question, but it is imperative that we reach an agreement by the end of the year."
"This is essential for our public services, for meeting consumers' expectations, and for developing the Internet regardless of the infrastructure in place."
"It is also essential for planning the economic recovery of our European Union thanks to this resource."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, better and less expensive data transmission through high-speed broadband for all in 2020: that is an ambitious policy target, I must say, and I fully support it."
"But let us face it: it will not come easily."
"Nevertheless, I believe that with the Parliament's first-reading position, we will be able to take a big first step towards this goal."
"And let us be clear: broadband for all is not only about making sure that everyone has a Facebook profile."
"It is about ensuring Europe's place in the world as a leading knowledge-based economy."
"If we manage to connect 500 million people, our citizens and businesses will be able to reap all of the benefits and opportunities of the digital economy."
"Two things, especially, need to change if Europe is to get there."
"Firstly, we need a well-functioning pro-competition telecommunications market at European level."
"That is why we have introduced rules on competition-proofing."
"Member States should not be allowed to allocate newly freed-up spectrum to a specific market player if that would diminish or distort competition in the market."
"Secondly, we need a more efficient allocation of spectrum: an allocation that also more actively reflects today's diverse demands and needs for spectrum."
"That is why we are gearing this policy programme not only to free up the 800 MHz band, but also to free up additional bands amounting to at least 1 200 MHz by 2015."
"Let me finish by thanking the Commission, the Commissioner, the rapporteur and my fellow shadows for their extraordinarily good cooperation; without it, this level of ambition would not have been possible."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Madam President, first of all, may I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Hökmark, on skilfully piloting this report through the committee and achieving a very broad measure of consensus."
"I join with the other shadow rapporteurs in thanking him for his work."
"I very much support his desire to legislate so as to see Europe meet the technological challenges in this sector and maintain a leading position in the world."
"This is cutting-edge technology, and it is very important."
"The key point is getting the right balance between the different interests involved - the incumbent broadcasters, the mobile operators, broadband provision and the official users, including the military and civil emergency services."
"I just want to sound the slight warning note that we must respect subsidiarity and national competences in this area and in this process."
"Legislating in this field of policy is particularly difficult because the technologies involved change and advance so rapidly and so much, which means that we are always playing catch-up rather than legislating ahead of the game."
"Nevertheless, I think we must act to clear the way for the new technology, for its exploitation and utilisation of spectrum, and I hope that this proposal and this report will do just that."
"Madam President, I should like to continue by responding to a number of things that have been said, and I will start with what Mrs Trautmann said."
"We were told - and it is true - that radio spectrum is a scarce resource."
"I should like, first of all, to stress that it is a shared asset."
"It is an asset of which no one can claim exclusive ownership."
"As far as we are concerned, then, no stakeholder, whoever he or she may be, can claim to have a kind of pre-emptive right, a kind of vested right, over spectrum, and I believe that this is something that is established in this report."
"Being both a shared and a rare asset, we need to have a good understanding, firstly, of how spectrum is used today, hence, this idea of a wide-ranging, comprehensive study on how spectrum is currently being used by all stakeholders, including those whom Mr Chichester just singled out, namely, civil protection services, for example, and even military services."
"It really is important to understand how this scarce resource is actually being used today, because we do not feel it is being used optimally - far from it."
"Secondly, we need to have a transparent process for allocating this scarce resource, but it must also be dynamic enough to prevent any idea of vested rights emerging again."
"I should also like us to pay attention to the principles of allocating and auctioning spectrum, because it is not necessarily used in every case for commercial purposes and, hence, to generate profit."
"I am, of course, thinking of the cultural dimension, which has been pointed out, but also of spectrum use for public service purposes - we should actually have a discussion about civil protection services - and indeed for military purposes."
"If we take a purely market-based approach, then we are clearly in danger of giving priority - or excessive rights in any case - to market players which we know are able to distort the market on account of their size; in other words, we know that small operators cannot always compete with them."
"Lastly, I should like to draw attention to the fact that the exponential use of the radio spectrum has public health implications, too."
"I know that this is not the subject of the report, but I believe that we will have to monitor this issue very closely because our fellow citizens are affected."
"(DE) Madam President, Mrs Kroes, the spectrum is a valuable and limited resource that must be managed with care and foresight, taking into account society as a whole."
"The radio spectrum policy programme is therefore of particular importance."
"The spectrum must be utilised efficiently, taking into account economic, social and cultural aspects."
"To this end, we must fully utilise the technical means available to us in all bands to achieve the greatest possible efficiency."
"The telecoms package adopted last year must form the basis of our radio spectrum policy because it also stipulates that the spectrum management of the EU and its Member States must take equal account of cultural, social and economic interests."
"This must be taken into consideration, in particular, in connection with the harmonisation of spectrum use in the EU."
"In this regard, I would like to point out that implementation of the first digital dividend in the Member States has so far been progressing at very different rates."
"Further opening of the UHF band, particularly below 800 MHz, should therefore only be considered after taking into account our experience with white spaces in this band."
"There are many technical and financial questions that are yet to be definitively resolved."
"In particular, the problem of interference and the question of cost offsetting for cultural facilities and local authorities in connection with technical retrofitting, with regard to radio microphones for example, have not yet been satisfactorily resolved."
"When allocating frequency bands, the various different interests must be weighed against each other in a responsible manner."
"On the one hand, provision of mobile broadband networks across the board is a basic requirement that is in the interests of European citizens, but, on the other hand, development in the area of public and private broadcasting must be taken into consideration as an important instrument for cultural diversity and the provision of information."
"We must set the correct course for technical development and for Europe's position in the area of digital information technology and cultural diversity."
"(ES) Madam President, Commissioner, we should certainly congratulate ourselves today on holding this debate."
"Too often, we have heard that spectrum planning and management is a technical issue that is the exclusive competence of the Member States."
"Today, thanks to Parliament's determination during the negotiation of the telecommunications package, conducted so magnificently by our fellow Member, Mrs Trautmann, this discussion on spectrum is taking place where it should be: in the political sphere of the European Union."
"The fact that it is a scarce public resource and its cross-border scale make our intervention as EU legislators worthwhile, but we should not couch this process as a confrontation between the various uses that we could assign frequency bands."
"Incessant technological progress means that we are increasingly able to transmit more data using less of the spectrum and with less interference."
"Our goal must be to establish the bases of dynamic planning that uses technological progress to enable the various groups of users to be made more compatible, thereby obtaining greater economic and social output from this valuable resource."
"We do not want there to be winners or losers from this process, but rather operators committed to a process of continuously improving spectrum use and allocation, and for it to be oriented, above all, toward the public's social and economic development."
"(FR) Madam President, Mrs Kroes, Mr Hökmark, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating my friend, Mr Hökmark, on his excellent report and on the spirit of openness that he has shown throughout these debates."
"This draft report broadly supports the European Commission's proposal, in particular, on the need to make available, by 1 January 2013, the 800 MHz band freed up by the changeover to digital television and the complete cessation of analogue television broadcasting."
"As a result of the digitisation of terrestrial television broadcasting, a large number of frequencies, referred to as digital dividends, are being made available."
"The qualities that these frequencies possess in terms of coverage and penetration of buildings are universally recognised: they are called golden frequencies."
"It is in this context that the European Commission is proposing a first programme to develop an approach, for the years 2011-2015, to the strategic radio spectrum issues facing the European Union."
"Nevertheless, I would like to highlight two aspects that I feel are important, Mrs Kroes, Mr Hökmark."
"Firstly, I believe that we should create the inventory proposed in Article 8; it is preferable to rely on a precise, expertly prepared inventory so as to identify new bands before explicitly mentioning harmonised frequency bands."
"If the aim of finding more frequencies for wireless broadband communications is to be pursued and encouraged, it would seem appropriate to proceed on the basis of this inventory - without anticipating the result - by selecting, without any prior technical expertise, one or more specific frequency bands."
"The final point that I should like to discuss concerns the use of frequency bands that are currently used for military purposes."
"The Commission certainly has no authority to explore the scope for sharing spectrum with military uses."
"I am therefore opposed to the amendment to Article 7(3), which deals with the radio frequency needs of specific EU policies and which proposes using civil frequencies for military purposes."
"(RO) Madam President, the decision being debated today marks the launch of the first European radio spectrum policy programme."
"Its aim is strategic planning and harmonisation of the use of radio spectrum to ensure the functioning of the internal market."
"In practical terms, the programme will facilitate spectrum availability, maximise the flexibility and increase the efficiency of its use based on general authorisations, avoid distortion of competition and avoid harmful interference and disturbance, as well as harmonise technical conditions and protect health."
"In keeping with the decision, the Commission, together with Member States, will produce an inventory of existing spectrum use and of possible future spectrum requirements in the Union, in particular, in the range from 300 MHz to 3 GHz."
"We used the amendments tabled to request a bridging of the digital divide so that all EU citizens have access to the broadband communications infrastructure at no less than 30 Mbps by 2020, and that opportunities are secured for both the commercial sector and public services by means of increased broadband capacities."
"We have also asked to ensure that new consumer devices and technologies are accessible so as to secure consumer endorsement for the transition to digital technology and efficient use of the digital dividend."
"I welcome the importance attached to ensuring that the required radio spectrum is available for monitoring the atmosphere and the Earth's surface."
"This enables space applications to be developed and utilised and transport systems to be improved, especially for the Galileo and GMS systems, as well as for smart safety and management systems for the transport sector."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that one point that we all agree on and have established is that this programme for frequency harmonisation and coordinated spectrum use can serve a dual purpose."
"I believe that this is a key point to be remembered at all times; in other words, through the programme, we can develop the great potential for economic exploitation of this field by the telecommunications sector, the audiovisual sector and new services, while, at the same time, giving a boost to economic development and to other sectors linked to the telecommunications sector."
"We can also develop the potential for cultural and social development that this dual purpose permits and requires."
"Commissioner, in my opinion this programme should also be seen as an opportunity, so that we respect and uphold certain fundamental principles through the choices we make."
"Firstly, the principle of media pluralism."
"The review of the system for managing radio frequencies at European level is very important, and I believe that we must clearly prevent the accumulation of frequency rights and the creation of monopolies and oligopolies, which unfortunately exist in some European countries and which are becoming stronger and gaining a foothold in the broadcasting sector."
"Secondly, the principle of balance between the liberalisation and opening up of the market to new operators, and fairness, so that the commitments entered into with those operators who have provided substantial investment can also be promoted, supported and maintained on the market."
"Lastly, transparency and the guarantee of well-managed and well-administered frequency allocations."
"We are talking about auctions not only to focus on an aspect of the market that should be reconciled with all the possible social uses for spectrum, but also to say that discretion should not be used and unfair advantages should not be given with regard to radio frequencies."
"This point also deserves close attention."
"To conclude, unfortunately I do not have the time to expand on the social aspects, but they have been discussed at great length by all the members of my group."
"(NL) Madam President, Mrs Kroes, today we are celebrating Europe Day."
"Europe is eagerly looking for particular things which matter to our citizens and which also bring with them prosperity and well-being to the European community."
"This topic, this report by Mr Hökmark, fits that brief perfectly."
"It is specific and it puts us more in the picture about the social and the economic dimensions."
"Public airways, which are in short supply, will be freed up and that is badly needed if we are to meet the demand for ever more and ever faster wireless Internet connections."
"Good coordination at European level is an obvious requirement in this respect."
"In 2013, 800 MHz will be freed up, in 2015, 1 200 MHz, and that is badly needed if Europe wants to remain amongst the global frontrunners."
"These services have a huge financial value: EUR 200 million annually, which is to say, that around 3 to 4% of economic growth depends on there being enough spectrum."
"And that percentage is only going to keep growing."
"Just look, for example, at the GSM standard which we jointly brought about in the 1990s; that, too, was the right move at the right time."
"Let me tell you, those advantages of scale are clocking up."
"Every year, they can make a difference of EUR 80 billion."
"The Netherlands, my native country, which I and the other Dutch MEPs have a mandate to represent here, is ready for it; we have already freed up space for the fourth generation mobile Internet."
"In a nutshell, both the problems faced by auxiliary services, TV stations, public service broadcasters and the continuing problems concerning interferences that could arise, that is, problems with local microphones, will be a thing of the past."
"I therefore sincerely hope that, on the basis of this excellent and promising report, we will be able to reach agreement with the Commission as early as the first reading."
"Good luck with it!"
"(DE) Madam President, firstly, I would like to apologise for the fact that Members are currently leaving the Chamber."
"However, a vote is taking place in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy at the same time as this debate and we have not yet invented a way of dividing people in two."
"Mr Hökmark has found a good compromise here."
"However, with regard to this matter, we must always take into account the performance level that we want to see in the future, on the one hand, for the first generation network and, on the other, for the cable operators and everyone else with an interest in the spectrum, particularly the blue light organisations."
"This performance level must be defined."
"The most important aspect with regard to this data is the quantity of data."
"The next most important aspect is the time it takes for it to be transmitted, the strength with which it is transmitted in order also to enable coexistence here, and, finally, the priorities that are established by means of the software."
"For the future, we need a detailed report in this regard in order to significantly increase the speed of the GSM first generation network."
"Cable network operators already achieve very high speeds of up to 100 megabits/s, which is very respectable and can be increased further in future."
"However, we have major problems when it comes to the price level, particularly with regard to data roaming."
"In some Member States, it is currently possible to buy one gigabyte for less than EUR 1."
"I have just looked at my mobile phone to see how much it costs me."
"At home, one gigabyte costs me EUR 1."
"When I am here, one gigabyte costs me EUR 9 900, and when I travel to another Member State, it can cost EUR 14 900."
"We urgently need to take action in this regard."
"I would ask you, Commissioner, to ensure that this decision takes account not only of performance range and performance level, but that, above all, we also establish a common European market with regard to price level that enables people to use data services even when they are not in their own Member State."
"We have urgent priorities to address in this regard."
"(DE) Madam President, Europe will only be able to defend its leading role as the largest economic area in the world if it takes the lead in the development and use of new technologies."
"Broadband technology is undoubtedly an important part of this."
"Our new radio spectrum policy must ensure large transmission capacities and high transmission speeds."
"Overarching frequency planning and management at European level is, without doubt, less appropriate for achieving this goal, as the Commission itself also stresses that this can be carried out well and efficiently in the individual Member States."
"A coordinating role would certainly be desirable, however."
"Despite the high costs, the provision of optical fibre networks should, in my opinion, be encouraged."
"The European Union is currently lagging behind its competitors, the United States and China."
"That is probably a consequence of irresolute policy and too much bureaucracy."
"I therefore agree with the rapporteur, Mr Hökmark, that we absolutely must stick to the timetable that has been set for freeing up the spectrum."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, I would like to thank all those who were involved in this fascinating debate, for, although the issue may seem to be a very technical one, at the end of the day, it is a mainstream issue because radio spectrum is like water or fresh air."
"It is, as Catherine Trautmann has said, a scarce good, it is a public good, and it is also an essential good."
"The rapporteur and his shadows have succeeded in making the issue quite clear, and simply putting before us what has to be done to achieve a positive outcome."
"Of course, this is a democracy: we are debating the issue and it is an attractive debate."
"Not so long ago, however, we discussed the Digital Agenda; we all agree on the Digital Agenda; and this issue is a major one for the Digital Agenda."
"For if we do not assume our responsibility and take a clear line, then we can forget what was said earlier by Ms Toia: we need to be aware that in 2020 - and we set this out in the Digital Agenda - every European should be able to pursue his or her interests via what are ultimately spectrum opportunities."
"We have also talked about creating digital opportunities for every European by 2013."
"If that is what we have in mind, then we need to be consistent and we need to be in a position to assume the consequences of being consistent."
"I would like to thank all those Members who have spoken in clear language, stating priorities while, at the end of the day, agreeing on exactly what we have to do in a strategic approach to regulation with regard to the management of radio spectrum."
"There are still hurdles to be overcome, no doubt about that."
"Given what is at stake, however, I am confident those hurdles will be taken successfully."
"We fully respect the use of spectrum for broadcasting and cultural activities: let there be no misunderstanding on that."
"We will tackle that point if there is still any hesitation to be overcome."
"With regard to additional spectrum for broadband and the second digital dividend, I think everybody is aware that sooner or later - and most of the Members of Parliament will probably think sooner - we will have to tackle that point, too."
"This is a win-win situation, and in freeing the 800 MHz band, we took the option which affected the least amount of spectrum, so we can see that as step one on our journey."
"To look backwards for a moment: who could have imagined 15 years ago what is at stake today?"
"Had we waited 15 years ago, and hesitated in taking decisions as politicians, we would have failed."
"In that event, what we would be discussing now is not whether we want the number one position or the number three position, but whether we want to avoid the last position."
"Spectrum is a national competence: I am aware of that."
"The Commission agrees, and the inventory is a matter for the Member States."
"However, we all agree that spectrum is a very valuable resource and we need to recognise that talking about a digital single market also gives us the opportunity and the responsibility to think along cross-border lines - and, if there is one area in which we ought to think cross-border, it is spectrum policy."
"With regard to deadlines and what has been and is at stake, it is clear, to me at least, that 2013 is not too early."
"We should also be aware that derogations are proposed for two types of situation: in the case of difficulties with neighbouring countries and in the case of circumstances that no one could have foreseen."
"I believe, however, that we have to take the line that time is not on our side and that derogations should not be misused."
"All in all, I am looking forward to discussions with the Council members, I am looking forward to the result of your voting and I am looking with confidence to the future, in the hope that one of the pillars we have talked about will be finalised before the end of the year."
"I should like to conclude by thanking, once again, not only the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs, but also the members of the various committees involved, for their constructive and very positive efforts."
"rapporteur. - Madam President, I think we need to be aware that we are talking about a part of society which is developing extremely rapidly."
"The pace of change has been, and will continue to be, extremely rapid."
"We are really talking about how we want things to be in the year 2020."
"That is why it is important to make the point that, in discussing the 700 MHz band, we are not saying anything more than that we shall have the opportunity to take decisions later on the best way of using it."
"As has been said, spectrum is a scarce resource, but it is also a public good, and we have the responsibility to use it as well and as efficiently as possible - a point that Ms Trautmann also made."
"I would also like to emphasise that there is no conflict between cultural and commercial use."
"I want us to have ambitions of a kind that will enable us to bring culture into this new technology, rather than reserving the technology for commercial use, which will be the outcome if we are not sufficiently ambitious."
"In that case, culture will be left behind, and I do not think that culture in Europe will have the best opportunities if it is closed into the old technologies."
"I believe it is possible not only to secure broadcasting as of today but also to create new opportunities for a new time."
"However, we need to be able to take decisions."
"I must say - without irony and with a high level of satisfaction - that no one here tonight has questioned the fact that we need to be number one."
"In the global world of competition and knowledge, the only way to win is to be number one, and that should be our aim."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday, 11 May 2011."
"Emergency autonomous trade preferences for Pakistan (debate)"
"Τhe next item is the report by Vital Moreira, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council introducing emergency autonomous trade preferences for Pakistan - C7-0322/2010 -."
"Madam President, this report was, in fact, not written by me."
"I am an accidental rapporteur, who came in at the last minute because the original rapporteur stopped working on this report."
"Therefore, as chair of the committee, I took over, in line with the Rules of Procedure."
"As well as being an accidental rapporteur, I am also a reluctant one because, in truth, I did not vote for this report and have deep objections to its content."
"Nevertheless, things are as they are and it falls to me to gallantly accept the duties I have been given."
"As we know, this report on the exceptional trade preferences conceded to Pakistan originated with a European Council decision, which mandated the Commission to make a proposal to Parliament and to the Council."
"As these are exceptional preferences that are not compatible with the positive or negative non-discrimination rule of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), it is necessary to obtain a WTO waiver before awarding these trade preferences."
"Despite everything, the Commission tabled the proposal before Parliament and the Committee on International Trade, which I chair, decided to go ahead with the debate and vote on this report, of which I am the accidental rapporteur."
"It is the result of this vote which we are bringing to the Chamber."
"The issue, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, has proved rather contentious in Parliament's Committee on International Trade, as regards whether - and this was the pretext for this Commission proposal - we should use trade preferences as a means of emergency aid to a given country; as regards the duration and extension of those trade preferences; and, finally, as regards what conditions would be imposed on the beneficiary, Pakistan in this instance."
"Although a majority in the committee voted for the Commission proposal to award Pakistan these exceptional preferences, in fact, the Committee on International Trade also voted for several amendments aimed at limiting the impact of these trade advantages awarded to Pakistan, including, inter alia, the adoption of a safeguard clause, in case imports from Pakistan increase too much because of the reduction or removal of trade tariffs."
"Other amendments relate to, for example, requirements that Pakistan not create or abolish the restrictions it has on exporting commodities."
"In conclusion, it is important to take into account that our efforts here could turn out to be completely in vain if the WTO waiver is not obtained; we do not presently know when, or if, it will end up being granted."
"In any case, even if our efforts turn out to be in vain, it will, at least, be an excellent opportunity to debate how sensible it is to use exceptional trade advantages as a means of emergency aid - or, as in this case, as a means of political repayment for a given country - and what limits such usage has."
"We therefore run the risk of setting dangerous precedents or, worse still, of making political use of trade preferences that should perhaps follow criteria that are rather more objective, and rather less discretionary and contextual than in this case."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, today we are discussing a legislative proposal for emergency autonomous trade preferences for Pakistan."
"This proposal was tabled by the Commission at the express request of the European Council in the immediate aftermath of the floods that hit Pakistan in the summer of last year and brought widespread devastation to the country and to its people."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur and the Committee on International Trade for their hard work and their support for the proposal."
"The Commission proposal aims at the introduction of a unilateral and temporary suspension of import duties on 75 export items from Pakistan. These trade preferences would liberalise about a quarter of Pakistani imports to the EU and be available for two years, with a possible extension for another year."
"The European Union is aware that such trade concessions, especially in sensitive sectors such as textiles, might have an impact on EU industry, and therefore we have ensured that a balance is kept between the needs of Pakistan and the interests of our own industry and other supplier countries."
"The number of products selected is limited."
"We have set a ceiling on the liberalisation of very sensitive items, and liberalisation would only be of limited duration."
"In the meantime, we have also requested the World Trade Organisation to grant us a waiver of the applicable WTO rules to enable us to implement the proposed measures."
"As you know, we are still discussing this issue with other WTO members and hope to come to a solution soon."
"The images of people having lost their livelihoods might not be present any more in everyone's mind, but we should not forget the immense cost of those devastating floods, both in terms of humanitarian needs and economic devastation."
"These trade measures are not 'stand-alone', and come on top of the significant humanitarian and development assistance - amounting to EUR 480 million - that the EU has granted to Pakistan."
"However, ambitious trade measures are essential for the sustained economic recovery of Pakistan's economy and should be part of our medium-term response to those unprecedented natural disasters."
"I therefore hope that Parliament will support the proposal."
"Let me now turn to some of the amendments that have been proposed."
"I will not go into detail on all of them, but let me highlight the most important ones."
"I know that there are requests for making the granting of autonomous trade preferences conditional upon Pakistan respecting certain fundamental principles."
"I understand the concerns that may exist in that respect, and you are aware that human rights issues are an integral element of our long-term relationship with Pakistan."
"However, given the temporary nature of the waiver to address an emergency situation, the Commission believes those conditionalities would not be appropriate."
"Our human rights dialogue, in the context of our Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with Pakistan, is the appropriate forum to address such issues with Pakistan and reach sustainable solutions."
"As regards provisions that would oblige Pakistan to abstain from maintaining, introducing or increasing duties or charges having equivalent effect, or any other restriction on the export or import of certain products, I believe that such conditions would seriously undermine the granting of the preferences and are contrary to the spirit, the nature and the purpose of our regulation."
"Moreover, we cannot prohibit Pakistan, through this regulation, from implementing measures that are consistent with its international obligations."
"On the other hand, we could agree to the introduction of a mechanism allowing the imposition of limits to duty-free imports for Pakistan tariff rate quotas where volumes of imports of products liberalised increase beyond certain levels."
"I also agree that preferences should be removed for any product causing or threatening to cause serious difficulties to a Union producer of like or directly competing products, as determined by an investigation carried out by the Commission."
"We could also agree with mechanisms to establish customs surveillance on imports covered by the regulation, linked with quarterly reporting."
"However, a prior surveillance mechanism would create an undue burden in terms of administrations' licensing requirements."
"I note, finally, that there are requests to limit the duration of the trade preferences to one year from the date on which the waiver takes effect."
"I think that would be very problematic."
"The Commission initially proposed applying exceptional measures for a period of three years."
"In its compromise proposal, which was reflected in the WTO waiver request, the Council limited the duration to two years, with the possibility of extending it by one more year."
"However, to limit the duration even further to one year would erode the advantages of the autonomous trade preferences measure, and they would become meaningless."
"Let me also point out that a compromise reached in the Council on 10 November was based on subjecting seven textile and clothing products to tariff rate quotas rather than full liberalisation."
"This compromise became the basis for the subsequent request for a WTO waiver."
"However, this is not reflected in the European Parliament amendments, and as a result of the consultation with WTO members, it might be necessary to subject a few more products to tariff rate quotas."
"The waiver, if granted, would constitute a maximum of preferences the EU could grant to Pakistan on those terms and, as a consequence, the regulation will have to reflect the content of the WTO waiver once it is agreed in the WTO."
"Let me also reassure you that the Commission will conduct an annual impact assessment on the autonomous trade preferences granted to Pakistan and present it to Parliament and the Council, and that is another reason not to reduce the duration of application of this instrument."
"I thank the European Parliament for its cooperation on this sensitive issue."
"The Commission stands ready to work closely with Parliament in order to have this proposal adopted and show the EU's determination to act responsibly towards countries in need."
"Mr President, I believe that it is an appropriate time for us to discuss this report from Mr Moreira."
"Why?"
"The reason is because we are currently awaiting a decision on the waiver requested by the European Union from the World Trade Organisation on the topic actually being discussed."
"My personal view is that it is important, in this context, for us to convey a clear message to the European Union's other trade partners."
"The Union must continue to be determined to supplement the emergency humanitarian aid which it generously granted to Pakistan during an initial phase with trade measures aimed at bringing about the Pakistani economy's sustainable recovery."
"Diplomatic consultations with the World Trade Organisation definitely require time because the concerns of the Union's trade partners must be taken into account."
"The outcome of these consultations is currently uncertain."
"However, as the recent events remind us, it is clear that we need a stable, prosperous Pakistan, which will not go down the slippery slope of extremism and will be able to act as a partner in the anti-terror effort."
"As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, I would like to thank my fellow Members in the Committee on International Trade for adopting the main points which we developed in our opinion."
"I want to highlight two of these points here."
"The first one, which is perhaps the most important for the Committee on Foreign Affairs and was also mentioned by the Commissioner, is the requirement not to decouple human rights conditionality, including respect for the basic standards of the right to work, from granting trade preferences."
"I believe that we have a difference of opinion on this point."
"As human rights are a key aspect of the agreement binding the EU and Pakistan, the autonomous trade preferences proposed must be dependent upon respect for human rights in this country."
"On the other hand, a prior full assessment of the impact of the measures proposed has not been conducted by the Commission."
"I think that it would have had a major impact, in particular, on Pakistan's population and this country's budget resources."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, almost nine months after the disastrous floods, the situation in Pakistan is still bad and the people of Pakistan need our help."
"It was therefore right and proper for the European Union to take action and to very quickly put together a multi-million euro aid package, and it is important that this aid actually reaches the local community."
"Right from the start, I was not particularly happy about the Commission's proposal, under pressure from the Council, to use foreign trade instruments of all things in order to provide short-term aid for Pakistan."
"I brought this up several times in committee and asked in particular for the person responsible for foreign policy in the European Union, namely our High Representative, to also come to the committee or to Parliament in order to explain why foreign trade should have to be used to pay for this, to present to us in detail the overall strategy of the European Commission and put this in a common context and, in so doing, perhaps convince us that it really does make sense - I will say this again - to allow foreign trade to make a short-term contribution in this regard."
"I am very grateful that Mr David and others have succeeded in putting together a package that received the support of a broad majority in committee."
"In this regard, I would particularly like to emphasise the time limitation that we would like to see."
"This is the only solution that enables us to avoid the misdirection of funds."
"However, what is the situation in Pakistan at the moment?"
"Although Bin Laden is out of the equation, the question that has arisen in recent days as to the extent to which representatives of the Pakistani Government were aware of who was hiding in their country remains."
"Many fellow Members, including some in my group, are not happy about this."
"Moreover, we do not yet know how the other countries within the WTO will act and whether they will ultimately give their consent."
"It would therefore be good, when we vote on the amendments tomorrow, if we do not carry out a final vote, but rather refer the matter back to committee so that we can see what comes out of the WTO talks and whether it does actually make sense for us ultimately to give our consent to this package."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, quite honestly, we do not understand why the majority of the Committee on International Trade were so adamant in wanting to put this matter forward for debate, only to then ask for it to be referred back to committee, a request that we reject."
"Both decisions are wrong; however, because of the time constraints, among other reasons, I intend to focus solely on the issue of merit, but only after voicing my full support for Mr Moreira's speech."
"In this complicated world in which natural and man-made disasters are occurring all the time and in large numbers, we would be setting a dangerous precedent if we were to turn every humanitarian emergency into a review of trade policy."
"That is a slippery slope that could result in serious imbalances and, hence, unfair treatment of the poorest countries."
"Yet it is only through balanced, permanent and objective rules that those countries can reap the benefits of trade policy, which must not replace development cooperation."
"We know that any aid earmarked for Pakistan would not be used to help the people hit by the floods almost a year ago."
"We know with just as much certainty that it will be the European textile sector that mainly, if not exclusively, pays the price for this humanitarian aid."
"We cannot accept this unfair departure from trade policy rules because we are aware of the need to consider other factors, too, in our discussions."
"We all know that, as well as showing solidarity with Pakistan's flood-hit populations, another fundamental reason for granting aid lies in the decision to support Pakistan's counterterrorism efforts."
"The grey areas that have emerged in recent days between the Pakistani authorities and al-Qaeda, and the Bin Laden affair itself, show how unreliable that country is."
"I believe that we must focus attention on this, just as we must focus attention on the major human rights issues that have emerged lately."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is something wrong about holding a debate in May 2011 on a natural disaster that occurred in summer 2010, a disaster that left 12 million people homeless and destroyed 20% of the country concerned."
"I do not support the socialist position, which was expressed by Mr Susta just now."
"It is partly due to this hesitation that we are still racking our brains trying to work out which instruments we can adopt in order to actively help Pakistan, and on top of our frustration at not having achieved that yet, we are also conscious that we need a trade policy approach that is more mature in political and humanitarian terms: trade policy must become one of the instruments for helping populations in difficulty."
"I admit that the Commission has acted swiftly and effectively by proposing a package of measures, which obviously needed to be discussed and rebalanced so that they did not penalise a European sector that has already been tested by the crisis."
"It is thanks to the work done by the Committee on International Trade, including that contained in certain amendments - among which the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe supports Amendment 37 - that businesses, too, can request application of the safeguard clause."
"However, it seems that these are bad times for Pakistan and that too many people are failing to face up to their responsibilities."
"We are asking India to change its attitude and to soften its 'no' stance at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) as a tangible sign of good-neighbourly relations."
"True, relations are difficult between those two countries, since there was also the Mumbai attack and Pakistan's poor cooperation in identifying and capturing the perpetrators of the attack."
"Yet that affair could be something that breaks the bad habits of a bad relationship between neighbours."
"We are also asking the Pakistani authorities for something, namely, to be more determined to consider this issue from a bilateral point of view in their relations with India."
"Bilateral meetings have recently taken place, though little has come of them, perhaps due to a pride issue on the Pakistanis' part."
"It is clear that cricket diplomacy, emphasised by Pakistan's Members of Parliament, whom we met just two weeks ago, has so far failed to produce meaningful results."
"Lastly, it is the WTO, above all, that we are asking - as we did in Geneva during the recent Interparliamentary Assembly - quickly to adopt mechanisms that will enable international trade rules to respond swiftly and flexibly to emergencies in a country hit by unforeseen disasters."
"This tariff reduction affair may end up achieving nothing, or it could open a new era in trade relations."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, this was the worst natural disaster ever to hit Pakistan."
"We, I am proud to say, reacted fast."
"Commissioner Georgieva was on the scene, and, when I met with Prime Minister Syed Yousaf Raza Gillani, I was certainly able to discuss the EU's response with him."
"One thing was absolutely clear."
"We needed to think outside the box."
"We needed to come up with a new solution to provide help."
"Not only aid but trade was the answer, as a short-term measure to assist."
"I am pleased that the committee has approved the report, after much deliberation, and I know, through colleagues from right across the committee, the painstaking work that was done to try and come forward with something that was acceptable."
"But I am afraid some of the amendments to which the Commission has already made reference take away from the spirit of our initial intentions and the initial way in which we reacted."
"At WTO level, objections have been registered to our EU proposal."
"On the one hand, India says that this should not be a part of the EU-India FTA."
"I agree."
"There should not be a link."
"That is the right approach."
"But at the same time, it is asking for relaxation in trade directly from Pakistan."
"There is a contradiction in its approach."
"I ask them to reconsider."
"I believe this House should reaffirm the Commission position."
"We have the guarantee of annual impact assessments."
"I hear what colleagues say about their security concerns, but I stand here as somebody who narrowly survived the Mumbai attacks and I say to those colleagues: this is not the time to turn your back on Pakistan."
"The credibility of the EU is at stake."
"Give the Commission proposal your support."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, I, like many others in this House, share the concern for, and the sympathy with, the people affected by the terrible floods in Pakistan."
"I did so at the time and I do now."
"However, when I look at how the political will has been lacking, how the corporate interests have interfered and how the WTO has procrastinated, what I see before us are recommendations that dilute the original proposals put forward at such short notice by the Commission."
"Mention has already been made of the short timescale for the trade preference relaxation, reduced from three years to one year: Pakistan is prevented from maintaining or increasing duties or charges within that time."
"Moreover, it is proposed to seek not only an annual report on a one-year programme but also quarterly reports on the application and implementation of the measures."
"This adds up to a huge bureaucracy being created, only to come to an end within one year."
"So I have a great deal of sympathy with the proposal, which is Amendment 43, to send this back to the committee so that we can come up with something which will actually deliver the help we want to give to Pakistan."
"Finally, I think this really does point to the acute need to look at how the WTO works and to transform it into a properly democratic body whose proceedings are transparent and whose members are accountable."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is now almost a year since the people of Pakistan suffered devastating floods."
"We all have very close ties with the people of this stricken country."
"What is scandalous, however, is the fact that the negotiations in the WTO are still dragging on, and that alone makes it clear that this form of trade facilitation is not suitable to be used as an emergency aid measure."
"My group has repeatedly called on the Commission to put forward a plan B in order to be able to help the people of Pakistan quickly and permanently to rebuild their country."
"No alternative solution has been presented, however."
"Perhaps the Commission simply lacks ideas or is unable to act because it feels obstructed by resistance in the European Council, which it is only too familiar with."
"Otherwise, it would seem as if the difficult negotiations in the WTO are being used as an excuse for the lack of action."
"You knew as well as we did that these negotiations would be difficult before they even started and you probably also already knew this when some of the foreign ministers from Germany and other Member States sent you on this mission."
"After all, the facilitation of trade in the area of textiles, leather and ethanol that you now want to offer to Pakistan would undermine the GSP+ (Generalised System of Preferences+) status that countries like Bangladesh have attained, and indeed, in contrast to Pakistan, they have attained it through ratification of important UN and ILO conventions for the rights of workers and environmental protection."
"It is precisely this status advantage that enables Bangladesh to import primary products from Pakistan, to process them and then export them to Europe."
"It is no wonder that this country is now putting up resistance."
"However, we cannot in all honesty expect approval for our desire to help Pakistan at the expense of one of the poorest countries in the world."
"By doing so, we will ultimately damage ourselves, too, and indeed we will be doing this on the eve of the presentation of the new Commission draft on the revision of our system of trade preferences."
"My solution to this problem is therefore as follows: place the focus on direct aid for the reconstruction following the floods and take immediate action instead of losing in the negotiations in Geneva."
"After all, with every day that we fail to provide aid, we as Europeans are losing the trust of Pakistan in particular and we will ultimately pay a high political price for this."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I consider this report to be completely unacceptable."
"I am aware of the tragic floods that struck Pakistan last year and I think it is right to help that country."
"I understand that the European Union has already made around EUR 500 million available, which I do not consider to be a trifling sum."
"These new concessions are absurd, since they are concentrated in a sector - textiles - which is a dominant sector in Pakistan but which in Europe, on the other hand, has been destroyed precisely as a result of unfair competition from Asian countries."
"Do we want to deliver the final blow to the European textiles sector?"
"That is certainly not what the Lega Nord want, nor do we intend to accept it."
"The issue of whether to grant these waivers, should Parliament approve them, will subsequently have to be examined by the World Trade Organisation."
"It appears that some states - including the aforementioned India, Pakistan's long-time enemy - are willing to give their consent, not free of charge, of course, but in exchange for similar favourable conditions being granted by the European Union, which is inclined to welcome such requests."
"I have the impression that EU trade policy is dictated by the worst possible kind of self-destructive behaviour, and I therefore hope that this measure will be rejected outright."
"(DE) Mr President, in north-west Pakistan, what had not already been destroyed in some regions by war and terrorism was swept away by the floods in 2010."
"In addition to the commitment of EUR 415 million in emergency aid, the EU now wants to lift duties on a number of products."
"Pakistan will now soon attain the long-wished for status of a developing country with special tariff preferences."
"However, the EU should not be under any illusions that granting trade preferences could put an end to the advance of fundamental Islamists and terrorists in the nuclear state of Pakistan."
"The United States has failed to do this despite billions being provided in military aid."
"The West has therefore paid dearly for the loyalty of a small and, moreover, diminishing part of the political leadership in Pakistan."
"The elimination of Bin Laden by the United States has also raised a number of difficult questions."
"Even if Pakistan was aware of the whereabouts of the al-Qaeda leader, who was the subject of an international arrest warrant, and therefore would have been called on to extradite him, it does not change the fact that the targeted killing was a violation of Pakistan's sovereignty."
"The West must not throw its own principles, such as the rule of law, overboard."
"Terrorists, dictators and mass murderers must be brought before a court and not eliminated by means of targeted killings."
"(PT) Mr President, firstly, I should like, in particular, to congratulate our colleague from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), Mr David, on his work."
"I am representing him here today because it is absolutely impossible for him to be present in the Chamber."
"I also want to say that we have always considered support for flood victims in Pakistan an ethical and moral imperative."
"For this reason, we have strongly supported all the traditional humanitarian aid measures that have been taken."
"We really believe work towards helping stabilise the situation of so many millions of affected people must continue."
"What we cannot accept is that European Union trade policy should now be considered a suitable and appropriate instrument for humanitarian aid."
"The truth is that this will have two harmful consequences: one within the European Union, especially for the southern countries, and for their textile and clothing industries, which are now seriously weakened because of an economic, social and financial crisis unparalleled since they joined the Union; and, secondly, at international level, during World Trade Organisation (WTO) negotiations, where this opening of the largest trade bloc in the world - the European Union - to these potential exports from Pakistan could completely unbalance the negotiations."
"It is not by chance that they are at the impasse they have reached."
"Faced with a situation like this, therefore, it is only natural that we have to say, regarding the history of the eight months of difficult negotiations - in which we have taken part and offered the most constructive proposals - on this regulation, that the only position we will now be able to take is, unfortunately, in support of the amendment that, ultimately, envisages the end of this proposal for a regulation as we know it."
"We have to do so now, not because of a lack of solidarity with Pakistan, but because we believe humanitarian aid should be given in the proper place and in the proper way."
"(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, dealing with this European Parliament report has been complicated, mainly because it has involved measures requiring approval from the World Trade Organisation (WTO), so the preliminary draft that the Commission sent to Parliament is different to that sent to Geneva."
"We think it is necessary to help Pakistan."
"We believe that, exceptionally, trade preferences can be conceded, provided that they take into account the sensitivity of European industry and, in particular, of the textile industry, which is suffering badly from the consequences of the crisis in regions like the Community of Valencia in Spain."
"However, this report has enabled us to verify that measures that can be taken within the framework of international trade probably cannot be dealt with as urgently as these acts require, so we should learn for the future."
"Let us help Pakistan, yes; not, however, with the Commission's original proposal, as it does not take into account the effects on European industry as regards implementation deadlines for sensitive products, and would even delay the implementation of these measures because it is not the same as the text awaiting WTO approval: we would miss the deadline."
"We therefore consider it unacceptable to keep this proposal and we think that we will have to vote against it."
"(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, with this proposal for a regulation, we are once again faced with a clear and lamentable exercise in Commission hypocrisy."
"An exercise in hypocrisy which consists of bringing into the sphere of humanitarian aid things whose place is strictly in the sphere of the commercial interests of a few; of business, pure and simple."
"An exercise in hypocrisy which is using the natural disaster that has befallen Pakistan to bring the longstanding plans of a few big companies in the European Union's powers to life."
"Today, the justification is humanitarian aid to Pakistan."
"Yesterday, it was helping in the fight against terrorism."
"Yesterday, like today, there is only one true intention: to obtain trade concessions that benefit, above all, the big European importers."
"That is how it is, however much the Committee on International Trade might want to sugar the pill with toothless safeguards which essentially do not change anything."
"These trade concessions, as the report itself acknowledges, will harm the European Union's textile industry, and the countries and regions most dependent on it."
"This impact is severe in a sector that is already very weakened - hit hard as it was by the liberalisation of world trade - and which is concentrated in regions with high levels of unemployment, poverty and marginalisation, and with low economic diversification."
"However, it becomes even more serious when these regions are situated in Member States, like Portugal, faced with an extremely serious economic and social crisis, which could shortly be exacerbated by the illegitimate intervention that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and European Union are preparing."
"I remember that the Portuguese Parliament unanimously adopted a resolution against these trade concessions."
"There is a need for measures defending the European textiles sector and related jobs."
"We have seen nothing like that from the Commission."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the regulation being discussed today, under the guise of solidarity, is, in reality, yet another betrayal by Europe of its citizens."
"We cannot allow the EU to further damage high quality sectors such as textiles in Italy and elsewhere."
"We should protect them by any means possible from unfair competition from countries such as China, Turkey, India, Vietnam and Pakistan, where workers are exploited at very low cost and where there are no minimum guarantees in terms of respect for social rights."
"It is to those countries that many large European companies have relocated their production, at the expense of jobs in Europe."
"Moreover, why it was not even possible to wait for the World Trade Organisation's verdict on this regulation is beyond me."
"In the meantime, however, Europe has basically shown that it will go to any lengths to harm the interests of its citizens and its high quality industries, now and in the future."
"I sincerely hope that the regulation will be rejected during the vote."
"(EL) Mr President, obviously, I, too, support the provision of humanitarian aid by the European Union as and where possible."
"I understand the Commission's reasoning in terms of providing aid in the form of unilateral trade concessions in favour of Pakistan."
"However, I do not agree with the Commission's proposals calling for two industrial sectors in the Union, namely the textile and bioethanol industries, to shoulder most of the burden."
"I would point out that the European textile industry has been under immense pressure over recent years as a result of the liberalisation of trade within the World Trade Organisation."
"I served four terms as a member of parliament for a region, one area of which, namely Naoussa, has one of the highest unemployment rates in the whole of Europe, as a result of the impact of globalisation of the textile industry."
"As far as bioethanol is concerned, I would stress that important investments have been made in the EU in this new industry."
"We must not overlook the fact that these are two industries in which Pakistan would appear to be particularly competitive."
"Furthermore, the said concessions have no conditionality clause attached, as would apply if Pakistan were granted GSP+ status."
"Finally, I should like to ask if the said concessions will benefit the flood-stricken inhabitants of Pakistan."
"I doubt it."
"In order to moderate the virtuous intentions here, my counter-proposal is that concessions should be made on other industrial products."
"Why specifically on textiles?"
"We would be equally useful to the flood victims in Pakistan."
"In any event, the duration and range of concessions should be limited and provision should be made for safeguards, as proposed in the amendments tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats)."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, we all firmly believe that we must help the people in Pakistan, but the instrument that you are proposing, Commissioner, is the wrong one, for three reasons."
"The first is that there is absolutely no proof that trade facilitation will benefit the people affected by the floods."
"On the contrary, we can even see that the textile industry in Pakistan is based in other regions and, in recent years, has even experienced growth."
"Thus, this sector is not really affected at all."
"How we intend to help the people affected by the floods by means of trade facilitation is beyond me."
"Secondly, I cannot understand how we can now grant these facilitations to a country that plainly does not meet the GSP+ conditions in terms of social and environmental standards and send a signal to other countries, like Bangladesh, which do meet these conditions, that essentially tells them that their efforts are not wanted and it is also possible to achieve this status by other means."
"My third argument, Commissioner, is that this is not an approach based on solidarity, because the burden in Europe is borne in a one-sided manner by certain sectors and certain countries only."
"If we want to do something, then we should do so in a spirit of solidarity with all countries and with the involvement of everyone, and that means we need direct aid for the flood victims."
"That would be the right approach to take."
"(PL) Mr President, expressions of sympathy are due to all the victims of this terrible catastrophe and this is why it is right that the European Union has immediately rushed to provide humanitarian aid."
"The future of Pakistan is a key issue for the world and for Europe."
"This is an important country in the context of the fight against terrorism, and it is also a country which is a significant source of immigration to the European Union."
"Unfortunately, until now, the European Union has had no concept for a policy on Pakistan."
"The proposal for EU trade preferences has no specific aim."
"The Commission was not able to justify implementation of the proposal, and neither could the Committee on International Trade during its meeting."
"The proposal does not help those affected by the flood, nor does it have any significant influence on the country's development."
"The European Union has two significant and very important interests in its relations with Pakistan: firstly, the fight against terrorism; secondly, the economic development of the country, which should be based on the rule of law, as it is elsewhere."
"So instead of making proposals which do not achieve anything, we need to prepare a serious, wide-ranging offer of economic aid and cooperation, on a conditional basis."
"If Pakistan wants to increase its cooperation with the European Union, it should show that it is cooperating in the fight against terrorism in a very real way and that it is developing its rule of law."
"Then, a wide-ranging aid programme would make sense; wide-ranging and not limited to one or two branches of the economy."
"The proposal which has been presented - and I am repeating this once again - does not solve anything, so I believe it should be rejected."
"I call on Mrs Ashton to present a well-thought through, conditional concept for cooperation with Pakistan."
"Mr President, it is now eight months since the Council proposed a sensible package of measures to help Pakistan following the devastating flooding."
"I regret that, eight months later, we are still debating it and not implementing it."
"Let us ask why we needed this package."
"There is a difference between aid and what is contained in this trade package."
"Aid, of course, is very important to Pakistan, but the idea of this trade package was to provide an incentive to entrepreneurs to start rebuilding factories and reinvesting in the textile and other industries that were literally swept away by the flooding."
"It is not true to say that the textile industry was not impacted by the flooding."
"It is true that the centre of much of the textile industry is elsewhere than the flooded area but a lot of the support packages for the textile industry were in flooded areas, as was a lot of the textile industry."
"This would have given an incentive to rebuild the textile industry by demonstrating there was a market for their products."
"Unfortunately, our response has been very curmudgeonly."
"I can certainly support the idea of having a safeguard clause, but it would be better to do nothing at all than to do this for only one year."
"One year will not give the space for the investment that is necessary."
"I also regret that India has been less than supportive in the WTO but I hope, as Mr Rinaldi mentioned, that the so-called cricket diplomacy is going to lead to a solution and that India will recognise that, both on humanitarian grounds and in the interests of security, it is important to help Pakistan create jobs and investment in the future."
"(SK) Mr President, Commissioner, I see that this theme has divided the House."
"Nevertheless, and contrary to the view held by my fellow Members, I support what the Council has presented."
"As a member of the Committee on Development, it is precisely this aspect that I would like to emphasise."
"Although urgent humanitarian aid in the form of funding is essential in response to disasters such as those in Pakistan, more needs to be done."
"The most effective way we can promote development is to enable people to help themselves."
"I therefore welcome the abolition of customs barriers - no matter how temporary - and I am confident that this transitional period will allow us to evaluate the process proposed by the Commission."
"If this process and approach works, I would perhaps then revise the definition of the European Union's development assistance."
"If anything, it is not Pakistan, but China that poses the biggest threat to Europe's textile market."
"(RO) Mr President, as some of our fellow Members have said, you have noticed the argument that granting special trade preferences to Pakistan would not be an appropriate solution for helping the flood victims, as they do not regard trade as a suitable means of response in such emergencies."
"I agree that granting trade preferences may not help directly the people who have suffered as a result of flooding."
"However, by implementing measures to supplement humanitarian aid, we can contribute to Pakistan's economic recovery."
"Indeed, international trade and humanitarian aid are not two diametrically opposed activities."
"In practical terms, there is a degree of complementarity between all European Union policies."
"In fact, when we offer developing countries trade preferences, we do not take this action purely for pragmatic, commercial reasons, but to show our solidarity with these states."
"Mr President, the images of last summer's flooding in Pakistan were indeed shocking, and the European Union rightly sought to implement aid measures to assist the millions of Pakistanis whose lives were devastated by this terrible disaster."
"Humanitarian aid should be disbursed without political strings."
"However, emergency trade preferences are a politically controversial measure, both in the context of Pakistan and the region."
"The presence of Osama Bin Laden in Pakistan has now once again exposed Pakistan's ambivalent approach towards fighting terrorism."
"So, speaking personally, I am concerned that these emergency trade preferences will appear to reward the Pakistani Government for its lack of action in this respect."
"I am also worried that secular, democratic Bangladesh, also a country prone to flooding, will suffer as a consequence in terms of unfair competition, and it, too, is heavily dependent on textiles."
"This is a well-meaning measure and, of course, I fully accept that, but it is one we need to consider extremely carefully, given all the things that I have outlined in my brief speech."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, this draft is an attack on the European textile industry, there is no question about that."
"However, allow me also to bring in a humanitarian aspect."
"Extensive duty exemptions must be linked to an absolute obligation to respect human rights."
"In this regard, I am thinking of Christian minorities and women's rights."
"The blasphemy law in Pakistan is particularly worrying: anyone who insults Mohammed is sentenced to death."
"Fundamentalism is widespread in Pakistan across all levels of society and can even be detected among students at the renowned International Islamic University."
"You clearly do not believe the argument yourself that trade preferences can be used to promote prosperity and combat radicalism."
"The EU cannot simply grant trade preferences where this ignores or fails to require compliance with important matters of basic law."
"Mr President, I speak as Chair of the delegation which covers Pakistan, and I must say that some real crocodile tears have been shed here tonight by people expressing views which are about 180 degrees away from those they normally express."
"When we have discussed this issue here in the past, we have been assured by the Commission that the items in question have been carefully assessed to ensure they do not clash with EU exports."
"Has this changed?"
"We have been asked: why textiles from Pakistan?"
"The answer is: because textiles are a major export for them."
"You cannot expect them to conjure up something within a few months."
"We, too, had our doubts about the potential effect of this measure in the flood-stricken areas."
"We raised this matter when we were in Pakistan, and we heard directly from Members of Parliament there that the measure would be of benefit to industry in their constituencies, so I really think that we should consider the message we send if we do not support this measure."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all, I would like to apologise for not being present at the beginning of the debate, but I was only just arriving from Brussels by plane and you were - how shall I put it? - in advance of the schedule, which is very laudable, but which resulted in my being a little bit late."
"I have taken notice of all the speeches that have been made on this report."
"I would simply like to stress a couple of points."
"First, we are not discussing an FTA."
"It seems to me that a lot of speeches start from the assumption that this is a kind of FTA with all the elements that go with it."
"For example, the problem of social conditionality, of sustainability as we call it, should not be considered here because this is very clearly a measure that is limited in time."
"Secondly, we are not discussing the GSP either."
"We will do that in the near future and then there will be the discussion as to which countries can be included and which not."
"No, this is a proposal that the European Commission has made with respect to the massive flooding in Pakistan, time-bound for two years, with the possibility of its being continued for another year."
"Let me also say that the amendment to limit it to one year, honestly speaking, to my mind does not make much sense: it would be better for you simply to vote against it."
"Why have we not yet come to a conclusion, and why is this argument being used now, when about a year has already elapsed since the flooding took place?"
"It is simply because we have just introduced this request for a waiver with the WTO, but within the WTO we face serious problems with the neighbours of Pakistan."
"I do not think I have to name them."
"We tried to find a solution."
"I think we were moving in the right direction and we will have to see in the coming weeks what the impact may possibly be of what has recently been happening in Pakistan."
"But there we are in the hands of the WTO as to whether or not we get a waiver, and this waiver can only be obtained by unanimity, so we cannot force this within the WTO."
"We can only try to do our best to get it through."
"I would also like to say that I am not talking, as one of the previous speakers has done, about crocodile tears and hypocrisy and so on. That is not up to me to say, but let us say in a very neutral way that what has been said tonight is not necessarily consistent with what has been said in the past."
"It is not because time has elapsed and that we have not yet got a waiver that the argument as such has changed."
"Since the beginning, there has been a discussion as to whether or not this was directly in favour of the people struck by the flooding."
"It is partially, yes."
"Since the beginning, it has been said that there should also be humanitarian aid."
"There has been humanitarian aid up to EUR 480 million so the arguments have not changed and I really do not see the merit in us now, all of a sudden, switching to another direction."
"We have taken notice of the problems that can arise with the European textile industry, and with the ethanol industry."
"There is a safeguard clause proposed that is, I think, sufficient to counter possible problems that might arise, so this is fairly clear and you are either in favour of it or against it."
"The Commission is in favour of it and I think that, both from the point of view of the economic development of Pakistan and from the point of view of the security issues that are certainly linked with Pakistan, it would be a major mistake on the part of the European Parliament not to take up this responsibility and vote this down."
"Mr President, I would like to welcome Commissioner De Gucht, albeit a little late, which we understand, but I think that there is still time to deliver the committee's final position."
"As the accidental rapporteur of this report and, once more, against my will, please allow me just two observations."
"The first is that this debate has demonstrated as much division on this issue as in the Committee on International Trade itself or even more, and the second is that the merits of the proposals adopted by the Committee on International Trade, some of which the European Commission considers inconclusive ... the plenary sitting tomorrow will decide on the merits of these proposals and the Commission's objections."
"Allow me just two final observations."
"There are two things of which Parliament and the Committee on International Trade cannot be accused."
"Firstly, of having tried to block this issue, despite it being dependent on a World Trade Organisation (WTO) waiver and, in truth, of voting on an issue that can be rendered toothless by a lack of that waiver."
"In fact, the Committee on International Trade decided to go ahead despite this."
"Secondly, we took into account all the Commission's last-minute amendments, because the Commission - which is the only body and institution that can initiate legislation - submitted its proposal, but the terms of the waiver request submitted to the WTO are not the same as the proposal that the Commission tabled before Parliament."
"Moreover, then came the Council's compromise, which was also different from the Commission's initial proposal."
"The Committee on International Trade did not question any of these things as an obstacle to taking the debate into their own hands and voting on this issue, and took on board all these late changes from both the Commission and the Council."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday, 10 May 2011."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Questions regarding Pakistan are never entirely free of controversy, even those regarding aid following a natural disaster."
"In the case of autonomous trade preferences for Pakistan, it is important to introduce a safeguard clause in case of interruptions to trade resulting from the abolition of tariffs."
"We should also take into account our trading interests and care for them in the long term by establishing their optimal period of validity and the conditions which must be fulfilled by Pakistan."
"The flood which affected Pakistan so catastrophically in the summer of 2010 had a disastrous effect on the country's economy."
"The EU wants to help Pakistan by contributing to the economic redevelopment of the country."
"In view of the fact that Pakistan is unusually important to the security of the EU due to its geo-strategic position, we should do everything we can to stabilise the situation there."
"In this way, we will prevent the radicalisation of opinion in Pakistan."
"A more stable economy always brings with it a more democratic society and a retreat from anti-democratic, radical social movements."
"Our decision will send an unambiguous signal to Pakistan that we want to help and that we would like Pakistan to become a stable and rich country, which will prevent opinion becoming radicalised there."
"I believe that this Pakistan, as our ally, would also help to solve the deadlocked situation in Afghanistan."
"I support the principle of helping Pakistan boost its economy following the floods in July 2010."
"However, I feel that the proposal made by the Commission is inappropriate for several reasons."
"Firstly, it is not a particularly quick solution: almost a year after the disaster, we have no positive sign of the waiver that the Union must obtain from the WTO before its proposal can enter into force, we have not finished our work as legislators, and we have still to hold negotiations in the Council."
"Secondly, no impact assessment has been carried out, and we do not know what effect these measures will have either on the Pakistani economy or on the European economy (in particular, the textile and ethanol sectors, which are specifically targeted by the proposal)."
"Nor do we know how Pakistan will redistribute the income from exports covered by these measures so that they genuinely benefit the regions affected by the floods."
"Lastly, it should be noted that the proposed measures place no human rights obligations on Pakistan."
"This goes against all the positions recently adopted and must remain the exception."
"Free trade agreement with India (debate)"
"The next item is the oral question to the Commission by Mr Moreira, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on the state of play of the EU-India Free Trade Agreement negotiations - B7-0214/2011)."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I hope not to use the full five minutes."
"The issue is simple."
"This is an initiative of the Committee on International Trade, of which I am chair, and it is as chair that I am asking this question, in relation to which the political groups have reached agreement by consensus."
"I am pleased to be asking this question, which has had the approval of the political group coordinators on my committee and which seeks a response from the European Commission on a range of concerns regarding the state of play of the EU-India Free Trade Agreement (FTA) negotiations, which have been ongoing since 2007."
"There is no need to stress the importance of this initiative."
"In fact, one of the great innovations of the Treaty of Lisbon was giving the European Parliament the right not just to give final approval to agreements on, inter alia, international trade after their negotiation, but also to be informed about every stage of negotiations, from the outset."
"This means that Parliament has the power and the duty to monitor negotiations - in this case, trade negotiations - and to intervene politically using the parliamentary means at its disposal, such as hearings, resolutions and oral questions, in order to stay informed on the progress of these negotiations."
"It is for this reason that the Committee on International Trade believes in listening to the Commission, which, we should say, has been providing us with a great deal of information on this subject."
"However, I think it needs to answer a number of questions publicly."
"The oral question consists of seven questions, specifically on the progress made on a range of sensitive subjects, such as public procurement; negotiations concerning intellectual property rights issues in relation to generic medicines; the application for a mandate on overseas investment negotiations that the Commission submitted to the European Council; issues being negotiated relating to culture and cultural services; whether there has been a specific assessment of the effects of a possible FTA with India on the main European industries; whether there is a quantitative assessment of the foreseeable benefits and losses from this FTA for the European Union; and, finally, whether the Commission assures us that it will give Parliament's views on this issue the proper consideration."
"The questions are in writing; they are in the document we tabled and I think that they are clear enough for us to make progress on the issue of public information on these important trade negotiations between the European Union and one of our great trade partners."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Moreira and the Committee on International Trade for giving me the opportunity to address the plenary on this important negotiation."
"It goes without saying that to conclude an agreement with India at this juncture is not only of great economic value but also of major strategic importance."
"India is just at the beginning of a development path which will make it one of the key economic players of this century."
"An ambitious and balanced agreement with India would take our relationship to a different level by providing a stable, predictable framework governing our future economic relations."
"We are therefore working very hard to bring this negotiation to a conclusion and there is a real opportunity to do so."
"India is clearly interested at the highest political level."
"The India-EU Summit in December came out with a strong commitment expressed by both sides to conclude the negotiations as soon as possible."
"We have made progress across a range of issues."
"We are making headway on the tariff offers and are preparing the exchange of offers on services."
"We are now intensively negotiating on procurement, and this is the first time that India has negotiated a substantive procurement chapter including specific rules and market access commitments."
"Having said this, I do not want to hide the fact that there are also still some thorny issues on the table which require difficult negotiation."
"As with any negotiation, the last yards are the most difficult."
"Firstly, there are the tariff negotiations where we have made some good progress quickly over the last few months and I am confident that India will significantly improve its offer, but a few sectors remain very difficult; notably, cars, and wine and spirits."
"We are also having very intense discussions on services and the contours of a possible package are getting clearer, but some of our key interests concern sectors where legislative reform is still ongoing or being contemplated in India."
"This mainly concerns insurance, postal, financial, retail, legal and accountancy services."
"This makes negotiations very challenging."
"There is also sustainable development, which is, of course, very important for us but very sensitive in India."
"We are fully aware of the views of the European Parliament in this respect and will take those into account."
"However, we must remain realistic."
"We need to see what will ultimately be possible with a partner like India."
"We need to find a solution which satisfies our expectations but also takes into account the specific situation of India."
"So yes, there will be a chapter on sustainable development that will be part and parcel of the agreements, that will recognise the importance of relevant international standards and be based on cooperation, but we also need to be clear that a sustainable development chapter which would allow the use of trade restrictions linked to social or environmental issues will not be acceptable to India."
"This would also not be in accordance with the model we are advocating in our trade agreements in general."
"We are not pursuing sanctions but cooperation in this area."
"Another issue which has been sensitive in this negotiation and the cause of some concern is access to medicines and the potential impact this FTA might have on access to medicines in the developing world."
"But let me reassure you on these crucial points."
"We are fully aware of the specific role played by India as regards access to affordable medicines in the developing world."
"Therefore, this FTA - whether its intellectual property rights chapter, its investment chapter or any other chapter - will not undermine the capacity of India to promote, produce or export generic medicines, including through compulsory licences."
"We ourselves have even proposed very clear language to this effect but, at the same time, one should bear in mind the potential of a robust framework on IPR in India, which can certainly encourage innovation and research, including as regards the development of new medicine."
"Therefore, negotiating a chapter on IPR with India remains an important objective for us in this negotiation."
"Let me also be very clear as regards data protection and data exclusivity for pharmaceutical products."
"What we will be asking through this agreement is that, if and when India decides to introduce a system of data exclusivity, it will be applied in a non-discriminatory manner so that European producers will also benefit from it and, of course, we continue to believe that access to medicine and the protection of test data can coexist constructively."
"Further dialogue by all interested stakeholders should help to develop a common understanding on this matter."
"Also, in the intellectual property rights chapter, geographical indications are a major area of interest for the EU."
"It is important to obtain in this negotiation a political deliverable allowing for the effective protection of the major EU GI names."
"Negotiations have so far proven to be difficult."
"Nonetheless, the Commission continues to push for a satisfactory outcome."
"Finally, as you are aware, the Commission has also proposed to the Council additional negotiating guidelines to also negotiate investment protection."
"These draft negotiating guidelines have been shared with Parliament subject to the appropriate confidentiality requirements."
"The Council is currently examining these guidelines and we look forward to hearing Parliament's view on them."
"When and how this chapter can be negotiated will ultimately depend on when the Council manages to agree on these additional negotiating guidelines."
"Let me conclude by reiterating that this negotiation is very important and, I believe, an opportunity we should not miss."
"Of course, we should not conclude an agreement at any cost but only if the substance on the table is right."
"If the substance is not there, we should simply say no."
"Some of our requests, such as access for our cars or wines and spirits or the opening of certain services sectors, are difficult for India to deliver."
"I look forward to more intensified exchanges on this with the European Parliament as we move into what is hopefully the final phase."
"I believe the debate we will now have is a useful opportunity for this House to give its views on these negotiations."
"These views will be taken into account as far as possible, taking into account the realities and specificities of this particular negotiation."
"In this respect, we look forward to the resolution that you are planning to adopt on the India FTA, which I believe is very timely."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the case of India, I would like to state that I expressly agree with the Commissioner that it is good for us to be in talks with this country regarding a trade agreement."
"The strategic reasons alone - you mentioned some of them - speak for themselves."
"In particular, the fact that, regrettably, we are not making any progress within the framework of the WTO also speaks even more in favour of this free trade agreement with India."
"However, the issue that is still causing me concern is whether we really will obtain access to the Indian market for our enterprises."
"Does this free trade agreement ultimately really only suit the world and the division of economic power between Europe and India that we know today, or will this agreement still be suitable in ten or 15 years' time?"
"In this regard, I am increasingly concerned about the issue of the exclusions."
"I fully understand why India is currently demanding certain exclusions in certain sectors in the negotiations."
"A country at the level of development at which India currently finds itself needs exclusions."
"This is certainly something that we in Europe can understand very well."
"However, I would expressly like to see all these exclusions expire on a particular day."
"I would like the exclusions to be provided either with a clear time limit or with definite benchmarks, however they are structured - perhaps the Commission could consider what proposals it intends to bring to the table to go some way towards meeting India's demands."
"I would therefore like very clear limits for all exclusions, whether in the form of time limits or benchmarks."
"We more than owe that to our enterprises and thus, also to our workers."
"I would be very grateful if you could tell us to what extent you have such exclusions and possible limits for them in view in the negotiations."
"The second important subject that you mentioned and that I would like to express my agreement with is the subject of intellectual property."
"We absolutely must achieve a result that benefits our farmers and other parties affected here, particularly in the area of geographical indications."
"We must also help our manufacturers when it comes to medicines, but I think that we will all agree that this must not be to the detriment of those who are dependent on access to cheap medicines."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the EU-India free trade agreement negotiations are ambitious, they concern many economic sectors, but they are also a cause for concern in Europe and in India, as I was able to see during last month's meeting between the trade committee of the two chambers of the Indian Parliament and the European Parliament's delegation for relations with India."
"India is booming; it is a strategic partner, as you have reminded us."
"Everyone understands the importance of developing trade between us."
"Yet we are not starting from scratch, since the Union is already India's main trading partner, the main investor in India and the main destination for Indian investors, and India is also the main beneficiary of the system of generalised preferences."
"We will therefore have to be alert to any new impact that a new and more far-reaching trade agreement may have on fragile sectors of the Indian economy."
"I am thinking, for example, of agriculture - our Indian colleagues spoke to us about this - and of the consequences for sectors that are particularly exposed to competition from emerging countries in Europe, and I am thinking of the car industry."
"Such an agreement should serve the development of our societies and of employment and not give rise to uncontrolled liberalisation that would have disastrous effects."
"That is why my group wishes to emphasise a number of points in these negotiations, which should culminate in an agreement that helps achieve the objectives of sustainable development and poverty eradication, and which should also be accompanied by clear and verifiable commitments, on the basis of cooperation, of course, but then coupled with serious social and environmental commitments."
"I should like to emphasise a few points in particular. Firstly, regarding agriculture - which I mentioned earlier - we call on the Commission to ensure that none of the agreement's provisions, either on the liberalisation of agricultural trade or on intellectual property rights, threaten small-scale farming in India."
"I am thinking of the provisions on seeds, for example."
"Secondly, regarding generic medicines, India is the biggest producer of generic medicines in the developing world."
"We call on the Commission to stop demanding data exclusivity, since all the NGOs say it is liable to harm the distribution of those medicines."
"Thirdly, in the area of services, we call, firstly, for public services to be left out of the sectors to be liberalised and, secondly, concerning mode IV, for the principle of equal treatment to be guaranteed - in other words, for all forms of social dumping to be rejected."
"Lastly - thank you, Mr President - we believe that the sustainable development chapter must include binding commitments in relation to respect for social and environmental standards, in particular, ILO social standards."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, these negotiations are a little like the four-armed God Shiva, since it takes so much effort to conclude such a complex agreement."
"I am now going to explain the position of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe."
"Firstly: access to medicines."
"While I welcome the Commissioner's statement, I confirm that I am against any attempt to implement protectionist measures in a sector in which Europe actually hindered access to low cost medicines in the past."
"Exploiting the issue of counterfeiting purely for protectionist purposes is about as low as it gets."
"The agreement should instead be an opportunity for the Indian and European pharmaceutical industries to cooperate with one another."
"Secondly: industrial sectors."
"We are asking India to allow sensitive sectors such as the automotive and alcohol sectors, in which our exports are today heavily taxed, to also feature in the agreement."
"Thirdly: agriculture."
"For our part, we declare ourselves willing to discuss agricultural products and to open up our market, but with a few conditions attached: obviously, we must say 'no' to GMOs and do everything we can to protect geographical indications."
"As regards this last aspect, I would remind you that geographical indications are not just a trade policy matter; they are also part of Europe's identity."
"We therefore hope that a huge effort will be made to simplify registration procedures in India's bureaucratic system, which is very onerous, perhaps even more onerous than the European one, which says it all."
"As regards public procurement, I congratulate the Commission if it is true that India seems to be prepared, for the first time, to include public procurement in an international agreement."
"Indian railways - to give you an example, 17 000 trains transport 18 million passengers every day, and there are plans to build a further 25 000 kilometres of track in the next 10 years - are one of the many markets that could potentially be opened up with this free trade agreement."
"If the negotiations go well, both parties will benefit: sustainable development will be promoted, child labour will gradually be eradicated and a more progressive form of social protection will be upheld."
"I feel it is pointless and detrimental to oppose this, and so I call on all the groups in Parliament to reject a priori a compromise text."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, as the Commissioner has said, he agrees with this resolution, and it reiterates everything that the EU-India Free Trade Agreement could encourage - investment, the elimination of tariffs, non-tariff barriers, etc."
"The conclusion of an ambitious FTA is expected to boost bilateral trade by EUR 160 billion by 2015, with key sectors seeing as much as a 30% increase in bilateral foreign direct investment."
"I am sure that the Commissioner will agree that these are exactly the kind of figures that will help to stimulate the economy and create jobs, not only throughout the United Kingdom, but also in India."
"In its initial assessment of the potential FTA between the EU and India, the Centre for the Analysis of Regional Integration at Sussex concluded that any gains would depend on the extent to which the text identified and dealt with the key areas which the Commissioner specifically mentioned, such as government procurement, services, investment in trade facilitation, etc."
"It states that if an agreement is largely confined to an issue of shallow integration, notably, the reduction of tariffs, there is a strong possibility of trade diversion exceeding trade creation for both parties."
"The Commissioner mentioned, quite rightly, sustainable development."
"I would say to you that we have to be very careful."
"The red lines are set, as it were, in tablets of stone, and I hope that we will not go too far towards conceding too much."
"I would also agree with Mr Caspary on time limits."
"I think he put a very good point forward there."
"At this point, I should also mention the impact of the WTO Doha Development Round on an EU-India FTA."
"Current signals from Geneva have not been positive, and the Commissioner admitted not so long ago that the negotiations were in dire straits."
"Now is perhaps the time, he said, for Plan B - something, I hasten to add, that the Committee on International Trade has been looking for for a long time."
"What effect will this have on the EU-India FTA?"
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, let us be clear: this free trade agreement is not negotiated on an equal footing."
"India's per capita GDP is about 6% of that of the EU. India, although ambitious, is a developing country with a huge number of poor and starving people within its borders."
"We must not forget this."
"We are bound by the principle of policy coherence for development, which is enshrined in the Lisbon Treaty, and it tells us that none of our policies must harm development."
"Yet, with this FTA, we are causing harm - to agriculture, retail, Indian companies, etc. Examples have already been mentioned."
"In addition, through the dispute settlement provisions, we are reducing the policy space for India, and for the EU and its Member States, to introduce, for example, new environmental legislation."
"The mechanism in question has led to multinational companies suing countries for their policies on health and environment - and your governments, too, will be affected by this."
"With regard to generic medicines, as I see it, they are not out of the danger zone."
"Pushing for data exclusivity in any form is a problem, no matter how it is done."
"Parliament needs to send a clear signal to the Commission that a trade agreement should be fair and should not curb the policy space."
"Unfortunately, however, the members of the EPP, ALDE and ECR Groups are actually curbing their own power as Members of this Parliament."
"In the Committee on International Trade, they have consistently asked the Commission not to pursue the investment chapter until Parliament has given its opinion on what investment policy should look like, but now, in this resolution, they are calling on the Commission to go ahead without waiting for Parliament's opinion."
"How come?"
"I really hope that some of our colleagues can have a second look at the text before simply agreeing to it on Wednesday."
"I hope we can send a clear signal to the Commission and thereby influence the negotiations, making it very clear that we want to exercise our powers as the European Parliament."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the motions for resolutions that the European Parliament has been presented with make it clear to all groups that Parliament - as has already been emphasised - does not feel it is sufficiently informed about the specific status of the negotiations."
"I am therefore grateful for the more detailed information that we have been given today."
"The questions from the left side of this House in particular deal directly with the concerns of the people in Europe, but also in India, and these are concerns for their own social and economic situation and the prospects of workers and those looking for work, including in the EU Member States."
"As we know, the devil is in the detail, so we would like to know the following, Commissioner: what are the specific subjects of the negotiations when it comes to public invitations to tender in the services sector or in connection with labour migration?"
"What text is on the table with regard to intellectual property rights?"
"What is the situation with regard to the environment and agriculture?"
"By using the specific texts, we want to examine whether the role of India as the pharmacy to the world's poor is put at risk or whether the production of cheaper malaria medicines or medicines for the treatment of AIDS will be obstructed by the agreement, without ignoring the massive research investments also made by our own pharmaceutical companies."
"We want to examine whether European local authorities, hospitals or ministries are, in future, to be obliged to make calls for tenders in which Indian companies can also be included."
"We want to know whether the agreement will regulate the conditions of entry into the Member States of the European Union of Indian nurses or carers for the elderly, including the length of stay and recognition of qualifications."
"We want to know whether the agreement text will put small-scale farmers and fishermen in India at risk and whether European steel workers are threatened with redundancy because Indian capital will, in future, be able to be invested freely in the purchase of companies in the EU as a result of the agreement."
"(HU) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the political analysts and politicians - for example, Henry Kissinger - who predicted decades ago that besides the United States of America, the European Union, Russia and China, and India, too, would have a leading role in the new world order were right."
"Of course, we congratulate the people, the peoples of India on that, but we should not forget about those infringements, including child labour, which led to this, to this development, and the European Union must send a clear message to India that the human rights infringements and child labour cannot be continued in the future."
"These do not fit in with the ideas which the European Union represents."
"We do not see that the free trade agreement would ensure sufficient independence of the European economy and European production."
"We therefore suggest that the free trade agreement contain guarantees to ensure the independence of European family entrepreneurs, smallholders and producers, through which Europe might overcome the economic crisis in which we currently find ourselves."
"(PL) Mr President, it is right that, in a situation where there is a problem with extending trade liberalisation within the World Trade Organisation, the European Union is concluding free trade agreements with important global partners, such as India."
"We have much in common with India - it is the largest democracy in the world, it is a country which acts as a stabilising influence internationally, and it is our ally in the fight against international terrorism."
"Trade relations play a huge role, today."
"Arranging them in the right way would lead to economic growth in India and the development of the country, and would improve international stability."
"It is in our interest."
"It is right that we are also expecting the Commission to take up the very significant subject of foreign investments, and to include the promotion and protection of foreign investments."
"A European Parliament document on this subject already exists, addressing what Parliament expects from future talks on the mutual protection of foreign investments."
"Tomorrow, we will be voting on an important regulation which will allow the Commission to take further action."
"It is very important that this sector should expand and bring benefits for European and Indian investors."
"(RO) Mr President, the free trade agreement with India will become the most substantial agreement of this kind if the negotiations are concluded satisfactorily for both sides."
"The European Union is India's biggest trade partner and the Generalised System of Preferences is one of the instruments used by the European Union to encourage this country's economic development."
"Although India has an emerging economy, social disparities persist."
"More than 800 million people live on less than USD 2 a day."
"India's efforts in building a strong economy must be backed up by the political will to improve the situation in terms of human, social and environmental rights."
"This is why the European Commission must urge during the negotiations for some legally binding clauses to be introduced relating to these areas."
"India can set not only an economic example for the rest of the developing countries, but also an example of democracy."
"Mr President, I was a member of the EP delegation that went to India last month."
"A small group of us went, and it was exceedingly interesting and very valuable to go."
"I want to talk, in particular, about paragraph 29 of the motion on which we will vote on Wednesday."
"It says that Parliament 'welcomes all efforts by the Indian Government to eradicate child labour'."
"I suppose the person who drafted this is attacking goods that might be manufactured using child labour and brought into Europe, but the motion does not say that."
"What it does is single out one of the unfortunate aspects of Indian life which still exists."
"Last year, our delegation visited a project in southern India, which is financed by EU money, to eliminate child labour."
"From what we saw, the problem was that children were actually working in the fields - not manufacturing anything - to pay off debts that their parents had incurred."
"They were sentenced to do this for life and to miss out on schooling."
"The phrase used in the motion for a resolution is potentially offensive to Indians."
"Of course they want to eliminate child labour."
"We should either get rid of paragraph 29 or change it to say that we are concerned about goods that might be made using child labour."
"For me, there is a whiff of superiority here, with Europe saying: 'We have got rid of child labour, but you Indians are still using it'."
"That is not the relationship we should have with a very important trading partner."
"(NL) Mr President, I believe there are two schools of thought on the free trade agreement with India."
"Firstly, there is the view that goes: we now have an agreement which is the most extensive in the world."
"We therefore need to maintain it and it is important in itself and, then, as we trade with India, a number of what are commonly known as non-trade concerns, such as minority rights, child labour and caste discrimination, will crop up."
"I call this 'the trader's take on things'."
"This way of thinking pervades the resolution that is before us."
"The second take on things, Mr President, actually demands that we, first of all, clear up non-trade concerns and only then reach an agreement."
"I call that 'the preacher's take on things'."
"We know that, in the latter scenario, India will definitely not want to enter into an agreement with us."
"I would like to remind this House that in March 2009, we adopted a resolution which took into account both the trade and the non-trade concerns."
"In my opinion, the resolution before us is a retrograde step."
"It may contain a sustainable development clause, but it has no teeth."
"The Dalits have hardly been mentioned at all."
"Nature and the environment are the biggest losers in the current text."
"I cannot therefore endorse the text of the resolution."
"Our negotiators have to hold on to the 2009 resolution."
"The trader and the preacher must continue to cooperate and, I am quoting the Commissioner here, 'only then will you have a balanced agreement'."
"(EL) Mr President, achieving an ambitious and mutually beneficial agreement between the EU and India is, quite rightly, a core objective under the EU's current external trade policy."
"If negotiations are to be brought to a swift conclusion, consultations must be stepped up on key sectors, such as services, non-tariff barriers, public procurement and geographical indications."
"As far as the trade in goods is concerned, I would highlight the high average tariffs imposed by India on both agricultural and industrial goods."
"As regards access to the services sector, unfortunately, there appears to be no clear commitment on the part of India at present."
"The Union should insist in no uncertain terms on its claim to enhanced protection for all geographical indications on a market as important as the Indian market."
"Moreover, India is also an ally of the Union within the framework of multilateral negotiations on geographical indications in the Doha Round."
"It should be noted that India has a clear legislative framework, especially as regards the procedure for the registration of geographical indications and their coexistence alongside trademarks."
"Finally, I should like to say that the Union must demonstrate flexibility towards the Indian request for protection for non-agricultural Indian geographical indications so that India, in turn, will grant protection for European geographical indications."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, I really do think it is important that, following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, we decide on the structure of the negotiations together, because this Treaty gives Parliament a new role in trade relations."
"If we once again consider the fact that India is clearly a market of the future, we must also feed this back into a clear position adopted by Parliament: In our view, industrial development in the European Union - linked to jobs - is of key importance."
"We therefore need to make it clear that the interests of jobs in industry in Europe must take priority in the trade agreements."
"For that reason, although an agreement has to be asymmetrical, at the end of the day, the tariffs must be zero."
"It is not acceptable for us to have tariffs of 100% in mechanical engineering and the automotive sector and, in the end, perhaps negotiate 50%."
"As long as we do not have any zero tariffs, it will encourage investments outside Europe."
"Therefore, Commissioner, we need to clearly define our priority areas and they lie in industry."
"We also need a level playing field to be established with regard to social standards, and it is also necessary for clear obligations to be imposed on India in relation to workers' rights."
"(RO) Madam President, India is booming as a country, with enviable economic growth, and is one of our biggest trade partners."
"The free trade agreement with India is extremely important for the future of trade relations."
"This is why I, too, am in favour of concluding this agreement as soon as possible."
"One important aspect relates to the deregulation of services, especially with regard to modes 3 and 4."
"Services are particularly important for economic growth, both in India and the European Union, which must be reflected in the free trade agreement."
"With regard to mode 4, the problems linked to the recognition of professional qualifications need to be resolved, which is, nevertheless, a fairly difficult issue, given that we have problems with mutual recognition of professional qualifications even between European Union Member States."
"I would like to ask the Commission to tell us what stage the discussions have reached on this subject."
"The second aspect relates to reciprocity of access to the public procurement markets."
"Providing European companies with access to India's public procurement markets may contribute to our companies' development."
"Another measure needed is for India to produce and implement some transparent, clear regulations on public procurement, which will also enable European companies to gain access to them."
"Madam President, as the original parliamentary rapporteur for this matter when we opened negotiations back in 2007, I always said at the time that we should try to reach an ambitious free trade agreement that is really comprehensive and far-reaching in what we can achieve, and I am quite pleased to see that we have followed an agenda which seeks to do this."
"It is quite clear to me when I look at what the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce is now saying that we are likely to increase bilateral trade from EUR 69 billion in 2009 to EUR 160 billion in 2015."
"I am encouraged to see also India making real headway in trying to deal with a variety of issues including particularly non-tariff barriers."
"It is a great encouragement to see how the current Indian Government is now facing up to issues of corruption, even to the extent of detaining the Commonwealth Games Chief, and addressing those non-tariff barriers."
"Can I also welcome, Commissioner, this joint declaration made by you and the Indian Trade Minister, Anand Sharma, on 13 December 2010 stating unequivocally that nothing in the agreement would prevent the poorest from accessing life-saving medicines."
"That will, I hope, give confidence to colleagues in this House as to our approach in these negotiations."
"There remains one other matter that was always regarded as a red-line issue and that is public procurement."
"On all the enquiries that I have made, Commissioner, I keep being informed that some detailed negotiations and plans are in place but, as yet, we do not have those details."
"I wonder if you could provide us with those today?"
"May I finally be bold enough to ask you whether we can conclude this FTA before the summer is out."
"(PL) Madam President, it seems to me that, as opposed to my fellow Members, I believe that the agreement will be very beneficial for India as well as the European Union at this juncture."
"The world order is changing."
"Some superpowers are becoming weaker while others, like India, are growing in power."
"That is why we, the European Union, need a partner like this, a democratic partner, since we also have various relations with undemocratic partners."
"The agreement which is currently being negotiated concerns the exchange of goods, services and investments, but there will also be references to sensitive social and environmental issues."
"I was very pleased to hear the Commissioner's comment with regard to generic drugs that there will be no danger of a negative effect on the patients."
"Having been in India many times, and also in developing countries, we have heard from AIDS patients how important it is for them to have access to cheap drugs."
"Digital services and personal data are very important in Europe as well."
"I am convinced that India can fulfil European conditions concerning personal data, although the EU is amending them at the moment and will probably change them as technology develops."
"After the latest events at Sony, Europeans need to be sure that their data are secure if they are being processed abroad."
"I am sure that this agreement will lead to a rise in various environmental working standards, but we need to be careful here."
"It appears to me, especially in view of our debate, that we all have different expectations of India and we want to include these expectations in the free trade agreement."
"However, this is a free trade agreement, and it cannot include all our expectations or everything we would like India to achieve."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, there are so many issues involved in this agreement that you have to concentrate somewhat in order to pick out the most important ones."
"In my opinion, there are two things that are immensely important, both of which could be subsumed under the heading of 'fairness'."
"The first is fairness for our producers and for our industry."
"That has been mentioned several times already."
"We must not allow certain restrictions, which may perhaps make sense at the start, to remain in place permanently."
"Right at the start of this agreement, we must establish how long something should apply and under what circumstances regulations will subsequently be discontinued."
"After all, India will obviously continue to develop and we need to take account of that."
"In this regard, I share the views expressed by my fellow Members."
"It is also a question of fairness for the people, both in the European Union and also in India."
"That is also extremely important."
"An agreement such as this must also contain elements that do not necessarily relate only to trade - these have also been mentioned already: sustainability, human rights, social, environmental and labour standards - these things are also unbelievably important."
"Above all, these aspects must be laid down in such a way that there are consequences if they are not complied with."
"I do not at all mean this to sound schoolmasterish towards our Indian friends."
"When it comes to human rights, I can imagine that India has better law relating to the press, for example, than some Member States of the European Union."
"In other words, we need to view from the opposite side, too."
"However, these requirements must be binding for both sides, they must be met and, if they are not met, it must have consequences for both sides on account of social dumping."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, we support the negotiations on this free trade agreement with India, which has to be ambitious but which nevertheless still raises some issues."
"Firstly, the issue of whether to include a chapter on sustainable development."
"This free trade agreement is a new-generation agreement, so it is only natural that it should include such a chapter."
"Hence, we are not talking about a quid pro quo, but about a negotiating chapter as such."
"Furthermore, if the free trade agreement is to reflect each party's level of development, it cannot overlook such fundamental standards as the prohibition of child labour, for example."
"Although it has been officially prohibited since 1986, an estimated 60 million children still work today in India's fields and factories."
"The Commission cannot ignore minimum social standards during these negotiations."
"To come back to the purely commercial negotiating chapter, the issue of reciprocal access to government contracts has not been fully resolved."
"I am pleased that access to Indian federal government contracts is being covered by these negotiations, but what about provincial contracts?"
"To conclude, I have a few concerns about the protection of intellectual property rights and, in particular, of geographical indications - this has been mentioned several times."
"Indian legislation protects them only at national level, not at international level."
"As I understood it, the Commission had listed 200 indications that it intended to protect via an agreement that would come into force before the free trade agreement."
"Is this still the plan?"
"We now move to the catch-the-eye part of the debate."
"I will not be able to give the floor to everybody who has asked, and I would ask those of you who get the floor to keep to your one minute."
"(SK) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the free trade agreement with India is clearly an exciting opportunity, offering tremendous potential for trade with the world's largest democracy."
"However, I am rather disappointed that negotiations on the free trade agreement have made only sluggish progress towards the conclusion of a negotiated agreement."
"In particular, the domain of intellectual property rights requires clear and fair treatment because it is unacceptable, from a human rights perspective, to threaten the fundamental rights of the poorest inhabitants of developing countries, including the right of access to generic medicines and health care."
"The Commission and the Indian authorities should and must intensify their cooperation on a common definition of counterfeit drugs, an important area which is harmful to patient health, in order that public health is adequately protected."
"(RO) Madam President, as a member of the European Union-India delegation, I support the conclusion of a free trade agreement between the European Union and India."
"India is an important developing country and a significant trade partner for the European Union."
"However, it is important for us to know what the fine detail of this agreement's content is going to be."
"I should mention as a reminder that the European Parliament will ratify this agreement."
"This is why we are asking for information about the current stage of negotiations."
"I would like to ask the Commission how this agreement is going to reflect both the European Union's future industrial policy and India's industrial policy."
"There ought to be a particular focus placed on the respect for, and protection of, intellectual property rights and patents."
"Last but not least, I would like to know whether this agreement will help the positions of the European Union and India converge on the fight against climate change and reducing polluting emissions."
"(PL) Madam President, reaching an agreement with India on free trade is a key issue for Europe at the moment."
"In the face of current economic problems, this agreement will ensure that the Union will have greater access to one of the fastest growing economies in the world."
"However, there are still many problems which need to be solved."
"In my opinion, we should elaborate on agricultural matters and those concerning movement of populations."
"Furthermore, there is a lack of adequate progress on government procurement and services, principles for the protection of intellectual property, including geographical indications, conditions for sustainable development, and particularly in following production standards when creating equal conditions for competition."
"I believe that it is essential to carry out an assessment of the specific character of individual sectors to flag possible negative influences of a free trade agreement on vulnerable sectors of the economy of the European Union."
"Madam President, I think we all welcome India's growth over the last decade or so, and especially since dumping some of the failed marxist and socialist policies of yesteryear."
"This has enabled it to throw off the shackles and to grow in an admirable way."
"I would also like to remind our colleagues from all across the political spectrum that this is a trade agreement and, as such, we should be focusing on the trade aspects."
"That is not to say that the other aspects are unimportant, but if we can focus on trade so as to help bring about and create wealth in India, and help entrepreneurs in India to create wealth and jobs in their own villages and towns, that will be to the benefit of all."
"It concerns me when we place too much emphasis on our standards from day one in an almost imperialist way, as my colleague, Bill Newton Dunn, said earlier."
"I think it is important that we focus on improving trade agreements to create wealth in these countries, including India, and help them out of poverty."
"That is the best way we can help."
"(PT) Madam President, the profound weakening of the productive capacity of the weaker economies of the European Union, such as Portugal - which result from integration based on competition between the strong and those who are thus weakened; between the rich and those who are thus impoverished; and which is conducted according to the interests of the big companies of the European powers - is exacerbated by the liberalisation and deregulation of world trade, led by those powers in their own interests."
"Faced with the visible disaster caused by this path, instead of backtracking, the European Union continues to give signals that it wishes to blindly forge on ahead."
"It is in this context that we should analyse this agreement, which is the widest-ranging one agreed to date."
"A profound change in current trade policy is urgently needed, steering international trade towards complementarity and not competition, towards the establishment of fair and equitable economic relationships that are mutually advantageous, and which serve the development of countries and their peoples, and not just a few companies and financial institutions."
"The multifaceted crisis that we are facing demands a new rationale for economic, social, energy and environmental issues, which free trade, one of the pillars of neoliberalism, clearly renders unviable."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I would like to thank colleagues for the very rich debate on the FTA negotiations with India."
"It is, of course, very difficult to go into all the questions in a detailed manner, but let me just focus on some questions that have been repeatedly put."
"On public procurement, it is obvious that the public procurement chapter will focus on federal level, not on provincial level."
"By the way, this is the first time ever that they have been ready to negotiate on public procurement as such, but I also want to indicate the limitations of this."
"What is very important is that our negotiations also cover to the maximum extent possible India's central level public sector undertakings where the bulk of procurement is done."
"Niccolò Rinaldi gave the example of trains, which is obviously one of the major sectors, given the difficult position of India with regard to infrastructure."
"Another question that has been repeatedly touched upon is child labour."
"I think it is fair to make a distinction between child labour in manufacturing and child labour in agriculture."
"Obviously, there are still quite a lot of youngsters working in agriculture."
"Whether they combine it or not with schooling is not always very clear, but I think the majority of them do so."
"It may also be the case that the number of children working in manufacturing goods that will be exported to Europe is rather limited so I think, as Mr Newton Dunn rightly pointed out, we should clearly distinguish between the two."
"Let me also say that child labour is a very complex matter and it has always been a very complex matter in our own countries."
"I remember very well that when I was young, which is, of course, some time ago, but nevertheless not ages, a lot of children were still working specifically in agriculture, so this is not something that completely belongs to the Dark Ages in Europe either."
"(FR) Mr Désir raised the issue of Europe's demand for data exclusivity to be included in our negotiations."
"Several other Members specifically raised this point in connection with doctors in developing countries."
"I would like to be very clear, however, and I have already said this on several occasions, during conferences and also directly to the NGOs concerned: we are not asking for data exclusivity; we are simply not asking for that."
"What we are saying - and it seems reasonable to me anyway - is that, if India ever decides by itself to apply data exclusivity, then it will apply to us too."
"There is what we call in our jargon 'national treatment', and I believe that that is the right approach."
"I therefore believe that I would be criticised to some extent if I agreed to apply protection measures to the Indian pharmaceutical industry that were not applied to our own industry."
"That is what this is about, nothing else."
"I really want to be very clear on that."
"Other issues have been raised, Madam President, in particular with regard to tariffs - an issue raised, among others, by Mr Caspary."
"There is, of course, a different timeframe for, let us say, the path to zero for India and for Europe, which is understandable because they have different levels of development."
"The only question is whether zero can be achieved in certain sectors."
"We always emphasise the need to achieve it in every sector."
"Even so, I should like to draw your attention to the following, Mr Caspary: what will benefit our industry the most?"
"A path towards zero in the very long term, or a rather drastic reduction in the first few years?"
"I believe that we actually need to strike a balance between the two and then see where it takes us."
"Nevertheless, I should like to draw your attention to the two objectives: to reach zero in, say, 20 years, and to obtain a very moderate reduction in the meantime."
"The same solution is not necessarily that attractive to our industry, in my view."
"Therefore, we shall see, and I am sure that together, we shall come up with the best possible solution during this discussion."
"Concerning the GIs, the high level of protection is an important objective in this negotiation and it has taken quite some time and effort with India to come to a common approach."
"One should also consider that India has never protected GIs through a bilateral agreement, so this is the first time that they are discussing this with a partner."
"We will continue to pursue this issue vigorously with the overall objective of achieving a high level of protection for our GIs."
"I think that I have covered most of the other issues."
"I am certainly willing to continue the discussion on this agreement with Parliament and the Committee on International Trade, the more so now that we are reaching the end game in this discussion."
"I am not going to pronounce on the exact timeframe for coming to a final agreement."
"In any case, this cannot be long now because we are now dealing with the most sensitive topics - cars, wine and spirits, public procurement and GIs."
"We have to come to a conclusion, so we are really in what I would call the end game of these negotiations."
"We are in the last stretch to the finish, but the road will still be rather bumpy."
"Mr Obermayr, you were asking for the floor earlier."
"I said at the beginning of the catch-the-eye part of the debate that I could not take everybody and I am afraid you were in that category."
"OK, but we do not have much time."
"(DE) Madam President, in this connection, I would like to point out that I understand what you are saying very well and that you do a splendid job as President."
"However, your predecessor did not act fairly in allowing many Members to overrun by half a minute or 20 seconds - the Commissioner also spoke for seven minutes and 36 seconds instead of three minutes."
"It is surely not fair to keep to the time now when the speaking time is only one minute anyway."
"However, I understand what you are saying and I thank you for your understanding."
"I have made it clear since I took over the chair that I expect people to keep to their speaking time for the rest of this evening or else we are going to have trouble because we will run over midnight and I do not wish to do that."
"I have received four motions for resolutions tabled in accordance with Rule 115(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday, 11 May 2011."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"The Indian economy is one of the fastest growing economies in the world."
"Even now, the majority of Indian foreign investment is situated in the European Union and the Tata Group alone is a leading employer in the industrial sector in Great Britain."
"Taking into account the pace of India's development, it should be acknowledged that the trade agreement between India and the EU will form one of the most significant and demanding agreements to have been concluded to date."
"The agreement will undoubtedly contribute to an increase in the level of investment and imports and exports for both parties to the agreement."
"It will allow a freer exchange of goods and will contribute to greater prosperity in India as well as in EU countries."
"The agreement will intensify world trade, especially in the field of services."
"In spite of the advantages to be gained from signing the agreement, we should, however, bear in mind issues where both parties to the agreement present opposing views."
"The EU does not accept goods which have been produced to the detriment of the environment, or which have been produced using child labour."
"The agreement which we are striving for should guarantee proper workspaces, diversified, developing economies and multicultural diversity."
"It is crucial to introduce a decision-making system which is effective and improves cooperation, and also to introduce measures to support training for individuals and organisations which will help the regions to develop."
"In order to achieve the aims intended, a transparent and public debate is necessary."
"We are entering a crucial stage in the EU-India free trade agreement negotiations."
"This is a difficult exercise in which the Commission will try hard, I hope, to accommodate Europe's various strategic interests."
"In this respect, I should like to draw attention to the need to make progress in opening up the Indian market to European wine exports."
"Today, the Indian market has closed itself off to our products by imposing exorbitant 150% tariffs on them."
"We must therefore demand respect for the principle of trade reciprocity."
"It seems absurd, in fact, that our market should be very much open to wine products from emerging countries when we do not have satisfactory access to their market."
"I therefore encourage the Commission to continue the ambitious strategy it was able to carry out when it concluded a free trade agreement with South Korea."
"It is imperative to compensate for the arrival on our market of cheaper wines produced outside the EU with improved access for our products to foreign markets and, in particular, to the Indian market, the growth potential of which is exceptional."
"EU-Japan trade relations (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on EU-Japan trade relations by Daniel Caspary and Jarosław Leszek Wałęsa, on behalf of the PPE Group, Syed Kamall, Robert Sturdy and Jan Zahradil, on behalf of the ECR Group, Niccolò Rinaldi, Metin Kazak and Marielle De Sarnez, on behalf of the ALDE Group, and Emilio Menéndez del Valle, David Martin and Vital Moreira, on behalf of the S&D Group (O-000088/2011/rév.1 - B7-0220/2011)."
"Madam President, in recent months, Japan has increased its interest in opening possible negotiations on a free trade agreement with the European Union."
"From the point of view of the European Parliament, the most important issue should be the non-tariff barriers, which has been emphasised many times at meetings of the Trade Policy Committee."
"The problem is not tariffs but the numerous restrictive regulations and obstructions faced by EU companies in gaining access to the Japanese market."
"I am in favour of greater cooperation between the European Union and Japan, but I believe that the priority should be the removal of these non-tariff barriers which restrict the access of EU goods to the Japanese market."
"This is why paragraph 30 was accepted in the conclusions of the European Council in March and indicates the line to be taken and presented by the European Union at the EU-Japan Summit in opening negotiations on a free trade agreement."
"It is quite right to make the opening of these negotiations conditional on Japan showing goodwill in reviewing, inter alia, the issue of non-tariff barriers and restrictions on public procurement."
"It is worth bearing this in mind, all the more so as Japan is lobbying against the loss of competitiveness in the EU market as a result of the EU-Korea Free Trade Agreement which is due to come into effect."
"author. - Madam President, I think - I hope - that most of us in this House would agree that our preference is for multilateral negotiations and a successful outcome for the Doha Development Round at the WTO."
"But, given the difficulties that we all know have been encountered there, I think the Commission deserves support in negotiating some of these bilateral agreements."
"For this reason, I think we should actually be pressing ahead with an EU-Japan free trade agreement."
"I recognise that there are concerns over the natural disasters that have befallen Japan, but I have spoken to many Japanese colleagues, friends and others who believe that, if we tread sensitively, an EU-Japan agreement would send a signal that Japan is back on its way and is on the road to recovery."
"If you look at the figures, in 2009, Japan and the EU together represented more than a quarter of global GDP and more than 20% of world trade, and had a combined volume of foreign direct investment of about EUR 200 billion. Given that the EU countries and Japan face common challenges, I think it is important that we look at some of these issues and address them through trade agreements."
"Despite low tariffs, I think it is quite clear that bilateral trade volumes between the EU and Japan lag behind the bulk of the EU's trade partnerships with its other main trading partners."
"I think this is mostly due to the non-tariff barriers."
"It has been estimated that the cost of some of these barriers is actually higher than the existing tariff levels, and that most of the gains will come from removing these barriers."
"For companies within EU countries, there would be gains if we could tackle barriers to public procurement, to the medical devices market - where there is insufficient recognition of international standards, to services - including financial services and postal services, and access for SMEs."
"For the Japanese, there would be gains in the automotive and ICT sectors."
"But let us not forget that removing or reducing barriers to ICT products from Japan would be of benefit to the EU as well."
"I think that, overall, there is a feeling on both sides that an EU-Japan FTA has the potential to become a true win-win for both sides."
"author. - Madam President, I co-signed this initiative to table an oral question and a resolution in advance of the 20th Japan-EU Summit because I believe that the European Parliament, which will be asked to give its consent to any potential free trade agreement with Japan, should have its say at the earliest possible stage."
"I believe that this opportunity should be used by Parliament to strongly support an FTA with Japan for the following reasons."
"The European Union and Japan are industrial giants that share democratic values and together represent 38.5% of the world's gross domestic product."
"We share similar challenges: the rise of China, the global financial crisis, decreasing demographics and the need to access raw materials and energy sources and to achieve price stability."
"Therefore, I see great potential in further developing trade relations with Japan, our sixth largest trading partner."
"The economic benefits are clear."
"The Copenhagen Economics report concluded that the bilateral elimination of tariffs and reduction of non-tariff barriers would benefit both businesses and consumers and drive economic welfare by EUR 33 billion in the EU and EUR 18 billion in Japan."
"The potential launch of negotiations on an FTA agreement was backed by the Council as long as Japan was willing to tackle non-tariff barriers on market access and restrictions on public procurement."
"I would like to reiterate that non-tariff barriers and public procurement are crucial areas for European businesses where Japan needs to make significant concessions."
"Of course, the European Parliament demands that the Commission be fully transparent in all negotiations and that we be provided with timely sectoral impact assessments."
"In addition, we will support bilateral safeguard measures, as was the case with the South Korea FTA, to avoid serious injury to sensitive sectors such as automotives, electronics, aviation and machinery."
"In conclusion, I am firmly convinced that it is high time that Parliament showed its support for a future FTA between the EU and Japan, building on the establishment of a high-level group, especially in the wake of the March 2011 disaster."
"author. - Madam President, an EU-Japan free trade agreement clearly has the potential to create significant numbers of European jobs and to benefit European companies, and the reason for that is that EU penetration of the Japanese market is currently extremely modest by comparison with EU exports elsewhere."
"In fact, according to the OECD, our market penetration in Japan is amongst the lowest, and the reason for this has been indicated by my colleagues."
"The problem is not high tariff barriers - the tariff barriers are relatively low - but rather non-tariff barriers, including regulatory complications, issues in relation to mutual recognition, poor access to public contracts, and so on."
"The million dollar question for both the Commission and this Parliament is whether to insist that Japan continues to make progress in tackling these non-tariff barriers before we open negotiations, or to open negotiations in the hope that, by doing so, we will encourage Japan to reduce its non-tariff barriers."
"There is no easy answer to that question."
"However, I think the omens are good that Japan does want to tackle non-tariff barriers."
"The Japanese Prime Minister has called for an 'open Japan' policy, and that is partly because he recognises that Japanese industry is stultifying in its present environment."
"It is also, of course, partly because of the anticipated impact of the South Korean free trade agreement on Japanese exports, but I think that, in addition, it reflects recognition of Japan's limited experience with opening up."
"European companies have had improved access to telecommunications, car manufacturing, retail and the insurance sector in Japan, and that has not damaged the Japanese economy but has, in fact, encouraged innovation and development in Japan."
"So I think the omens are good."
"On balance, my group takes the view that we still need Japan to show a little more willingness before we announce the opening of free trade negotiations."
"We are not against an FTA but we think that Japan needs to do a little bit more to prove that the Japanese Prime Minister can deliver on his words."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, the tsunami and earthquake that hit Japan last March constituted a major tragedy."
"The resilience of the Japanese people reassures us that Japan will be able to overcome that tragedy and to emerge from it stronger than before."
"The help offered and the solidarity expressed by the EU will also be instrumental in achieving this recovery."
"This tragedy came a few months before a very important summit between the EU and Japan, scheduled for 28 May 2011, which is set to define the direction of our relationship for the years to come."
"As you know, the previous EU-Japan Summit of April last year established a joint high-level group composed of senior officials to identify options for the comprehensive strengthening of all aspects of the EU-Japan relationship, in the political, economic and sectoral cooperation fields."
"On the trade side, the high-level group looked into ways of strengthening and integrating the economic relationship, addressing all issues of interest to both parties."
"These include tariffs, non-tariff measures, investments and procurement."
"From Japan's side, the clearly stated preferred option is to start negotiations on a free trade agreement which includes preferential tariffs."
"However, from the EU side, an agreement focusing on tariffs would clearly not be enough."
"The problem with Japan is, indeed, not so much tariffs but the fact that EU exporters and investors still face all sorts of non-tariff barriers."
"Typical examples of these include cumbersome approval processes for medical equipment and certain food products, and lack of convergence with internationally recognised standards for car parts and components."
"Barriers in these areas have been in place in the Japanese market for decades."
"We have raised these matters in the various bilateral dialogues between Japan and the EU over the past few years but little progress has been achieved so far."
"In the light of this, we would need an agreement that would also tackle non-tariff barriers, increase market access for investment and open the Japanese public procurement market."
"The focus of the high-level group's trade discussions has been on exploring how to achieve progress on these issues."
"A degree of progress has thus been delivered on a limited number of non-tariff measures from a list identified by the EU, namely three out of 27, but for most non-tariff measures on the list, we feel that Japan has failed to present a credible road map demonstrating how the problems should be solved."
"So, in the Commission's view, what has been achieved in the high-level group provides, at this stage, no more than a good basis for further discussion."
"On 25 March 2011, the European Council reiterated the strategic importance of the EU-Japan relationship, confirming that 'the forthcoming summit must be used to strengthen this relationship and bring forward our common agenda'."
"In this regard, the conditions for a successful FTA should be explored on the basis that Japan can demonstrate its willingness to tackle, inter alia, non-tariff barriers and restrictions on public procurement."
"Discussions are still ongoing with Japan."
"Last week, I met Foreign Minister Matsumoto precisely to discuss this matter."
"In my opinion, it is not yet clear how far we can progress, in the limited time before the EU-Japan Summit, with regard to fulfilling the Council's conditions."
"In particular, more work is needed in order to arrive at a shared level of ambition on agreeing the contents of the negotiation, as well as an ambitious but realistic outcome."
"This could be achieved through a so-called 'scoping' exercise, which could be conducted after the summit."
"Once that has been done, we would examine the results and decide whether or not to launch the negotiations."
"On the trade and economic side, the level of ambition should include, at least, aiming for the following: 100% duty and quota-free treatment for all goods; a robust and credible road map for eliminating a critical mass of non-tariff measures; an open investment regime to achieve levels of foreign direct investment into Japan comparable to those of other OECD countries; and a government procurement market with a level of openness matching those of the EU countries at all levels of government."
"I should also mention that, if the summit leaders decide to go ahead with the option of a comprehensive bilateral legal framework, this should include both trade and investment relations and political relations and cooperation."
"This comprehensive approach, encompassing all bilateral, political and economic relations in a balanced way, is necessary in order to fulfil our targets and our ambitions for a deeper strategic partnership."
"We are, indeed, at a crucial stage in our economic relations with Japan, and there are still some issues that need to be clarified."
"I therefore welcome this debate and look forward to hearing your views on how we should shape this relationship in the years to come."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my sincere thanks to the Commissioner for giving us an overview of the current status of the trade relations between the European Union and Japan."
"Unfortunately, I get the impression that the situation with regard to these trade relations has barely improved in the last two years."
"You mentioned the summit in 2009 and the high-level dialogue and I get the impression that so far in these talks, we have not succeeded in obtaining any obvious additional market access for European companies in Japan."
"Now that the first initiative, namely, this high-level dialogue, has been unsuccessful, I am very concerned that our primary concern is not the question of how we can perhaps achieve tangible success in this high-level dialogue, but instead we are already considering whether we should not negotiate a free trade agreement."
"I can well imagine that a free trade agreement with Japan would make sense, but before we enter into such negotiations, it is not too much to ask that we first wait for the results from the existing instrument, namely this high-level dialogue."
"I want to be very open about this and I am not saying this in order to take away any negotiating chips from Japan, but because I would genuinely like to see whether Japan is serious about intensifying trade relations with us and genuinely opening up its markets and also its attitude to our products."
"I would be very interested - unfortunately, Commissioner, you did not mention this at all just now - in how you intend to involve the European Parliament in the issuing of the mandate."
"I have the impression that we would have a great deal to say on the subject of Japan."
"With regard to the negotiations with India, Canada and also Korea, we as Parliament have repeatedly been critical of the fact that, in our view, the wrong priorities were set to some extent in the negotiations, and therefore it would be very helpful if you would involve Parliament very closely in this matter right from the issuing of the mandate."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Council's request to open negotiations with Japan on the conclusion of a free trade agreement must be assessed very carefully."
"We therefore welcome the Commissioner's cautious approach to this issue and we call on Parliament as a whole to follow that approach, which inspired our group's motion for a resolution."
"The new Japanese Government has demonstrated - at least verbally - its willingness to open up its market, one of the most closed markets in the developed world."
"This positive attitude must be verified in practice, especially with regard to the 27 non-tariff barriers identified by the European Union, which must be lowered so that we can open negotiations with Japan and make them one of the priorities of our trade policy."
"We believe that improving these relations can help make Europe more competitive, since Japan accounts for 9% of world GDP, or over 35% when its GDP is added to our own."
"Today, however, we cannot adopt resolutions unless they make the opening of free trade agreement negotiations subject to specific, binding and verifiable conditions; namely, that there will be genuine reciprocity and a proper impact assessment."
"Firstly, Japan's protectionist policy in the automotive sector concerns us, because there is an imbalance between exports and imports."
"Secondly, we wish to raise the issue of non-tariff barriers."
"I am talking about a whole range of standards, from health and plant health measures to technical standards - especially in the agricultural and automotive sectors - export subsidy rules, customs checks and factors allowing for counterfeiting and also triangular trade with China and Korea."
"To conclude, ladies and gentlemen, we ask that before Europe declares itself willing to open negotiations on the conclusion of a free trade agreement, it resolutely defines the Community interest that it intends to protect and specifies the areas in which it will request reciprocity from Japan."
"We hope that the Commission will take these comments of ours on board."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, in December last year, I visited Japan and one of the concerns that was raised repeatedly by the Japanese officials was the slow progress in trade relations between the European Union and Japan."
"We all know that, unlike some other EU partners in the Far East, we share common values of democracy, human rights and the liberal market economy with Japan, making her a more natural partner for the European Union."
"At the 19th EU-Japan Summit in April last year, it was agreed to establish a joint high-level group in order to analyse the progress in EU-Japan relations so far and draw up suggestions for streamlining our current activities."
"The importance of continuing to work on non-tariff issues was also stressed in the context of the joint high-level group and I hope that these agreements can be put into practice as soon as possible."
"I would like to speak in favour of timely and concrete steps to alleviate non-tariff barriers in order to liberalise EU-Japan trade relations."
"Both markets would benefit greatly from upgrading trade relations between the EU and Japan, especially keeping in mind innovation and technologies."
"I would also welcome further cooperation on matters relating to cyber security."
"I hope that we can improve trade relations with Japan and I look forward to further progress in these relations."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, it is quite desirable to review the trading arrangements that we have with other countries and it is quite understandable that Japan sees the FTA as particularly attractive in relation to the recent Korea FTA."
"There is a lot that we can support in the EPP-ALDE-ECR resolution but I think that they are making a mistake to 'strongly support' an FTA."
"That is a direct quote from paragraph 2."
"I think that is premature support when we do not have impact assessments on the environmental and social effects of an FTA."
"They are predicting the answer before identifying the effects of implementing the solution."
"Many people have commented about the non-tariff barriers and the work that has yet to be done by the high-level group."
"I think that needs a positive step forward."
"When we bear in mind the importance of Japan as a trading partner - with bilateral trade with the EU standing at EUR 120 billion a year, and with the EU being the number three trading partner for Japan and the number two investor in Japan - I think we recognise that any bilateral agreement runs the risk of undermining multilateral agreements with the rest of the world and, in particular, with the developing countries."
"So I think that strong unconditional support for an FTA needs to be revised."
"Finally, I would like to say that, whilst we have every sympathy with Japan, future trade policies simply cannot be based on who has had the most recent natural disaster."
"Madam President, Commissioner, just one topic should be the focus of attention when the summit is held between the European Union and Japan at the end of this month: the disaster that has devastated the people of Japan as a result of earthquakes, the tsunami and continuing radioactive contamination, and the concrete role that can be played by the EU, its Member States and individual citizens in helping to deal with the resulting problems in the short, medium and long term."
"That is why I once again wish to express my deepest sympathies to the Japanese people."
"We must immediately extend offers of partnership and help in dealing with this disaster - particularly in view of the debate we have just held on Pakistan."
"The summit must produce concrete decisions, particularly in relation to cooperation in clearing contaminated areas and joint research and development in the area of renewable energy."
"The possible development of our trade relations and economic cooperation through a corresponding agreement should not be simply a response to the nuclear accident."
"For this reason, negotiations should not begin too hastily, but should be examined with due care, paying particular attention to the different traditions and lifestyle."
"In view of the size and strength of the two economies, particular care is required when agreeing a comprehensive, bilateral trade agreement."
"Many issues have been raised, including intellectual property rights and public procurement, and the investment capital has reduced the scope for political action on both sides."
"That is why long-term impact assessments are required in relation to the relevant chapters and aspects of any economic and trade policy cooperation agreed in the future between the 27 EU Member States and Japan."
"For this reason, the European Parliament, as a codecision-making authority, as well as the public at large, must also be consulted."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Madam President, most people know - but many do not - that, shortly after a country becomes a member of the EU, all its trade agreements are negotiated by the Commission and, specifically, the EU Trade Commissioner."
"Under this arrangement, the interests of all 27 Member States need to be satisfied, which, of course, means in practice that they will not be."
"In consequence, an EU-negotiated trade agreement is likely to be less beneficial for an individual Member State - and, I have to say, the UK in particular - than if the Member State had been able to negotiate for itself."
"Now, the rationale for all this is that the EU is a large trading bloc and because of this clout, the EU is able to negotiate a trade treaty that would not be open to a Member State to negotiate on its own."
"But what do we find here?"
"The negotiations for the EU trade treaty with Japan have not even properly started, as the Commissioner said."
"Meanwhile, the comparatively small, but dynamic, economy of Switzerland already has a trade treaty with Japan, and has had since 2009."
"Once again, here is further proof that the UK and the other contributing Member States would be much better off outside the bureaucratic contraption that is the European Union."
"(DE) Madam President, in 2009 between them, the EU and Japan produced more than one quarter of the world's economic output and accounted for over 20% of world trade, which is why a well-conceived free trade agreement with Japan is of central importance for the EU."
"There are synergy effects that can be exploited, as well as shared challenges, such as competition with China and secure access to raw materials."
"However, bilateral safeguard clauses are also important in this agreement."
"I am thinking of sensitive economic sectors such as the automotive, electronics, aerospace and mechanical engineering industries."
"I am certain that Japan can and will be a fair and reliable partner."
"The bottom line is that however important Japan may be as a trading partner, European citizens must be protected from any risk from radioactive contaminated products."
"(DE) Madam President, Mr De Gucht, ladies and gentlemen, this may seem an unusual way to open a speech in the European Parliament, but I must admit that I am not sure that this is the right time to conclude a trade agreement with Japan - or indeed whether such an agreement is advisable at all."
"There are three reasons for my uncertainty."
"The first question is whether we are actually undermining our attempt to establish a multilateral agreement by agreeing a large number of external trade agreements with highly significant trading partners."
"Are we not in danger of concentrating too much on concluding individual agreements, which may prevent us from pursuing a multilateral system with appropriate and sufficient vigour?"
"Secondly, so far, I have not got the feeling that Japan is really meeting us half way in terms of market protectionism and non-tariff trade barriers."
"The wheels should already have been set in motion, otherwise the entire agreement is in danger of being too one-sided."
"My third question is: what are the consequences?"
"I do not intend to judge whether this is good or bad for us in the final analysis."
"However, I would like to know in advance how the social consequences are to be assessed, and how things look in terms of the environment or labour market."
"These are issues that I do not believe have been entirely clarified."
"Surely these questions should have been better assessed and researched in advance."
"As some of my fellow Members have pointed out, if these points were to be clarified, the Commission would be well advised to consult the European Parliament when issuing a mandate."
"This would avoid many of the difficulties encountered with other trade agreements because we were not consulted."
"I would welcome such a procedure for all future trade agreements."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it would seem that some groups are very sure that it is right for us now to seek a very ambitious free trade agreement with Japan."
"As you have heard, my group is not so sure."
"I myself have great sympathy with this position because I believe that by strengthening cooperation in trade, we can help generate a new economic dynamism in Japan, following the disaster that has befallen the country."
"However, there are some fundamental questions that are inescapable."
"I do not intend to repeat what has been said about the need to predict the consequences in the bilateral area, or about the fact that we should avoid the mistake of first defining free trade priorities and then moulding European industrial policy to these as a dependent variable, or that the question of making a contribution to sustainability must be taken into consideration."
"I should like to emphasise something else: I believe that the effects that such a free trade agreement between two of the giants of international trade would have on the entire structure of global trade must be discussed in greater detail than has been the case heretofore."
"When two such mammoths of the commercial trade sector enter into negotiations on a free trade agreement, then this is not simply a bilateral matter."
"Until now, there has been no free trade agreement between two economic superpowers, so this would be a first."
"But what does that mean?"
"What is the strategic perspective?"
"What effect will this have?"
"It is not enough simply to say we want multilateral trade and if we do not get it, then we will stick with the bilateral dimension of free trade and wait to see what happens."
"We are also responsible for making the implications clear to the European public, which is why the involvement of Parliament in the issuing of the mandate, as called for by several of my fellow Members, must be central."
"(RO) Madam President, the economies of the European Union and Japan account for 35% of global GDP."
"I believe that a free trade agreement between these two economic powers could provide benefits for both sides."
"However, the first thing which needs to be done is to remove the difficulties which form the basis and, in practical terms, stand in the way of drafting a really profitable agreement for both sides."
"The Japanese market is currently subject to barriers, non-tariff barriers, as my fellow Members have also mentioned, which restrict import access, thereby impacting as a whole on trade activities and investments."
"As part of the negotiations it is conducting, the European Commission must strive both to promote a more transparent regulatory policy, which will help European companies to understand fully the rules for conducting trade with Japanese partners, and to deregulate access to public procurement."
"Finally, I also think that an impact study needs to be carried out, which will examine the effects of any agreement, particularly in the area of vulnerable European industries, such as the car industry, electronics and aeronautics."
"(SK) Madam President, Commissioner, Japan shares many common interests with the European Union that are not limited to political issues, but also extend to economic and trade cooperation."
"Although both Japan and the European Union are mature economies, their trade cooperation has failed to exploit the opportunities presented by their economic clout."
"In addition to duties, more effective trade cooperation is hindered by the numerous obstructions that Japan has placed in the way of standardisation and access to public procurement and government contracts."
"Although I believe that it is in our interest to improve trade cooperation with Japan, we must strive to make our cooperation correct, open, balanced and beneficial to both parties."
"I would therefore like to express my support for the European Commission in its pursuit of this objective."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I should just like to touch upon two points."
"First, the relationship between bilateral and multilateral agreements."
"Some Members have advanced the idea that we should concentrate on the multilateral agreements rather than the bilateral ones."
"We do!"
"As you know, the multilateral negotiations for the Doha Round are in dire straits, and we are the only big trading bloc that has been making proposals recently to try to bridge the differences between the developed and the emerging economies with respect to industrial sectors."
"But while we are really concentrating on the multilateral aspects of trade, on the other hand, we should not neglect all our bilateral relations with important trading partners."
"Secondly, with respect to Japan, as many among you have been saying, it is really a 'chicken and egg' situation."
"Do you start the negotiations and then hope that in the course of the negotiations, you can resolve the non-tariff barriers that have been in place for many years, or do you rather try to do away with the majority of the non-tariff barriers as a precondition for negotiations on the free trade agreement?"
"I think that, to a certain extent, we need that conditionality, because the real problem with Japan is not so much tariffs."
"Of course, the idea would be to eliminate 100% of tariffs, which normally you would not have with a developing or an emerging economy."
"The real problem is with respect to non-tariff barriers."
"We have been proposing a list of 27 non-tariff barriers which we think are crucial for our trade relationship, but in only three cases out of the 27 is there now a solution on the table which seems to be acceptable."
"The Japanese claim that they have solutions for all the rest too, but we cannot see a solution in the proposals that they have been making to us."
"So we believe that we need a scoping exercise so that we know what we are talking about."
"I hope that, in the course of that scoping exercise, we can do away with a number of non-tariff barriers, and that this will create the right climate for us to get down to actual free trade negotiations with Japan."
"That is how we see it."
"We see it, at least partially, as a precondition that we should stick to."
"I have received four motions for resolutions tabled in accordance with Rule 115(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday, 11 May 2011."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"I believe that a rapprochement in the field of aeronautics will create a huge opportunity for the European and Japanese economies."
"The European aircraft industry has long been the chief supplier of civil and military technology in the international market."
"Japan is also carrying out research into advanced solutions for general aviation as well as for passenger transport and cargo."
"It is estimated that the transport of passengers and goods by air will be one of the fastest growing branches in the coming decades."
"It is true that we already have examples of cooperation between partners from the European Union and Japan, including the EC 145 helicopter, designed jointly by Eurocopter and Kawasaki, but the potential for cooperation could be much greater in my opinion."
"I appeal for action to be taken for rapid European-Japanese cooperation in aeronautics, at company level as well as in research and development units."
"Transitional arrangements for bilateral investment agreements between Member States and third countries (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Carl Schlyter, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing transitional arrangements for bilateral investment agreements between Member States and third countries"
"- C7-0172/2010 -."
"Madam President, this has been a complicated issue to deal with."
"We have over a thousand bilateral investment agreements."
"According to the Treaty of Lisbon, this falls within the competence of the EU."
"How should we handle this situation?"
"It is not proving to be very easy."
"We have had a lot of meetings and we have tried to find a common position, but without success."
"I might as well be honest about that."
"We will have to vote on it and see what Parliament's position will be."
"I would have liked us to have had a position that we all agreed on in order to be better placed to enter into negotiations with the Council."
"We would then have been able to defend Parliament's powers and principles as laid down in the Treaty."
"That was not to be, on account of the fact that this is a sensitive subject, particularly when it comes to how to deal with the old agreements."
"With regard to the new agreements that the Member States are continuing and are entitled to enter into, we could undoubtedly have agreed on a policy in which there is a reasonable balance between the rights of investors and other rights."
"This was difficult to do with regard to the old agreements, however, and I have therefore retained the compromises that we proposed in committee, as the vote was very even."
"I still hope that we have a more up-to-date view of the investment agreements than was the case with many of these old agreements, where we were the ones who invested in other countries."
"Nowadays, we have at least as many investments coming into our Member States."
"We must therefore make sure that we have the necessary scope in our policy and also that investments are adapted to more developed, modern work in relation to the environment and social matters."
"We must defend this part of the Treaty."
"Investment policy cannot fail to take it into account, either."
"As I said, we will have to see how the vote goes tomorrow."
"Another problem we have here is the fact that we cannot even use the reasoning of providing maximum protection for investments."
"That is not the right way to create legal certainty."
"Since the new trade policy is more balanced, we must also have a more balanced view of what maximum protection can entail."
"We surely do not want to provide maximum protection here to foreign state-owned companies, or even companies owned by dictatorships, at the expense of human rights and the environment."
"This is a balance that I hope we will be able to achieve."
"The idea is not that we should use investment agreements to achieve social objectives, but neither should they prevent us from achieving social and environmental objectives."
"This is a far-reaching debate."
"Another important debate concerns transparency."
"We recognise that Parliament and the EU have been given new competences."
"The Commission is now responsible."
"Therefore, it must also have access to the documents."
"We must increase transparency."
"Many of these agreements were written at a time when there were hardly any cases of dispute settlements."
"Now we have more than 300 cases and ongoing procedures."
"This must, therefore, be opened up to better scrutiny."
"We cannot have this total secrecy and I very much hope that, irrespective of what we think about this link between policy and investment, when it comes to transparency, we can stand united and defend openness and the new competences bestowed on us by the Treaty."
"I truly hope that that will be the case."
"I therefore hope that Amendment 13 will receive support."
"Without it, we will have absolutely no democratic control over these procedures."
"We need this if we are to retain and defend legal certainty."
"We are also seeing a tendency for many other countries, like the United States, Australia and Canada for example, to start to look at renewing their agreements."
"It will be good if we can agree to update the existing dispute mechanisms and judicial procedures, because these are outdated and need to be brought up to date and made more transparent."
"Then we will have an investment policy for the future."
"That will be dealt with in a different context - the debate about the future itself."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, the regulation on transitional arrangements for bilateral investment treaties is an important legislative initiative."
"The Lisbon Treaty has entrusted the Union with a new exclusive competence on foreign direct investment."
"The continued existence, since the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, of more than 1 200 investment-related international agreements concluded by Member States is not questioned under international law."
"However, it is incompatible, under EU law, with the new exclusive competence on foreign direct investment."
"At the same time, these agreements serve as a valuable source of legal protection for European investors operating abroad."
"Because the Lisbon Treaty does not contain arrangements clarifying the status of bilateral agreements, we need to establish legal certainty for investors benefiting from these agreements by authorising their continued existence."
"While it is important to authorise existing investment agreements, it is also important to foresee the possibility of taking action in a cooperative manner to address important issues that could arise with regard to the content of the agreements and their interaction with EU investment policy."
"We have to reserve appropriate mechanisms for Union action to permit the development and implementation of the policy at EU level."
"I understand that, in relation to the Commission proposal, the scope for such action is the most difficult issue - for Parliament and even more so for the Council."
"So the challenge we have here is to find a solution that safeguards the principles I have just outlined and is acceptable to both Parliament and the Council."
"We realise, in this respect, that there are still some considerable gaps to be bridged between the institutions but, at the end of the day, we will have to find a compromise in the interests of the EU and of its investors."
"We believe that the amendments adopted by the Committee on International Trade constitute a basis for finding such a solution."
"They maintain fundamental trust in the Commission's proposal but, at the same time, seek a potential compromise."
"We note with satisfaction here that Articles 5 and 6 would still leave the Commission the power to review investment agreements and withdraw authorisation should such agreements create major problems."
"Given the positions of the main protagonists in this process, we will all have to show some level of flexibility."
"The Commission is ready to play its part, to be flexible and to facilitate an agreement between Parliament and the Council, but this cannot be at any cost."
"We will be vigilant on the basic principles of our proposal."
"The existence of the bilateral investment agreements needs to be safeguarded but, at the same time, we cannot unconditionally bless agreements if they create significant problems."
"The Commission fully shares Parliament's sentiment that the competence on investment should be exercised primarily at EU level, and we support the objective of Europeanisation of investment negotiations."
"However, I need to make clear that the Commission will not be able to negotiate with all countries targeted for investment protection by Member States."
"Our Member States have investment treaties with more than 100 countries."
"Replacing those will be a very gradual exercise, taking years."
"That is why it is important to create an effective mechanism empowering the Member States, under certain conditions, to continue negotiating and concluding bilateral investment agreements."
"Such a mechanism should respect the procedures and prerogatives of the institutions involved."
"Finally, it needs to be emphasised that we are approaching a decisive stage of the legislative process, and time is becoming a major factor."
"It is important because the longer the adoption of the regulation takes, the longer the limbo period lasts, with the potential to create legal uncertainty for investors."
"I hope that, after the vote, Parliament and the Council can sit down together to find an early agreement on this issue."
"We are ready actively to support them in that endeavour."
"Madam President, I would like to begin by thanking Mr Schlyter, who, as the main rapporteur, created the appropriate framework for the committee's work in building a majority, in order to draw up a proposal which will achieve - and has achieved - a committee majority."
"As Mr Schlyter said, whatever happens tomorrow - the voting results are anyone's guess - I hope they will reflect what has been done by the committee."
"Creating a common investment policy for the European Union is a very important step forward in the integration of the European Union."
"If firms within the European Union compete jointly within the same framework, on the same principles, the same should be true externally; they should have the same system of legal protection."
"I also agree with Mr De Gucht."
"I am very pleased that he is supporting the proposal negotiated by the committee, because it really is a very good compromise between various standpoints: a compromise between the Commission's standpoint, on the one hand, and the opinions presented by the Member States, and, on the other, it is compatible with investors' interests, but most of all, it opens up good prospects for the Union's investment policy in the future, serving the Union as a whole."
"It is very important that we are creating a new system, beginning by establishing a solid legal basis created by the agreements currently in force, and which were negotiated by Member States so that a common system of protection for the entire European Union could at last be established."
"It is important that the resolution which will be voted on tomorrow should be quickly agreed with the Council."
"This is something which is very important."
"I hope it will happen this year, with the active participation and support of the Commission."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen."
"In the era of the globalised economy, the European Union's common commercial policy seems quite natural to us."
"In this light, an initiative for the European Union to coordinate investment policy seems just as normal."
"The current system, relying on Member States' numerous overlapping, and sometimes conflicting, bilateral investment agreements, should be replaced within a reasonable timeframe by a new framework of European Union investment agreements consistent with the horizontal objectives of EU policies."
"Personally, I would be in favour of placing the main emphasis on development policy."
"I agree with the rapporteur that the transition to the new regime should not take place overnight but should play out within a predetermined transitional period, the duration and rules of which should be established in advance so as to avoid any legal uncertainty."
"Without such a timeline, the regulation would allow parallel, potentially incompatible investment schemes to emerge."
"A sufficiently long transition is needed to make the open-ended duality in EU investment policy unacceptable for Parliament, as the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union states that investment policy is fully within the competence of the European Union."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to Mr Schlyter for his excellent report on a sensitive issue on which a great deal of common sense is needed."
"Not all investment agreements can be replaced by European agreements, but not even the Commission can ignore agreements that infringe European provisions, and we agree with the rapporteur about placing the emphasis on transparency."
"Ideally, we should have a clause that automatically repeals the 1 200 agreements currently in force."
"Unfortunately, however, that would mean legal uncertainty for investors and too much work, perhaps, for the Commission."
"Our amendments in the Committee on International Trade have been successful, firstly, in ensuring that the Commission's powers are fully respected and, secondly, in stating that legal certainty should be guaranteed."
"Some of the amendments on which we will be voting tomorrow in plenary may now alter this compromise and balance, and I call on my fellow Members, and the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs in particular, to come up with a balanced measure that is acceptable to all."
"Madam President, Mr De Gucht, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Schlyter, for his hard work and for trying, in the spirit of the European Parliament, to find a satisfactory compromise for all sides, and looking for the best solution and developing this on a cooperative basis."
"This is not a simple issue."
"It involves a common European Union investment policy in the context of international trade policy with all their concomitant effects on the situation in the EU and the Member States with regard to social, economic and employment policy, weighing up the interests of financial groups, big business and economic enterprises, on the one hand, and those of the trade unions and workers on the other."
"That is why it is important that such an agreement should be reached on a democratic basis and that citizen's should remain confident in the controlling role of Parliament."
"For this reason, I hope that tomorrow's vote will show that the compromise that has been sought is supported by Parliament."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Madam President, the Lisbon Treaty is normally regarded as having been constitutional in its scope; but what we have here is an example of how the Lisbon Treaty will impact, and impact adversely, on the commerce of Member States."
"I know we are discussing transitional arrangements but what matters is that the Lisbon Treaty has removed from Member States the right to negotiate bilateral investment treaties."
"Some time in the future, and it is still not clear when, bilateral investment treaties will fall under the Commission."
"Because of Lisbon, investment treaties can become an instrument for the Commission's political objectives - and not just the Commission's: we can be absolutely sure that the Greens will try to advance their political programme, and we have seen that in the trade treaties time after time."
"Attempts will be made to tack on to every investment treaty the full Green agenda."
"Now the Greens are talented politicians - and I say this in admiration."
"They will often succeed, and in consequence, investment and hence commerce in all Member States will be hamstrung and hobbled."
"By contrast, countries outside the EU will not be subject to the Greens' Pantomime of the Ents, if you remember those characters in the Lord of the Rings."
"It is all very, very depressing."
"(DE) Madam President, the security of investments both at home and abroad is of key importance for economic development both in Europe and in the relevant partner countries."
"The only way to secure existing jobs or to create new employment is by safeguarding investments."
"That is why there are two things that I regard as being important."
"Firstly, the over one thousand agreements already in existence must be retained."
"It makes no sense to cast investors, Member States and others into a state of legal uncertainty."
"Secondly, and this is particularly important for us: in future, we will have to have many common European agreements that apply to all 27 Member States and investors from these Member States if we are also to have a uniform level of protection within the European internal market."
"For this reason, I am very grateful to my fellow Members - Mr Schlyter, as well as Mr Zalewski, Mr Sturdy and Mr Rinaldi - because they have tried and succeeded in finding a broad consensus."
"I think it would be a good thing if the other groups would reconsider this issue and recognise that the compromise on the table is actually a very good solution that tries to cater to all needs."
"For my own group, I would like to state clearly once again that we want a good solution for investors, workers and Member States."
"We are looking for speedy negotiations with the Council, so that this issue is not put on the long finger, but that a solution is found soon."
"On account of the differences between the groups, my group favours completing the first reading this week."
"Finally, I would like to add that we would be very open to finding a swift solution in the second reading - and we would be very grateful if this were possible - in other words, we would suggest that, rather than following the normal procedure of the second reading, we should try to find a so-called early second-reading agreement."
"Once again, I would like to thank all those involved."
"I think that by adopting this legislative process, the Committee on International Trade is showing that we are capable of dealing with complex issues and complex dossiers within a reasonable timeframe."
"(RO) Madam President, since 2009, commercial policy has come under the exclusive remit of the European Union and we must now find a common denominator for a large part of foreign investment policy."
"There will therefore be a transition period during which the competences relating to bilateral investment agreements between Member States and third countries will be transferred at EU level."
"In this situation, I believe that adopting an EU-level procedure for verifying and reviewing bilateral investment agreements is preferable to a formal intergovernmental arrangement."
"The role of completing the implementation of the changes must be given to the European Commission and not to Member States, so as to ensure protection of the common interest."
"This is why the European executive has to guarantee both legal certainty for the investors due to be affected by the transition process and equivalent investment conditions for companies from all the European Union's Member States."
"(NL) Madam President, the Netherlands, my native Member State, has been a trading nation for centuries, and the Commissioner ought to respect that, because we have formed a single country through working together."
"The Dutch business community is amongst the largest investors worldwide."
"Indeed, the Netherlands has entered into 98 bilateral investment agreements with a very high level of protection."
"The proposed authorisation system gives the Commission overly extensive powers to withdraw approval from current investment agreements and too little certainty for these."
"The threat that Member States might have to cancel their current bilateral investment agreements at the Commission's instigation before the EU enters into a new agreement with an equivalent level of protection is unacceptable."
"Authorisations should only be withdrawn when the EU has negotiated a new agreement with an identical level of protection."
"(DE) Madam President, there are four issues I would like to address very briefly."
"The first is that this project should come under an enormous banner guaranteeing security and reliability for investors who wish to invest in the EU, as well as investors in the EU who wish to invest elsewhere."
"Both groups must be able to rely on the support of the existing contracts."
"Secondly: while we should be very grateful to the rapporteur for his truly comprehensive work, we should avoid trying to pack too much into trade agreements."
"I must contradict the rapporteur because this is quite a typical process for dealing with differences of opinion at committee or parliamentary level and not everything can be accommodated by compromises."
"Accordingly, I should like to thank the rapporteur for his fairness in our cooperation."
"Let us wait and see how the vote goes tomorrow."
"Thirdly, I welcome Mr De Gucht's statement that the Commission was not questioning the existing agreements."
"This does not mean that the EU should not quickly conclude new agreements now that the Union has been reconstituted under the Treaty of Lisbon."
"However, if Mr De Gucht believes this to be the case, he will certainly agree with the significant weakening of the instrument for examining existing agreements, which we voted on in an amendment, and with the limitation of the reasons for withdrawing approval to four clear criteria."
"Which brings me to my final point: it has been made quite plain in these discussions and during the committee's work that there are different interests at stake here, depending on how many bilateral agreements one's own country has concluded."
"That is why it is a good thing that a transitional period is clearly defined in this directive."
"Madam President, out of some 2 500 bilateral investment treaties in the world, 1 500 concern EU Member States."
"Outside trade and investment are essential for economic recovery."
"I doubt whether many external markets trust trade packages with the EU in the light of the failing euro and the Commission's botched attempts to save three of its Member States' economies."
"What sort of effect will EU exclusive competency on bilateral investment have on Member States?"
"The UK has a trade deficit with the EU and relies on negotiations with third countries, many of which have been in place for years and relate to our Commonwealth of Nations."
"I am appalled that the EU is seeking to implement a device to proffer national packages at Union level by majority voting, undermining the ability of individual Member States to gain or maintain advantages that may substantially support domestic economies."
"I would like to ask the Commission whether it actually recognises pacta sunt servanda in international law."
"(EL) Madam President, the adoption of a common foreign investment policy which safeguards equal treatment for all European investors is a very important move."
"However, until such time as it is possible to conclude investment agreements at Union level, a legal vacuum - the legal uncertainty referred to by Mr Caspary - needs to be avoided and the necessary security of law must exist for European investors."
"I would point out that the legislation of the Member States of the Union, in conjunction with unifying legislation, provide every guarantee needed for third country investors."
"On the other hand, if a high level of protection is to be safeguarded for Europeans investing in third countries, the current bilateral agreements executed by individual Member States of the Union need to remain in force."
"The draft resolution does not, in my opinion, safeguard the necessary security of law in any way whatsoever."
"I refer, in particular, to the points relating to: firstly, the Commission's discretionary powers to withdraw the authorisation to maintain existing agreements or to approve new negotiations to amend current or execute new agreements; secondly, the provision to review the legal framework within five years; and thirdly, the extremely time-consuming procedures for executing new agreements."
"The amendments adopted by the Committee on International Trade are, in my view, a move in the right direction."
"I repeat, the objective should be to maintain existing and simplify the procedure for executing and applying new bilateral agreements."
"(RO) Madam President, Member States' investment policies must be harmonised at EU level as part of a common commercial policy."
"Member States should ensure that bilateral investment agreements are compatible with the Union's development policies."
"The Commission must gradually replace existing agreements with new ones which will offer an ideal system for protecting investments."
"Due to the risky nature of direct foreign investments, a high level of legal certainty must be guaranteed during the transition period."
"In this regard, I welcome the approach adopted by the Commission and rapporteur, based on coexistence."
"It is vital for bilateral agreements to remain in force and for Member States to be able to finalise negotiations or initiate new ones."
"Finally, I support setting a timeframe with a deadline for the transition from Member States' bilateral agreements to EU international agreements."
"(SK) Madam President, Commissioner, the protection of EU Member States' cross-border investments has become an extremely complex and delicate issue following the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"More than 1 200 bilateral investment agreements concluded by Member States under different, frequently incompatible, legal regimes need to be placed comprehensively under the auspices of the European Union without impairing the rights of the parties involved."
"The only possible way out of the legal stagnation brought about by transferring Member States' powers to the European Union would appear to be a principle allowing both sets of agreements to coexist over a transitional period, in order for Member States to renegotiate existing bilateral agreements or, in line with EU investment policy, to complete negotiations on agreements under preparation."
"Even so, proper cooperation between the Commission and Member States must be maintained throughout this process, so that there is absolutely no loss of legal certainty for investors and contracting parties."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I would simply like to touch upon the question that has been raised by several Members of this Parliament on compatibility with EU policies."
"We aim to be flexible and to achieve a good compromise for the transitional regulation."
"These amendments go even further than the Commission's initial proposal for the regulation, as they considerably expand the scope of the review and withdrawal mechanisms which are already a source of major concern for Member States and many Members of Parliament."
"These new criteria, relating to incompatibilities with established policies of the Union or general principles of the Union set out in Article 21 of the Treaty, could be regarded as opening the door to all sorts of additional requirements that existing investment agreements should meet."
"I believe such an approach would be strongly opposed by Member States as considerably increasing the level of legal uncertainty for investors benefiting from these agreements."
"To return to the next steps in this procedure, I believe that tomorrow's vote will be an important signal for all stakeholders in this process, and most notably also for the Council as regards the legislative procedure."
"The outcome of tomorrow's vote will be discussed with the Ministers during the public debate next Friday."
"Next Friday, we have a Foreign Affairs Council on trade, and this will be one of the topics that we will discuss."
"I hope - and I am confident - that your votes will provide the basis for an agreement."
"I understand that tomorrow, there will be a vote on the amendments and on the report as a whole but - as Mr Caspary, among others, has said - I hope that this will not hinder us from reaching an early agreement at second reading."
"Madam President, I would like to thank everyone who has participated in the debate."
"It has been difficult."
"Some points that were taken up by Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl and others relate to security and fairness."
"That is precisely what we are all agreed on: investments must be fair, people should be treated fairly and we must have a reasonable level of security."
"At the same time, we cannot over-protect them like molly-coddled infants."
"It is like a minefield sometimes; we take hits occasionally and we develop our awareness."
"On the other hand, the risks must be reasonably predictable and we must be able to understand what risks we are taking."
"If we are too over-protective, we will retain our old industries and miss out on the change and renewal that we need because we do not dare to take new decisions."
"That would be unfortunate."
"Therefore, I do not quite understand the Commissioner's criticism of some of the compromises that are being tabled again here, as we refer to the Treaty and you are the ones who interpret how it is to be applied."
"We are very well aware that you cannot review every single agreement and query everything, but can only look at serious violations."
"It is also good that we are in agreement that Articles 5 and 6 should be retained."
"It would be unfortunate if the Commission's only means of querying an agreement were to be to take the matter to the European Court of Justice."
"If an agreement is called into question and the European Court of Justice says that the agreement is invalid, hundreds of agreements would suddenly become invalid without warning."
"That would certainly not be a practice that would result in legal certainty."
"It is important for Articles 5 and 6 to be retained."
"I completely agree with Mr Caspary that our negotiations should be conducted quickly."
"Irrespective of how the vote goes tomorrow, it is important that we conduct the negotiations quickly."
"I have already spoken to the Hungarian Presidency and it is ready and willing to deal with this matter as soon as we have voted."
"It could also conceive of a decision at first reading, but it does not look as if that will be the case here."
"I do not think that the Earl of Dartmouth need worry that the Greens will take over investment policy."
"There are many forces that wish to keep it precisely as it has been for the last 50 years."
"I have to say that even if you admire our political capability to get proposals through, please do not exaggerate it."
"For my part, I admire your rhetorical skills."
"With their help, perhaps we could get even more green policy through."
"As I have already said, we will have to vote this week and see how it goes."
"I would like to thank those involved and also the Hungarian Presidency, which I have met with on a number of occasions."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday, 10 May 2011."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"An attempt has been made at both WTO and OECD level to introduce comprehensive multinational regulations for foreign direct investment, or FDI, that would apply to all economic sectors."
"The legal protection offered by the bilateral investment treaties (BITs) is important in ensuring that businesses are encouraged to take the step of investing abroad, which can cost many millions."
"The EU is both a recipient and provider of foreign direct investment."
"It remains to be seen whether a move to coordinate the good 200 BITs in operation in the European Union can finally resolve the problem whereby binding BIT arbitration judgments based on international law entail commitments to investors by Member States that give rise to EU Treaty infringement proceedings."
"Direct investment is certainly not the miracle cure claimed during the economic transformation of Central and Eastern Europe, for example."
"Although greater predictability in relation to FDI opportunities for EU investors is something to be welcomed, the potential negative aspects of investment policy, for example, the fear among the local population of redundancies and wage cuts due to outsourcing and the relocation of production, should not be swept under the carpet."
"Likewise, we need to make it clear to developing countries that FDI can only improve living standards if the fundamental institutional requirements are met, such as clear property rights, the independence of the legal system, and political stability."
"I believe there is a lack of honesty in relation to this pseudo-humanitarian development aid."
"One-minute speeches (Rule 150)"
"The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance."
"(PL) Madam President, today is the 61st anniversary of Schuman's declaration."
"Many official celebrations, festivals and parades are taking place to commemorate the anniversary."
"Do not let the celebratory mood blind us to the problems with which the EU is currently wrestling. Firstly, we must reply to the question whether the national self-interest which has appeared in the negotiations over the next financial perspective is in accordance with the calls for solidarity of our founding fathers?"
"Secondly, are initiatives which reverse European integration, such as the latest initiative to restrict the Schengen area, compatible with the spirit of Europe?"
"Finally, does the current crisis in the euro area and the lack of solidarity of Member States in tackling it present a threat to the success of this ambitious project?"
"Unfortunately, there are many more examples pointing to a crisis in European integration."
"On this anniversary, let us take the opportunity to reflect seriously on what to do to stop these detrimental tendencies, and to return to proper, dynamic integration in the future."
"Let us renew the spirit of Europe according to the ideas of Robert Schuman, so that the successes we have had so far in our common project do not fall by the wayside."
"(HU) Madam President, on Europe Day, I would like to speak about the Community idea."
"The legislative package on economic governance represents a new chapter in the life of the Union."
"If observed and enforced, the new system of economic policy governance might finally encourage the Member States of the European Union to establish responsible economic policies."
"However, this is only one of the conditions of stability of Europe."
"The democratic regression recently seen in several Member States is a disturbing phenomenon."
"The governments of certain Member States have crossed the boundaries of the rule of law, which were previously considered to be inviolable; they are restricting the freedom of the press, which is essential for the implementation of real democracy."
"The European Commission and the Council should openly combat democratic regression; if the Commission and the Council do not take action against the democratic deficit in the Union, it will result in severe problems."
"Thank you for your attention."
"(FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, EUR 976 billion have been allocated by the European Union for the period 2007-2013."
"A large proportion of that amount has been awarded to programmes for which subsidies need to be requested from the European Commission."
"A Bulgarian study has shown that the funding for the majority of the approved projects has gone to three or four European countries, with very few of the others participating."
"Unfortunately, the Commission does not have a summary of these findings and their causes, or of the added value of these programmes, and I fear that this will not be taken into account in the next financial framework."
"The Commission pledged to apply the principles of transparency and equal treatment in these programmes."
"That also means doing more to promote opportunities and ensuring fairer access to information."
"I am convinced that the Commission should take steps to promote programmes among interested Europeans while catering for the needs of beneficiaries from new acceding countries."
"Madam President, last week, I met a man in my local church who was arranging his son's memorial service."
"His 37-year old son had died the previous year of cancer."
"No parent should have to go through the pain of losing a child."
"As a mother, I can think of nothing worse."
"But we have over 2 000 parents, brothers, mothers and sisters in Cyprus who are suffering every day as they wonder about the fate of their loved one."
"In 1963-64, civil unrest, and the subsequent Turkish invasion and occupation of Cyprus in 1974, resulted in approximately 2 000 Turkish as well as Greek Cypriots going missing."
"Their fate is unknown, and in 1981, the Committee on Missing Persons was set up and funded primarily by the EU."
"The work they have done in this area has brought peace to many families."
"There is much more work for them to do, with over one and a half thousand people still missing."
"I urge this House to support the work of the CMP, and to support Written Declaration 10 which is humanitarian in its objectives and seeks to bring peace and remembrance and reconciliation to these families."
"(EL) Madam President, today is Europe Day and it reminds us of the objectives on which the European Union must be based: a deepening of the European institutions and a common economic policy which, in our opinion, will set socially fair prosperity and viability as its priorities."
"However, the agreement on the euro is fundamentally a move in the wrong direction, as it does no more than impose the traditional economic orthodoxy."
"Attempts to link the euro to constant cutbacks in the social state and constant pressure on wages and pensions in the long term risk eroding not only political cohesion, but also the European ideal."
"In response to this, we Greens propose the agreement on viable prosperity: integrated fiscal convergence, a truly interventionist and ambitious European budget and mainstreaming of the social and environmental dimensions."
"That is why we want to pave the way to move in a different direction."
"However, no one is entitled to take life-changing decisions without consulting the public."
"The only solution is fundamental dialogue with and direct recourse to the public."
"The intransigence, in the past, of those who handled the European Constitution prevented us from institutionalising European referenda."
"However, we can find alternative solutions, provided that we have the political will."
"We owe it to Europe and its future."
"(EL) Madam President, today is the 66th anniversary of the major anti-fascist grassroots victory on 9 May 1945, when the fascist-imperialist axis between Germany, Japan and Italy and their allies was crushed."
"We honour the dead, the tortured workers, men and women, who fought to crush fascism within the ranks of the communist parties, the national freedom fighters and the anti-fascist movements."
"The organising forces behind the major grassroots victory against the fascist-imperialist axis were the communist parties, with the heroic fight by the people of the Soviet Union altering the course of the war, at a cost of over 20 million dead, thousands injured, villages and towns destroyed and razed to the ground and the destruction of its economy."
"It is a brazen insult to the millions of dead and injured, the victims of fascist and Nazi bestiality in Greece and Europe as a whole, for the European Union to try and wipe out and falsify history: to turn 9 May from a day of anti-fascist grassroots victory into a vulgar celebration as Europe Day, a day which celebrates the European monopolies."
"Today, the working classes and the poor grassroots classes are again suffering one of the worst capitalist crises."
"They face the biggest attack since the end of the Second World War ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Madam President, one of my constituents in London has informed me of serious allegations against a Mr Vladimir Perisic, also known as Dr Vladmir De Rothschild, who claims to be a medical doctor and a specialist surgeon."
"It is alleged that Mr Perisic is not medically qualified, is not registered with the General Medical Council, and that he uses his spurious medical credentials to defraud vulnerable people."
"He allegedly claims to have met David Cameron and persuaded the Department of Health to consider his proposal for an NHS voucher scheme."
"As a result of this, an article featuring him recently appeared, in good faith, in a national Sunday newspaper."
"This could give him further spurious legitimacy to dupe those in need of serious medical care."
"He is potentially a dangerous risk to the public."
"Mr Perisic should be investigated by the relevant UK authorities and the appropriate action taken if the allegations are found to be true."
"The national press might also decide to play a useful role in investigating this matter."
"(RO) Madam President, it is a well-known fact that wherever officials from the International Monetary Fund have been, large popular uprisings have occurred."
"At the moment, these despotic bureaucrats are imposing a ridiculous agreement on Romania whereby between 150 and 200 of the country's existing 400 hospitals will be closed down."
"Seventy-one hospitals have been closed so far, resulting in the deaths of innocent people."
"The alleged reason for this is outrageous."
"These hospitals are supposedly unprofitable."
"However, there is nowhere in the world where hospitals generate money as they provide a different kind of benefit."
"This is why, alarmed at this act of genocide, I lodged a criminal complaint against the IMF's representative in Romania, Jeffrey Franks, as well as against the local henchmen."
"I appeal to the European Parliament and World Health Organisation to take a stance on this to prevent a Member State of the European Union turning into an extermination camp."
"At present, Big Finance, which is attempting to introduce a new world order, is exterminating us, but tomorrow they could also exterminate you."
"I cherish the hope that the IMF does not want to replace al-Qaeda."
"(HU) Madam President, we, the members of the Hungarian community in Romania, imagine the Europe of the future as the Europe of the regions and communities, in which the Roma communities, too, can find their home."
"Today, on Europe Day, the President of Parliament has said: 'We should not retreat behind the borders of our inner circles; let us fight the challenges in unity'."
"I have been following with concern the flare-up of tensions in Transylvania, where the small communities are turning inwards as a result of tension, harassment or fear, shutting out the communities living together with them."
"It is evident in a European region that the future of the Roma community lies not in short-sighted part-measures, but in prospective action by Europe which is founded on solidarity and dialogue."
"The Roma integration strategy being prepared under the direction of the Hungarian Presidency may create the Europe of the future for the Roma communities as well."
"It is the responsibility of the Commission, Parliament, the Member States, the competent authorities and every local community concerned, and all of us, to make this a reality."
"(RO) Madam President, the health service reform proposed by the current Romanian Government is continuing the series of counter-reforms which are leading this country slowly, but surely towards a real social catastrophe."
"The intention behind the so-called health reform proposed by the Boc government in Bucharest is to shut down hospitals, reduce investment in medical equipment and make thousands of nurses and doctors unemployed, which are all drastic measures implemented in a medical service already suffering from a chronic lack of resources."
"Romania is in last place in the European league table for the quality and quantity of medical services."
"Even deeper cuts to healthcare services are a serious attack on human life and integrity."
"The so-called reform proposed by the Boc government is a direct attack on the rights provided for in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"On behalf of Romania's citizens, I call on the European Commission to take a stance and block these inhumane measures which are jeopardising lives and basic rights."
"(SL) Madam President, the agreement reached last week by the Palestinians, that is, by senior representatives of Fatah and Hamas, in which the new interim Egyptian Government was actively involved, opens up new opportunities for the resumption or, rather, the commencement of a genuine Palestinian-Israeli dialogue on peace and coexistence on the basis of the mutual recognition principle."
"I hope that the Israeli Government will rightly value the opportunities this Palestinian agreement brings."
"It is wrong to doubt the additional value of Palestinian unification and the agreement on democratic elections."
"For this reason, the statements made by Prime Minister Netanyahu that the authorities in Ramallah should choose between Israel and Hamas are of no benefit either to peace or to the finding of a solution, or to the realisation of the project whereby the two states would live side by side in a spirit of mutual respect."
"It is right that the democratic changes that are taking place in the Arab world should provide the bedrock for new structures, those of safety, coexistence and development."
"(PL) Madam President, I am taking the floor once again on a very painful matter for Poles in Lithuania."
"In this country, only 7% of the population are Poles, but in certain areas of course, there are more."
"It is very disappointing that before 2004, when Lithuania became a member of the European Union, the Polish minority had more rights than it has now."
"It is a paradox that there has been a regression, especially in educational matters, writing surnames in Polish and the rights and privileges of Poles living in Lithuania."
"I believe that the European Parliament, which is rightly vocal on behalf of various ethnic minorities in Europe and internationally, should also stand up for the Polish minority in Lithuania."
"Madam President, my request to make a one-minute speech on the withdrawal of democratic rights to vote in elections and stand for election in Spain was sent to the Secretariat last Wednesday, at which time the Supreme Court, at the request of the Spanish Government, had banned the Bildu electoral coalition formed by two legal parties, Eusko Alkartasuna and Alternatiba, as well as independent candidates."
"As a member of the Basque Friendship Group 'Toward a peace process in the Basque Country', I was among those signing the declaration aimed at requesting the Spanish Government to reconsider its position and take all necessary measures to ensure that the elections held on 22 May respect basic democratic principles."
"Last Friday, meanwhile, by a decision of the Spanish Constitutional Court, Bildu was allowed to stand for election."
"I very much welcome this decision and wish to express my hope that the elections held on 22 May in the Basque Country will be conducted in accordance with all international standards relating to democracy and electoral law."
"(PT) Mr President, I am Parliament's rapporteur for refugees and I should say that this mission has, in recent times, become a depressing one, if not at times macabre."
"Last month, I informed the House about the deaths of more than 100 refugees off the coast of Lampedusa, and now, still reeling from the shock of learning of the disappearance of 600 refugees who were leaving Libya, we learn of more than 60 who died in full view of the ships of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and several European navies."
"Let us not think that nothing can be done about these tragedies."
"There is a lot to do, that we must do, and that we are obliged to do by the international conventions that we have signed."
"I will give three examples in the 20 seconds I have left."
"The Council should conclude the codecision procedure regarding the resettlement of refugees that this Parliament voted for and that provided for emergency mechanisms for use on these occasions."
"A proposal should be tabled for a humanitarian corridor to remove from Libya refugees recognised as such by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), and NATO should comply with its mandate of protecting civilians, from Resolution 1973, which means carrying out high-sea rescues."
"Failure to help, let us not forget, is a crime and should not happen in our name."
"(SK) Madam President, the Duff Report on the European elections has not, in the end, appeared on the agenda for this part-session."
"Let us use this time to consider it and then reject it next month."
"The idea of a ​​transnational list is absurd."
"I have several questions: Why would Slovak, German or Italian electors vote for people they cannot understand without an interpreter?"
"How will their elected MEPs then represent them if they cannot even read letters sent to them by their constituents?"
"How many times is a Greek MEP going to meet his Slovak voters?"
"What are they going to discuss?"
"Besides, only large Member States will benefit from a pan-European list."
"Approval of this report would vindicate all the Eurosceptics' claims that the European Union harbours ambitions to become a multinational state."
"It will call into question the democratic legitimacy of this Parliament and alienate citizens from the European project even more."
"(EL) Madam President, I wish to comment on the need to safeguard the transparency and efficacy of the Climate Fund."
"One of the most tangible results of negotiations on climate change in Cancún was the agreement on a Green Climate Fund, with unprecedented financing in the order of USD 100 billion."
"While the transitional committee set up within the framework of the UN is preparing the final form of the Fund, so that it can obtain a final seal of approval in Durban at the end of the year, questions relating to the design of this unique and extremely important instrument remain unanswered."
"The Fund must be a carefully designed vehicle that will provide effective financing for adjustment to climate change in the developing world."
"However, both the recent criminal attacks on the Community emissions trading system (EU ETS) and the information in the recent report by Transparency International on corruption in climate funding are causes for concern, not only because huge amounts of money are at risk, but also, more importantly, because a global fight which, unlike others, may not be open to repeat efforts, is at risk."
"(SK) Madam President, in 1990, József Antall declared himself Prime Minister of all Hungarians, including Hungarians living outside Hungary."
"Today, Viktor Orbán has gone even further."
"A new constitution has been adopted, committing Hungary to the idea of a single Hungarian nation consisting of all Hungarians, which is taken to mean all persons belonging to the Hungarian ethnic group, whatever their citizenship."
"Contrary to international law, according to which the promotion and protection of a national minority is the responsibility of the State in which that minority lives, this constitution also stipulates that Hungary is responsible for the fate of Hungarians abroad."
"The new Hungarian constitution also supports efforts to establish the collective, ethnically-based self-government of Hungarian minorities living abroad."
"The provisions of the Hungarian constitution may be a way of meddling in the internal affairs of foreign states and of breeding tension between Hungary and neighbouring countries."
"This is at odds with the spirit of a democratic Europe."
"(FR) Madam President, I wish to express our relief following the decision by the Spanish Constitutional Court to allow the lists submitted by the Bildu coalition to be included in the Basque Country's democratic elections."
"This decision was taken on appeal."
"It therefore overturned the decision of the Supreme Court, which had again banned the Basque nationalist left from standing in elections."
"Would it have been acceptable, at the very heart of the European Union, for citizens to have been deprived again of the right to vote for candidates whom they wished to support?"
"Fortunately, Spain has chosen to stop travelling down this very dangerous road for European democracy."
"We can only be pleased about that, and we must call on Bildu to fulfil the objectives to which it has committed itself: an end to all political violence in the Basque Country and the disbandment of ETA."
"A new political climate is gradually emerging."
"Dialogue is difficult, but a desire for peace has been very clearly expressed."
"I should like the European Parliament to continue to pay close attention to this important development, because the Basque Country is at the very heart of Europe."
"It is essential for Europe that this peace process, which comes 10 years after the Northern Ireland one, receives support and that it can also run its course."
"Madam President, for 12 years, I have been asking the Commission and the Council a question which has remained unanswered, as they claim it is hypothetical."
"On Thursday, the people of Scotland voted in the Scottish parliamentary elections and the Scottish National Party won an overall majority of seats."
"The prospect of a referendum on Scottish independence is now not a matter of 'if', but rather of 'when'."
"Under these new circumstances, I therefore ask the Commission and the Council, once again, whether, if part of an existing EU Member State should choose to separate, the new state would remain a member of the EU, or whether it would have to reapply for membership."
"The people of Scotland deserve a clear answer to a clear question."
"(GA) Madam President, I refer to the fires we had in my home county - Donegal - and elsewhere in Ireland last weekend, when we had fires which destroyed forests, land, fences and wildlife."
"I want to pay particular tribute to the fire services who were out working without sleep for three days or so, and to members of the defence forces - those who were working on the ground or in helicopters."
"They made every effort to control the fire."
"I am heartened by the response of the local community - young people, farmers, business people - who came out to help, along with the police and the civil defence forces."
"Now we need to learn lessons from this."
"We must now put an emergency plan in place so that not a minute is lost if something similar happens again."
"I am saying this, therefore, to thank all those people."
"(SK) Madam President, a hundred years ago, our forefathers fought for an eight-hour working day, a dignified life and better working conditions."
"A labour code is a piece of legislation under which a state provides a system of fundamental social rights for workers."
"The current government in Slovakia is preparing an amendment to its Labour Code that will increase working time to 56 hours per week and overtime from the current 400 hours to 560 hours."
"In addition, it places workers at a disadvantage, creates uncertainty for those in employment, and reduces financial support for those who lose their jobs."
"Paradoxically, the new rules are also destabilising for employers."
"Trade unions have taken to the streets to voice their opposition to the Labour Code amendment."
"The European Parliament declared 2010 the year for combating poverty."
"All of Europe is fighting against poverty."
"The Slovak Government will fuel unemployment and increase poverty with this Labour Code."
"(ES) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should today like to report the death on Sunday of the activist for Cuban human rights, Juan Wilfredo Soto García, and I should also like to express my sincere sympathy to his family."
"The Cuban Government's official story is that his death was caused by pancreatitis, but, according to dissidents inside Cuba, Juan Soto's death was caused by a beating from the police force of Castro's communist regime."
"Guillermo Fariñas, last year's winner of the Sakharov Human Rights Prize, has accused the Cuban regime and, in particular, the First Secretary of the Communist Party, Raúl Castro, of Juan Soto's death."
"It is likely that Raúl Castro incited his followers to use violence against the opposition during the recently finished Sixth Congress of the Communist Party of Cuba, and Cuban dissidents point to him as bearing responsibility for this latest murder."
"I should like to condemn the death of Juan Soto García, and to denounce the lack of freedom and democracy in Cuba."
"(FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, the European food aid programme for the most deprived persons in the EU was urgently introduced during the exceptionally cold winter of 1986, then enshrined the following year in the common agricultural policy."
"This programme has become vital for 13 million Europeans who have little job security."
"It eases the strain on their food budget through distributions by charities and social services, and adds up to a mere EUR 1 per European per year in aid."
"Together with the Federation of Food Banks, Secours populaire, the Red Cross and Restos du Coeur in France, I am concerned about the future of this programme after the European Court of Justice called into question its funding within the framework of the CAP."
"Our Parliament has often emphasised the fundamental nature of the right to food."
"Our institutions made 2010 the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion."
"To cite legal ambiguity as an excuse for dismantling, as some Member States are trying to do, a food aid programme that has proved its worth would be disastrous not only for the people concerned but also for Europe's credibility and image."
"That is why I call on the Commission to take the political measures necessary to safeguard, preserve and strengthen that programme."
"(BG) Madam President, the Romanian border control forces have been detaining illegally for more than 10 days a Bulgarian fishing vessel and its captain, Hristo Spasov, apprehended 20 miles east of Romania's Black Sea coast, an area outside the country's territorial waters."
"Equal access to the European Union's waters and resources is one of the basic principles of the common fisheries policy."
"This principle is confirmed by Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002."
"Following the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the European Union, both countries' marine areas are part of the pan-European waters and the regulations are directly applicable in their national legislations."
"The Bulgarian authorities have forwarded all the necessary documents to their Romanian counterparts, certifying that the vessel is entered in the European Union register and has all the permits for fishing in the Black Sea's waters."
"In spite of this, there has been no progress on the Romanian side."
"The sole response has been that only Romanian legislation and the country's constitution are applicable."
"We express our deep concern that equal access to European Union waters continues to be a huge problem for professional fishermen."
"We call on our fellow MEPs from Romania and the Commission, as guardian of the Treaties, to intervene as mediators to resolve the matter."
"(SK) Madam President, yesterday, we commemorated the end of the Second World War and today we celebrate Europe Day."
"It has to be said that the European Union constitutes a very distinctive and unique model, built primarily on democracy and the coexistence of nations in the European Union."
"At a time when we are commemorating such a significant anniversary, it is all the more dispiriting for us that, just a few days beforehand, the Hungarian Parliament, and later the President of Hungary, sign a constitution that runs counter to the fundamental principles of democracy."
"It is also unfortunate because the Hungarian Government, and Hungary as a country, currently holds the Presidency of the European Union."
"Viktor Orbán, as the Hungarian prime minister, has ridden roughshod over fundamental democratic principles."
"Not only has he refused to cooperate with the opposition in the adoption of this basic law of his country, but, because of the way the constitution has been conceived, he has very fundamentally undermined the rights of minorities, and destabilised good neighbourly relations between EU Member States."
"I therefore hope that the Venice Commission's findings will be directed towards the adoption by this Parliament of a resolution demonstrating that the Fidesz government is bad for Hungary."
"(RO) Madam President, every year, 9 May is celebrated as Europe Day and I take this opportunity to extend my best wishes to all European citizens."
"In his declaration of 9 May 1950, Robert Schuman, the French foreign minister, indicated that Europe would not be built all at once or based on a single plan, but through specific achievements which would primarily generate genuine solidarity."
"The aim of the Schuman Plan was to merge markets, modernise and expand the production of coal and steel, as well as improve and establish equal living standards for workers in these industrial sectors."
"Nowadays, Member States are facing economic, financial and social crises, creating the need more than ever for solidarity and respect for the Union's basic principles."
"I call for the barriers preventing the free movement of Romanian and Bulgarian workers to be lifted."
"I also request support from Member States for a new industrial policy and a new innovation policy capable of creating jobs which will provide European citizens with a decent living."
"(HU) Madam President, if we want to obtain results in the Roma strategy, we have to simultaneously improve the educational, employment, healthcare, and housing situation, and combat anti-Romanyism, hate speech, and discrimination against the Roma people."
"Neither of these can be efficient if we ignore the other."
"The Roma strategy of the Commission concentrates only on one side, the social tasks, and even in that respect, it shifts responsibility primarily to the Member States."
"Unfortunately, it barely mentions the necessity of combating anti-Romanyism, the human rights dimension of the issue."
"The Commission did not raise its voice when paramilitary groups were threatening the Roma citizens in the Hungarian Gyöngyöspata for weeks, and the Hungarian Government took action only when the tension and the provocation escalated into violence."
"I fear that if Europe does not show willingness to play a greater role in the improvement of the situation of the Roma people than what was mentioned in the Commission Communication, similar situations will occur again and again."
"It is not yet too late to make changes."
"We would like to hear the speech of Commissioner Viviane Reding on these issues."
"(ES) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to ask for your attention to remind you that this year has been proclaimed the International Year of Chemistry, in commemoration of Marie Curie being awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry exactly 100 years ago."
"With the slogan 'Chemistry - Our life, Our future', it is about making society more aware of chemistry's contribution to our well-being."
"Chemistry has made possible vaccines and antibiotics that have doubled our life expectancy, and it is key to developing new energy sources and improving food."
"Furthermore, the chemistry industry is a strategic sector in Europe, with 25 000 companies that employ, directly or indirectly, five million people."
"We in Parliament must, therefore, do everything we can to make the International Year of Chemistry a success because, as Marie Curie said, 'now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less'."
"Celebrating this year is a good time to take that on board."
"That concludes the item."
"Preparing forests for climate change (short presentation)"
"The next item is the report by Kriton Arsenis, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the Commission Green Paper on forest protection and information in the EU: preparing forests for climate change."
"Madam President, Commissioner, forests are very important to us all, for everyone here in this House and for every European in every corner of Europe."
"Forests are a part of our identity."
"We use them for recreation and for employment, and yet forests are so different for each of us, in each area of Europe."
"If someone from northern Europe visits the Mediterranean forests, he will think that many areas that we in the Mediterranean call forests are savannahs or parks, as they support no productive activities."
"Or, conversely, someone from the Mediterranean travelling in northern Europe will consider that the forests in the area are man-made rather than natural, as they support heavy productive activities."
"These forests, which are so different for each individual in Europe, for each area, face a common threat: climate change."
"Climate change is threatening European forests, with an increase in forest fires, with diseases passing from one country to another and putting entire species at risk, and with disasters caused by extreme weather conditions."
"The impact differs from one geographical area to another, but it is a cross-border impact and needs to be addressed with Europe's assistance."
"Today, we are debating, and in two days, we shall vote on Parliament's report on forest protection."
"This report was shaped by consent, right from the start, in cooperation with members from every country and political group."
"When it was tabled for debate in committee, it was further shaped by a procedure of 50 compromise amendments, from all the political groups and areas represented in Europe."
"I am therefore certain that this report represents Parliament's opinion as to how we can help forests, how we can help our communities to adapt to climate change."
"What are we asking for in this report?"
"We are asking for the Commission to proceed with the White Paper on adapting to and protecting forests from climate change, we are asking for a new regulation to replace the old regulation on the prevention of forest fires, we are asking for a new regulation to replace the old regulation on information on the state of forests and, finally, we are asking for an increase in funding for forests under the second pillar of the common agricultural policy."
"Forests account for 42% of the countryside, but only 1% of the CAP."
"We are asking for the facility to finance public agencies, for sustainability criteria for woody biomass used for energy and, finally, for pro-active, viable management of forests adapted to climate change."
"(RO) Madam President, the role of this report is to reopen the debate on forest protection at European level."
"Both forest protection activities and the provision of information about them are based on cooperation between European institutions and the authorities in Member States."
"I would like to highlight Article 23 in the report about stamping out illegal logging."
"I should mention that implementing sustainable forest management is vital to preserving biodiversity in Europe."
"Additional financial resources and the removal of legislative barriers are required to complete this process."
"Climate change research must be encouraged, especially as part of multinational projects."
"I also welcome the initiative aimed at organising employee training programmes."
"(PT) Madam President, on a subject which is vast by nature, I want to make just two brief points here."
"The first is to draw attention to threats currently weighing down on countless forest ecosystems."
"Amongst other things, I would highlight the spread of invading alien species, pests and forest fires."
"There is evidence of some recurrence of some of these factors, especially in convergence regions."
"There is a need for rigorous study of their impact, and also of the best ways to make the forest more resistant to this group of biotic and abiotic threats."
"To this end, sufficient financial resources should be channelled through Union programmes and support measures for evaluation of forests' ecological states and the health of their plants, and for their reclassification, including reforestation that favours indigenous species and mixed forests, as well as their resilience and biodiversity."
"Secondly, I would draw attention to the enormous diversity of natural conditions and, consequently, of forest ecosystems occurring in Europe."
"They need to be recognised and valued: their multifunctionality needs to be valued, along with their potential for generating employment and development in the rural world."
"(SK) Madam President, current studies into the impact of climate change on Europe's forests indicate that there is a wide range of specific regional responses from forest ecosystems."
"The ability to cope with the type and range of expected problems depends on natural regional conditions (mountainous areas, for example, are exposed to different problems than those of low lying areas), on the physiological sensitivity of forest vegetation, on how far individual ecosystems have developed their potential to adapt, on the intensity of the expected climate change (in Central and Eastern Europe, for instance, the change is projected to be one and a half times greater than the global average) and on the technical possibilities available to forestry to take adaptive action, for example, by changing species composition in favour of resistant trees."
"When drafting measures aimed at protection and adaptation, it is therefore extremely important to take into account specific local and regional features, and to respect factors specific to protected habitats."
"Madam President, it is a pleasure to be here this afternoon."
"Today, my colleagues and I were speaking for the first time in the Irish National Assembly - the Dáil - on Europe Day, so it is a historic day from that point of view."
"The topic before us is absolutely vital because forests have a huge role to play, particularly in combating climate change."
"We hear a lot about high-profile issues such as renewable energy, etc., which are certainly important, but forests deserve far more attention because it takes a long time to grow forests and they must therefore be protected and encouraged."
"There is a need for research, in particular, into ways of limiting forest fires."
"It is galling to realise that a single lit match can potentially destroy thousands of hectares of fine forest."
"I would also agree with the rapporteur that 1% of CAP expenditure going to forestation is not enough."
"Our Parliament wants to increase the number of hectares of forest in Ireland over the coming years, and an increase in funding through the CAP would certainly be sensible and worthwhile."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, at this very late hour, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Arsenis, for his commitment and his work in preparing the report on forest protection and information."
"Thanks also to the members of the committee who have put forward their views for their valuable contributions."
"The Commission announced its intention to present a Green Paper on forest protection and information in the context of the 2009 White Paper on adaptation to climate change."
"It was adopted in March 2010."
"The Green Paper set out the various socio-economic and environmental functions of forests and the challenges they will face in coming decades."
"It also reviewed current forest information systems in Europe."
"Most importantly it invited Parliament and the Council, as well as all other interested stakeholders, to provide their views on forest protection and information and on the way forward so that the EU could provide added value to the work going on at Member State level and more widely across Europe."
"The guiding principle has been to respect Member States' competences and subsidiarity while, at the same time, seeing how best the EU could contribute to ensuring that the functions of forests are protected and that the information necessary to achieve this is available."
"The past year has been rich in discussion and the Council conclusions, together with the results of the stakeholder consultation, are already feeding into the Commission's reflections on the next steps."
"Despite the fact that there has been a lengthy debate as to whether the EU needs a forestry policy or not, I am very pleased to see that appreciation of the economic, social and environmental functions of forests was a common theme in the stakeholder and Council input and that this concern is again evident today in the report drafted by Kriton Arsenis."
"Likewise, there is a very great need for information at a comparable level across a wide range of forestry-related issues such as employment, stocks, biomass, fires, soil and forest carbon information and trends, forest health, biodiversity and water protection, and each institution lays great emphasis on finding means to achieve this."
"In anticipation of Parliament's report, we have already begun working with the Member States to develop further and more clearly the precise information needs at EU level."
"The report will help us to focus this work."
"A further phase needs to be developed once the information needs are clear."
"We will be working on both aspects over the coming year, carefully and without duplicating other efforts in the forest area."
"Armed with relevant useful and comparable information, we should, in the near future, be better able to provide EU added value across forestry-related socio-economic and environmental issues, thus paving the way for better EU input to help forests to continue to deliver their multiple benefits for us all."
"The Commission will now study this report in detail and reflect fully on our response to it and to the Council conclusions and stakeholders' input."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday, 11 May 2011."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"The report on the protection of forests addresses the issue of forest decline resulting from felling."
"In view of the fact that we must count on further losses through climate change, European forestry finds itself in a difficult and risky situation."
"Some Member States (for example, Germany and Austria) operate a balanced forestry policy."
"A large number of countries - especially new Member States, including the Czech Republic - allow unsustainable forestry on their territory, however, which can be defined as the total clearance and looting of forest growth."
"The ratio of clearance to new forest growth is even higher than 100%."
"It is absolutely essential to manage and regulate the felling and clearance of forests at the European level, as long as these countries have such incompetent or corrupt politicians who are either unable or unwilling to halt this trend."
"In the Czech Republic, forestry management has become a business, in which the financial profits of the firms involved are all that matters."
"There can be no talk of maintenance or sustainable forestry management."
"It is also quite common that some citizens cut down trees without a permit, because the cost of heating fuel makes it worthwhile."
"I must appeal to the authorities who fail to penalise this and even fail to address it, because cutting down forests has become common practice in the Czech Republic."
"I welcome the report."
"It is a further step towards sustainable forestry in Europe, and halting the looting of forests in some Member States."
"The report accurately shows that forestry policy is the responsibility of Member States."
"However, we must support it at the European level at the very least due to the principle of subsidiarity."
"From the point of view of climate change, ensuring the safety of forests is extremely important, as they are threatened more and more by natural disasters, especially such as fires or wide-ranging tree diseases."
"We have to remember the exceptional role of forests in ensuring biological balance and diversity, and that they are a valuable link in the proper functioning of the economy, not only in the production of timber, but also in relation to other products and services which are a common public asset."
"I believe that it is therefore very important to establish a sustainable common European forestry management policy."
"I appeal to the Commission to draw up legally binding criteria for the sustainable development of tree biomass, at the same time introducing tools for collecting information on forests and forestry and for making this information accessible."
"I was rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on this report."
"I have endeavoured to emphasise the link that exists between forests and rural communities, based on the economic and social role which forests play as an important source of income and also in agricultural production."
"I feel that the role of forests in the future common agricultural policy is an important aspect of this."
"This is especially true in the context where Europe's action in the forestry sector is implemented in particular via the second pillar of the CAP - rural development."
"This must be preserved as a powerful, effective instrument, while funding must continue at a sufficient level as part of the post-2013 CAP programmes."
"Support must be maintained for creating forest plantations as part of these programmes."
"Forests are also an important provider of public services which go unrewarded by the market."
"This is why I think that forest owners should be given a direct payment per area."
"The role of forests in the European Union's energy strategy is another important point because their potential as a renewable energy source is currently underexploited."
"There is a lack of consistency among the European Union's various forestry-related policies as well as those of the Member States."
"It is therefore necessary to coordinate policies related to forestry, agriculture, renewable energy, biodiversity, as well as other environmental policies, more thoroughly."
"Here, we must also take industrial and research policy and the Europe 2020 strategy into account."
"Forestry is a natural part of an integrated rural and regional policy, and this must be taken into account in the discussions on the future of the common agricultural policy after 2013."
", in writing. - European forests are major contributors to climate change mitigation and the adaptation of European societies through the continuation of their economic, social and environmental functions."
"Therefore, EU forest-related instruments need to be updated to address new threats to their sustainable management and conservation."
"It's underlined the central role of Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) and the importance of forests for competitiveness and employment, in order to achieve EU's climate targets and deliver necessary ecosystem services such as biodiversity conservation, protection against natural disasters and CO2 capturing."
"Requests for: 1."
"Reporting through National Forest Programmes to be enhanced and SFM to be better implemented throughout the European Union."
"2."
"The immediate adoption of legislation on forest fire prevention as well as on forest information taking into account climate threats and the need for collection and dissemination of comparable data."
"Moreover, it calls for a White Paper on forest protection, addressing financial resources, knowledge exchange and promotion of research."
"3."
"There is recognition of the importance of forests for rural development and the need to remove obstacles to funding for forestry and biodiversity."
"A call for access to funding of the relevant measures for public bodies and rural producers has been agreed upon."

"Mr President, Commissioner Šemeta, ladies and gentlemen, the process we are dealing with today - that is, the discharge for the expenditure of the European Commission - is an essential process."
"In recent years it may perhaps have been taken rather lightly, but in fact granting discharge for all the expenditure of the European Commission for the year 2009 is an essential task of the European Parliament."
"We are aware that 80% of these funds were spent as a shared responsibility between the Commission and the Member States."
"Nonetheless, the overall responsibility for this process lies with the Commission."
"I would therefore like to address you quite directly, Commissioner Šemeta."
"Firstly, I would like to thank you."
"I would like to make that clear at the outset."
"I would like to include my fellow Members who have worked very well together and who have supported Parliament's position very strongly."
"However, the discussions that we had were very intense, Commissioner Šemeta."
"You have only shared responsibility for 2009, yet you have thrown yourself into it."
"In some cases we have had heated arguments and have gone into very great detail."
"I should like to emphasise, however, that you have put the discharge at the top of the agenda in the College, in the Commission."
"The President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, spent over an hour negotiating with us on the details."
"You yourself played a major part in changing the attitude of the Commission to the discharge and the attitude of the Commission officials to this whole process."
"I am grateful to you for having said quite openly that the pressure that Parliament has exerted this year will in the final event help you to improve transparency."
"You now have in your hands a means of exerting pressure not just on the Member States, but also on your own administration - which has until now been a little lax in dealing with these matters."
"However, I also think that we need to utilise this momentum that we have created together, Commissioner Šemeta - and I would ask you to pass on our thanks to President Barroso - and this dynamism for the other discharge reports."
"For there is one thing that must be clear to us, which is that for the 16th time in succession the European Court of Auditors has not given a positive statement."
"That is not insignificant, as it means that you have not actually met the criteria for 16 years running."
"Nonetheless, we have set key criteria that I would like to mention briefly and that you have met."
"I am pleased to have Mr Fjellner, the forthcoming rapporteur on the budget discharge, at my side."
"I hope that he will continue the work with the same impetus."
"The Commission has begun - and this is crucial, because we are after all talking about 80% shared responsibility here - quite clearly to state erroneous expenditure in the accounts of the European Union for 2009."
"It has listed these items openly."
"Building on this new transparency, therefore, we have set five key requirements."
"The first is a long-running issue - an old favourite - that Parliament has been dealing with for a long time, and that is the national management declarations."
"As a representative of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I am also pleased to be able to point out that this has been brought about by Dutch members of the ALDE Group in particular."
"We are talking here about the confirmation by the finance ministers that EU funds have been spent correctly in their home countries."
"We do not yet have these national management declarations, but we want to get them."
"In this respect I will be building on my cooperation with Mr Fjellner in the future."
"Commissioner, you have promised that we will look into whether stricter conditions can be introduced by the next financial perspective in 2014."
"It is important that you have drawn up guidelines - we are grateful to you for that - that you have shown which countries have actually provided national management declarations - it is not many: basically, only the Netherlands meets the requirements in full - and that you have instructed the Directorates General to show for the first time in the activity report for 2010 what components will be present in a future national administrative declaration, even if this will only take place at working level."
"The second key requirement is that the commissioners must also accept greater responsibility."
"You have proposed that the Directorates General be obliged to inform their commissioners of irregularities and I want to thank you for that."
"The third, and essential, requirement was for the instrument of stopping or suspending payments to be used to a greater extent."
"You have listed clear criteria for when you will do that."
"You have shown us clearly how you have already done this in the last couple of years."
"Thank you for such openness and transparency, which helps us exert pressure on the Member States."
"Thank you also for the guidelines that will help the Member States."
"In addition, you promised that when evaluating the performance audit you will set clear standards; this is an obligation that you have anyway under the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Thank you also for involving us to a considerable extent in the performance audit process."
"You have also promised to make simplifications, because often the material is so complex that people hide behind the rules and indulge in abuse."
"Thank you also for having set very specific requirements for the next financial perspective."
"I advocate that we continue along this path."
"I believe that Parliament can make a great contribution towards raising the Commission to another level."
"I wish Mr Fjellner all the best and would like to extend my warm thanks to my parliamentary staff, particularly Bent Adamsen and Dominykas Mordas."
"rapporteur. - (FI) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I wish to thank everyone with whom I have had the pleasure to work, in particular the shadow rapporteurs, whose cooperation was excellent."
"I would also like to thank the members of the Committee on Budgetary Control, as there was a clear majority on the Committee who were in favour of the report and the atmosphere was very positive indeed."
"My thanks also go to all the officials who were of assistance to us."
"The work was demanding, it took a long time, and the issues are quite delicate and awkward, but they nevertheless have to be dealt with and discussed."
"The main idea in the report is that we in the EU are now going through an economic crisis."
"Member States, companies and the general public are continually having to think about how they can make savings and how they can manage from one day to the next."
"Parliament must do the same, and the Council has even proposed that Parliament should also think about savings in this respect and that they need to be made."
"Of course, this is problematic, because we all have our own pet projects and our own ideas about what Parliament should be doing anyway."
"Finding areas in which to make savings in such a case is sometimes obviously very difficult."
"Many things that are proposed here and that relate to Members' benefits and the way in which they work are not very major in terms of cash."
"The EU's economy will not rise or fall because of them, but the loss of reputation that we could cause if we do not function in a reasonable manner and one that is acceptable in the eyes of the public is considerable, and that is why we really need to think carefully about what we are going to do."
"In my opinion, we should focus on the essential reasons why we are here."
"We are a legislative body; we draft a budget."
"That is the work we do and we need to have the means to do it."
"Information technology must be delivered and all the rest, but with regard to everything that goes any further than that, we have to be very critical, to ensure that it is actually connected with the work that we are here to do."
"Now that time is short, I wish to raise two important but perhaps equally troublesome issues in this report."
"The first is security."
"Mr President, I hope that the SecretaryGeneral will soon make a proposal to improve security."
"In the space of a year or so, we have had three robberies: in the bank, the canteen and the post office."
"This really cannot continue."
"We know that there is a continual threat of terrorism throughout the world."
"If Parliament's security is so poor that someone can walk in here and rob the post office or the bank, and no one even gets caught, there is every reason to make improvements, and fast."
"There are a lot of details connected with this, and they are set out in this report."
"They should serve as a basis for essentially improving security."
"The next important matter is that I cannot possibly justify to the public the fact that every three weeks we change our place of work."
"This incurs far more expenditure."
"It cannot be justified, and that is why we should have the courage to discuss here openly whether this is a reasonable way to spend taxpayers' money."
"We know how difficult this is; this is about our history and private passions, but in the current economic crisis we need to speak about this issue."
"We cannot build walls like these between the decisionmakers and the people and alienate one from the other in this way."
"That is why we need to raise the matter and talk about it."
"Yesterday I saw a document that said that the French Senate has proposed that Parliament should only meet in one place, Strasbourg."
"This would suit me fine, because the main issue is that we should only have one place of work and not spend money on constant travel to and fro."
"I would like to reply right away by saying that the Secretary-General and the Deputy Secretary-General put a lot of effort into ensuring our safety in Parliament."
"Yesterday we spent a great deal of time discussing this issue at a meeting of the Bureau."
"Procedures must be improved, but I would also like to take this opportunity to call on all the Members of the European Parliament to understand that a certain level of discipline is required of us."
"I know that they are sometimes a burden, but if we want a Parliament which is both safe and open to the public, we must carry out checks, although I know that Members and I myself are sometimes irritated by them."
"Please believe me when I say that there are only two options; either these checks continue, which will mean that we can feel safer, or we dispense with them, in which case there can be no question of safety."
"I would also like to ask Members once again to take a positive attitude to the heightened checks, which I do not wish to have to abandon."
"They will continue to be enforced in future."
"We also have other plans to ensure that Parliament remains open, since it is very important that it does."
"We want to be a Parliament which is open to the public, but at the same time safety requirements dictate that we must adopt certain measures which have not been necessary to date."
"This also affects our assistants, and it has come to my attention that our assistants are much more indignant than even the Members."
"I would therefore ask the assistants, who work very hard in Parliament, also to understand the need for these checks."
"It is not only Members that are subject to checks, but also assistants."
"I am sure that we will adopt these rules in order to feel safer."
"rapporteur. - (HU) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Mr President has said, Mr Rivellini is the rapporteur for seven reports on the table."
"Our colleague has worked exceptionally hard and efficiently over the past six months, but unfortunately he is unable to attend this sitting, and I have the honour to stand in for him in today's debate."
"As I have mentioned, Mr Rivellini is the rapporteur of seven of the reports."
"Allow me to remind you of the key EU institutions whose discharge reports were prepared by Mr Rivellini."
"Mr Rivellini prepared the discharge report in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Council, the European Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions, the European Court of Justice, the European Court of Auditors, the Ombudsman, and the European Data Protection Supervisor and their offices."
"Let me thank Mr Rivellini on my part, and also specifically the European Court of Auditors; the work of this institution was indispensable for the preparation of the reports on the table."
"Let me also thank the members of the Committee on Budgetary Control of the European Parliament and also their colleagues for their work which has led to today's results."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to highlight two reports."
"One is the discharge report of the European Council, the other is the discharge report of the European Economic and Social Committee."
"The discharge of the European Council is always complicated because a debate develops each year between the two institutions, the European Parliament and the European Council concerning the discharge procedure."
"Let me be clear and unequivocal."
"The definite and clear position of the European Parliament is that it has the same power and authority to grant or withhold discharge concerning the European Council as in the case of any other institution."
"Mr Rivellini proposes to postpone the discharge of the European Council in order to leave room for further consultation between the Council and the European Parliament concerning the discharge procedure."
"We followed a similar procedure last year and the year before."
"The competent committee of the Parliament recommended postponement of the discharge of the Council, and discharge was granted on a later date."
"This year, although the proposal is similar to previous years' in that it concerns the postponement of the discharge, we have unquestionably achieved progress as regards the Council discharge procedure, therefore I thank and congratulate the Hungarian Presidency of the European Council."
"As point eight of the discharge report concerning the European Council says, this progress is due to the positive attitude and efforts of the Hungarian Presidency."
"Therefore I congratulate those involved in the work of the Hungarian Presidency."
"We have experienced this progress year by year, but its rate is nowhere near what would be desirable."
"We consider it to be a positive result that the Council has acknowledged the discharge procedure and the budgetary procedure as two different processes that must be handled separately."
"It is also to be welcomed that Members of the Council attend and participate in the current debate on the discharge proposal."
"Unfortunately, Council representatives ignored the invitation of the technical committee this year, too."
"They did not participate in the committee debate on the discharge procedure, nor did they provide access to important documents which would have been necessary for granting discharge, and the European Council did not answer the questions of the parliamentary committee either."
"These are the problems which should be overcome at last."
"I hope that after the postponement of discharge it will be possible to reach a definitive and forward-looking agreement between the competent parliamentary committee, the European Parliament and the European Council on the issues related to the discharge of the Council."
"Finally allow me to touch upon the proposal for exemption of the European Economic and Social Committee."
"The problems related to the management of the budget of the Committee are not as serious as to justify the postponement of discharge, therefore we are in favour of granting discharge."
"Furthermore, the problems detected during the work of the committee are not connected to the year following the year for which discharge is granted."
"Ladies and gentlemen, as substitute for Mr Rivellini I can say that as regards the seven proposals we should motion for a resolution by Parliament as laid down in the proposal."
"rapporteur. - (NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, you deserve a pat on the back."
"For the first time in years, the Council is attending this debate on the discharge of the budget."
"Congratulations, we really appreciate that."
"Ladies and gentlemen, EUR 22.6 billion, that is how much the 10th European Development Fund will spend in the 2008-2013 period."
"That makes the European Development Fund the EU's most important financial instrument for development cooperation with the ACP countries."
"The 10th European Development Fund is also extremely important in terms of its financial commitment and, in terms of scope, it is 64% larger than its predecessor, the 9th European Development Fund."
"I would like to make five comments."
"First of all, so far, the European Development Fund has not been part of the EU's ordinary budget."
"That is actually unacceptable because it interferes with democratic supervision, leads to a lack of responsibility and certainly does not help the transparency of funding."
"In my report, I remind the Commission that, during the discussions on the future financial framework, it has committed itself to ensuring that the European Development Fund becomes a truly integral part of the European budget."
"I hope that that will now be the case and I hope, President-in-Office of the Council, that you will send out the message to the Council and to Member States that, from 2014, the European Development Fund really must become an integral part of the Union budget."
"Obviously, that should not be taken to mean that this operation should be allowed to result in resources which are generally made available for development cooperation being cut."
"Secondly, quantity is one thing, quality is another."
"As far as ordinary development cooperation is concerned, the European Commission has committed itself to spending 20% of the aid on primary and secondary education and on primary health care."
"In my report, I ask the Commission to do the same with regard to the European Development Fund. To focus, primarily, on primary and secondary education, health care and even to increase that amount to 25% of the total fund."
"In that respect, cooperation with NGOs, both local and European, is of vital importance."
"Thirdly, allow me to comment on financial management."
"The European Court of Auditors has carried out an extremely thorough investigation of the financial management of the 8th, 9th and 10th European Development Funds, not only in its annual report but in a great many special reports, and made really good and really valuable comments."
"However, there are indeed some reasons for concern, such as the shortcomings the Court has found with regard to procurement procedures, ex-ante checks of the European Commission's delegations and failing internal control systems in our partner countries."
"The Court of Auditors explicitly notes that this is not fraud, but shortcomings."
"I think that we need to take that on board."
"There are indeed far too many non-quantifiable errors."
"Commissioner, I hope that you will take this up with your colleague."
"Something really needs to happen on that front."
"My fourth comment is to do with budget aid (and it would be more fitting in a broader debate)."
"Mr Charles Goerens is here with us; he is the rapporteur of the Committee on Development Cooperation for the Green Paper on Budget Aid."
"We all recognise that budget aid can be an important element for the improvement of development cooperation."
"However, it should not be regarded as a cure-all, because it also comes with a number of drawbacks."
"The positives are that transaction costs are low, that partner countries have an increased responsibility for themselves and that there is a better dialogue between partners and donors."
"At the same time, there is obviously the risk of embezzlement, of the misappropriation of funds."
"I can see this debate taking place many more times to come in this Parliament."
"My fifth and last comment concerns the investment facility."
"The investment facility is a vehicle used by the European Investment Bank to divert loans to our partner countries."
"At the moment, this mechanism does not actually fall under the discharge, nor does it fall under the declaration of assurance of the Court of Auditors."
"That is actually not acceptable."
"We need to remedy a few things."
"What is positive in all this is that the representatives of the European Investment Bank and the members of the Committee on Budgetary Control have had an extremely constructive debate."
"As a matter of fact, they have, for the first time ever, produced a report."
"There is a lot we can learn from that."
"There are a number of important comments in my report with respect to that."
"We are also entrusting a few tasks to the European Investment Bank and the European Commission."
"We are asking for better coordination of funds."
"European Investment Bank, European Commission, we are actually asking for an investigation into the activities of the European Investment Bank towards the end of September this year so that we can start the next discharge procedure with proper documentation."
"We are asking for greater involvement of local partners where the Investment Bank cofinances projects, we are asking for more direct and less theoretical reporting and we are asking for a general audit of all funds of the European Investment Bank."
"Ladies and gentlemen, my assessment of the functioning of the European Development Fund may be strict, but I think that it is a fair one."
"I believe that my report considers a great many avenues for the better management of financial resources for development cooperation and I would therefore urge you to adopt my report with a large majority."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, I should like to inform you that I will be making use of all my time."
"I was responsible for the discharge of the agencies, where the Committee on Budgetary Control has executed its task of exercising control over the administration of a significant number of decentralised agencies and joint undertakings."
"The successful execution of this important task would not be possible without the help and cooperation of my fellow shadow rapporteurs or the members of the committee, my office and the secretariat."
"I would like to thank them all for that."
"I would also like to very much thank Mr O'Shea from the Court of Auditors for his contribution and cooperation."
"I strongly believe that the European agencies and joint undertakings bring added value to the EU and help strengthen European identity with a presence in the Member States."
"At the same time, our role as a Parliament is accountability towards citizens, so we have to make sure that taxpayers' money is used properly, transparently and effectively."
"The constructive dialogue involved a long monitoring process over several months between Parliament, the agencies, the Commission, the Internal Audit Service and the Court of Auditors."
"The joint long, analytical and preparatory work has resulted, in my opinion, in increasing transparency and tighter management discipline."
"Let me now turn to the two agencies for which our committee is proposing to postpone the discharge: CEPOL and EMEA."
"In CEPOL we were expecting to find problems dating back to last year's report."
"Since the new Director has been in place the action plan that Parliament requested has been implemented and results are just now starting to be visible."
"I think that it is widely accepted that, since the new management took over, improvements in the running of' CEPOL have been evident."
"Nevertheless CEPOL needs to step up its efforts."
"In EMEA, the European Medicines Agency, problems were found with the management of procurement procedures."
"Concerns were raised about the potential risk to the independence of experts and also potential problems with staff recruitment."
"In general, EMEA is considered a well organised and functioning agency."
"Nevertheless, for an agency of this significance, I think that we should be absolutely sure that the right procedures are in place and effectively applied."
"For this reason we have requested the agency, with the cooperation of the Internal Audit Service, to conduct an audit and present us with the results by the end of June."
"Let me now conclude with a horizontal report."
"I would like to believe that this report gives a comprehensive overview of all the issues that are related to all the agencies and joint undertakings."
"The report identifies many examples of good practice and includes proposals for future improvements."
"It calls for a review of all agencies by the Commission, with particular attention to be paid to the smallest agencies and how their performance can be improved."
"It also calls on the Court of Auditors to undertake a comprehensive analysis of the agencies' approach to the management of situations where there is a potential conflict of interests."
"I am very satisfied with the readiness of the Court to do so."
"In the current major economic and social crisis, the significance of monitoring has become more important than ever before."
"Together - Parliament, agencies, the Commission and the Court of Auditors - we are committed to dealing with and solving the problems and achieving even better results."
"It is exceptionally difficult to avoid irregularities but it is even more important to find them and to prevent them."
"I am of the opinion that we have successfully carried out this function of monitoring."
"The next speaker is Minister Zsolt László Becsey on behalf of the Council."
"Minister, thank you very much for coming here this morning."
"The Hungarian Presidency is giving a very good example, also to the next presidencies, in being present for this very important discussion."
"I am saying what our colleague Bart Staes said a few minutes ago: it is very good that you are present."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (HU) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I will only speak in Hungarian as an introduction, and then I will continue in English when speaking as a Member of the Council, but since as a MEP I always speak in Hungarian in this room, I will continue to do so."
"Secondly, I would like to ask Mr President to allow me the two minutes at the end of the debate regardless of when my machine is switched off."
"I hope that the Council will be granted enough time, as in previous debates."
"This debate comes at a time of economic and financial crisis when many Member States have had to cut their national budgets and keep their expenditure under strict control."
"European citizens and taxpayers are rightly paying ever closer attention to the proper spending of EU funds."
"I therefore welcome the opportunity to present the views of the Council and the Hungarian Presidency during this debate."
"Of course it is right that the budgets of each of the institutions are part of the wider system of control and scrutiny."
"For too long we have operated under the 'gentleman's agreement' originating from 1970, according to which both Parliament and the Council have refrained from examining each other's administrative expenditure."
"I think we both accept that such an agreement is no longer appropriate in today's climate after the Lisbon Treaty."
"That is why the Council has proposed, and is ready to discuss, new arrangements for governing the long-term cooperation between our two institutions involved in the discharge procedure."
"We have put forward a proposal and we look forward to discussing it with you."
"I strongly believe that it is in both our interests to cooperate in this area, and no less important to show Europe's citizens that we are cooperating."
"I therefore invite Parliament to begin discussions on this issue."
"I personally ask you, Mr President, to do your best to appoint your delegation to negotiate with us at a political level."
"We are ready to share our ideas with you."
"More generally we share your concern that the EU budget be correctly implemented."
"We have examined in detail the Commission's annual accounts as well as the observations made by the European Court of Auditors in its annual report."
"At the end of February, I myself presented to the Committee on Budgetary Control the Council's recommendations on the discharge to the Commission for the implementation of the budget."
"I welcome the fact that many of the points highlighted by the Council have been taken up by your institution as well."
"The Council recommended granting discharge to the Commission, and it acknowledged the overall improvements identified by the Court."
"These are part of a welcome trend and are due largely to the efforts over recent years by both the Commission and the Member States."
"Yet despite these positive signs the overall result is not yet satisfactory and the Court still had to qualify its opinion for 2009."
"I would like to briefly mention these issues: we need a serious discussion; we need long-term cooperation and a long-term agreement with you: following on from the gentleman's agreement that is what we should like to do."
"We stand by the discharge procedure on the basis of the Court of Auditors' findings because that is the rule, that is the Treaty issue; and we also expect Parliament and ourselves to take into account the complexity of simplifying existing regulations and enhancing their transparency."
"I hope that this kind of problem, whereby the Council discharge has been postponed by Parliament, will never come up in the future again so I ask that even during the Hungarian Presidency we should have a political discussion and agreement."
"That is my personal request to you, to Parliament and to you, Mr President."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, first allow me to thank the Committee on Budgetary Control, and in particular the rapporteur Mr Chatzimarkakis, for their excellent cooperation and the report he has drawn up, including the recommendation that the budget for 2009 should be discharged."
"I would also like to thank Mr Staes for his report on the implementation of the European Development Fund, and Mr Stavrakakis for his report on agencies."
"The 2009 discharge procedure is now reaching its end."
"It was an intensive period in which Parliament and Commission gave shape to the special partnership between our two institutions."
"We can observe that both institutions have a lot in common as regards sound financial management and European added value."
"You have heard the Court of Auditors and examined its reports."
"Several of my fellow Commissioners have conducted a fruitful dialogue with the Committee on Budgetary Control, and a lot of information has been shared with you."
"I would like to focus on three topics of special interest."
"First, both the Commission and Parliament need to reflect closely, together with the Council, on how the responsibility of the various financial actors can be better defined and outlined in the legislative framework."
"The fact that the majority of errors are detected by the Court of Auditors and the Commission in projects and payments managed by Member States indicates clearly where more efforts need to be made without delay, as shared management represents almost 80% of the European Funds."
"Article 317 of the Lisbon Treaty explicitly requires the cooperation of Member States in the implementation of the budget."
"To this effect, the Commission has put forward consistent proposals in the context of the current revision of the Financial Regulation."
"As Parliament is now on an equal footing with the Council as regards recasting this regulation, there is a real and unique opportunity to reinforce Member States' accountability, and it should not be missed."
"Second, you will undoubtedly share the view that the complexity of the rules discourages potential beneficiaries from applying for EU financial support."
"In addition, this complexity constitutes a significant source of errors, as underscored by the Court of Auditors in several of its audit reports."
"The simplification of eligibility rules and financial processes is a priority objective of the Commission in the perspective of the next Multiannual Financial Framework."
"Therefore, the Commission has also made proposals for the revision of the Financial Regulation aimed at clarifying the rules, ensuring their consistency with sectoral legislation and simplifying financial processes."
"Third, these proposals also foresee differentiated control strategies according to the level of risk estimated per programme, action and type of beneficiary."
"This approach aims at improving the quality of controls by ensuring that their costs are proportionate to the benefits they generate while providing reasonable assurance that the EU budget is managed in accordance with sound financial management principles."
"I am happy to see that this approach is high on the agenda of the ongoing discussions and the proposals which are on the table really match the Commission's ambitions."
"The discharge procedure has allowed the Commission to learn from the conclusions and recommendations of the European Court of Auditors and the resolution of the discharge authority at a time when we are considering the future design of EU policies and their reflection in the EU budget."
"It is now our common responsibility, together with the Council, to translate concretely those lessons into a new set of modern and efficient rules and processes which will enable the Union to meet better the expectations of our 500 million citizens in a sound and cost-effective way."
"Let me conclude by expressing my special thanks to the European Parliament for its continuous support, over the years, of the Commission's efforts to achieve better financial management of the European Union's budget."
"rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Development Cooperation. - (NL) Madam President, in the past, the European Development Fund has been the target of the Court of Auditors' criticism that greater efforts need to be invested in expenditure control."
"This control must, above all, come from the EU delegations in developing countries."
"They are the closest to the projects which we are discussing."
"In recent years, in particular, the European Commission has made important steps towards improving control, especially as regards budget aid and spending in fragile states."
"What is more, better cooperation and coordination on development policy between Member States could save us EUR 6 billion."
"However, to achieve this we need strong EU delegations, delegations which can assume those roles and tasks and ensure the quality of spending."
"Ironically enough, the parties that cry blue murder about fraud, but refuse to spend money on strengthening the management of EU delegations, are often one and the same."
"If we really want these delegations to prevent development money ending up in the wrong hands or to prevent money leaking away into failing projects, then EU delegations will need more staff."
"We therefore have to make that choice in our external policy budget for the coming years."
"I await with curiosity the Commission's answer to a number of comments made by Mr Bart Staes in his excellent report."
"My group fully endorses his conclusions."
"Having said that, what needs to happen before ex-ante controls are improved?"
"How can we ensure improvement of the management of implementing organisations?"
"What will the Commission do in order to increase further the capacity of beneficiary countries and regional organisations and what is necessary for that to happen?"
"In the future, the EU development policy should spend more on funds which offer access to financial services, that is microfinancing funds. There are people with enough dreams and skills in poor countries."
"They should be given the chance to build up their own lives with small loans."
"The EDF should also contribute to that."
"Finally, as part of the European budget, the European Development Fund is obviously subject to democratic control, but that must not lead to the total budget for development cooperation being cut."
"Madam President, discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the Eighth, Ninth and Tenth European Development Funds inspires me to make the following comments."
"Firstly, the Commission's ambition - a very justifiable one - is to promote regional development in Africa."
"It has two instruments, two mandates in fact, for doing so."
"Firstly, it has a mandate from the Member States to implement the European Development Fund, which is in fact financed by the national budgets."
"The same Member States have also given it a mandate to negotiate economic partnership agreements."
"It is therefore a policy coherence matter that we are talking about here."
"Moreover, the Commission has a heavy responsibility in this matter."
"It can, however, count on the members of the European Parliament's Committee on Development when it comes to making the necessary resources available to the delegations."
"Secondly, the implementation of the European Development Fund is a matter for the Africans, who are co-owners of the European Development Fund with the European Union."
"It is in both partners' interests to make the best possible use of it."
"I hope that the inclusion of the European Development Fund in the budget, which I also demand - that elusive phenomenon, that event which is always promised but which has never materialised - will be able to preserve the original nature of the Fund."
"We will have to ensure that this acquis is preserved."
"rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. - (HU) Madam President, as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs I would like to draw the attention of the Committee on Budgetary Control to several proposals, and ask it to include them in its report."
"First of all, we appreciate the efforts of the Commission to improve financial management, but at the same time we regret that Member States do not draw in full the financial assets of the European Social Fund notwithstanding the financial crisis."
"This rate decreased from 54% in 2007 to 36%."
"We think that more efforts must be made in this field."
"We also urge greater efforts to decrease the frequency of refunding non-eligible expenditures, and we would like to draw the attention of the Commission to the need to accelerate decision-making processes relating to financial adjustments."
"It is to be welcomed that the European Social Fund focused on employment strategy, but as I have said, they did not involve all the funds available, so further efforts are necessary in this regard."
"There were minor problems with the agencies, I do not have time to elaborate on it, but in general we must say that their financial management is acceptable and should be supported."
"rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. - (DE) Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has expressed a very positive opinion to the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"We were very pleased with how the funds had been implemented by the Commission services."
"We have no criticisms to make, either as regards the way in which the funds were spent or as regards the level of expenditure."
"On the contrary, we have nothing but praise for the prompt and positive use of the funds in the LIFE programme."
"The Commission has succeeded in spending the additional funding that we granted and in doing so usefully."
"The agencies in our area - the European Environment Agency (EEA), the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the European Chemicals Agency (ECA), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) - have also managed their money responsibly."
"In contrast to the competent committee, the Committee on Budgetary Control criticises the European Medicines Agency in its report and even wishes to refuse discharge for this agency."
"I think that is going too far, to put it politely."
"If I were being less polite I might say that the Committee on Budgetary Control is interfering in matters outside its sphere of competence."
"It should please stop doing so. I can only ask Parliament and plenary to improve matters in this respect."
"rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism. - (DE) Madam President, unlike the previous committee, the Committee on Transport and Tourism was not able to express a purely positive opinion."
"We nonetheless welcomed the fact that substantial resources were provided for the trans-European transport networks and that in 2009 the Galileo programme finally had a very good year, which was regrettably not the case in previous years."
"We were also able to state that the coordinators are doing a good job in the case of the trans-European networks, because they are also making a great contribution to the overall financing of these major projects."
"As we see it, there is room for improvement in other areas that this Parliament considers important - such as road safety."
"In this area only 73% of the funds have been committed."
"In our opinion, this programme in particular could do more work and better work with less funding."
"Finally, I would like to mention that we would like to see greater coordination between transport and cohesion policy."
"We cannot have priorities being specified in one committee and these then being ignored in other committees."
"Such coordination is, however, taking place at the moment in the reviews that we are carrying out."
"We hope that we will be able to report better news on this for 2010."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Transport and Tourism has endorsed my recommendation for discharge to be granted to the European transport agencies, which support the European Commission."
"The discharge is granted because the Court of Auditors deemed that the annual accounts of the agencies were substantially reliable, although we must take note of and underscore a number of critical issues."
"Some of these issues are common to all the agencies or some of them, including for example: cancellations and delays in procurement procedures, failure to observe Staff Regulations, or the violation of the principle of budgetary annuality."
"These agencies' commitment to overcome said problems should, however, be highlighted."
"In general terms, I should like to make two brief political observations, namely the lack of any multiannual programming - which is symptomatic of a leadership deficit - and the dearth of incisiveness in the work of some agencies, such as the European Railway Agency."
"In the same vein, I should like to note the delay - some two years after the fact - in setting up procedures to determine responsibility for the Viareggio disaster."
"rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development. - (DE) Madam President, I would like to use a minute now as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development and then speak for two minutes later in the debate on behalf of my group."
"Madam President, Mr Becsey, Commissioner Šemeta, President Caldeira, ladies and gentlemen, the regional policy budget remains the Achilles heel of the European Union general budget."
"Five percent of payments from the European Regional Fund still have errors and must therefore be described as irregular payments."
"Even some of the payments that appear to be correct are actually supporting grotesque projects."
"May I remind you that an Elton John concert in Naples was subsidised by the European Regional Fund."
"It was said to be a measure to promote tourism."
"That might be the case, but in my opinion real regional aid for Naples should take a different form."
"The reason for this is that all too often the Member States still consider funding from the European Regional Fund to be soft money."
"This is obvious from the fact that there is a backlog of repayments due from irregular payments, from the fact that very often the Commission has to use the instrument of suspending payments - something that, as budget controllers, we expressly welcome - and from the fact that the punctuality of reporting suffers."
"The Director General for Regional Policy cannot provide us with any assurance as to the legality and reliability of over half the operational programmes because the reporting by the Member States is inadequate."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we still have a lot to do here."
"rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries. - Madam President, the Community Fisheries Control Agency was established in 2005 to ensure better compliance with the rules of the common fisheries policy by the EU Member States."
"This agency, which is based in Vigo, Spain, plays an important role in strengthening fisheries control and ensuring coordination between EU Member States."
"I welcome the recent adoption by the agency of a multiannual work programme for the period 2011-2015 in line with the EU 2020 Strategy."
"I believe that the multiannual work programme will improve cost-effectiveness through enhanced regional cooperation and the pooling of means under joint deployment plans."
"I welcome the approval by the Court of Auditors of the granting of discharge."
"This viewpoint is supported by my opinion, which was adopted by the Committee on Fisheries."
"The Commission will shortly publish its legislative proposals for the reform of the common fisheries policy."
"This reform must standardise Member States' compliance and enforcement regimes, as there is no uniformity throughout the EU."
"In this regard, I strongly urge the Commission to introduce a system of administrative sanctions."
"This should not be left to each individual country."
"If we have a common policy, then the sanctions should apply across the board."
"We should, in fact, have administrative sanctions for minor offences rather than the criminal system that is currently employed in my own country."
"rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality. - (ES) Madam President, year after year we in the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality have been reiterating the need for a gender perspective to be incorporated into all stages of budgetary procedure, in order to make progress with policies on equality and, therefore, on equality between men and women in the European Union."
"We therefore welcome both the special report drawn up by the Court of Auditors on professional training activities financed by the European Social Fund, and a study evaluating the viability and options regarding the inclusion of certain elements in the gender perspective."
"Even so, it is essential to continue making progress with it."
"We are concerned about issues relating to payments in the Daphne programme combating gender violence, and we hope that over the years there will be greater sensitivity, and that we will really take the gender perspective into account in each and every one of the operational programmes undertaken in the EU."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to thank both Commissioner Šemeta and the rapporteur, Mr Chatzimarkakis, for their truly excellent cooperation."
"This is a sound report and I can only say that we are essentially in agreement in the Committee on Budgetary Control on the recommendations that we have tabled."
"It is nevertheless the 16th year in a row that there has not been a clear statement of assurance from the Court of Auditors."
"The errors are not increasing."
"On the contrary, they are decreasing, but it is still not acceptable."
"The picture that emerges from the figures year on year is not one that we consider to be acceptable."
"The Commission bears a large degree of responsibility for this, but I would say that the Member States probably bear an even greater degree of responsibility."
"As the Commissioner pointed out, 80% of the finances and the funds used are under joint responsibility and the Member States are not taking their share of the responsibility for this."
"This is also where we have the biggest problems."
"The Commission must therefore put pressure on the Member States to persuade them to assume responsibility for the funds that the EU allows them to manage."
"The report contains three requirements that I would like to emphasise in particular."
"The first is to do more to get the Member States to submit national declarations."
"There are currently four countries that do so - the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark and the United Kingdom."
"This shows that it is possible."
"The Commission must provide these countries with support, but it must also use them as an example in order to force other countries to do the same thing."
"The second point is that the Commission must get better at utilising the opportunity to suspend payments."
"For those countries that repeatedly have problems managing money, payments should be suspended."
"It is not possible to continue mismanaging funds without it being noticed."
"The third point is that we must have better systems for recovering money paid out in error."
"We need clear rules."
"It is a strange situation that those countries with large debts to the EU can continue to have money paid out to them and that it can take such an incredibly long time before the money comes back."
"This is another area in which the Commission must make improvements."
"I am pleased that the Commissioner has met Parliament half way on these three points, and I look forward to being able to work closely with Commissioner Šemeta next year as rapporteur."
"I would like to thank Mr Chatzimarkakis."
"I will try to carry on your work well during the next year."
"Now we are making progress."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - (RO) Madam President, I too want to thank the rapporteur for this excellent report and the very productive cooperation I received while drafting it."
"I also would like to thank the Commission for the dialogue which we managed to have because this budget discharge report is not only an annual discharge report, but it also sets new cooperation guidelines for the next period."
"I would like to raise three issues which I regard as being very important."
"Firstly, I would like to discuss the national management declarations which should indicate how EU money is used."
"More than 80% of the European Union's budget is managed at national level, but almost all the responsibility for managing this money lies at EU level."
"National management declarations should help us a great deal to see how EU money is used by national authorities and who is responsible for the use of this money."
"It is of paramount importance that a minister assumes this responsibility and that these national management declarations have the signature of a political decision-maker on them."
"Secondly, I want to touch on the subject of the automatic blocking of European funds when EU money is badly managed or when there are indications that this money would be badly managed."
"It is extremely important for us to intervene quickly when the management and implementation mechanisms for EU funds are not operating very well."
"Thirdly, we are talking about money from taxpayers, European citizens."
"It is therefore extremely important that, when it comes to the fraudulent use of EU funds, recovery operations are much more efficient and that the cost of them does not come out of the European citizen's pocket."
"This is money which European citizens give the European Union."
"When it has been used fraudulently, it is European citizens who cover the loss."
"This is not fair."
"European citizens have lost out twice and this is a situation which needs to be resolved quickly."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Madam President, I, too, would like to offer sincere thanks to Mr Chatzimarkakis and all the other rapporteurs for their excellent work."
"I, too, would like to thank the Council and the President of the Court of Auditors, in particular, for their presence here, although it is strange that we should have to make specific reference to that."
"Nonetheless, thank you for being here."
"Madam President, the discharge for this year comes at an important moment for two reasons."
"The first reason is that all Member States are having to make extremely stringent cuts."
"The second reason is that we are on the eve of the adoption of a new multiannual budget."
"I believe that both of these reasons highlight the fact that we need to look at this discharge and European spending with additional scrutiny."
"As far as I am concerned, this is about both the legitimacy and the effectiveness of European spending, because European citizens are entitled to expect that European investments really do deliver something."
"Madam President, for me, political accountability for spending is as easy as pie."
"Name one body of local, provincial, regional or national democratic representation that does not exercise political accountability for spending."
"Why then do we not have the same at European level?"
"Why are Member States still failing to exercise responsibility for 80% of the EU's spending?"
"I call once again on the Council to finally get down to work on national Member States' declarations."
"In my view, there will be no multiannual budgets from 2014 onward so long as those declarations from Member States are not given."
"Madam President, the current situation is forcing us to give additional scrutiny to Parliament's own budget."
"I am really pleased with the savings we have managed to make, even though they have come about as a result of our efforts to conserve our resources."
"We are now also going to be using our air miles on business flights and we are going to tackle paper consumption."
"Every one of these proposals is excellent."
"There is one more thing that I would like to point out: from this September, we could use not just cars, but bicycles as well, and through you, Madam Vice-President, I would like to invite Mr Buzek to officially launch this bicycle scheme in September."
"Madam President, this debate covers a very extensive issue, as it involves granting discharge to a whole range of European institutions, each one of which has its own specific features."
"It is therefore very difficult to summarise this issue in one speech."
"Cooperation between the Court of Auditors and the Committee on Budgetary Control, of which I am a member, is excellent, and this cooperation has produced certain recommendations on how the European Parliament should vote when granting discharge."
"Nevertheless, in the evaluation of individual institutions, especially the European agencies, deficiencies constantly arise, for example in the recruitment process, in public procurement, in problems with transparency or problems with internal control."
"It is therefore very difficult, for a whole series of these reasons, to agree to grant discharge."
"On the contrary, we should support the reports which propose postponing discharge."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (NL) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, there are five reports I would like to comment on."
"First of all, the Commission."
"I very much appreciate my fellow member Mr Chatzimarkakis's approach."
"I think that he has done a brilliant job of handling this discharge exercise."
"In a very targeted way, he has focused in advance on a number of questions, he has put six questions to the Commission and I have to say that we have achieved what we asked for."
"I also have to thank the Commission."
"This is my 12th discharge exercise."
"I believe this must be the first time that we have worked together in such a constructive spirit; not only Commissioner Šemeta, but also individual commissioners in charge of their own remits have really invested time on this discharge."
"They have met both the shadow rapporteurs and the lead rapporteur on several occasions and, thanks to their constructive dialogue, I think that we have achieved a great deal."
"I agree to a large extent with what Mr Gerbrandy has said."
"These are times for saving and we therefore need to be prudent about how we spend our money."
"Eighty per cent of the European budget is, indeed, spent in Member States and managed by Member States."
"President-in-Office of the Council, we must finally have this political responsibility for shared management of EU funds in place."
"For that reason, we are still demanding that Member States submit their national declarations of assurance."
"For me, that is a vitally important demand."
"There is also a need for better control."
"I think that Member States should carry out audits of the funds they receive from the EU more intensively than has been the case to date."
"The lead rapporteur has also paid a lot of attention to finding out where funds have been used improperly and recovering them, as well as to introducing control mechanisms."
"The way I see it, that area does indeed deserve a great deal of attention and the comments he has made should provide the basis for the next discharge exercise under Mr Fjellner's rapporteurship."
"Moving to the European Parliament: I see that our Secretary-General is sitting next to the Vice-President."
"I have to offer explicit thanks to Mr Welle."
"I was the discharge rapporteur for the last exercise."
"There was some tension between me and the Secretariat-General."
"Though, at the time, I wrote a rather stringent report, I have to thank Mr Welle because he and his administration have, very diligently, correctly answered all the questions I had put to them and put a great deal of effort into this work."
"I believe that, eventually, the tension that may have existed between us has led to a better result and probably to a better European Parliament budget."
"When we talk about the European Parliament's budget, what I also want to impress on my colleagues here is that we have to do away with the culture of ever more, ever more and never enough."
"As an institution, we should be setting an example, which means that we should also be bold enough to save."
"However, let me add a side comment on that point."
"I have rather grave reservations about the Museum of European History, in particular, not about the content of the project in itself, but about the costs associated with it."
"Obviously, it is good that we are going to have such a museum, but what disturbs me greatly about this is that, in this plenary chamber, we have never really had a serious debate about this project."
"And yet, if we add everything up, we are going to spend more or less EUR 136 million on the Museum of European History."
"That is a lot of money, ladies and gentlemen, but we have never had a serious debate about it."
"We have never debated where this museum should be located and what it should look like."
"All of it is happening behind closed doors, often in the inner sanctum of the Bureau, and, as a democrat, I cannot accept that."
"Let me turn now to the Lux film prize: Mr Itälä has made several comments on this prize in his report and, by the way, I congratulate him on the work that he has done."
"I have to say that my group sets great store by the Lux prize; though we are now most certainly prepared to take on board a number of critical comments about the functioning of the prize, we do consider it valuable that the European Parliament is supporting this project, because that means valuable film projects are getting support."
"I also want to mention Mr Stavrakakis and one of his reports about the Council."
"I am now addressing directly the President-in-Office of the Council, the Hungarian Presidency."
"I find it unbelievable that the Council, which has always demanded that others act transparently, has obviously been much more reserved when it comes to itself."
"Our demand is very simple, President-in-Office: as Parliament, as the body approving the discharge, we want access to all documents."
"We want an open debate about the Council's budget."
"We do not want to talk about the content of the Council's budget and say: you are allowed to do this and you are not allowed to do that, but what we do want is transparency about how the Council is spending its money because the Council's budget is different now from what it used to be 30 years ago and consists of a great deal more than just a number of administrative expenses."
"Finally, I would just like to comment on the European Medicines Agency."
"We have problems there."
"We have postponed the discharge, because EMEA is clearly having problems in terms of procurement procedures."
"Its procurement procedures for several projects have been fraught with errors, which corresponds to the significant amount of EUR 30 million."
"Moreover, there have been issues surrounding conflicts of interest of EMEA's experts and staff."
"I believe, now that the discharge has been postponed, we will have a debate on this at some point before the autumn and I hope that, with that debate, we will be able to put an end to conflicts of interest within EMEA."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DA) Thank you, Madam President."
"I would like to start by thanking everyone involved in drawing up these excellent and critical reports on the EU institutions' accounts for 2009."
"Some people have questioned whether we are not being overly critical."
"For example, when we ask questions about our own method of spending money here in the European Parliament, whether in relation to the delayed opening of the Visitors' Centre, the establishment of a secret television channel or the continuing travelling circus moving between Brussels and Strasbourg."
"No, we are not being overly critical."
"In fact our job, on behalf of European taxpayers, is precisely to put our finger on the sensitive areas and press hard."
"That is what our citizens expect of us, and in reality we could have included even more points of criticism."
"The fact that it is our job to investigate and to be critical is precisely why the Council's behaviour is unacceptable."
"This year, the Council has again done everything it can to impede our work as auditors."
"It has refused to send us the relevant material, it has refused to answer our questions and it has refused to meet the Committee on Budgetary Control for an open debate, as all the other institutions do."
"I am obviously pleased that the Hungarian Presidency has chosen to be here."
"It should be commended for this."
"However, when we talk about a 'gentlemen's agreement' between the Council and Parliament, I have to say that, if there is such an agreement, please can we see it."
"The Council has the chance to read it out today, if such an agreement exists."
"We would like to see it."
"We have repeatedly asked the Council to let us have it, but we have never received it."
"This is because it does not exist."
"Therefore, my group can fully support the proposal not to grant discharge to the Council today."
"Instead, we would call on the Council to desist from boycotting Parliament and to answer the questions that we are asking about its accounts."
"Today we are debating the EU's accounts for 2009."
"However, just as important as what the accounts tell us is what they do not tell us about something that is extremely important for the EU's economy."
"A few days ago, Europol published a report on organised crime in the EU."
"It made shocking reading."
"According to the account in the newspaper Le Monde, VAT fraud alone costs many billions of euro a year."
"There is also fraud in connection with CO2 quotas, as well as other types of fraud."
"Therefore, there is certainly reason for us to continue, and intensify, our discussion of how the EU's economy can be organised in the interests of taxpayers."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Madam President, I believe it is madness for this European Parliament to approve the 2009 EU budget when financial irregularities or possible fraud affect between 2% and more than 5% of the total."
"These are not figures made up by me to suit party-political propaganda, but estimates from the European Court of Auditors."
"The level of irregularities for 2009 is abnormally high and equates to half of the UK's contribution for the EU for this year, roughly EUR 6.3 billion."
"This situation would simply not be tolerated in any company or organisation: heads would roll."
"This House is set to approve discharge for 27 EU agencies - expensive and needless quangos - while the European Court of Auditors has launched a full-scale investigation into their accounts for 2009."
"This should ring alarm bells ahead of the vote."
"I repeat, in the strongest possible terms, that it is nothing short of madness to sign off EUR 523 million of - let us remember - taxpayers' money, while the official auditing arm of the EU is investigating possible fraud and financial mismanagement at these agencies."
"Medicines Agency and CEPOL postponement is piecemeal."
"Year after year we hear the European Commission blame the Member States for the irregularities, yet it does absolutely nothing about it when it has the power to block funding."
"Instead it is proposing to move from a zero tolerance strategy to one of tolerable risk when it comes to EU expenditure fraud."
"To make matters worse, the Commission and Parliament are demanding increases in the budget for the coming years."
"Most of these increases coincide with the areas with the highest level of irregularities."
"It will be an absolute disgrace, and an affront to taxpayers, if this House grants discharge for the 2009 accounts."
"The only conclusion to be drawn from a vote in favour of discharge is that this House and its Members openly endorse financial mismanagement or worse."
"I call on the British Prime Minister to reduce the UK's contribution to the EU in line with the amount of the irregularities if the European Parliament fails to act in the interests of the British taxpayer."
"(DE) Madam President, perhaps you would allow me briefly to make a very general appeal to my fellow Members with regard to the discharge procedure."
"Budgetary control - and thus also the discharge procedure - is undoubtedly an essential element of parliamentary work, but in my opinion this discharge procedure has no teeth whatsoever."
"Even if discharge is refused, there is no real possibility of binding sanctions; the only thing that can be done is for the president of the European Parliament to bring Treaty infringement proceedings at the European Court of Justice."
"In the event that discharge were to be refused for the European Parliament, we would end up with the absurd situation of the presidency of Parliament initiating infringement proceedings against itself."
"There can be no doubt that reform is needed here."
"Moreover, the fact that the legal basis of the discharge process was geared mainly towards the Commission yet we tend to grant discharge reciprocally with other institutions creates a certain amount of legal uncertainty that we should be preventing."
"What remains in practice are other political levers that we can use."
"That is not sufficient for this discharge procedure."
"I, along with my fellow Members, would therefore like us to work towards reforming the discharge process."
"Corrigenda (Rule 216): see Minutes"
"2009 discharge (continuation of debate)"
"The next item is the continuation of the joint debate on the 2009 discharge."
"Madam President, the first issue I want to discuss is that of our concerns about the functioning of the European agencies."
"These are areas of concern in which we need to make changes in the future in order to prevent and avoid bad management, irregularities, fraud, conflicts of interest and, at the end of the day, bad expenditure."
"One of our concerns is institutional transparency."
"All the EU agencies should make available on their websites a list of all contracts awarded over the previous three years at least, and the Commission should undertake to integrate this information into its financial transparency system. Transparency is also needed with regard to the rotation of staff between agencies, and I have asked for an overview of all staff members who change working place from one agency to another."
"A second area of concern is conflicts of interest, and many of my colleagues have referred to this already."
"Proper management of current and potential conflicts of interest in the EU agencies requires a major effort, and cases such as that involving the European Medicines Agency must be prevented and avoided, and penalised wherever they occur."
"The third area of concern is rationality and efficiency in the functioning of the EU agencies, especially at a time of financial crisis."
"I propose discussing and finalising a merger of CEPOL into Europol, as this would be the best solution to CEPOL's structural and chronic problems."
"Moreover, it is undeniable, beyond the CEPOL case, that a number of EU agencies with common fields of intervention are performing similar or complementary activities from headquarters located all over Europe."
"The Commission should therefore evaluate the possibility of merging agencies with overlapping or complementary activities."
"The second issue I would like to address very quickly is the fact that we decided to postpone the discharge, and will vote to postpone the discharge, for two agencies - CEPOL and EMA."
"There have been serious violations in terms of public procurement, recruitment and conflicts of interest and also, with regard to CEPOL, appropriations and the cancellation of appropriations."
"The last issue I would like to refer to is the transparency of EU beneficiary funds."
"I have been questioning the Commission about this for a year and I will continue to do so."
"We need transparency in all EU beneficiary funds, and I would draw attention here to the national companies which benefit from and use such funds."
"There must be a single website, in one or two languages, with common criteria, on which all these beneficiaries can be identified and compared."
"(ES) Madam President, first of all, I should like to say how pleased I am to finally see all the actors in this discharge procedure together."
"In particular, I would welcome Mr Caldeira, President of the Court of Auditors, and Mr Becsey, representative of the Hungarian Presidency, as well as Commissioner Šemeta, naturally."
"As regards the current discharge procedure, with respect, in particular, to the other institutions, which is my field, I should like to express my agreement with the steps that have been taken since last year's Spanish Presidency decided, when applying the Treaty of Lisbon, that it was time to bring the necessary transparency and control of the Council's accounts up-to-date too."
"The gentlemen's agreement was useful last century, but its bases have changed radically."
"I would therefore be grateful if the Hungarian Presidency kept up these efforts toward continued progress, whilst recognising that the Council gives advice or makes recommendations on the discharge procedure, but it is Parliament - the European Union's only democratic institution, directly elected by the European public - that decides and adopts the final decision."
"Let us, then, acknowledge the efforts that both institutions - ours well represented by Mr Welle - are making so that we can have a procedure suitable for the 21st century, and institutions that must be transparent and respond to the European public's expectations."
"As rapporteur for next year's discharge, I mean to continue cooperating closely with the Council to that end, but for the moment the deferral is still necessary."
"I will conclude by expressing my concern about the incidents and irregularities that have taken place in the administration of the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC)."
"As a European-level forum for expressing opinions and reaching a consensus between the three pillars of our productive and economic life, which are so necessary at this time of crisis, it is a body that seems essential to me."
"That, then, is reason enough to demand that it be administered as impeccably as the other institutions."
"Therefore, given the decision of the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) to start investigative proceedings, as well as the recent General Court judgment annulling the vacancy notice concerning the post of Secretary-General of the EESC, my group intends to clearly call for a deferral until the EESC has been given the opportunity to table a plan or strategy before Parliament for overcoming the current situation of opacity and continuous irregularities, which reveal the urgent need for change."
"(NL) Madam President, rapporteur Chatzimarkakis and many other speakers have rightly highlighted the need for Member States to submit declarations of assurance."
"It may rather appear as if we are asking the Council and Member States for a favour."
"I believe that that is a misconstruction of the situation and that is why I think it is good that the Council is present here this morning."
"Perhaps it would be good for the Council to read once again the exact wording of the interinstitutional agreement which was entered into when we adopted the financial perspectives for this period."
"The agreement clearly states that the Council would issue declarations at the most appropriate political level."
"It is unfortunate that the Council has not adhered to these arrangements."
"However, the agreement was supposed to be a quid pro quo and it is perhaps good to remind you of this, now that we are busy negotiating new financial perspectives."
"There was a difference of opinion between the Council and Parliament over the level of the financial perspectives."
"The difference was EUR 112 billion over a seven-year period."
"Parliament agreed to revise their figure to EUR 110 billion."
"What we wanted in return were a number of things which would not cost any money at all."
"Declarations of assurance from Member States and political responsibility cost nothing."
"That is what the Council signed up to."
"What, though, is the situation now, four years after that date?"
"Four Member States have complied with the agreement, but the others have not."
"That is a good omen for the upcoming negotiations."
"You have to be as good as your word, even though it was Austria that held the presidency of the Council back then."
"I therefore think that it is vital that we actually implement the action programme that has been agreed, because, otherwise, the negotiations over the new financial perspectives will be at risk."
"Finally, I would like to touch on a general matter."
"If I am not mistaken, it is now the seventeenth time that the European Court of Auditors has failed to issue a declaration of assurance."
"In light of the upcoming European elections, maintaining a situation whereby Parliament nonetheless grants a discharge for the budget every year will be untenable."
"It is time we had a positive DAS for a change."
"- (CS) Madam President, we are discussing an apparently routine matter, moreover it is money that has already been spent."
"The annual repeat performance of this procedure should, above all, lead to a situation where matters are assessed and prepared more carefully and conscientiously in the future."
"For example, in the case of the two largest EU projects, which are the global satellite navigation system and the European joint undertaking for ITER and the development of nuclear fusion, I consider it unacceptable that such important projects are literally 'drowning' in deficiencies which any decent manager would know how to resolve."
"Irregularities in the involvement of small and medium-sized enterprises in satellite projects, deficiencies in recruitment and infringements of the principles of equal treatment, problems in the ITER undertaking over compliance with budgetary principles, audits and rules for providing grants; these are just some of the errors identified."
"One of the main causes of problems, however, is undoubtedly the lengthy decision-making on the projects themselves."
"Unless we are clear about priorities, including funding in such key activities, half-hearted and patchy decision-making will continue to bring not only the problems mentioned, but also a reduction in the overall quality of projects."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, at a time of general economic belt-tightening in which everyone is being asked to make sacrifices, I think it is essential for the European institutions - which operate thanks to the money of European citizens - to have the most transparent financial management possible."
"I find it unacceptable that one of its main bodies, the Council, should continue to maintain a stance that is totally insular and lacking in transparency."
"Given that Parliament is the only European institution that is democratically elected and that represents European citizens and taxpayers directly, I believe we have the right to know exactly how all the appropriations are managed."
"The Council cannot keep behaving as it is, rejecting necessary and proper interinstitutional comparison."
"The European Union is based on a fundamental balance of powers, a prerogative which the Council undermines by acting in this way."
"It must therefore fall into line with the other institutions as quickly as possible and explain to Parliament - and therefore citizens - how its budget is actually managed."
"(NL) Madam President, it seems that we have a new rule in Europe: in case of doubt, create an agency."
"Today we are debating the reports of no fewer than 39 agencies and Parliament will be deciding on whether or not to grant discharge for 2009."
"As far as my group is concerned, discharge should definitely not be granted."
"The Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV) is against these monstrosities which just eat money and do not serve a single demonstrable purpose."
"That is the case with the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions."
"The Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions alone have already swallowed up hundreds of millions of euros and, yet, they have had no effect on policy."
"They are merely talking shops, where litres of coffee are consumed and which produce an endless stream of reports which not a single person reads."
"Madam President, our group will therefore not be granting discharge, except to the conclusion that there is a great deal in these agencies that is not working properly; in fact there is so much that is not working that we should abolish them as soon as possible."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by saying something about the comments on the House of European History."
"As rapporteur for buildings I would firstly like to say that the figure of EUR 136 million is definitely incorrect."
"Secondly, we are not talking about a prestige project here; after all, we are constantly complaining that people know nothing of European development since the Second World War, and we now want to make sure that two to three million people a year get to know these developments and find out more about them - so that perhaps they will be less Eurosceptic."
"We should debate together the level of the operating costs and the synergies that may be able to be realised with the information centre."
"A great many Members have taken part in the debate."
"However, the debate has only just become public, with the result that some Members do not yet feel they have been adequately informed."
"I will be happy to provide assistance with such discussions or requests for information."
"I consider the project to be necessary and useful, because people need to find out more about European development - otherwise there will be more and more Eurosceptics."
"Secondly, on the subject of development aid. I would first like to thank Mr Staes warmly for the fact that we have genuinely achieved a joint report in many, many respects that I can categorically support."
"I consider it essential that we set development aid priorities in the areas of infrastructure, health, education and particularly agriculture, and in particular I think that perhaps we should consider introducing an evaluation of projects after 10 years."
"It is not our aim to start only short-term projects that in the final event have no lasting effect."
"Moreover, we should make sure that we achieve better coordination of development aid with the Member States and also are able to implement once and for all the integration of the entire development aid budget into the EU budget, because it is incomprehensible why only part of our development aid is included in the EU budget."
"(LT) Madam President, I would like to thank all the rapporteurs for their excellent work."
"The budget discharge procedure is very important for defending the European Union's financial interests, for ensuring better management of European Union finances and more transparent and responsible European Union handling of taxpayers' money."
"I have a few comments."
"Firstly, infringements of rules on procurement remain some of the most frequent errors mentioned in the report on the budget discharge."
"This is linked to the complexity of these rules."
"There is a need to simplify procurement rules and set out clear and uniform procurement principles throughout the entire European Union."
"The Commission should analyse the best experience gained in this area, because some Member States, such as Lithuania, have already established sufficiently effective procurement principles, based on modern technologies, but as I mentioned, the Commission itself has to express its political will on this matter."
"Secondly, I would like to emphasise that improving the quality of how the funds are spent should not only be an important European Union priority, but a realistic one."
"There needs to be clear and more rapid progress developing effective management and control systems in the Member States, reducing the level of risk of error and simplifying requirements and rules."
"For example, the report presented stresses that, due to complicated rules, there is slow uptake of European Union funds earmarked for TEN and TNI projects and other cohesion policy priorities."
"I feel that in this area there is an urgent need to ensure the simplification, effectiveness and transparency of procedures."
"Thirdly, as rapporteur responsible for the working document of the Committee on Budgetary Control ""Improving transport performance on trans-European rail axes”, I would again like to call on the Commission to take action in order to adapt the rail infrastructure to cater for trans-European services, while creating missing links at cross-border locations, helping the Member States to alleviate various complications related to the different gauges and providing the effective financial assistance."
"Finally, as for discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Parliament for 2009, I believe that Parliament also has to implement realistic decisions which would include better value for money."
"(FI) Madam President, in my speech I want to focus mainly on cohesion policy."
"Although the error rate in cohesion policy has fallen considerably since 2008, from 11% to around 5%, it is still an area which presents us with a number of challenges in spending."
"The biggest challenges relate specifically to public procurement and, in addition, most of the problems connected with cohesion funds are also associated with the complicated implementing rules and the acts arising from the Financial Regulation, which take insufficient account of the complex network of actors in regional development."
"Much has also been spoken of increasing the risk of error."
"We nevertheless have to remember that this does not eliminate the fundamental problem of rules and systems being too complicated."
"Moreover, in this case the problems should not be tackled from the wrong angle."
"At the same time, Parliament is also considering the Financial Regulation for future financial frameworks."
"Although the discharge process now under way has its focus on the year 2009, it is important to learn a lesson for tomorrow and finally also simplify financial management."
"(PL) Madam President, what matters is not in fact that the number of Eurosceptics is growing as a result of the way in which the EU institutions spend money; the problem is that European taxpayers and European voters deserve transparency and a certain basic respect."
"The fact that funds are recovered very inefficiently, or that they are used inefficiently, certainly does nothing to enhance the authority of the European Union or our institutions."
"It also does nothing to enhance the authority of the agencies, which are examples of a certain kind of Euro-bureaucracy, which evade internal and external monitoring, where friends are employed and where the idea of competitive selection procedures is pure fantasy."
"The Museum of European History is a very controversial proposal, and therefore the majority of the members of our group will vote against the majority of these reports."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European agencies are permanently in the crossfire of criticism."
"Yet on the other hand, we rely on them when problems arise almost overnight; for example, if increased FRONTEX personnel are required in the Mediterranean or if dioxin is found in animal feed."
"For this reason I would ask all my fellow Members to apply a sense of proportion and political foresight to these discharges."
"We need to evaluate the operational efficiency of the agencies objectively if we are to get away from opinions and assumptions and get a clear overview of what the agencies are actually achieving."
"I have been working to achieve this for some time."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, I would also like to warmly welcome to this House the Hungarian Presidency and the President of the European Court of Auditors."
"On behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) I should like to thank all the rapporteurs for their cooperation and also all the representatives of the institutions for coming."
"I should like to point out to the Council at this early stage that Members of Parliament are elected to control the executive."
"The idea, then, that national governments should be allowed to control the European Parliament is an unprecedented attempt to weaken this Parliament."
"Consequently, your offer is not really an offer."
"It is an offer to make us small and weak."
"How would the national parliaments react to such a suggestion?"
"If you would not dare to try it nationally, please do not attempt it at European level."
"Regarding the discharge in the European Parliament I should like to say that improvements in management can be discerned under the current Bureau and the present Secretary-General."
"I would like to expressly acknowledge the PPE Group's part in these improvements."
"We can see that action is being taken and that things are being done at our request - such as the intervention in the voluntary pension fund - that were absolutely necessary in order to avert the immediate insolvency of this fund in 2009."
"I should now like to comment principally on the proposals to reform the Staff Regulations."
"These are paragraphs 77 and 81 in the report by Mr Chatzimarkakis."
"These proposals have led to unprecedented lobbying by those affected, including of Members here in this House."
"The criticism of the Regulations is justified, however."
"The Regulations are still living in the 1950s and have never been modernised."
"Travel days are calculated based on times taken in the days of steam and the benefits come from a time when working abroad was extremely unusual."
"They are no longer justified today."
"We have today our last and actually our only opportunity to have an influence ahead of the reform of the Regulations."
"My proposals also concern the matter of whether it is normal for a member of Commission staff - not including their annual holiday entitlement, note - to have up to seven weeks paid time off, and this for all those earning more than EUR 10 000 net per month."
"In my opinion, overtime should definitely be included in this salary."
"What we are talking about here is creating new job vacancies."
"By removing some of these days off we could create around a thousand jobs."
"Instead of being days struck out, these new jobs could be used for Europe's new tasks so that we can make recourse to the European Commission instead of constantly having to establish new authorities and agencies."
"We should also seek to obtain a true overview of the administrative costs."
"The current 6.7% of the budget is far too low an estimate."
"It may be correct for direct management, but it is certainly not correct if we include all the administrative expenditure - including that in the Member States - for managing EU funds."
"I suggest that we produce an own-initiative report on the actual administrative costs of the European Union here in the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"(PL) Madam President, Commissioner, I regard this discharge as yet another in a series of discharges granted in recent years, and I remember very well how serious our reservations were only three years ago, in particular with regard to areas such as the Structural Funds, the Cohesion Fund, the regional funds and external actions."
"It has to be admitted that the Commission has fulfilled certain commitments over the past two years by making visible improvements, such as a reduction in the error rate recorded over the past three years."
"I think this is a good opportunity to say to Commissioner Šemeta that we have seen and noticed these developments, that we are taking note of them and that they are a good sign."
"I still have a number of concerns, however."
"Firstly, the procedure for recovering misspent funds is too slow."
"Secondly, there is a certain reluctance to concentrate on priority projects, or to talk about the error rate for these projects."
"Regardless of a project's value, I think that there must be some reason behind errors in funding and in the implementation of funds."
"I am very concerned by the growing discrepancy between commitments and payments, which means that there is a growing pot of money that the Member States are apparently unable to spend."
"The blame here lies with the Member States."
"The Council's reluctance to cooperate with Parliament as far as the discharge is concerned is extremely alarming."
"Yet I see that Mr Becsey is with us, who has served his time in this Chamber, and who I think will be able to convince the Council that Parliament is the only democratically and directly elected body in respect of which the Council has a reporting obligation."
"Finally, I share the many reservations that have been voiced regarding the agencies, although my reservations only relate to a small number of them."
"(FR) Madam President, my speech will concern the granting of discharge to the European Medicines Agency, but I could have made more or less the same speech about the European Food Safety Authority."
"I have to say that the Committee on Budgetary Control has done an absolutely excellent job, and that if there were ever a time for Parliament to state its position, it is during the vote on discharge."
"Therefore, there is indeed a budgetary aspect to what I am going to say, and it relates to the EMA's work."
"Firstly in terms of its passivity in the benfluorex, or Mediator, affair - it is totally unacceptable."
"Secondly, in terms of the management of conflicts of interest, and I shall give just one example."
"I have publicly denounced, together with our colleague Mrs Parvanova and a group of NGOs, the truly scandalous case of the Agency's Executive Director."
"This whole affair has been managed by the Agency's Management Board in an extremely casual way, which makes it impossible to build trust."
"The role of our agencies is to give us the means to take decisions and to enable our fellow citizens to have confidence in the guidelines that are given."
"That is why I strongly support the postponement of discharge and will vote in favour only if we are fully satisfied with regard to conflicts of interest."
"(NL) Madam President, the Eurobarometer shows that enthusiasm for the European Union has been fading for years."
"There are now only five Member States in which the majority of the population speaks about the European Union in positive terms."
"As far as the citizens are concerned, Europe is synonymous with waste of money."
"We have to take those objections extremely seriously and, indeed, my fellow member Mr Itälä has rightly done so."
"He argues that it is irresponsible of Parliament to continue the practice of meeting in two locations."
"I totally agree with him on that."
"To Mr Sarkozy, I say: we have to put a stop to Parliament travelling back and forth between Brussels and Strasbourg."
"We also need sound accountability when it comes to our own general expenditure allowance."
"Because of a lack of such sound accountability, members of the European Parliament will soon find that appearances are against them and that they really ought to have paid more attention to the general expenditure allowance."
"That situation has to change."
"Mr Itälä rightly argues in recital 5 that we must take adequate measures to ensure for a responsible attitude towards our general expenditure allowance."
"I hope that recital will stay, because it is good for credibility and transparency."
"(PL) Madam President, every debate on the discharge takes place in a certain context."
"On the one hand, today's debate is taking place in the context of the crisis, the preventive measures being taken and the financial difficulties being experienced by certain Member States, while on the other hand it is being held against the backdrop of the new financial perspective for the post-2014 period, which has already been drafted."
"We must be aware of the fact that our comments today regarding the implementation of the budget have a very serious impact on the debate on the future of the financial perspective."
"Therefore the debate on the discharge is important not only in terms of monitoring, but also in terms of correcting errors and taking note of areas where we have failed or where up-to-date measures mean we are now faced with new requirements."
"A characteristic feature of this debate is not only the fact that ever more people are criticising the budget, but also that the results are quite obviously better, for example in respect of cohesion policy, where clear improvements have been made, albeit improvements which have gone unnoticed by the critics of the European budget."
"I would also like to draw attention to the fact that these positive results must now also be integrated into our considerations regarding future action, or in other words the type of action that must be continued and the regulations that must be introduced, in particular with regard to the recovery of funds."
"I would also like to draw the House's attention to the following issue: the debate on whether the budget has been implemented properly must be accompanied by a debate on the effectiveness of policies."
"We refer to this very frequently in parliamentary documents, but we concentrate on procedures."
"There has been much talk of a Europe of results, but this is not the same as following the correct procedures."
"One entails the other, but we must also pay attention to the effects and results of our actions."
"Mr President, I would like to thank all the rapporteurs: they have done an important job for us."
"In my contribution I would like to comment on a few reports, and firstly on the discharge for the Committee of the Regions."
"The CoR is, of course, the voice of regions but it also delivers many EU programmes."
"It would therefore be wrong to suggest, as some have done, that it should fund itself."
"On the Commission's discharge, I support the granting of a discharge."
"Although more needs to be done, as outlined in the report, I believe that reducing the error rate for regional policy from 11% to 5% is real progress."
"Structural funds are extremely important for places like Wales - where I come from - where they are implemented very well."
"We therefore need to ensure that structural funds are not discredited or undermined."
"On the Council discharge, I would support postponement."
"We are often lectured by certain Council members on the need for transparency, so they themselves should be open to providing information on their expenditure."
"Unfortunately, some seem reluctant to do so."
"Finally, I would like to say a few words on Parliament's discharge."
"It is always controversial to consider one's own spending, and our budget certainly receives a lot of attention, which is perhaps understandable in times of economic and financial difficulties."
"Therefore I am pleased with many of the suggestions made in the report, including on issues concerning buildings policy and prizes - which need to be reviewed and made more transparent - as well as allowances and the important issue of the need for a savings strategy for Parliament's budget."
"It could be argued that many of these points concern future budgets rather than the 2009 budget, but I believe that, when we consider any budget and any discharge, we should also look to the future to ensure that we learn lessons from the past."
"Mr President, for the 16th year the Court of Auditors has only given a qualified statement of assurance, which means for the 16th year public confidence in the integrity of the management of our financial affairs has been undermined."
"I recognise that the Commission has made efforts to make improvements, but in voting to grant discharge I can only vote outcomes, not intent."
"The auditors report that far too many headings are materially affected by error and, since 80% of our spending is under shared management with the Member States, it is perfectly clear that the Member States must accept greater responsibility."
"It is clear too that the Commission must give greater urgency to achieving that outcome."
"So until I see evidence of significant improvement, I shall continue to vote against discharge of the budget."
"(FR) Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating all the rapporteurs on the huge amount of work they have done on this discharge, and I am also pleased that the Council is in attendance for this debate."
"The European Parliament's seat in Strasbourg is a question of European identity, not just a question of saving money."
"I am discussing this today, in this House, during the debate on the 2009 discharge because the symbol of Franco-German reconciliation is being treated by some members of the Committee on Budgetary Control as a blessing, as an easy way to cut costs."
"The issue of Parliament's expenditure also interests me."
"While on this subject, I propose that we hold the group weeks in Strasbourg rather than in Brussels; that way, we would ensure that our parliamentary seat in Strasbourg is cost-effective."
"Since we want to make savings, I propose other things, such as abolishing the Friday subsistence allowance for our colleagues and the subsistence allowances for journalists, too."
"Europe is enough of a draw for journalists not to have to be given a subsistence allowance."
"We should not use the budget as an excuse for appropriating an important issue that goes beyond the scope of budgetary control, and though I welcome the important work done by Mr Itälä, our rapporteur, I say this with regard to this discharge."
"Lastly, since we are talking about savings, I should also like us to clean up and reorganise the system for reimbursing sponsored visitors groups."
"I do not think it is very moral to reimburse the group leader in cash on the day of the visit without making any effort to check how much the group has spent."
"It gives a very poor impression of our institution."
"I would inform you that the amount allocated sometimes exceeds the amount actually spent."
"It would make sense for the groups to send an estimate prior to the visits, for Parliament to send them an advance payment on their expenses, to be paid into a bank account, and for the balance to be paid upon presentation of the receipts detailing the expenses actually incurred, up to a certain amount, of course."
"(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Becsey, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to congratulate all the rapporteurs on their excellent work."
"I want this speech to focus, in particular, on heading 5, relating to the administrative and operational expenditure of the various institutions, and to recall that the volume of administrative and operational expenditure represents less than 6% of the European Union's annual budget."
"Despite this figure, I believe it essential that the principles of economy, efficiency and effectiveness be applied."
"It is in budgetary implementation, above all, that savings need to be promoted and incentivised."
"At the same time, under no circumstances can we incentivise and promote the full usage of all the funds for each heading."
"It is important that rigour and austerity be advocated, and, at the same time, that Parliament have the minimum resources that it needs for excellence in lawmaking."
"With regard to interpretation and translation, I believe it essential and crucial that members be able to express themselves and work in their native language."
"In essence, that is us giving meaning to the motto 'united in diversity'."
"I believe that, in place of purely incremental budgets, we should have zero-based budgeting at the beginning of each parliamentary session, and furthermore that the institutions' budgets should be multiannual budgets."
"Control cannot mean bureaucracy, since this is always an unnecessary cost."
"The principle of trust in the institutions should prevail."
"Finally, discharge cannot be a time for discussing detailed policy requiring broad consensus, in particular revision of the Treaties."
"For example, I consider the discussion of workplace-related issues in discharge reports inappropriate."
"(DE) Mr President, honourable members of the Council and Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to comment on the agencies that I dealt with as a member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety."
"First, however, let me say one thing about the permanent debate on Strasbourg versus Brussels."
"I am a definite advocate of Strasbourg and I believe that if there is any doubt then we should move the entire parliament to Strasbourg, not to Brussels."
"Strasbourg is a symbol of European unity that must not be abandoned."
"In the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety we looked at six agencies that have achieved outstanding results in terms of the intensity and quality of their work."
"The error rate has reduced noticeably."
"I should therefore like to take this opportunity to praise the staff of these agencies."
"A total of 104 new jobs were created at the European Chemicals Agency, which mainly supervises our REACH projects."
"In the case of the European Food Safety Authority, or EFSA, it should be noted that we need to achieve more precise monitoring and greater transparency."
"In the case of the European Centre for Disease Control, or ECDC, we found that the funds had not been fully utilised."
"Not all its tasks have yet been discharged."
"The European Environment Agency reliably provides data and figures that are very important for our work, for the way we shape the future."
"However, I would like us to establish more precisely what overall cost savings the Union will achieve as a result of environmental improvements and to present these figures."
"The European Medicines Agency is still clearly having difficulty getting things off the ground, despite having been in existence for some years now."
"We found some accounting errors and inadequate coordination between financial services and scientific services here."
"Overall, however, I consider the work of the agencies to be very positive."
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Ulmer for his noticeably factual contribution."
"It makes a pleasant contrast to many of the things that I have heard said about the agencies this morning."
"It is extremely depressing that many of the Members from the Eurosceptic parts of this House can never think of anything else but the agencies when it comes to budget cuts."
"May I remind you that when these agencies were allocated it seemed that the prime ministers and governments of the Member States of the European Union could not get enough of these agencies on their soil."
"Yet now people are acting as if they are the scourge of the European Union."
"I am very pleased at the announcement of a study by the European Court of Auditors into the management costs of the agencies."
"I believe it will provide us with a basis to at last have a more objective debate."
"I am delighted - as I said previously in my first contribution - that the representatives of the Hungarian Presidency are here with us this morning."
"That is not something we can take for granted when there is a debate that includes the discharge of the Council."
"I would therefore like to address you directly, Mr Becsey."
"I am pleased that the Council is prepared to recognise - as I took from the comments made by Mr Deutsch - that the budget proceedings and the discharge procedure must be dealt with differently."
"This European Parliament is the people's representation and it demands accountability for the use of taxpayers' money."
"We will therefore not shirk from demanding that the Council be held accountable for the money given to the Council from the Community budget to finance its work."
"Of course, there is plenty that we could negotiate on, such as what form the discharge procedure should take in the future."
"However, I should like to ask you whether you seriously expect the European Parliament to negotiate on something that is our right under the treaties."
"After all, that could only result in this right being restricted."
"I fail to see why I, as a Member of the European Parliament, would do that."
"Unfortunately, we do not have many opportunities to discuss things together and I would be delighted if you would take this opportunity to make it clear to us for once who it is in the Council that is actually fighting against the necessary transparency."
"- (SK) Mr President, I was interested to hear the information about the communication problems with the European Council regarding fulfilment of its chapter of the general budget."
"As far as I am aware, control over the executive is one of the fundamental tasks of MEPs."
"The Council, the Commission and also the other EU institutions handle the financial resources of EU citizens according to agreed rules."
"It is therefore natural that the elected representatives of the people perform checks on behalf of taxpayers as to whether the institutions are handling citizens' money carefully and in accordance with the agreed rules."
"It works the same way in all democratic states."
"I therefore cannot understand the position of the European Council, which refuses to give us the cooperation necessary for assessing its budget."
"We are not asking whether Mr Sarkozy or Mrs Merkel are visiting a better or worse restaurant or purchasing a better or worse briefcase, or buying the clothes of this or that firm, but we are asking how they handle the public resources of taxpayers, and we are fully entitled to do this, and they are wholly obliged to provide this information."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (HU) Mr President, since I have only two minutes to react, I would like to address only a few things."
"One is, I would like to reiterate that we are prepared to reach a long-term agreement in the debate between the Council and Parliament."
"Only this can solve the problem, namely, the problem of legitimacy, which was also mentioned by Mrs Gräßle."
"Let me tell you that I know that Parliament is a directly elected body - after all, I was also a Member; but there are legitimate leaders, ministers, in the Council as well."
"Furthermore, both bodies are equal participants in the discharge procedure: one of them at the level of recommendation, the other in the case of final discharge."
"In the recommendation submitted we separated the budgetary process and the discharge process."
"I would like to request appointment of a delegation to negotiate on behalf of Parliament and we should reach an agreement by means of a politically representative delegation for Parliament."
"It is not helpful to continue with these problems."
"And it is also clear from the draft Memorandum of Understanding we have submitted that we also have to clarify what data provision falls within the competence of the Council and what does not."
"I think this will promote presentation between the various administrations."
"Then we can indeed be requested to provide data that fall within the competence of the Council."
"As regards national declarations, which has also been raised several times, I propose that we should solve this in the debate on the Financial Regulation."
"I know there are proposals concerning this."
"Of course the complexity of the issue in certain Member States has to be considered, but I repeat that this will be a very significant point of debate in another process."
"Mr President, thank you for the opportunity to speak, and I would like to urge everyone once again not to turn the relationship between the two discharge bodies or institutions into a wrestling match."
"Let us sit down and negotiate, and reach an agreement instead of degrading this problem to a mailing debate of the secretariats and bureaucracies."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, this debate confirms the broad common understanding between Parliament and the Commission on the way forward and on the need to improve our policies and programmes, bringing added value to EU citizens."
"I think we are moving in the right direction, and the issues you have raised concerning the introduction of management declarations, more automaticity in the application of sanctions and work on recoveries are really important subjects, on which the Commission is working."
"I would like, in particular, to thank Ms Grässle for her work on the Financial Regulation."
"I think it is very important that the proposal submitted by the Commission on the introduction of management declarations is finally approved because this issue is really about increasing the accountability of our Member States, which are responsible for managing 80% of your budget."
"With streamlined and much more automatic application of the interruption of payments procedure, I think we will see, in the discharge for 2010, that the incidence of interruption of payments is growing and services are no longer afraid to apply this instrument in their work."
"We are also working with the Member States on recoveries, and we submitted a lot of information to the rapporteur about the situation in relation to recoveries."
"I think that, working together, we can find ways of improving the situation here."
"Of course, sanctions are a good thing but we also have to seek incentives, and this is an important subject in terms of facilitating our Member States' activity."
"We all agree that we have moved forward on simplification of our rules, and we have presented our views on this subject."
"These proposals will be taken into account when we are preparing new programmes for the next Multiannual Financial Framework."
"I fully agree that our public procurement legislation is very complex, and a great many errors are occurring in the area of public procurement."
"That is why the Commission has launched a public consultation on the simplification and improvement of public procurement rules, and I hope this will lead to a much simpler and more efficient system."
"With regard to the Staff Regulations, it is time to look at them once again, and my colleague Maroš Šefčovič is working on a revision of the Staff Regulations."
"This is, of course, a complex issue, and we have to take into account all those sensitive matters which are related to simplification, but the fact is that certain provisions in the Regulations are really outdated and need to be reconsidered and revised."
"Of course, the Commission will reply formally to your recommendations in the follow-up report, to be presented after the summer, but, as you can see, we are already working hard to reinforce the management of the EU budget and improve the performance of our programmes."
"I am looking forward to our future cooperation."
"Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the Commissioner once again on behalf of Parliament for his excellent cooperation."
"You have now raised certain points once again."
"We should take these as a starting point for our continued work."
"However, I would also ask you to pass on our thanks to your colleagues, because we had a very intense exchange with many individuals - I should particularly like to mention Mr Cioloş and Mr Hahn - and both were very cooperative."
"Please would you pass this message on to them once again."
"I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Becsey, for his clear words."
"He spoke very clearly; we may not like what he said, but at least he was clear in what he said and we are grateful for that."
"I consider it only right that you are here."
"I do not think there is particular cause to mention it."
"Nonetheless, it is good that you are here."
"I have saved my final thanks for the President of the European Court of Auditors, Mr Caldeira, with whom Parliament always enjoys genuinely open and positive cooperation. We very much appreciate that."
"Our work would not be possible without your background work."
"Our discharge is based mainly on your contributions."
"We would like to see you playing a greater role in the future assessment of the performance audit, Mr Caldeira."
"The future of the European Union depends not just on the funds being spent legally and correctly, but also and above all on their being spent usefully; in other words, effectively and efficiently."
"That will form part of the performance audit under Article 318 of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"As Parliament, we would like to see an annual debate on the performance audit of the Commission and we would like you to be invited here to debate it with us as a representative of the European Court of Auditors. My sincere thanks to my fellow Members and to everyone involved."
"Welcome"
"I should like to adjourn the debate a moment to announce that today in the visitors' gallery we have Professor Dagmar Lieblová, President of Theresienstadt Martyrs Remembrance Association, from the Czech Republic, whom we welcome."
"(Applause)"
"Professor Lieblová is in Strasbourg accompanied by 28 students from Prague and Hamburg, who have worked together on a two-year project researching the transfer of Czech forced labourers from Hamburg to Theresienstadt concentration camp."
"She is visiting our Parliament at the invitation of our Vice-President, Mr Rouček, and of Mr Fleckenstein, and her project has been awarded a European prize."
"Thanks very much to Professor Lieblová and her students for their major contribution to furthering our understanding of European history, and for their commitment to the moral values that inspire the Union."
"2009 discharge (continuation of debate)"
"We will now continue with the debate on 2009 discharge (39 reports)."
"rapporteur. - (FI) Mr President, when in my initial speech I spoke about Parliament's security, President Buzek immediately said that this issue had been discussed by the Bureau."
"That is excellent and an important thing, so my thanks go to the SecretaryGeneral, who has taken swift action."
"I wish to thank him for the many other steps that he has taken that have led to improvements in this House."
"The year 2009 was election year, after which we had new statutes for assistants as well as Members."
"There were a lot of problems with those and the SecretaryGeneral and the RothBehrendt working group introduced changes, and that is excellent."
"Many have asked why I am raising the issue of travel between Strasbourg and Brussels."
"The reason is that taxpayers do not understand why we are squandering the money that they pay in taxes."
"What happens, then, when the people do not understand?"
"In Finland we recently had elections."
"The only party that was triumphant was the Eurosceptics, and they won easily."
"If this trend spreads in Europe we will have big problems in important areas."
"Finland does not now intend to endorse the Portuguese package."
"These matters impact on one another, and that is why I am trying to explain here that, unless we are prepared to make changes now, the public are not going to back us and we will lose out in the significant, major issues."
"That is why we need to sort out the smaller ones."
"rapporteur. - (HU) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to thank everyone who has enriched today's debate with their valuable comments."
"As I have indicated this in my capacity of rapporteur, or to be precise, as a stand-in for Mr Rivellini, seven discharge proposals are tabled to the European Parliament."
"The seven discharge proposals concern seven very important European institutions."
"In his discharge report Mr Rivellini proposes that the European Parliament should grant discharge to the European Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions, the European Court of Justice, the European Court of Auditors, the European Ombudsman, and the European Data Protection Supervisor and their respective offices."
"Today's debate has confirmed for us that there is an agreement in the European Parliament on this issue."
"One of Mr Rivellni's proposals concerns the discharge of the European Council."
"Here again, there is an agreement among the Members and groups of the European Parliament that discharge should be postponed."
"I would like to welcome the observation of Minister of State Becsey, made in today's debate."
"I consider the steps relating to the work of the Hungarian Presidency to be important."
"If these steps are continued, when Parliament puts the issue of the Council discharge on its agenda again this autumn, finally it will be possible for the European Parliament to grant discharge to the European Council with the backing of a long-term agreement between the European Council and the European Parliament on the Council discharge procedure."
"In the light of these thoughts, I would like to thank again everyone who contributed with their work to Parliament making a decision on these seven proposals today."
", in writing. - (PL) Unanimity is rare among the Members of the European Parliament, who are usually divided into eight groups."
"In today's votes on the 39 discharges in respect of the implementation of the budgets of the individual institutions for 2009, we postponed the decision to grant discharge to the Council of the European Union by 637 votes in favour, 4 against and 13 abstentions."
"The decision taken by Members today is the natural consequence of the events of recent months."
"Council representatives, including the Secretary General, did not accept a single invitation from the members of the Committee on Budgetary Control to discuss the Council's expenditure in 2009."
"What is more, we were not given answers to any of several dozen specific questions, which included questions regarding the funding arrangements for the European External Action Service, which was set up in late 2009 (the Rivellini report contains a full list of questions)."
"If we remind ourselves of the difficulties that accompanied the debates on the Council's expenditure in 2007 and 2008 and the far-reaching concessions granted by Parliament in this respect, this year's position is understandable."
"Following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, both institutions need a formal agreement on reviews of expenditure to replace the 30-year-old 'gentlemen's agreement'."
"Citizens have the right to demand transparency as far as the Council's and Parliament's finances are concerned."
"For now, we must wait until 15 June 2011, when the Council is to provide answers to MEPs' questions."
"in writing. - (BG) The process of improving the quality of expenditure and control over legal spending and complying with the rules is not a one-off activity, but an ongoing process which is our main responsibility to Europe's citizens."
"People do not understand why we are still dealing with the 2009 budget in the middle of 2011."
"This is why, based on preliminary discussions through organising an interinstitutional discussion, we can shorten the procedure, but without it being at the expense of quality."
"Control over the spending of European funds would improve considerably if there were specific data and methods available for assessing the management and control systems deployed in Member States because error rates of 0% are questionable."
"At least 30% of the errors could have been detected and rectified by the national agencies prior to them being certified by the European Commission."
"Member States and the Commission must take the necessary action to comply with the rules and adopt suitable measures for promptly removing any deficiencies detected."
"The report on the 2009 discharge for fulfilment of the EU's general budget, section I - European Parliament."
"We are constantly confronted with numerous shortcomings that prevent us from using our resources in a wholly efficient manner."
"In my work as Chief Rapporteur for the EU budget for 2010 for the area of Other Divisions, I came across concrete examples of bad management."
"This applies to the area of the security service, where security costs are constantly rising, to the area of translation and the effective use of translation resources, and to other areas."
"The bureaucracy is recording substantial increases in workload."
"This leads to pressure for additional resources."
"We therefore need a comprehensive assessment of staffing structures and the requirement for resources."
"In the area of security policy, but also in the area of IT and buildings, we need to find a balance between internal employees and external suppliers."
"The internal problems of every institution make people forget about improving interinstitutional cooperation."
"Most of the increasing problems have a common denominator: we are making little use of independent studies into the use of resources and the organisation of work."
"We therefore need to subscribe to such studies in selected areas this year."
"I fully support the Committee on Budgetary Control's decision to postpone granting discharge to the European Medicines Agency in the light of what I feel are some very serious points."
"I should like to emphasise in particular the lack of guarantees regarding the independence of experts and managers, and hence the potential for conflicts of interest."
"This issue is all the more relevant in view of the finding that certain dangerous medicines that caused the deaths of numerous people in Europe were belatedly withdrawn from the market."

"Pan-European orders for the disclosure and freezing of fraudsters' assets are critical, because currently the fraudsters walk away while the victims lose out and face expensive legal bills."

"Madam President, in paragraph 2 of Article 9a, after the words 'at the request of a Member State', we would like to add the phrase 'any legal person or any association not having legal personality acting on behalf of the Union industry'."
"The reason is to make this regulation consistent with other safeguards that we have approved, such as the South Korea FTA safeguard clause."

"Oral explanations of vote"
"Madam President, a billion here, a billion there, and pretty soon we are talking real money."
"The amounts that have been dedicated by the European Union to these bailouts dwarf the domestic spending of our national governments."
"The United Kingdom alone has so far made available GBP 7 billion in Ireland and it is now about to be asked for another GBP 4.2 billion in Portugal."
"GBP 7 billion is more than the value of all the domestic cuts we have made in social security put together - and all for a policy which is now visibly failing."
"When the Greek bailout was originally agreed we were told that it would be enough to deter the speculators, that Greece would now be borrowing competitively in the market and that no more would be needed."
"Yet, we now see Greece openly negotiating for a default and for further loans."
"It is clear that we are not going to see the money again."
"It is also clear that we are breaking the law."
"These bailouts are not merely unauthorised under the Treaties, they are expressly prohibited and, worst of all, they are damaging to the recipient countries."
"There is a racket - a Ponzi scheme - whereby governments and banks connive to give money to European bankers and bondholders, while expecting the repayment to come from ordinary European taxpayers."
"Ireland and Greece are now having to borrow more money to send to Portugal, while at the same time Ireland and Portugal are having to borrow more money to send to Greece."
"Let me finish by quoting my countryman Rudyard Kipling."
"'You will find it better policy to say:--"
"'We never pay any-one Dane-geld,"
"No matter how trifling the cost;"
"For the end of that game is oppression and shame,"
"And the nation that plays it is lost!'"
"Madam President, we have voted today on the 2009 accounts at a time when governments across Europe are having to take austerity measures: expenditure is being cut and taxes are being increased."
"Yet, in the European Union, every year the Commission demands more money, and every year the Court of Auditors replies that the money is not being well spent."
"The Court of Auditors says that the 2009 accounts, on which we have just voted, are materially affected by error and that is why I am very pleased that the British Conservatives and our good friends in the European Conservatives have voted against discharge of these accounts."
"The EU should take much better care of taxpayers' money."
"Madam President, when my constituents ask me about the EU budget, one of the things they do not understand, particularly at the difficult time that we are going through, is why we are spending all this money."
"At a time when our government is having to make cuts and reduce the level of public spending, and governments across the EU are having to do exactly the same thing, why is it, first of all, that the EU is asking for more money for its budgets and its financial perspective, and secondly that it cannot spend the money it has efficiently?"
"As my colleague Mr Fox said earlier, the EU accounts for 2009 were riddled with error."
"The accounts have not been signed off for 15 years, and all the time our constituents have been asking us why we are not spending their money better."
"It is time we put our house in order."
"Whatever you feel about the European Union, it is surely right that we should spend taxpayers' money wisely."
"(FR) Madam President, I voted against granting discharge in respect of the implementation of Parliament's budget, not so much for financial reasons as for political reasons, since this House is anything but a Parliament."
"No talking goes on in it, there is no opportunity to debate in it, even when the fundamental rights of one of its Members are at stake."
"Over and above myself, I feel ashamed for our institution."
"It is mired in political correctness."
"There is no confrontation of ideas."
"There is no real freedom of expression."
"It is all about conformism."
"We spend our time doing work that would be far better done by a technical agency responsible for harmonising standards or rules and, other than that, we play at being the United Nations."
"You defend human rights in Guatemala and Indonesia - anywhere in the world where you have no jurisdiction."
"You are incapable of defending the rights of one of your Members."
"I feel ashamed for this Parliament; it is a useless Parliament and a Parliament of useless people."
"(FI) Madam President, I would like to say a few words about the EU budget."
"First of all, I think that it is very important to ensure that the way in which the European Parliament spends its money is transparent and open."
"We are actually going through a time in Europe when all the Member States are having to make budget cuts and watch every penny, so we must also apply the same policy."
"It is very important that openness and transparency have an important role in all that we do."
"There are, however, a few small areas - of seemingly little consequence - where some wanted to make cuts."
"In my view, these types of cultural services and cultural awards, such as the LUX Prize, which would represent savings of a few tens of thousands of euros, are not the right areas in which to make savings, because we can see that culture and creative industry have recently been a source of growth."
"In this respect, it is important that, when we make cuts, we take the view that we should not do so in areas that are sources of growth in the European Union, but instead cut the red tape that does not produce growth."
"Finally, I hope that the pay reforms that apply to us Members of Parliament, and which have gone through, will be implemented everywhere, in each Member State of the European Union at the same time."
"That is because I understood that this reform was based on the notion that all Members of the European Parliament would receive the same salary, and this should also be taken into account by the nation states in their taxation practices."
"(DA) Madam President, we were not able to vote on the final resolution on Pakistan in this House today, but I would very much like to point out that I think it is absolutely reasonable and timely for us to help Pakistan through the very difficult situation that the country is facing."
"The EU has provided EUR 415 million in emergency aid to Pakistan, and that is a good thing."
"It is also positive that we are now taking the initiative to remove duties on some important export products in these areas, namely textiles and leather."
"We are doing this because our experience essentially shows that free trade is a good thing."
"However, I must say that, at the same time, I find it regrettable and somewhat hypocritical that we are also making indeterminate promises and saying that, if the initiatives that we are taking in respect of Pakistan start to work, we will discontinue them."
"We will erect the customs barriers again."
"I think Parliament should revise its view of how this matter should be dealt with."
"Therefore, it is perhaps very sensible that we have postponed the vote on the resolution."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, even though the vote has been postponed, I remain strongly opposed to the report because I do not want to see the death of an industry - textiles - which has been the real driving force and economic backbone of my homeland, Tuscany."
"Today we are allowing duties on textile products from Pakistan to be eliminated: it could then be the turn of India and then who knows which other State."
"This is the result of the European Union's wretched trade policy."
"After the floods, Pakistan had already been helped by Europe with almost half a billion euros."
"It seems that aid is granted partly in order avoid dangerous anti-democratic tendencies."
"Yet, if I am not mistaken, the most wanted and dangerous terrorist in history was hiding in Pakistan."
"Did the Pakistani authorities really not know about this?"
"Last year, the Veneto region was also hit by extremely serious floods, which crippled many local textile companies."
"By signing this agreement, we risk all the efforts made to return to production being rendered totally pointless."
"Textile producers, especially the very smallest, now seem to have been abandoned by Europe, where big manufacturers - which have relocated - rule all."
"However, we in Lega Nord shall fight until the end to preserve and develop this valuable resource for our territories."
"Madam President, six months after the floods in Pakistan the UN spoke of a humanitarian crisis of epic proportions."
"Another three months have passed, and there is still an entirely insufficient response by the EU and the WTO."
"I voted in favour of granting Pakistan emergency trade preferences for textile and other products in the EU in order for these trade preferences not simply to be a purely token measure that filled the pockets of the corrupt elites in Pakistan."
"I call for effective control over the increased income by democratic trade unions to ensure that the money is directed towards rebuilding schools and hospitals in the areas affected by flooding."
"A major threat to the collective interests of all workers in Pakistan has been brought to my attention by the Progressive Workers Federation of Pakistan."
"I oppose the disgraceful attempt and threat by the government to no longer allow trade unions to organise on a national level."
"(IT) Madam President, the Treaty of Lisbon lists foreign direct investment among the matters pertaining to common commercial policy."
"Indeed, according to Article 3 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Union has exclusive competence in this matter."
"Following the entry in force of the Treaty of Lisbon, Member States have maintained a significant number of agreements with third countries on foreign direct investment."
"If we want to prevent these agreements from interfering with the rules laid down by the Treaty, we cannot but adopt the policies and measures contained in the report by Mr Schlyter."
"The adoption of measures to substitute the existing agreements is the only way to ensure a high degree of protection for investors and to ensure that their rights are recognised and guaranteed by the legal certainty of such agreements."
"The draft certainly moves along these lines and I have therefore voted in its favour."
"(IT) Madam President, I voted in favour of this report because I am absolutely convinced that we need to control European investments abroad at a time of great crisis and economic uncertainty."
"In fact, with the entry in force of the new Treaty, responsibility for the protection of investments passes from the Member States to the Union."
"I hope, however, that the Commission will submit a report in September that sets out strategies on this issue."
"We must regulate the transition phase and it is essential that, through an authorization process, the bilateral investment treaties (BITS) concluded by Member States are respected and that they are allowed, under certain conditions, to renegotiate existing BITS or finalise pending ones and to enter negotiations for further ones."
"Legal certainty remains, however, a relative term as long as the transition of the investment protection regime is not completed and expiry dates are not set for Member States' existing BITs."
"A transition period is therefore necessary to manage this change and, in order to avoid legal vacuums, the regulation in question leaves the management of the Treaties to the Member States."
"In light of what I have said, I reiterate my hope that the Commission will set out the appropriate strategies in short order."
"(DA) Madam President, we have voted today on the provision of EUR 46 million in macro-financial assistance to Georgia."
"Obviously, these funds will not be provided without imposing the conditions of responsible economic management and transparency."
"That is clearly important, but it is also important to remember that the provision of this money is in our own interests, as Georgia is very important from a geopolitical point of view."
"The country was hit by a double blow: first there was the war with Russia in August 2008 and then the global financial crisis."
"It is therefore in the European Union's interests to support a Western-oriented government that is willing to undertake reforms, which is what we have done with the vote today."
"(PL) Madam President, Georgia is a strategically important country, in particular for the countries situated in the eastern part of the European Union."
"In addition, it is a participant in the Eastern Partnership programme, which is aimed at strengthening cooperation with EU Member States."
"The country places a strong emphasis on following pro-Euro-Atlantic policies."
"The recent Russo-Georgian conflict of August 2008 demonstrated how important it is to keep this country within the sphere of European policy."
"The programme of macro-financial assistance to strengthen Georgia's economy, which has been implemented since 2009, is therefore still crucial for the further development of positive political and economic relations, and also in respect of national security."
"I therefore agree entirely with the European Commission's proposal regarding the earmarking of additional funds for grants and loans in order to improve Georgia's financial situation."
"Written explanations of vote"
"in writing. - (PT) I am voting for this proposal, since I agree with the discharge procedures, as they propose suitable appropriations for each heading."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this report and agreed with the European Parliament's decision to grant the Court of Justice discharge in respect of the implementation of its budget for the financial year 2009."
"In the course of preparation of the Annual Report concerning the financial year 2009, the Court of Auditors performed an in-depth assessment of supervisory and control systems in the Court of Justice, which included examinations relating to human resources and other administrative expenditure."
"This assessment had broadly positive results, with the exception of observations concerning a contract concluded for the provision of services."
"I endorse the suggestion of the Court of Auditors that procurement procedures should be better prepared and coordinated by the Court of Justice."
"The Court of Justice experienced difficulties as regards recruitment of qualified conference interpreters, and the limitations as well as the need to use a range of interpretation techniques in order to be able to qualitatively and quantitatively satisfy all requests for interpretation."
"I agree with the rapporteur that the Court of Justice should report on this in its upcoming Annual Reports, given the importance of interpretation for the proper functioning of judicial work."
"I voted in favour of authorising discharge of the 2009 budget of the Court of Justice because I believe its formal and substantial accuracy is the result of extremely competent work done by all the staff of this institution."
"in writing. - (PT) I welcome the exhaustive analysis carried out in this report by the Court of Auditors, and I call for the continued exchange of best practices between the institutions, as well as effective interinstitutional cooperation regarding development and the implementation of an integrated management system."
"The report flags up certain situations that still need to be reviewed, and I hope that these are given due consideration."
"I therefore support and welcome the rapporteur's conclusions."
"Financial control on implementing the European Union budget takes place on three levels: internal control, within each institution; external control, carried out by the EU Court of Auditors; and a discharge procedure carried out by the European Parliament."
"With today's vote, discharge is granted for the implementation of the budget of the European Court of Justice for the financial year 2009."
"I voted in favour because controls carried out by the Court of Auditors and the Committee on Budgetary Control showed that all transactions were carried out in a wholly legal and regular manner."
"in writing. - I voted to grant discharge to the Court of Justice, while noting the mixed results in terms of speeding up procedures."
"I welcome the increase in the number of cases completed by the Court of Justice (377 judgments and 165 orders compared to 333 and 161 respectively in 2008), take note of the number of preliminary ruling cases being the highest ever (302) and welcome the decrease in the number of cases pending at the end of 2009 (741 cases compared to 768 cases at the end of 2008)."
"However, I note with concern that the General Court in 2009 showed a decrease in the number of cases decided and an increase in the duration of the proceedings and that consequently, although the number of new cases in 2009 was lower (568 new cases compared to 629 in 2008), the backlog of pending cases continued to increase (from 1178 in 2008 to 1191 in 2009)."
"I also welcome the fact that the Civil Service Tribunal closed more cases than ever before (155 cases), and that the average duration of a procedure was 15.1 months compared to 17 months in 2008."
"in writing. - (PT) Taking into account the statement of assurance as to the reliability of the accounts and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions provided by the Court of Auditors pursuant to Article 287 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, I voted for this decision, which grants the Registrar of the Court of Justice discharge in respect of the implementation of the Court of Justice budget for the financial year 2009."
"in writing. - Grants the Registrar of the Court of Justice discharge in respect of the implementation of the Court of Justice budget for the financial year 2009."
"With today's resolution, Parliament grants discharge to the Registrar of the Court of Justice for the implementation of the budget of the Court of Justice for the financial year 2009."
"Parliament notes that, in the course of preparation of the Annual Report concerning the financial year 2009, the Court of Auditors performed an in-depth assessment of supervisory and control systems in the Court of Justice, the European Ombudsman and the European Data Protection Supervisor, which included the examination of an additional sample of transactions involving payments relating to human resources and to other administrative expenditure."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this report and endorsed the decision to grant the European Ombudsman discharge in respect of the implementation of its budget for the financial year 2009."
"In the course of preparation of the Annual Report concerning the financial year 2009, the Court of Auditors performed an in-depth assessment of supervisory and control systems in the Court of Justice, the Ombudsman and the European Data Protection Supervisor which included the examination of an additional sample of transactions involving payments relating to human resources and to other administrative expenditure."
"The Court of Auditors found that the Ombudsman has not adopted general provisions on the procedures for the recruitment of temporary staff, although the relevant article of the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants of the European Union requires that each institution shall have done so."
"I agree with the rapporteur that this omission may affect a large proportion of the Ombudsman's staff, as the majority of posts granted are temporary."
"The Ombudsman should report on progress in this area in his annual activity report."
"The Court of Auditors indicated in its annual report that the audit did not give rise to any further significant observations as regards the Ombudsman."
"in writing. - (IT) I voted in favour of authorising discharge of the 2009 budget of the European Ombudsman since, mindful of the report on its activities and the observations I was able to make about it, I believe that accounting procedures have been respected, that the overall management can be considered good and that in the coming years we will be able to improve those aspects which are now considered controversial."
"in writing. - (PT) I welcome the conclusions of the audit in the Annual Report of the Court of Auditors."
"I also welcome the implementation of the key performance indicators in the Annual Management Plan, as well as the fact that the objectives for 2009 were achieved and the Ombudsman's decision to publish his annual declaration of interests on his website."
"Finally, I support the rapporteur's conclusions and commend the quality of Ombudsman's annual activity report, and welcome the inclusion of the follow-up during the year to Parliament's earlier discharge decisions."
"I would first like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Rivellini, for his excellent work throughout the discharge process."
"In today's vote, I gave my backing to the request for discharge regarding the implementation of the European Union general budget for the financial year 2009, Section VIII - European Ombudsman."
"The Court of Auditors, which is responsible for external financial control, said that following careful assessment of the budget it had received reasonable assurances as to the reliability of the annual accounts for the financial year 2009 and the legality and regularity of the pertinent transactions."
"I also applaud the Ombudsman's decision to publish his annual declaration of interests, including on the Ombudsman's own website, and I should like to join the Court of Auditors in praising the quality of the annual activity report submitted by the Ombudsman."
"in writing. - I voted to give discharge to the Ombudsman and note, with satisfaction, that in 2009 the Ombudsman was able to help with almost 77% of all complaints and dealt with 70% of inquiries in less than one year, and I welcome the fact that the average length of inquiry was reduced to 9 months (from 13 months in 2008)."
"in writing. - (PT) Taking into account the statement of assurance as to the reliability of the accounts and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions provided by the Court of Auditors pursuant to Article 287 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, I voted for this decision, which grants the European Ombudsman discharge in respect of the implementation of its budget for the financial year 2009."
"in writing. - This grants the European Ombudsman discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget for the financial year 2009."
"in writing. - (IT) With today's resolution Parliament grants discharge to the European Ombudsman for the implementation of the budget for the financial year 2009."
"I would like to stress that Parliament welcomes the fact that in 2009 the Ombudsman was able to help with almost 77% of the complaints and that he dealt with 70% of the investigations in less than one year."
"We welcome the fact that the average length of inquiry was reduced to nine months (compared to 13 months in 2008)."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this report and endorsed the decision to grant the European Data Protection Supervisor discharge in respect of the implementation of its budget for the financial year 2009."
"The Court of Auditors indicated in its annual report that the audit did not find any significant gaps as regards the EDPS."
"In the course of preparation of the Annual Report concerning the financial year 2009, the Court of Auditors performed an in-depth assessment of supervisory and control systems in the EDPS."
"This included the examination of an additional sample of transactions involving payments relating to human resources and to other administrative expenditure."
"The Court of Auditors found that under certain circumstances the EDPS may run the risk of making incorrect payments to staff."
"I endorse the suggestion of the Court of Auditors that EDPS staff should be requested to submit at appropriate intervals documents proving their personal situation, and that the EDPS should improve its system for the timely monitoring and control of those documents."
"in writing. - (IT) I voted in favour of granting the European Data Protection Supervisor discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget for the financial year 2009 since, despite the fact that some data was controversial and less transparent than required, the EDPS has shown willingness to commit itself to undertaking further ex-post verification processes from 2011 onwards."
"in writing. - (PT) I welcome the conclusions of the audit by the Court of Auditors, whose annual report notes that the audit did not give rise to any significant observations."
"I also welcome the annual publication of declarations of the financial interests of the institution's elected members, with relevant information on remunerated tasks and activities, or professional activities that are subject to declaration."
"Finally, I welcome the rapporteur's conclusion on the request made to the European Data Protection Supervisor to include a chapter in its next annual activity report - financial year 2010 - including detailed information on the follow-up during the year to Parliament's discharge decisions."
"in writing. - I voted to give discharge to the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) but I note the Court of Auditors findings that the EDPS had not put in place a system of ex-post verification, where appropriate, as required by the Financial Regulation, and that the standards of internal control adopted by the EDPS did not provide for exceptions to standard financial procedures to be duly recorded in a central register."
"in writing. - (PT) Taking into account the statement of assurance as to the reliability of the accounts and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions provided by the Court of Auditors pursuant to Article 287 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, I voted for this decision, which grants the European Data Protection Supervisor discharge in respect of the implementation of its budget for the financial year 2009."
"in writing. - This grants the European Data Protection Supervisor discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget for the financial year 2009."
"in writing. - (IT) With today's resolution, Parliament grants discharge to the European Data Protection Supervisor for the execution of its budget for the financial year 2009."
"I would underline that Parliament welcomes the fact that in the course of preparation of the Annual Report concerning the financial year 2009, the Court of Auditors performed an in-depth assessment of supervisory and control systems in the Court of Justice."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this report."
"The Court of Auditors has again drawn the European Parliament's attention to a large volume of carryovers of unspent funds by several agencies in the financial year 2009."
"I agree with the rapporteur that the agencies concerned should step up their efforts to improve financial and budgetary planning and programming."
"I also believe that the agencies' expenditure should be predictable and a solution that respects the annuality principle of the Union budget should be found."
"The agencies should strengthen their internal controls to make sure that contracts and procurement procedures are correctly applied."
"Furthermore, it is important to fully guarantee the independence of agency staff and experts."
"The Commission should provide Parliament with a detailed overview of the criteria applied in order to ensure the independence of recruited staff."
"I agree that each agency should establish a multiannual work programme, in accordance with the Union strategy in the sector it deals with."
"The multiannual work programme is important for enabling an agency to better organise its activities, provide an enhanced risk-assessment of its activities, and make effective organisational arrangements to implement its strategy."
"in writing. - (IT) I voted in favour of authorising discharge of the 2009 budget for the performance, financial management and control of EU agencies since I find the report to be objective, serious and independent."
"The critical issues are adequately highlighted, as are the positive elements."
"With reports of this standard, as long as its contents are followed up over the coming years, the quality of EU administration can only increase, invalidating the grounds for complaints from critics of the European Union."
"in writing. - (PT) In the last few years, there has been an unprecedented increase in the number of agencies, so the Interinstitutional Working Group on Agencies is crucial, as is the forthcoming special report by the Court of Auditors, with a study on these agencies' performance and a comparative analysis of their costs."
"It is important to mention the innumerable weaknesses found by the Court of Auditors, and for their extent to be rapidly scaled back."
"I therefore agree with the rapporteur on the need to improve the transparency of estimates and responsibility of projects; to strengthen their procurement authorisation at the financing decision and work-programme level; to correct failings in the recruitment of personnel, and increase its objectivity and transparency; and to implement and comply with the Financial Regulation to which they are subject."
"Finally, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his work, and I call on all the agencies to include the conclusions that have been adopted."
"Every year, the European Parliament adopts a report on the European agencies to accompany the debates on budgetary discharge."
"And every year it is the same finding: waste, shortcomings in recruitment and public procurement procedures, carryovers and cancellations of too numerous appropriations ..."
"It is not necessary to uncover fraud, as at the European Economic and Social Committee, to reach a verdict of mismanagement."
"Every time, however, Parliament pretends to see progress, and grants discharge."
"What is worse, it never calls into question the Commission's policy of outsourcing to these agencies, which appears to be aimed less at effectively implementing the European Union's policies than at providing every major city in the Union with its own small share of European institutions."
"The nagging question of whether these agencies are effective and useful unfortunately remains unanswered, year after year."
"The few agencies that analyse their performance do so in accordance with the procedures and processes that are imposed on them and not in relation to concrete results."
"The agencies are useful above all ... to the agencies."
"That is why we refused to grant discharge to a number of them and abstained on the resolutions that accompanied them."
"in writing. - I support the report of Georgios Stavrakakis on the performance, financial management and control of EU agencies because mainly it stresses the need to encourage the agencies to develop, and then regularly update, a comprehensive situation outlining their financial circuits and the responsibilities of the financial and operational actors."
"In addition, it reminds the agencies of the importance of fully guaranteeing the independence of their staff and experts."
"It argues, overall, for a more constructive and transparent process."
"in writing. - (IT) I commend the work carried out by the rapporteur, Mr Stavrakakis, and all those who participated in the drafting of the texts relating to the granting of discharge for the financial year 2009."
"We can say, in general terms, that the results achieved in 2009 are better than the previous results."
"Nevertheless, it is true that even with respect to the current financial year, the Court of Auditors has noted, in more than one agency, a high level of carryovers and cancellations of operational appropriations and a high number of transfers."
"Some agencies have also shown a number of weaknesses in procurement procedures."
"Certainly, the present context of severe economic crisis must be taken fully into consideration when reviews and assessments are undertaken, but it is also important to highlight the need for a general improvement in the management of subsidies."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of the report '2009 discharge: performance, financial management and control of EU agencies' in order to acknowledge that the functioning of all EU agencies needs to be further improved."
"The discharge procedure for the financial year 2009 revealed that immediate actions are required with regard to transparency and efficiency."
"For transparency in EU agencies to be improved, all 21 Agencies and the Commission must publish a list of all contracts awarded over the last three years as well as a report of the staff members changing jobs from one agency to another, and they must enact stricter rules regarding conflicts of interest as soon as possible."
"Moreover, for the future discharge procedures, the Director of each EU agency should make available to Parliament its report from the Internal Audit Service."
"To enhance greater efficiency in the functioning and expenditure of the EU agencies, genuine consideration must be given to the possibility of merging Governing Boards for agencies working in related fields."
"Furthermore, the Commission should deliver an assessment of the feasibility of merging EU agencies with overlapping activities."
"in writing. - I voted for this Report but am concerned by the Court of Auditors' findings that several agencies had deficiencies in procurement procedures."
"I call on the agencies to strengthen their internal controls to make sure that contracts and procurement procedures are correctly applied."
"Parliament is not ready to accept the chronic inability to put in place a control system which avoids or detects in time persistent errors undermining the legality and regularity of the agency's transactions."
"I urge, in this respect, the agencies to:"
"improve the transparency of estimates and responsibility of projects;"
"strengthen their procurement authorisation at the financing decision and work-programme level;"
"ensure that the disclosure of exceptions in their Annual Activity Report is made in a comprehensive manner;"
"ensure adequate follow up of potential irregularities;"
"develop and report on ex-post controls."
"I voted in favour of the report on the 2009 discharge: performance, financial management and control of EU agencies."
"If we want Parliament to play its role of discharge authority seriously, the MEPs must be given access to more comprehensive and detailed information on the budgetary and financial management of the agencies."
"We note that the responsibilities are shared, but they also seem to be diluted."
"Thus, the European Commission, despite being represented within the management boards, reminds us, on the subject of the accounting errors made by the European Police College (CEPOL), that an agency is 'an entity with its own legal personality and has a fully administrative autonomy, which includes financial autonomy.'"
"Yet the management board sometimes delegates sole administrative responsibility to the Executive Director."
"Finally, the European Parliament decides whether or not to grant discharge to an agency, on the basis of the fairly brief reports by the external auditor, and depends on the goodwill of the Executive Director to be given additional information."
"I believe it is imperative to fill this gap in the legislation on Internal Audit Service (IAS) reports on the agencies and to propose a solution that will see Parliament granted real powers."
"in writing. - I note that the Court of Auditors has once again drawn attention to a large volume of carryovers and cancellations of operational appropriations by several agencies in the financial year 2009."
"I also note the existence of unused budget lines and the high number of transfers in some of the agencies, and I would call on the agencies concerned to step up their efforts to improve financial and budgetary planning and programming."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this report and agree that the European Parliament should postpone its decision to grant discharge in respect of the implementation of budget of the European Police College for the financial year 2009."
"In its report the Court of Auditors again qualified its opinion on the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions."
"The College demonstrates a persistent lack of compliance with the Financial Regulation with regard to public procurement rules."
"A significant amount of the College's total budget contains irregularities."
"The Court of Auditors identified severe shortcomings in the administrative and financial rules governing expenditure on the organisation of courses and seminars, which accounts for a major proportion of the College's operational expenditure."
"I agree with the rapporteur that it is unacceptable that the revised College's Financial Regulation has never entered into force and, as a result, all engagement contracts signed were illegal."
"In the interest of fostering transparency, the College should provide direct access to its budget, which should include a list of its contract and procurement decisions, and should be published on the College's website."
"I have voted against granting discharge for 2009 for the European Police College, as proposed by the rapporteur, because not even I am convinced by the irregular procedures adopted in the period under review."
"I consider that more details are required to provide a deeper and more detailed explanation showing the regularity of the accounts."
"For the second year in a row, we have been unable to grant discharge to the European Police College (CEPOL) for the financial year 2009."
"The multiannual action plan that was devised following the identification of the agency's management problems lacks clarity, and the monitoring report fails to give us a proper understanding of the measures put in place."
"The College admittedly performed better in 2010, following the departure of its former Director, Ulf Göransson, who has been taken to task by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) and the Court of Auditors for his irregular, indeed fraudulent, expenditure."
"However, it is still unacceptable that this agency, founded in 2006, has yet to meet the criteria of good administration."
"We must give thought to the very structure of CEPOL, which is clearly too small to function autonomously given the complex rules it must observe as an agency."
"We must also question why this agency, the role of which is to organise training seminars for national senior police officers, should require its own headquarters rather than be attached to Europol, the Hague-based European Police Office, which everyone praises for its effective services."
"With this vote the European Parliament has decided not to grant discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Police College for the financial year 2009 but to postpone the decision."
"In effect our decision is based on the considerations of the Court of Auditors, which issued an opinion with reservations on the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying the budget of the European Police College, by reason of the fact that the procurement procedures did not conform to the provisons of the financial regulation.Therefore I support the request to the College and its Governing Board to inform the discharge authority, by 30 June 2011, of the actions undertaken and improvements made in relation to all the irregular and/or incomplete points raised in the course of this procedure."
"in writing. - The report on the 2009 discharge for the European Police College provided for the postponement of the discharge."
"I voted in favour of this report in order to acknowledge the structural problems that the College has been facing for many years now."
"For the financial year 2009, almost half of the money carried over to 2009 was not spent, and 43% of the 2009 budget was carried over to 2010."
"The European Court of Auditors stated that implementation of the College's budget is hampered by severe and recurrent weaknesses in its programming and monitoring."
"Moreover, serious and repeated violations of public procurement rules were identified: five procurement procedures - worth a total of EUR 455 111 - failed to comply with the rules."
"Transparency also remains a matter of concern, since irregularities continue to affect staff selection."
"Likewise, I consider unacceptable the lack of investigation of the former Director in relation to his responsibilities concerning College appropriations that have been used to finance private expenditure."
"Therefore, I advocate the merger of the College into Europol as the best way of achieving greater efficiency in expenditure and tackling the College's structural and chronic problems."
"I voted in favour of postponing the decision to grant discharge for the financial year 2009: the Court of Auditors again qualified its opinion with regard to the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying the accounts for the financial year 2009."
"In particular, the Court identified severe shortcomings in the enforcement of the financial rules on public procurement and of the rules governing expenditure on the organisation of courses."
"The report notes that payment appropriations, equivalent to 43% of the total budget, were carried forward to 2010, which is at odds with the principle of annuality."
"We would like the agency to inform Parliament of the actions taken and the improvements made, and we call on the Court of Auditors to conduct a specific audit on the implementation of the European Police College's action plan."
"Together with my colleagues, I propose that the College merge with Europol in the Hague."
"I have my doubts about the College's ability to resolve structural problems linked to its small size, the relocation of its secretariat to Bramshill (70 km from London) and its high governance costs."
"in writing. - (PT) Taking into account the Court of Auditors' report on the annual accounts of the European Police College (EPC) for the financial year 2009, together with its replies, I voted for this decision, which postpones granting the Director of the EPC discharge in respect of the implementation of the EPC's budget for the financial year 2009."
"in writing. - This postpones the closure of the accounts of the European Police College for the financial year 2009."
"With today's resolution the European Parliament has postponed the decision granting budgetary discharge to the Director of the European Police College."
"In its reports on the annual discharge for 2006 and 2007 the Court of Auditors issued a qualified opinion on the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying the budget of the European Police College, by reason of the fact that the procurement procedures did not conform to the provisons of the financial regulation."
"In particular, Parliament is concerned that the Court of Auditors pointed to serious deficiencies in the administrative and financial rules governing expenses for the organisation of courses and seminars, which represent a large proportion of the College's operational expenses."
"in writing. - (DE) I voted for the postponement of the discharge."
"In view of the inglorious history of the European Police College's financial conduct, it is essential that a detailed review is carried out."
"In this connection I also consider it regrettable that the debate on the - in my eyes sensible - incorporation of the College into EUROPOL has subsided again."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this report and agree with the European Parliament's decision to grant discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the Translation Centre for the Bodies of the European Union for the financial year 2009."
"The Court of Auditors judged that the annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"I welcome the Centre's plan to carry out a mid-term review of its Strategy 2008-2012."
"I agree with the rapporteur that the Centre should further develop the evaluation of its performance by improving the links between its strategic actions and the actions foreseen in its Work Programme and by reviewing indicators for monitoring its performance in order to comply with SMART criteria."
"The Centre should also take more effective action on the constant expenditure growth in its budget."
"I have voted in favour of granting budgetary discharge to the Translation Centre for the Bodies of the European Union for 2009 because in this report I have found high precision, great transparency and a notable orientation towards results."
"in writing. - (PT) I welcome and agree with the rapporteur's observations, and I congratulate the Translation Centre for the Bodies of the European Union on the work it does."
"I also welcome the decision made by the centre to carry out a midterm review of its Strategy 2008-2012, and congratulate it on its excellent performance, with a 41% rise in its translation services in relation to 2008."
"I wish first of all to thank the rapporteur for the outstanding work done."
"As is known, financial control of the execution of the Community budget takes place at three levels: internal control, within each institution; external control by the European Court of Auditors; and the discharge procedure of the European Parliament."
"With today's vote, the financial control procedure is concluded with the granting of discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget for 2009 of the Translation Centre for the Bodies of the European Union, the accounts of which are legal and regular."
"Lastly, I would like to congratulate the Centre for submitting to the Court of Auditors a comparison of its operations carried out in the course of 2008 and 2009, allowing the discharge authority to make a better evaluation of the performance of the Centre from one year to the next."
"in writing. - I voted to give discharge to the Translation Centre."
"However, I call on the Centre to take more effective measures to remedy its constant rise in surplus;"
"I note, in fact, that for several years the Centre has had an accumulated budget surplus contrary to Regulation (EC) No 2965/94, and that in 2009 the surplus amounted to EUR 24 000 000, whereas it had been EUR 26 700 000 in 2008, EUR 16 900 000 in 2006, EUR 10 500 000 in 2005 and EUR 3 500 000 in 2004;"
"I observe that this surplus is mainly linked to the lack of precision in the forecasts for translation requests received from its clients."
"I welcome, nevertheless, the Centre's initiative to refund EUR 11 000 000 to its clients in 2009; and I stress that similarly, in 2007, the Centre had already refunded EUR 9 300 000 to its clients"
"in writing. - (PT) Taking into account the Court of Auditors' report on the annual accounts of the Translation Centre for the Bodies of the European Union for the financial year 2009, together with the centre's replies, I voted for this decision, which grants the Director of the Translation Centre for the Bodies of the European Union discharge in respect of the implementation of the centre's budget for the financial year 2009."
"in writing. - This grants the Director of the Translation Centre for the Bodies of the European Union discharge in respect of the implementation of the centre's budget for the 2009 financial year."
"With today's resolution the European Parliament has granted budgetary discharge for 2009 to the director of the Translation Centre for the Bodies of the European Union."
"The European Parliament welcomes the fact that the Centre will carry out a mid-term review of its strategy for 2008-2012; however, it invites the Centre to further develop the appraisal of its own performance, by improving the synergies between its strategic activities and the activities foreseen in its work programme and by reviewing the indicators for monitoring its performance in order to comply with SMART criteria."
"in writing. - (DE) I voted in favour of the discharge."
"The Translation Centre was established in 1994 to cope with the challenges presented by the multilingual nature of the EU - one of its essential features and proof of its cultural diversity."
"The agency is self-financing from payments made by the institutions/bodies for services provided."
"The European Court of Auditors has stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts for 2009 are legal and regular."
"in writing. - (LT) I endorsed this report and the decision to grant discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training for the financial year 2009."
"The Court of Auditors judged that the Centre's annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"In 2011 the Centre intends to make available Gantt charts for all key operational activities."
"These charts outline the amount of time spent by each staff member on a project and encourage an approach geared towards achieving results."
"In 2009, the Centre introduced a performance measurement system (PMS) in respect of its medium term priorities 2009-2011 and its annual work programme."
"The introduction of a PMS helps the Centre manage and evaluate its impact, efficiency, effectiveness and relevance."
"I agree with the rapporteur that the institution should continue to improve programming and monitoring and to respect the principle of annuality."
"Furthermore, the Centre must apply more effectively the budgetary principles of specification and transparency."
"I have voted in favour of granting discharge for 2009 in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training because the Centre has managed its funds soundly and in line with previous forecasts."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of the report on discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training for the financial year 2009, since it contributes to scrutiny of how funds are used by the European institutions."
"With a view to more efficient financial management in the future, the centre should submit a comparison of the operations during the year in progress and those of the previous year, to allow the authority responsible for discharge to assess its year-on-year performance more effectively."
"in writing. - (PT) I am pleased that the Court of Auditors has declared the operations underlying the centre's annual accounts for the financial year 2009 to be legal and regular."
"I would congratulate the centre for introducing a performance measurement system (PMS) in 2009, and on the introduction of changes in its recruitment procedures following remarks by the Court of Auditors in its 2009 report; these have contributed to improved transparency."
"I welcome and agree with the rapporteur's observations, and I congratulate the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training on the work it does."
"With today's vote I have supported the request for budgetary discharge for 2009 for the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training."
"The Court of Auditors, which is responsible for external financial control, following a thorough asessment of the Centre's accounts, has declared that it has obtained reasonable assurance that the accounts for 2009 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"I also wish to applaud the work done by the European Centre as the first to voluntarily undertake a pilot audit on its ethical framework in 2009."
"in writing. - I voted to give discharge to the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training."
"I congratulate the Centre for introducing a performance measurement system (PMS) in 2009 in respect of its 2009-2011 medium term priorities and its annual work programme, and for having set up a framework of performance indicators to monitor progress and measure output, outcome and impact;"
"I consider, in particular, that the introduction of a PMS helps the Centre manage and evaluate its impact, efficiency, effectiveness and relevance;"
"I believe, furthermore, that this system could include further improvements to the activity-based budget and closer monitoring of payment appropriations to avoid carryovers."
"in writing. - This grants the Director of the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training discharge in respect of the implementation of the centre's budget for the 2009 financial year."
"in writing. - (PT) Taking into account the Court of Auditors' report on the annual accounts of the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training for the financial year 2009, together with the centre's replies, I voted for this decision, which grants the Director of the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training discharge in respect of the implementation of the centre's budget for the financial year 2009."
"With today's resolution, the European Parliament grants discharge to the Director of the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training for the implementation of the Centre's budget for 2009."
"The European Parliament expresses its satisfaction that the Court of Auditors has stated that the transactions underlying the Centre's annual accounts for the 2009 financial year are legal and regular."
"in writing. - (DE) I voted in favour of the discharge."
"The European Court of Auditors was able to confirm that the annual accounts for 2009 were legal and regular."
"The Centre, which was established in 1975 and carries out analyses of vocational training systems as well as providing information for policy, research and practice in this area, is needed more than ever in these times when concerns are being raised as regards the level of training and the threatened shortage of skilled labour."
"Only its remote base in Greece, which makes it necessary to have a contact office in Brussels, should be reconsidered."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this report and endorsed the European Parliament's decision to grant discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the Community Fisheries Control Agency for the financial year 2009."
"The Court of Auditors judged that the Agency's annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"In 2010 the Agency adopted its multiannual work programme for 2011-2015."
"This document is important for ensuring that the Agency can make effective organisational arrangements to implement its strategy and achieve its goals."
"I agree with the rapporteur that the Agency should set out a comparison of operations carried out during the year for which discharge is to be granted and in the previous financial year so as to enable the European Parliament to assess the Agency's performance from one year to the next more effectively."
"The Agency should improve its annual work programme by including specific and measurable objectives both at policy area level and at operational activity level."
"The Agency should also redress its weaknesses in recruitment planning."
"I voted for discharge of the implementation of the budget of the Community Fisheries Control Agency for the financial year 2009 after seeing the analysis the Court of Auditors is undertaking, which states that its actions are legal and regular."
"Of its activities, I would stress the adoption of its multiannual work programme."
"I have voted in favour of budgetary discharge for the Community Fisheries Control Agency for 2009 because I appreciate the correctness, clarity and transparency of the accounts and the efficiency deriving from comprehensible and feasible planning."
"in writing. - (PT) I am pleased with the decisions detailed in the Court of Auditors' report that the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"I would congratulate the Community Fisheries Control Agency (CFCA) on adopting a multiannual work programme for 2011-2015 which will enable the better organisation and realisation of the proposed goals, as well as the creation of the Internal Audit Structure (IAS), which is an internal audit mechanism specialising in support and advice to the Executive Director of the CFCA and its management."
"I welcome and agree with the rapporteur's observations, and I congratulate the CFCA on the work it does."
"in writing. - (PT) Implementing control and inspection measures in relation to the application of the common fisheries policy (CFP) in its own exclusive economic zone should be a competence of the Member States, and as such they should be given adequate and sufficient backing, to which the European Union should contribute."
"We do not deny the need for there to be ways for the various Member States to cooperate, link up and coordinate their activities to control and combat illegal fishing, but we were sceptical of the benefits of creating the Community Fisheries Control Agency (CFCA) because we believe that some of its competences clash with those of the Member States."
"This is a centralisation that, apart from anything else, is not beneficial in terms of the necessary effectiveness of control activities."
"We have also stated our disagreement in terms of the representativeness of the Administrative Board of the CFCA, its operational model and the excessive weight that the European Commission has within it, namely in terms of its voting system."
"Furthermore, we would now say that if the CFCA is allocated a budget of EUR 10 100 000 (financial year 2009), the Member States are already being denied the possibility that the EU contribution to financing control activities could increase, in line with the proposal we tabled recently in Parliament, which was, unfortunately, rejected by the majority."

"The Community Fisheries Control Agency was founded in 2005 to ensure that the common fisheries policy rules are complied with by Member States."
"The Agency, which is located in Vigo in Spain, is very important in terms of fisheries control and coordination of Member States."
"It is a good thing, in my view, that the Agency has adopted the multiannual work programme for 2011-2015, as recommended in the Europe 2020 Strategy."
"The multiannual work programme will contribute to regional cooperation and to the sharing of resources under the deployment plans, something which will improve cost effectiveness."
"I welcome the decision of the Court of Auditors to grant discharge, and it is clear that the Committee on Fisheries, which accepted an Opinion from me on this issue, is of the same mind."
"in writing. - (LT) I endorsed this document, as the Committee responsible decided to approve the closure of the accounts of the European Aviation Safety Agency for the financial year 2009."
"The Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"However, the Agency should remedy the shortcomings in the programming of its activities so that in future the procedures for drafting the budget are sufficiently rigorous and obviate any need to increase and/or decrease the appropriations against its budget headings."
"Furthermore, the Agency has not yet drawn up a multiannual work programme."
"I therefore believe that it is necessary to take the current observations into account."
"Both the Court of Auditors and the Committee on Budgetary Control have delivered a positive opinion on the implementation of the budget of the Community Fisheries Control Agency."
"For these reasons Parliament has today voted to grant budgetary discharge for 2009."
"The controls carried out have shown that the Agency's budget is reliable and the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"I wish, however, to point to the presence of some weaknesses, above all, in recruitment planning, in respect of which I hope a rapid improvement can be made in the procedures relating to future financial years."
"in writing. - I voted to give discharge to the Community Fisheries Control Agency."
"Nevertheless, I urge the Executive Director of the Agency to fully fulfil his obligation to include, in his report to the discharge authority summarising the Internal Audit Service (IAS) Report, all recommendations made (including the ones which could be possibly refused by the Agency) and all action taken on these recommendations;"
"I call therefore on the Executive Director of the Agency to provide information on the content of the IAS's four 'very important' recommendations and the action taken by the Agency."
"in writing. - (PT) This report discharges the accounts of the Community Fisheries Control Agency (CFCA) in relation to its activities for 2009, renewing the discharge granted by the European Parliament on 5 May 2010, in relation to the implementation of the CFCA's budget for the financial year 2008."
"As the Court of Auditors has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, and as a delegation from the Committee on Fisheries visited the CFCA in June 2010 and was very satisfied with the general state of its affairs, particularly the execution of the Joint Deployment Plans, I believe Parliament should adopt this report."
"in writing. - (PT) Taking into account the Court of Auditors' report on the annual accounts of the Community Fisheries Control Agency (CFCA) for the financial year 2009, together with CFCA's replies, I voted for this decision, which grants the Executive Director of the CFCA discharge in respect of the implementation of the CFCA budget for the financial year 2009."
"in writing. - This grants the Executive Director of the Community Fisheries Control Agency discharge in respect of the implementation of the agency's budget for the 2009 financial year."
"With today's resolution the European Parliament grants budgetary discharge 2009 to the Executive Director of the Community Fisheries Control Agency."
"The European Parliament congratulates the agency on adopting a multiannual work programme for the period 2011-2015 and underlines the importance of such a document for the Agency to adopt efficient organisational arrangements with a view to implementing its strategy and achieving its goals."
"in writing. - (DE) I voted in favour of the discharge."
"The European Court of Auditors has stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts for 2009 are legal and regular, and the revision of a multiannual work programme carried out in 2010 as well as the start of an initiative to review its budget procedure convince me that the Community Fisheries Control Agency is implementing the recommendations it has received."
"In terms of what it is doing, the Agency - which was established in 2005 - is performing important - even essential - work, after the failure to achieve any of the aims agreed in 2002 and the fact that the common fisheries policy is considered to have been a failure to date."
"The Agency will be indispensable in the immediate future in view of the appalling fact that 88% of fish stocks in the EU are being overfished."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this report and endorsed the European Parliament's decision to grant discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Aviation Safety Agency for the financial year 2009."
"The Court of Auditors judged that the Agency's annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"I agree with the rapporteur that the Agency should consider making a Gantt diagram part of the programming for each of its operational activities, with a view to indicating in a concise form the amount of time spent by each staff member on a project and encouraging an approach geared towards achieving results."
"Furthermore, the Agency must implement an activity-based structure for the operational budget in order to establish a clear link between the work programme and the financial forecasts and improve performance monitoring and reporting."
"The Agency should set out a comparison of operations carried out during the year for which discharge is to be granted and in the previous financial year, so as to enable the European Parliament to assess the Agency's performance from one year to the next more effectively."
"In addition, a report must be attached to each year's budget on the unspent appropriations carried over from previous years, explaining why those monies have not been used and how and when they will be used."
"The Agency still demonstrates deficiencies in staff selection procedures, which put at risk the transparency of these procedures."
"I agree that the Agency must inform the European Parliament on the actions taken to redress this situation and make selection procedures more transparent."
"I have voted in favour of discharge for 2009 for the General Budget of the European Aviation Safety Agency because, in spite of apparently dubious management of the funds available, the Court of Auditors has considered the accounts to be reliable and the underlying transactions legal and regular."
"Moreover, I agree on the need for the agency to put in place more precise mechanisms for setting its objectives and for evaluating the results."
"in writing. - (PT) I welcome the decisions outlined in the report by the Court of Auditors that the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"I welcome and agree with the rapporteur's observations, and I congratulate the European Aviation Safety Agency on the work it does."
"in writing. - (LT) I endorsed this document, as the Committee responsible decided to approve the closure of the accounts of the European Aviation Safety Agency for the financial year 2009."
"The Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"However, it expressed concern about the lack of coordination between the needs, staff and financial regulation of the Agency and, in particular, that staff selection procedures made it difficult to recruit appropriately qualified personnel."
"I therefore believe that it is necessary to take the current observations into account."
"With today's vote budgetary discharge for 2009 has been granted to the European Aviation Safety Agency."
"Financial control of the implementation of the Community budget takes place at three levels: internal control, within each institution; external control by the European Court of Auditors; and the discharge procedure of the European Parliament."
"Clearly, every debate on discharge has its own specific context and today's discharge has taken place at a time of economic and financial crisis, which has created both financial and budgetary problems for some Member States."
"In spite of such conditions, I wish, nonetheless, to express satisfaction at the results achieved by the Agency and have therefore voted in the manner proposed by the rapporteur."
"in writing. - (PL) The Agency's work programme for 2010 is a matter of some concern to me."
"At the same time, I believe that it should be improved by establishing objectives and key performance indicators, as well as a better resource planning system."
"I would also highlight the need to improve the monitoring system for certification projects to make sure that, over the entire project duration, the fees levied do not deviate significantly from the actual cost."
"I ultimately decided to lend my support to the granting of discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Aviation Safety Agency for the financial year 2009."
"in writing. - I voted to give discharge to the European Aviation Safety Agency but urge the Agency to implement an activity-based structure for the operational budget in order to establish a clear link between the work programme and the financial forecasts and improve performance monitoring and reporting; note that the Agency prepares a multiannual plan every year, discussed with all stakeholders and approved by the Management Board, in which the budget per activity is presented; and acknowledge the view of the Court of Auditors that the structure of the Agency's operational budget (Title III) remained partially input-related and that the budget amendments were made without updating the work programme, even when they had a significant impact on the allocation of human and financial resources"
"in writing. - (PT) Taking into account the Court of Auditors' report on the annual accounts of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) for the financial year 2009, together with the EASA's replies, I voted for this decision, which grants the Executive Director of the EASA discharge in respect of the implementation of the EASA budget for the financial year 2009."
"in writing. - This grants the Executive Director of the European Aviation Safety Agency discharge in respect of the implementation of the Agency's budget for the financial year 2009."
"Through today's resolution, Parliament grants the Executive Director of the European Aviation Safety Agency discharge in respect of the implementation of the Agency's budget for the financial year 2009."
"Parliament welcomes the fact that the Court of Auditors found the Agency's accounts for the financial year 2009 to be reliable and the transactions to be, in all material respects, legal and regular."
"in writing. - (DE) I voted in favour of the discharge."
"The European Court of Auditors stated that the annual accounts for 2009 were regular and commented positively on the reliability of the accounts."
"At the same time, I should like to take this opportunity to emphasise the call in this report for a more transparent staff selection process."
"In view of the responsible tasks that the European Aviation Safety Agency carries out and the stated difficulties of finding qualified personnel, this should be accorded full consideration."
"in writing. - (LT) I endorsed this report and discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control for the financial year 2009."
"The Centre is an important institution that can strengthen and develop European disease surveillance and assess and communicate current and emerging threats to human health posed by infectious diseases."
"The Court of Auditors judged that the Centre's annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"I agree with the rapporteur that the Centre must set out a comparison of operations carried out during the year for which discharge is to be granted and in the previous financial year, so as to enable the European Parliament to assess the Centre's performance from one year to the next more effectively."
"I also agree that the Centre's powers must be strengthened so that the Union has an independent capacity to assess the severity of the risk of infection should a pandemic occur and so that coordination between the Member States can be improved."
"in writing. - (BG) The budget of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control for the financial year 2009 increased by 25.3% compared with 2008."
"If similar growth is recorded in the coming years, how will we cope with the financial crisis with our ever-increasing spending?"
"I think that the EUR 51 million could have been spent more effectively if they had been invested in regional disease monitoring systems in each individual Member State."
"This will not only help combat infectious diseases, but will also strengthen the healthcare systems in Member States themselves."
"I voted in favour of granting 2009 discharge to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control because the rapporteur has succeeded in identifying the most significant problems in terms of the transparency and accuracy of the accounts and because I am confident that this important and useful Agency will work on its administration in order to improve the areas pointed out, without undoing the good work that it has already done."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of the report on discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control for the financial year 2009, since it contributes to scrutiny of how funds are used by the European institutions."
"I believe it is a very important institution that can strengthen and develop European disease surveillance, and assess and communicate current and emerging threats to human health posed by infectious diseases."
"I regret, however, that the principle of annuality has not been respected, and that there was a high number of carryovers."
"in writing. - (PT) I welcome the decisions outlined in the report by the Court of Auditors that the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"I would also like to mention the centre's important contribution to the measures combating the pandemic of the H1N1 virus in 2009, not least by publishing preliminary guidelines on the use of specific vaccines against the influenza during the pandemic of the H1N1 virus in 2009."
"I welcome and agree with the rapporteur's observations, and I congratulate the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control on the work it does."
"In view of the Court of Auditors' statement that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable, and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, I voted in favour of granting discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control for the financial year 2009."
"Clearly, every debate on discharge has its own particular context, and the context of today's debate is the economic and financial crisis, which has caused financial and budgetary problems for a number of Member States."
"However, I think the Centre has done excellent work in strengthening European disease surveillance and assessing and communicating current and emerging threats to human health posed by infectious diseases."
"Lastly, I should like to congratulate the Centre on its contribution to the measures to fight the H1N1 virus pandemic of 2009."
"in writing. - I voted to give discharge to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and take the view that the Centre's powers must be strengthened so that the Union has an independent capacity to assess the severity of the risk of infection should a pandemic occur, and so that coordination between the Member States can be improved."
"in writing. - (PT) Taking into account the Court of Auditors' report on the annual accounts of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDPC) for the financial year 2009, together with the ECDPC's replies, I voted for this decision, which grants the Executive Director of the ECDPC discharge in respect of the implementation of the ECDPC budget for the financial year 2009."
"in writing. - This grants the Director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control discharge in respect of the implementation of the Centre's budget for the financial year 2009."
"Through today's resolution Parliament grants the Director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control discharge in respect of the implementation of the Centre's budget for the financial year 2009."
"Parliament calls once more on the Centre to set out, in a table to be annexed to the Court of Auditors' next report, a comparison of the operations that were carried out during the year for which discharge is to be granted and during the previous financial year, so as to enable the discharge authority to assess more effectively the Centre's performance from one year to the next."
"in writing. - (DE) I abstained from voting."
"The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control performs a very important task and has also justified its existence through its measures to combat the H1N1 pandemic; however, I would have expected the discharge to be postponed until the content of the recommendations by the Internal Audit Service (IAS) that are called for in the report is available - the IAS made one 'very important' recommendation and seven 'important' recommendations - and the Centre has presented a plan for the implementation of these recommendations."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this report and endorsed the European Parliament's decision to grant discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Chemicals Agency for the financial year 2009."
"The Court of Auditors judged that the Agency's annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"I agree with the rapporteur that the Agency must reduce the proportion of carryovers (the Agency has carried forward 29% of the total appropriations) to respect the principle of annuality."
"I welcome the Agency's initiatives for enhancing its customer focus and feedback procedures and congratulate the Agency for having conducted a stakeholder survey in 2009 and for having increased assistance activities for industry."
"The Agency must also further develop the planning and monitoring of its procurement and budget execution so as to reduce the proportion of carry forward appropriations."
"It is noted that the Agency has made a commitment to reduce the carryover of unspent funds to the following year and to limit those carryovers to a considerably lower level as compared to 2008."
"in writing. - (BG) What are we paying this sum of slightly more than EUR 70 million for?"
"For an agency where, according to the Court of Auditors, delays in the operational activities are caused by a lack of qualified staff and difficulties in implementing the IT system?"
"These two aspects are clearly crucial to the effective operation of an agency, but this makes me consider whether the agency can cope with the objectives it has been set in general."
"I voted against the discharge because, in my view, this money can be spent more effectively than in a poorly operating agency."
"I voted in favour of granting discharge in respect of the 2009 general budget of the European Chemicals Agency since the report shows that, despite several gaps and imperfections in the accounts, partly due to the recent creation of this Agency, its performance in terms of controls and budget management has steadily improved."
"in writing. - (PT) The European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) contributes to improving the European public's quality of life by guaranteeing the safe use of chemical substances and fostering innovation."
"In the face of the growing complexity and intensity of the use of and research into these types of substance, I believe the trend will be for the ECHA to become more important, which therefore justifies even closer scrutiny of how it generates the funds at its disposal."
"The Court of Auditors has attested to the reliability of its accounts for the financial year 2009 and they seem to be on the road to overcoming all the teething troubles that are almost inevitable with bodies of this type."
"I hope the ECHA will fulfil the purposes for which it was created, and will improve its budgetary rigour and its capacity for planning."
"in writing. - (LT) I endorsed this document, as the Committee responsible decided to approve the closure of the accounts of the European Chemicals Agency for the financial year 2009."
"The Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"However, the Court of Auditors highlighted delays in the operational activities caused by difficulties in implementing the IT system and by a lack of qualified staff."
"I therefore believe that it is necessary to take the current observations into account."
"Financial control of the implementation of the European Union budget takes place on three levels: internal control, within each institution; external control, carried out by the European Court of Auditors; and a discharge procedure carried out by the European Parliament."
"Today's vote sees the Executive Director of the European Chemicals Agency granted discharge in respect of the implementation of the Agency's budget for the financial year 2009."
"I voted in favour because the audits carried out by the Court of Auditors and the Committee on Budgetary Control showed that all the transactions made by the Agency were perfectly legal and regular."
"Lastly, I congratulate the Agency for having set up an Internal Audit Capability (IAC) to conduct internal audits and advise the Executive Director on risk management and internal control systems by issuing independent opinions and recommendations."
"in writing. - I voted to give discharge to the European Chemicals Agency but call on the Agency to inform the discharge authority of the steps taken to improve its control system by strengthening its financial circuits, workflows, audits, action plans and risk assessments."
"in writing. - (PT) Taking into account the Court of Auditors' report on the annual accounts of the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) for the financial year 2009, together with the ECHA's replies, I voted for this decision, which grants the Executive Director of the ECHA discharge in respect of the implementation of the ECHA budget for the financial year 2009."
"in writing. - This grants the Executive Director of the European Chemicals Agency discharge in respect of the implementation of the Agency's budget for the financial year 2009."
"Through today's resolution Parliament grants the Executive Director of the European Chemicals Agency discharge in respect of the implementation of the Agency's budget for the financial year 2009."
"Parliament welcomes the Agency's initiatives for enhancing its customer focus and feedback procedures."
"In particular, Parliament congratulates the Agency for having conducted a stakeholder survey in 2009 and for having increased assistance activities for industry."
"in writing. - (DE) I voted in favour of the report by Mr Stavrakakis, in which he calls on the European Court of Auditors to subject the (operationally) young European Chemicals Agency to performance audits."
"Based on the available data, the discharge of the Agency was recommended, this Agency having already submitted information that will be required of the other agencies in the future (such as an annexed table showing a comparison of figures from two consecutive financial years)."
"in writing. - (LT) I endorsed this report and discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Environment Agency for the financial year 2009."
"The Court of Auditors judged that the Agency's annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"The Agency is a reliable provider of independent environmental information for all Union institutions, the Member States and policy-making bodies."
"I agree with the rapporteur that the Agency must set out a comparison of operations carried out during the year for which discharge is to be granted and in the previous financial year."
"The Agency must further develop its communication methods in order to attract more media coverage for its findings and thus feed public debate on important environmental issues."
"Such measures may lead to a more transparent working method and greater public interest in the Agency's work."
"in writing. - (BG) Why should we fund agencies which fail to implement recommendations made by the Internal Audit Service?"
"In 2006, 27 recommendations were made, of which only nine have been implemented so far."
"This leads me to think that the European Environment Agency does not operate properly and its funding must be discontinued."
"I voted in favour of granting 2009 discharge to the European Environment Agency because I think the work it does is essential in this day and age."
"I therefore think that the critical issues pointed out do need to be corrected, but without losing sight of long-term strategic goals."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of the report on discharge of the budget of the European Environment Agency for the financial year 2009, since it contributes to scrutiny of how funds are used by the European institutions."
"I consider it a very important institution, specifically in relation to climate change adaptation, ecosystem assessment, sustainable consumption and production, and disaster prevention and management."
"in writing. - (PT) The goal of the European Environment Agency (EEA) is to make available credible and independent information about the environment."
"The EEA's mandate includes two aspects: firstly, support for European Union Member States in formulating economic policy that incorporates environmental issues and sustainability; secondly, coordinating environmental information through the Environment Information and Observation Network (Eionet)."
"Relevant issues justifying close monitoring by the EEA include assessing the state of the environment; identifying environmental trends, including the social and economic factors that environmental pressures are based on; monitoring environmental policies and their effectiveness; and predicting future trends and problems."
"in writing. - (PT) The rapporteur makes some observations and recommendations that we consider relevant in terms of budgetary processes for the European Environmental Agency (EEA) to take into account."
"At the same time, it highlights important failings in the EEA's recruitment processes, which call into question the transparency of this process, specifically: the vacancy notices did not specify a maximum number of candidates to be put on the reserve lists, questions used during written tests and interviews were not decided on before the examination of the applications, the decisions of the selection boards were insufficiently documented, thresholds for being invited to interview or put on the reserve list were not set in advance, and minutes were not complete."
"These are serious failings which urgently need to be corrected."
"The EEA can and should have an important role in compiling objective, trustworthy and comparable information on the environment in Europe, and in making it available in an accessible and thorough way."
"Nevertheless, it is important to be at pains to guarantee better cooperation, linkup and coordination with the competent institutions in the Member States, by promoting synergies and better circulation of information."
"in writing. - (LT) I endorsed this document, as the Committee responsible decided to approve the closure of the accounts of the European Environment Agency for the financial year 2009."
"The Court of Auditors reported insufficiently rigorous procedures for drawing up the budget leading to a considerable number of budgetary transfers affecting most of the budget lines (equivalent to 8% of the Agency's budget)."
"It notes, in particular, that some of these transfers led to successive increases and decreases in the same budget headings whereas some appropriations were not used and were transferred to other lines during the year."
"I therefore believe that procedures for drawing up the budget need to be more rigorous, because a large proportion of the financial resources stem from Union subsidies."
"Financial control on implementing the European Union budget takes place on three levels: internal control, within each institution; external control, carried out by the European Court of Auditors; and a discharge procedure carried out by Parliament."
"Today's vote sees discharge granted in respect of the implementation of the European Environment Agency's budget for the financial year 2009."
"I voted in favour because the audits carried out by the Court of Auditors and the Committee on Budgetary Control showed that all the transactions made by the Agency were perfectly legal and regular."
"In addition, I think the Agency does a very important job and I support the recent efforts made to involve the public more on important environmental matters, such as climate change, biodiversity and the management of natural resources."
"in writing. - I voted to give the European Environment Agency discharge on its budget."
"However, I call on the Agency to improve, by the end of the year, the accuracy of the information provided by the operational departments on the estimation of accrued operational expenditure."
"in writing. - (PT) Taking into account the Court of Auditors' report on the annual accounts of the European Environment Agency (EEA) for the financial year 2009, together with the EEA's replies, I voted for this decision, which grants the Executive Director of the EEA discharge in respect of the implementation of the EEA budget for the financial year 2009."
"in writing. - This grants the Executive Director of the European Environment Agency discharge in respect of the implementation of the Agency's budget for the financial year 2009."
"Through today's resolution Parliament grants the Director of the European Environment Agency discharge in respect of the implementation of the Agency's budget for the financial year 2009."
"Parliament specifically welcomes the Agency as a reliable provider of independent and assured environmental information for all Union institutions, the Member States and policy-making bodies."
"in writing. - (DE) I voted in favour of the discharge in view of the fact that the European Court of Auditors stated that it had obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts presented for 2009 were legal and regular."
"The European Environment Agency has performed important work in recent years in providing independent, reliable information and data in the area of the environment, which is a major concern of a large proportion of Europe's citizens, as evidenced by the annual reports of the Committee on Petitions."
"I also welcome the report's request that the European Court of Auditors undertake performance audits on the Agency."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this report and endorsed the European Parliament's decision to grant discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Food Safety Authority for the financial year 2009."
"The Court of Auditors judged that the Authority's annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"I agree with the rapporteur that the Authority should strengthen the planning and monitoring of budget processes related to differentiated appropriations."
"The Authority must improve its budget management in order to reduce its high carryover amounts."
"The Authority also needs to ensure its advice is high quality and independent in order to guarantee compliance with Union safety standards and scientific excellence and independence on all matters with a direct or indirect impact on food and food safety and plant protection."
"I voted for this report because the Court of Auditors has stated that is has reasonable assurances that the 2009 accounts for the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, and because on 5 May 2010 Parliament granted the Executive Director of the European Food Safety Authority discharge in respect of the implementation of the EFSA's 2008 budget."
"I also voted in favour because, although it should strengthen the planning and monitoring of budget processes, I agree that the EFSA needs to ensure that its advice is of a high quality and is independent, in order to guarantee compliance with Union safety standards, scientific excellence and independence on all matters with a direct or indirect impact on food and feed safety, and plant protection."
"in writing. - (BG) We cannot ignore the fact that for three successive years - 2006, 2007 and 2008 - the European Food Safety Authority carried over a large part of its commitments for operational activities."
"An even more controversial fact is that the Court of Auditors reported difficulties in the implementation of the agency's 2009 work programme."
"For these reasons, I think that this agency should not be discharged in respect of the implementation of its budget because European taxpayers do not deserve their money to be spent on an agency which is not coping with the commitments entrusted to it."
"I voted in favour of granting discharge in respect of the 2009 general budget of the European Food Safety Authority, not only because the Court of Auditors has declared that the accounts are reliable and that the underlying transactions are regular and legal, but also because the Agency has allocated some funds from its reserve for the completion of a number of important projects in infrastructure, information technology development and scientific cooperation, for example."
"However, I think further audits ought to be carried out on the use of some funds and budgetary management ought to be improved in order to reduce the high number of carryovers."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of the report on discharge of the budget of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) for the financial year 2009, since it contributes to scrutiny of how funds are used by the European institutions."
"I believe the EFSA should continue to guarantee scientific excellence and independence, meaning there is a need for measures relating to the declaration of interests by EFSA staff and experts working for the EFSA."
"in writing. - (PT) The work of European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) takes in all stages of food production and supply, from primary production to supplying consumers with food, including the safety of animal feed."
"It gathers information and analyses new scientific advances, so as to identify and assess all potential risks to the food chain."
"It can go ahead with a scientific assessment of any issue that could have a direct or indirect impact on the safety of the food supply, including issues related to animal health or welfare, and plant health."
"If food safety is one of the main requirements and greatest concerns of a market with over 500 million consumers, the way it is assessed and studied requires extremely high levels of professionalism, performance and impartiality."
"The Union has been advocating the capacity for monitoring types of food 'from field to fork', but it is essential to recognise that there is still a lot to do."
"in writing. - (LT) I endorsed this document, as the Committee responsible decided to approve the closure of the accounts of the European Food Safety Authority for the financial year 2009."
"The Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"Firstly I should like to thank everyone who worked on the report and to congratulate the European Food Safety Authority itself, which has respected the need to provide high-quality, independent advice in order to guarantee compliance with safety standards as well as scientific excellence and independence on all matters with a direct or indirect impact on food safety."
"Unfortunately I have to point out a few difficulties reported by the Court of Auditors following the audits carried out during the implementation of the 2009 work programme."
"I therefore add my voice to the calls for the Authority to take the necessary measures to remedy these shortcomings which, in any case, have not nullified the general regularity and reliability of the budget for the financial year 2009."
"in writing. - I voted to give discharge to the European Food Safety Authority, but regret that, for the third successive year, the Court of Auditors pointed out that commitments for operational activities carried over from the previous year had to be cancelled (19 % of commitments for operational activities carried over from 2008, 37 % of commitments for operational activities carried over from 2007 and 26 % of commitments for operational activities carried over from 2006)."
"Parliament urges the Authority to change this situation and to notify the Court of Auditors of the measures taken."
"in writing. - (PT) Taking into account the Court of Auditors' report on the annual accounts of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) for the financial year 2009, together with the EFSA's replies, I voted for this decision, which grants the Executive Director of the EFSA discharge in respect of the implementation of the EFSA budget for the financial year 2009."
"in writing. - This grants the Executive Director of the European Food Safety Authority discharge in respect of the implementation of the Authority's budget for the financial year 2009."
"Through today's resolution Parliament grants the Executive Director of the European Food Safety Authority discharge in respect of the implementation of the Authority's budget for the financial year 2009."
"Parliament congratulates the Authority for having set out, in the table annexed to the Court of Auditors' 2009 report, a comparison of the operations that were carried out during 2008 and 2009 so as to enable the discharge authority to assess more effectively its performance from one year to the next."
"Parliament also welcomes the fact that the Authority has increased its number of thematic papers and policy briefings."
"in writing. - (DE) In the case of the European Food Safety Authority I have not gone along with the rapporteur's recommendation to grant discharge 'on the basis of the data available'; the obvious deficiencies in budget management are simply too serious."
"The Internal Audit Service (IAS) has made 48 recommendations on grant management, 27 of which even fall into the 'critical' category."
"In addition, there are concerns regarding possible conflicts of interest and lack of transparency."
"in writing. - (LT) I endorsed this report and discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction for the financial year 2009."
"The Court of Auditors judged that the Centre's annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"I welcome the Centre's initiative to run a computerised network for the collection and exchange of information called the European information network on Drugs and Drug Addiction."
"This network connects national drug information networks, specialist centres in the Member States and the information systems of international organisations working with the Centre."
"I agree that the Centre should consider making a Gantt diagram part of the programming for each of its operational activities, with a view to indicating in concise form the amount of time spent by each staff member on a project and encouraging an approach geared towards achieving results."
"I also believe that it is important for the Centre to improve the programming and the monitoring of activities with a view to reducing carry over to the following year."
"I welcome the Centre's initiative to provide the European Parliament with the Internal Audit Service's Annual Internal Audit Report on the Centre, because this is a sign of transparency and best practice."
"I voted for discharge of the implementation of the observatory's budget for the financial year 2009."
"As in previous cases, the Court of Auditors has stated that its actions are legal and regular."
"It should be taken into account that Parliament granted it discharge in May."
"Its management seems crucial to me, and I was very pleased to welcome the creation of the European Information Network on Drugs and Drug Addiction (REITOX), which enables increased contact between national drug information networks and specialist centres for the sharing of best practices."
"I view the contribution of a framework for comparison with 2009 and 2008 positively, as it has facilitated the analysis of the increase in its activities."
"I voted in favour of granting discharge in respect of the 2009 general budget of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction as it has managed its resources prudently and in line with expectations."
"As the report shows, the management can still be improved, above all in terms of cash management and carryover analysis."
"in writing. - (PT) This monitoring centre has an extremely important role in the European context."
"Its remit is to provide objective, reliable and comparable information enabling the European Union and its Member States to have a wide-ranging perspective on the phenomenon of drug addiction and its consequences."
"Rigour in terms of information means there is a need for equal rigour in accounting."
"I hope the monitoring centre will not desist from truly and accurately carrying out the mission entrusted to it, and that it will do so whilst managing its budget the best it can."
"I also hope that any information it gathers will help the Member States to follow closely the causes and consequences of this scourge, and to point to paths and solutions enabling affected Europeans to free themselves from the addiction destroying them and their families."
"in writing. - (LT) I endorsed this document, as the Committee responsible decided to approve the closure of the accounts of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction for the financial year 2009."
"At the same time, the budget of the Centre was 2.25% less than its budget for 2008."
"Financial control on implementing the European Union budget takes place on three levels: internal control, within each institution; external control, carried out by the European Court of Auditors; and a discharge procedure carried out by Parliament."
"Today's vote sees discharge granted in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction for the financial year 2009."
"I voted in favour on the basis of the report by the Court of Auditors, which stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the accounts are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"Lastly, I welcome the Centre's decision to build and run a computerised network for the collection and exchange of information called the European Information Network on Drugs and Drug Addiction."
"The network will connect national drug information networks, specialist centres in the Member States and the information systems of international organisations working with the Centre."
"in writing. - I voted to give discharge to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addicition and, in doing so, welcome the fact that the Centre has further enhanced the annual forecast of its cash needs; notes that this forecast is constantly updated and submitted as a supporting document to the relevant Commission services to justify the Centre's quarterly request for payment of the next instalment of its annual subsidy allocated by the Union."
"in writing. - (PT) Taking into account the Court of Auditors' report on the annual accounts of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) for the financial year 2009, together with the EMCDDA's replies, I voted for this decision, which grants the Executive Director of the EMCDDA discharge in respect of the implementation of the EMCDDA budget for the financial year 2009."
"in writing. - This grants the Director of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction discharge in respect of the implementation of the Centre's budget for the financial year 2009."
"Through today's resolution Parliament grants the Executive Director of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction discharge in respect of the implementation of the Centre's budget for the financial year 2009."
"Parliament welcomes the Centre's initiative to run a computerised network for the collection and exchange of information called the European Information Network on Drugs and Drug Addiction."
"Parliament notes that this network connects national drug information networks, specialist centres in the Member States and the information systems of international organisations working with the Centre."
"in writing. - (DE) I voted in favour of the discharge."
"The annual accounts for 2009 were found to be regular."
"The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) has been exemplary in the way it administers its budget."
"The Monitoring Centre has already presented a table comparing financial years 2008 and 2009 - not just the figures (which show a 2.25% reduction in funds compared with 2008), but also the measures implemented."
"To fully ensure transparency the EMCDDA wishes to present the full report from the Internal Audit Service."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this report and endorsed the European Parliament's decision to grant discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Maritime Safety Agency for the financial year 2009."
"The Court of Auditors judged that the Agency's annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"I agree that the Agency should consider making a Gantt diagram part of the programming for each of its operational activities, with a view to indicating in a concise form the amount of time spent by each staff member on a project and encouraging an approach geared towards achieving results."
"The Agency should set out a comparison of operations carried out during the year for which discharge is to be granted and in the previous financial year so as to enable the European Parliament to assess the Agency's performance from one year to the next more effectively."
"In 2009, the Court of Auditors again noted a high number of budget transfers; therefore the Agency must continue to improve its planning and monitoring in order to reduce the number of budget transfers."
"The Agency must also take steps to overcome deficiencies in staff selection procedures, which put at risk the transparency of these procedures."
"I voted for this report."
"The Court of Auditors states that this agency's accounts are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"In reaching my position, I see the adoption of its five-year multiannual plan as positive, although - as the Court of Auditors says - it should improve budgetary planning and management."
"However, the assessment of its activities has been positive."
"I voted in favour of granting discharge in respect of the 2009 general budget of the European Maritime Safety Authority because, despite the previous absence of a multiannual programme and significant concern over the high number of budget transfers in 2008, the Agency has shown improvements in its management and, taken as a whole, the Court of Auditors had a positive view of the annual accounts and the underlying transactions."
"in writing. - (PT) The environmental disasters of the ships Erika and Prestige have laid bare the need to do more for maritime safety at European level."
"The agency, which is based in Lisbon, fittingly, has important competences in this area and deserves to be supported in its demanding work."
"This agency should, however, make efforts to improve its planning and monitoring policies."
"Firstly I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Stavrakakis, for his excellent work."
"I voted in favour today of granting discharge to the European Maritime Safety Agency in respect of the implementation of its budget for the financial year 2009."
"I would, however, like to draw attention to the fact that the Court of Auditors noted a high number of budget transfers in 2009 and add my voice to the request made to the Agency to work on improving its future budgetary planning and monitoring in order to reduce the number of budget transfers."
"I welcome the work carried out by the European Maritime Safety Agency."
"I also believe that the adoption in March 2010 of a five-year strategy represents progress in terms of its actions and improvements to future work."
"I therefore decided to vote in favour of granting discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Maritime Safety Agency for the financial year 2009."
"in writing. - I voted to grant discharge to the European Maritime Safety Agency for its 2009 budget but call on the Agency to further reduce the number of posteriori commitments (i.e. legal commitments that were entered into before the corresponding budgetary commitments were made); reminds the Agency that, since 2006, the Court of Auditors has reported infringements of Article 62(1) of the Financial Regulation; welcomes, nevertheless, the Agency's efforts to improve this situation by providing ad hoc training to avoid posteriori commitments."
"in writing. - (PT) This report discharges the annual accounts of the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) for the financial year 2009."
"As the Court of Auditors has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, I believe Parliament should adopt this report."
"However, it should be stressed that the Court of Auditors has, once again, noted a high number of budget transfers in 2009 (49 in 2009, 52 in 2008 and 32 in 2007), so it is desirable that the EMSA improve its planning and monitoring to thus reduce the number of transfers."
"It is also desirable that the EMSA set out, in a table to be annexed to the Court of Auditors' next report, a comparison of operations carried out during the year for which discharge is to be granted and in the previous financial year, so as to enable the discharge authority to assess more effectively the EMSA's performance from one year to the next."
"in writing. - (PT) Taking into account the Court of Auditors' report on the annual accounts of the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) for the financial year 2009, together with the EMSA's replies, I voted for this decision, which grants the Executive Director of the EMSA discharge in respect of the implementation of the EMSA budget for the financial year 2009."
"in writing. - This grants the Executive Director of the European Maritime Safety Agency discharge in respect of the implementation of the Agency's budget for the financial year 2009."
"Through today's resolution Parliament grants the Director of the European Maritime Safety Agency discharge in respect of the implementation of the Agency's budget for the financial year 2009."
"Parliament welcomes the fact that the Court of Auditors found the Agency's annual accounts for the financial year 2009 to be reliable and regarded the transactions underlying them, taken as a whole, as legal and regular."
"With the vote on discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) for 2009, Parliament has been able to confirm the good governance of that Agency and the use of its appropriations for their intended purpose."
"I welcome this vote, as it reaffirms Parliament's commitment to the Agency, which plays a crucial role in monitoring and supervising Europe's seas."
"Given that the pressure on our maritime area is growing, we have a duty to be extremely vigilant regarding its use."
"Hence I am particularly delighted that the proposals contained in my 2008 report on port State control have become key principles underpinning EMSA's work."
"They relate, for example, to ship inspections and coordination of the various national control systems by the Agency."
"The sea is an area that belongs to all Europeans, and it is part of our heritage."
"By promoting the exchange of good practice, relentlessly combating pollution and illegal activities at sea, and preventing accidents, we will be able to benefit from the sea's growth potential for a long time yet."
"in writing. - (DE) The funding of the European Maritime Safety Agency was also cut in 2009, by 3.8%."
"The Agency's tasks, which include environmental disasters at sea, are of particular importance in view of the state of EU waters."
"I voted in favour of discharge since the deficiencies listed mainly concerned procurement and staff selection procedures, while the European Court of Auditors gave a positive verdict on the annual accounts for 2009."
"However, these deficiencies must be remedied in 2010 and the 'very important' Internal Audit Service (IAS) recommendations must all be implemented if discharge is to be warranted in 2010."
"in writing. - (LT) I endorsed this report and discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Network and Information Security Agency for the financial year 2009."
"The Court of Auditors judged that the Agency's annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"I agree with the rapporteur that the Agency should strengthen its internal controls to make sure that contracts and procurement procedures are correctly applied."
"The Agency must also provide regular information on its financial circuits and the responsibilities of the relevant financial and operational actors."
"Deficiencies in Agency staff selection procedures still remain and put at risk the transparency of these procedures."
"The Agency must redress this situation and inform the European Parliament on the actions taken."
"I also agree that the Agency should put in place ex-post controls with the help of a professional supplier."
"I voted for this report. I did so because the Court of Auditors says it has sufficient assurances that the 2009 accounts of the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, and because on 5 May 2010 Parliament granted the Executive Director of the ENISA discharge in respect of the implementation of its 2008 budget."
"However, I accept that it should improve transparency regarding estimates and who has responsibility for projects, procurement procedures, and follow-up of potential irregularities."
"I voted in favour of granting 2009 discharge to the European Network and Information Security Agency having read in this detailed report of the regularity of the procedures adopted and of the specific areas that appeared to lack transparency."
"in writing. - (PT) The dematerialisation of contact between people and the increasing use of Web platforms make it advisable for the European Union to put cyber-safety in the 'essential' category."
"Indeed, ever greater amounts of information are being accumulated on the Internet, and people are making growing use of the net for a most diverse range of their day-to-day activities."
"Such circumstances bring an exponential rise in the risks of privacy violation and of illicit use of data, information, sounds or images by third parties."
"The Court of Auditors has attested to the reliability of its accounts, but highlights a range of corrections to be made."
"Since its foundation, the European Maritime Safety Agency has been giving extremely important support to the European Commission and to Member States, especially in terms of maritime safety and the prevention of pollution from ships."
"in writing. - (LT) I endorsed this document, because the Committee responsible decided to approve the closure of the accounts of the European Network and Information Security Agency for the financial year 2009."
"However, the Court of Auditors found deficiencies in procurement procedures, particularly with regard to the under-estimation of the budgets of a framework contract."
"The budget of the Agency for the year 2009 was 3.5% less than its budget for 2008."
"I believe that the current deficiencies must be redressed."
"Financial control on implementing the European Union budget takes place on three levels: internal control, within each institution; external control, carried out by the European Court of Auditors; and a discharge procedure carried out by the European Parliament."
"Today's vote sees discharge granted in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Network and Information Security Agency for the financial year 2009, thereby closing the procedure for 2009."
"I voted in favour on the basis of the statements made by the Court of Auditors, which has confirmed that it has received reasonable assurances that the annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"in writing. - I voted to give discharge to the European Network and Information Security Agency and, in doing so, I note with disappointment that there has been no progress since the previous year concerning the refund of EUR 45 000 which is the amount of VAT paid in advance by the Agency to the tax authorities of the host Member State; urges, therefore, the Agency to inform the discharge authority when this refund is made by the host Member State."
"in writing. - (PT) Taking into account the Court of Auditors' report on the annual accounts of the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) for the financial year 2009, together with the ENISA's replies, I voted for this decision, which grants the Executive Director of the ENISA discharge in respect of the implementation of the ENISA budget for the financial year 2009."
"in writing. - This grants the Executive Director of the European Network and Information Security Agency discharge in respect of the implementation of the Agency's budget for the financial year 2009."
"Through today's resolution Parliament grants the Executive Director of the European Network and Information Security Agency discharge in respect of the implementation of the Agency's budget for the financial year 2009."
"Parliament underlines that the Court of Auditors has stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"in writing. - (DE) I did not vote in favour of the discharge."
"The deficiencies listed by the Internal Audit Service (IAS) are too numerous and too serious."
"To name but one: after a re-examination of procurement by the European Network and Information Security Agency more weaknesses were found in this area."
"The 18 recommendations by the IAS to improve the Agency's services must be implemented comprehensively and without delay."
"Since the Agency has refused a full five of the 18 recommendations, however, it seems that even the will required for this is lacking."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this report and endorsed the European Parliament's decision to grant discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Railway Agency for the financial year 2009."
"The Court of Auditors informed the European Parliament that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the Agency's annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"I agree with the rapporteur that using two locations (Lille and Valenciennes) for carrying out its activities exposes the Agency to additional costs."
"I therefore believe that action must be taken by the Council to change the decision obliging the Agency to have a double seat."
"I believe that the Agency should set out a comparison of operations carried out during the year for which discharge is to be granted and in the previous financial year so as to enable the European Parliament to assess the Agency's performance from one year to the next more effectively."
"I congratulate the Agency, following the Court of Auditors' comments, on implementing a centralised system for registration of incoming invoices."
"This measure is necessary to ensure the timely recording of all invoices and contributes to avoiding delays in processing payments."
"I welcome the Agency's initiative to set up an Internal Audit Capability that is dedicated to providing support and advice to its Director and management on internal control, risk assessment and internal audit."
"I voted for discharge of the implementation of the budget of the European Railway Agency for the financial year 2009, because Parliament granted its director discharge in May."
"However, I agree - as the report says - that the carryover of appropriations needs to be better managed because they are in breach of the budgetary principle of annuality."
"I also agree with the observations by the Court of Auditors about delays in procurement procedures."
"I have a positive take on the effort made to bring in a centralised system for registration of incoming invoices, which is necessary to improve their management."
"I voted in favour of granting discharge in respect of the 2009 general budget of the European Railway Agency since, as the report shows, it managed its resources well overall."
"I also agree on the need to make a number of improvements in the area of auditing the accounts and managing the budget in order to reduce the level of carryovers and cancellations, which is still too high."
"in writing. - (PT) The European railways sector suffers from the incompatibility of national technical and safety rules, representing a serious disadvantage for its development."
"It is for the agency to reduce this gulf and to establish common safety objectives."
"Having two separate headquarters leads to increased costs, which perhaps should not be the case."
"The delay in carrying out a number of activities calls into question the principle of budgetary annuality, which has caused the carryover of budgetary appropriations."
"in writing. - (LT) I abstained from the vote on this document, although the Committee responsible decided to approve the closure of the accounts of the European Railway Agency for the financial year 2009."
"The budget of the Agency for the year 2009 was 16.6% less than its budget for 2008."
"The Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"It is worrying that concern was expressed over the weaknesses in procurement procedures revealed by the Court of Auditors' audit - cancellations and delays in procurement procedures, recurrent delays in the execution of payments and significant changes made to the work programme during the year."
"The Court of Auditors identified shortcomings in the management of the fixed assets' inventory, but notes the Agency's assurance that this will be remedied in the 2010 accounts."
"I feel that uncertainty about the location of fixed assets is another illustration of the problems and additional costs arising from using two sites."
"This is also the reason for my abstention."
"Through today's resolution Parliament has granted the Director of the European Railway Agency discharge in respect of the implementation of the Agency's budget for the financial year 2009."
"Unfortunately, the audit process revealed cancellations and delays in procurement procedures, recurrent delays in the execution of payments and significant changes made to the work programme during the year."
"I believe that such problems ought to be avoided in future years."
"To this end, I am very pleased with the Agency's creation of an Internal Audit Capability (IAC) that is dedicated to providing support and advice on internal control."
"in writing. - (PL) I voted in favour of granting discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Railway Agency for the financial year 2009."
"Nevertheless, I believe that the Council should take steps to eliminate one of the agency's sites, since this is a source of unnecessary additional costs, and the agency does not need two sites to take efficient action."
"Furthermore, I am concerned by the fact that the agency's staff regulations and their implementing rules have not been followed."
"in writing. - I voted to give discharge to the European Railway Agency for its 2009 budget."
"However, I regret the shortcomings in the management of the fixed assets' inventory identified by the Court of Auditors but note the Agency's assurance that this will be remedied in the 2010 accounts; considers that uncertainty about the location of fixed assets is another illustration of the problems and additional costs arising from using two sites."
"in writing. - (PT) Taking into account the Court of Auditors' report on the annual accounts of the European Railway Agency (ERA) for the financial year 2009, together with the ERA's replies, I voted for this decision, which grants the Executive Director of the ERA discharge in respect of the implementation of the ERA budget for the financial year 2009."
"in writing. - This grants the Director of the European Railway Agency discharge in respect of the implementation of the agency's budget for the 2009 financial year."
"Through today's resolution Parliament grants the Director of the European Railway Agency discharge in respect of the implementation of the Agency's budget for the financial year 2009."
"Parliament is concerned that the Court of Auditors has again highlighted cancellations and delays in procurement procedures, recurrent delays in the execution of payments and significant changes made to the work programme during the year."
"in writing. - (DE) I abstained from voting in this instance because I would have preferred the discharge to be postponed."
"This report shows that the annual activity report contains insufficient information on the planning, allocation and use of human resources."
"Moreover, if a report on the non-deployment and planned use of resources is only required for next year, this takes only limited account of the concern expressed by the European Court of Auditors regarding the repeated cancellations and delays in procurement procedures."
"in writing. - (LT) I endorsed this report and discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Training Foundation for the financial year 2009."
"The Court of Auditors informed the European Parliament that the Foundation's annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"I welcome the Foundation's intention to improve the performance of Vocational Education and Training systems in the Foundation partner countries and to develop a common methodology with international organisations and bilateral donors to improve its role."
"I feel that the Foundation must set out a comparison of operations carried out during the year for which discharge is to be granted and in the previous financial year so as to enable the European Parliament to assess the Foundation's performance from one year to the next more effectively."
"I agree with the rapporteur that the Foundation must draw up budgetary procedures more rigorously."
"This would help avoid the considerable number of budgetary transfers."
"I also welcome the Foundation's initiative to provide the European Parliament with the Internal Audit Service's Annual Internal Audit Report on the Foundation."
"I voted for this report. I did so because the Court of Auditors says it has sufficient assurances that the 2009 accounts of the European Training Foundation (ETF) are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, and because on 5 May 2010 Parliament granted the Executive Director of the ETF discharge in respect of the implementation of its 2008 budget."
"I agree with the entire content of the report and I would highlight the ETF's initiative of providing the discharge authority with the Internal Audit Service (IAS) Annual Internal Audit Report, as it is a sign of transparency to be followed by all other agencies."
"I voted in favour of granting 2009 discharge in respect of the European Training Foundation since, as the report underlines, the management of the accounts and the transactions was, taken as a whole, legal and regular."
"However, I think the lack of transparency in recruitment procedures and the inquiry opened by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) are worrying."
"I hope that the Foundation will take the appropriate action on this issue in order to improve its performance."
"in writing. - (PT) The objective of the European Training Foundation (ETF) is to contribute to the development of professional training systems, by strengthening cooperation regarding professional training and ensuring the coordination of aid."
"The activities of the ETF cover candidate countries for accession to the European Union, the countries of the Western Balkans, of Eastern Europe and Central Asia, and Mediterranean partner countries."
"There is a need for both caution and rigour when spending the available funds on issues related to professional training involving countries in the developing world."
"I endorsed this document, because the Committee responsible decided to approve the closure of the accounts of the European Training Foundation for the financial year 2009."
"However, worryingly, concern was expressed over the findings of the Court of Auditors as regards the lack of transparency in recruitment procedures and the intervention of the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), which has opened an inquiry (OF/2009/0370)."
"All deficiencies must be overcome in order to achieve greater transparency and to eliminate any uncertainty concerning the work of the European Training Foundation."
"In view of the Court of Auditors' statement that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable, and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, I voted in favour of granting discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Training Foundation for the financial year 2009."
"Clearly, every debate on discharge has its own particular context, and the context of today's debate is the economic and financial crisis, which has caused financial and budgetary problems for a number of Member States."
"Despite these difficulties, I congratulate the Foundation on its intention to improve the performance of Vocational Education and Training (VET) systems in the Foundation partner countries ('Torino Process') while at the same time undertaking a thorough review of its recruitment procedures."
"in writing. - I voted to give the European Training Foundation discharge for its 2009 budget and welcome the Foundation's initiative of providing the discharge authority with the IAS Annual Internal Audit Report concerning the Foundation."
"Parliament considers this to be a sign of transparency and a best practice to be followed by all other Agencies."
"in writing. - (PT) Taking into account the Court of Auditors' report on the annual accounts of the European Training Foundation (ETF) for the financial year 2009, together with the ETF's replies, I voted for this decision, which grants the Executive Director of the ETF discharge in respect of the implementation of the ETF budget for the financial year 2009."
"in writing. - This grants the Director of the European Training Foundation discharge in respect of the implementation of the foundation's budget for the 2009 financial year."
"in writing. - (DE) Discharge has been granted."
"The report comments positively that the 2009 budget provides a true picture of the Foundation's financial situation."
"The budget was reduced by 0.5% compared with 2008."
"Further potential savings can be made through increased cooperation with the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (CEDEFOP)."
"The Foundation hopes to deal with the criticised lack of transparency in staff recruitment by means of a thorough review of the process."
"I voted in favour of this report and endorsed discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work for the financial year 2009."
"The Court of Auditors informed the European Parliament that the Agency's annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"I agree with the rapporteur that the Agency must set out a comparison of operations carried out during the year for which discharge is to be granted and in the previous financial year so as to enable the European Parliament to assess the Agency's performance from one year to the next more effectively."
"I welcome the Agency's initiative of launching foresight on the safety and health impact of technological innovations in green jobs by 2020."
"I believe that the Agency must reduce the increased cancellation rate and inform the European Parliament of the actions taken."
"The Agency must also pay particular attention to the commitments still open at year-end with a view to using unspent funds to cover the subsequent financial and legal obligations."
"I voted in favour of granting discharge in respect of the 2009 budget of the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work because I think that, despite some inconsistencies identified by the Court of Auditors in the management of some funds and irregularities with respect to a procurement procedure, it can be said that the management on the whole has been good."
"Furthermore, I support the Court of Auditors' comments regarding the need for improvements in the programming and monitoring of activities with a view to using the available appropriations as efficiently as possible."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of the report on discharge of the budget of the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work for the financial year 2009, since it contributes to scrutiny of how funds are used by the European institutions."
"The effects of funding from this agency on measures relating to the health and safety of working women should be highlighted."
"in writing. - (PT) This agency is responsible for providing useful technical, scientific and economic information on health and safety in the workplace to the Union authorities, to the Member States and to interested parties."
"This information is essential to enable assessment of health and safety conditions in the workplace in the Union, and of what Europe's current best practices in this field are."
"Despite the Court of Auditors stating that the agency's accounts are reliable, and the fact that the agency effectively coordinated the network of agencies during the process of discharging the budget for the financial year 2009, the rapporteur singled out that it had not provided sufficient information for comparing actions carried out with subsequent years."
"I deem such information relevant and there should be an accompanying table annexed to the next report by the Court of Auditors, as is suggested."
"in writing. - (LT) I endorsed this document, because the Committee responsible decided to approve the closure of the accounts of the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work for the financial year 2009."
"The Court of Auditors identified an irregularity with respect to a procurement procedure (use of a framework contract beyond its maximum value)."
"The Agency's budget for 2009 was EUR 15 100 000, which is an increase of 0.6% from its budget of 2008."
"I believe that it is necessary for the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work to address the weaknesses in the procurement procedures."
"In view of the Court of Auditors' statement that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable, and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, I voted in favour of granting discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work for the financial year 2009."
"Clearly, every debate on discharge has its own particular context, and the context of today's debate is the economic and financial crisis, which has caused financial and budgetary problems for a number of Member States."
"Notwithstanding these difficulties, I commend the Agency on the progress it has made, despite a few mistakes, and on its effective work as coordinator of the network of Agencies during the 2009 discharge procedure."
"in writing. - I voted to give discharge to the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work."
"I welcome the Agency's initiative of providing the discharge authority with the Internal Audit Service (IAS)'s Annual Internal Audit Report."
"I congratulate the Agency on its considerable progress in this respect."
"Parliament acknowledges that all 'very important' recommendations issued by the IAS to the Agency were adequately implemented and closed, except the recommendation on validation of accounting systems, which was downgraded to 'important' as a result of its partial implementation; it calls, accordingly, on the accounting officer of the Agency to describe the methodology used in the validation of its accounting system; and it supports the idea of developing cooperation within the existing Inter-Agency Accountants Network in order to come up with common requirements and develop a common methodology for validation of the accounting systems in agencies."
"in writing. - (PT) Taking into account the Court of Auditors' report on the annual accounts of the European Agency for Health and Safety at Work for the financial year 2009, together with the agency's replies, I voted for this decision, which grants the Executive Director of the European Agency for Health and Safety at Work discharge in respect of the implementation of the agency budget for the financial year 2009."
"in writing. - This grants the Director of the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work discharge in respect of the implementation of the agency's budget for the 2009 financial year."
"Through today's resolution Parliament grants the Director of the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work discharge in respect of the implementation of the Agency's budget for the financial year 2009."
"Parliament welcomes the Agency's initiative of launching 'foresight' on the safety and health impact of technological innovations in 'green jobs' by 2020."
"Parliament notes also that data were collected on the safety and health of women at work."
"in writing. - (DE) Discharge has been granted."
"The European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, in which both employers and employees are represented and which advises companies on simple and effective ways to improve working conditions, is struggling with irregularities in the area of procurement as well as with the budgeting principle of annuality."
"On the other hand, the Agency has already given its assurance that it will pay particular attention to these difficulties; moreover, it has ensured maximum transparency by providing the Annual Internal Audit Report."
"I voted in favour of this report and endorsed discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the Euratom Supply Agency for the financial year 2009."
"The Court of Auditors informed the European Parliament that the Agency's annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"In the absence of an autonomous budget, the Agency is de facto integrated into the Commission."
"I agree with the rapporteur that this situation is at odds with the Agency's Statutes and that it raises the issue of the need to maintain the Agency in its current form and organisation."
"I voted in favour of granting 2009 discharge to the Euratom Supply Agency because it has managed its finances accurately and carefully."
"However, I think it is necessary, as the report states, to revise the legal position of the Agency, since it is still integrated into the Commission."
"in writing. - (PT) The European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) works in areas linked to atomic energy, specifically research, and drawing up guidelines for the safe and peaceful use of nuclear energy."
"Through the creation of this agency, Euratom aimed to ensure a regular and equitable supply of ores, raw materials and special combustible materials in the European Union."
"Despite recent concerns deriving from the accident at the Fukushima plant, nuclear energy forms part of the European 'energy mix'."
"The supply of whatever materials enable the agency's objectives to be achieved is therefore essential if Euratom is to remain active."
"The rapporteur has confirmed that the agency is, in fact, part of Euratom and has no budget of its own, which is cause for reflection about the usefulness of it remaining organised as it is."
"I do not have enough information to adopt a position, but I think that the solution that costs the EU least, and offers the greatest efficiency and transparency, should be chosen."
"When the budget for Euratom is EUR 5.5 billion, compared to EUR 1.2 billion for renewable energy sources, I refuse, on principle, to grant discharge to the management of Euratom."
"It is about time this trend was reversed, hence I abstained on this report."
"Firstly, I should like to thank the rapporteur for the superb work he has accomplished."
"As we know, financial control on implementing the European Union budget takes place on three levels: internal control, within each institution; external control, carried out by the European Court of Auditors; and a discharge procedure carried out by the European Parliament."
"Today's vote concludes the financial control procedure with the discharge granted in respect of the implementation of the 2009 budget of the Euratom Supply Agency, whose accounts were found to be legal and reliable."
"in writing. - I voted to give discharge to the Euratom Supply Agency."
"In doing so, I note that, in 2009, the agency did not receive any subsidy to cover its operations."
"The Commission bore all expenses incurred by the agency for the implementation of the 2009 budget."
"This situation has persisted since the creation of the agency in 2008."
"In the absence of an autonomous budget, the agency is de facto integrated into the Commission."
"To me, this raises the issue of the need to maintain the agency in its current form and organisation."
"in writing. - (PT) Taking into account the Court of Auditors' report on the annual accounts of the Euratom (European Atomic Energy Community) Supply Agency (ESA) for the financial year 2009, together with the ESA's replies, I voted for this decision, which grants the Executive Director of the ESA discharge in respect of the implementation of the ESA budget for the financial year 2009."
"in writing. - This grants the Director-General of the Euratom Supply Agency discharge in respect of the implementation of the agency's budget for the 2009 financial year."
"Through today's resolution Parliament grants the Director-General of the Euratom Supply Agency discharge in respect of the implementation of the Agency's budget for the financial year 2009."
"Parliament underlines that the Court of Auditors has stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable, and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"in writing. - (DE) I abstained from voting on the discharge of the Euratom Supply Agency, which has the task of ensuring the European Union is provided with fissile materials (including any stores)."
"According to this report, there are currently inconsistencies as regards the present organisation of the Agency and its legal form."
"This raises the issue of whether the Agency needs to be maintained in its current form and with its current organisation."
"I would have liked to have seen this matter clarified, particularly in view of the current Europe-wide rethink on nuclear power."
"I endorsed this report and discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions for the financial year 2009."
"The Court of Auditors informed the European Parliament that the Foundation's annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"I welcome the Foundation's intention to set out a comparison of operations carried out during the year for which discharge is to be granted and in the previous financial year."
"This will enable the European Parliament to assess more effectively its performance from one year to the next."
"I believe that the ex-post assessment exercise of the Foundation's 2005-2008 work programme is extremely useful for the Foundation."
"This exercise gives the Foundation helpful lessons and recommendations with regard to the challenges facing its future programming phase."
"I agree with the rapporteur that the Foundation must further develop its Eurofound Performance Monitoring System to ensure that the results of its performance monitoring are fed back into management decision-making and planning."
"I also believe that the Foundation must take steps to improve its evaluation and review procedure in the area of procurement to avoid future repetition of the assessment errors and inconsistencies identified by the Court of Auditors."
"Furthermore, the Foundation must make sure that funds are only used when appropriations are approved."
"I voted in favour of granting discharge in respect of the 2009 budget of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions because the audit conducted by the Court of Auditors on the accounts and the underlying transactions shows that the Foundation has done correct, timely and transparent work."
"Notwithstanding some weaknesses in recruitment and procurement procedures, I remain steadfast in my belief that there are good prospects for future improvement and that the Foundation is committed to putting them into action."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of the report on discharge of the budget of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound) for the financial year 2009, since it contributes to scrutiny of how funds are used by the European institutions."
"Although the Court of Auditors has declared the activities in relation to its annual accounts legal and regular, it should be highlighted that there were major gaps in the first accounts submitted by Eurofound."
"In future, Eurofound should correctly implement year-end procedures, and respect the deadlines for submitting its accounts, by means of additional training and resources."
"in writing. - (PT) The European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound) is a tripartite Union body, set up in 1975 with the aim of contributing to planning and establishing better working and living conditions in Europe."
"More specifically, it assesses and analyses working and living conditions, it gives authorised opinions and advice to key actors in the field of EU social policy, it contributes to improving quality of life, and it provides information on developments and trends, especially those that bring about changes."
"The rapporteur was concerned about the transparency of Eurofound's human resources management, and these concerns were echoed by the other members of the Committee on Budgets."
"I think there would be advantage in those concerns being dispelled."
"I endorsed this document, because the Committee responsible decided to approve the closure of the accounts of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions for the financial year 2009."
"The Foundation's budget for the year 2009 was EUR 20 200 000, which is a decrease of 3.8% from the financial year 2008."
"However, the Court of Auditors revealed errors and anomalies in the evaluation of one open procurement procedure which affected its quality."
"The Foundation must therefore take steps to improve its evaluation and review procedure to avoid the repetition of such errors in the future."
"It is regrettable that the Court of Auditors was compelled to comment on the budgetary and financial statement of the Foundation, especially to the effect that the initial provisional accounts presented by the Foundation contained serious shortcomings, pointing to significant weaknesses in the financial organisation of the Foundation."
"I believe that the observations made and concern expressed must be taken into account and appropriate action taken."
"Both the Court of Auditors and the Committee on Budgetary Control issued a positive opinion on the implementation of the budget of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions for the financial year 2009."
"For these reasons, Parliament today voted to grant discharge for the financial year 2009."
"However, I feel it is important to highlight the presence of some errors and anomalies that the Court of Auditors revealed in its evaluation of one open procurement procedure, which affected its quality."
"I therefore add my voice to the call for the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions to take steps to improve its evaluation and review procedure."
"in writing. - I voted to give discharge to European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working conditions but call on the Foundation to make sure that appropriations are made available only when the corresponding assigned revenue has been received; notes, in fact, that the Court of Auditors reported that, contrary to its Financial Regulation (Article 19), the Foundation's budget did not provide for specific headings for various programmes financed from assigned revenue; notes, moreover, that under a programme financed by assigned revenue, the Foundation committed EUR 184 000, although the assigned revenue actually received was only EUR 29 000."
"I regret that the Court of Auditors was compelled to comment on the budgetary and financial statement of the Foundation, especially to the effect that the initial provisional accounts presented by the Foundation contained serious shortcomings, pointing to significant weaknesses in the financial organisation of the Foundation; welcomes the Foundation's confirmation that it will ensure, through additional training and resources, that its implementation of year-end procedures and its adherence to the deadlines for the presentation of its accounts is correct"
"in writing. - This grants the Director of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions discharge in respect of the implementation of the Foundation's budget for the financial year 2009."
"Through today's resolution Parliament grants the Director of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions discharge in respect of the implementation of the Foundation's budget for the financial year 2009."
"Parliament notes that the Court of Auditors revealed errors and anomalies in the evaluation of one open procurement procedure which affected its quality."
"Parliament therefore calls on the Foundation to take steps to improve its evaluation and review procedure to avoid repetition of such errors in the future."
"in writing. - (DE) I abstained from voting on this discharge."
"The report lists a series of deficiencies, but at the same time it refers to assurances by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions that it will effectively remedy these."
"While this is to be welcomed, in view of the quality of the deficiencies (shortcomings in recruitment procedures were found as far back as 2006, the provisional accounts submitted to the European Court of Auditors contained serious errors resulting from weaknesses in the financial organisation) it is not possible to vote in favour of discharge."
"Qualified personnel should subject the Foundation in Dublin to a detailed audit, and we should vote on discharge only after the necessary changes resulting from this have been made."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this report and endorsed discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of Eurojust for the financial year 2009."
"According to information provided by the Court of Auditors, Eurojust's annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable and the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"I welcome the Agency's initiative to include Key Performance Indicators in its 2010 unit plans."
"I agree with the rapporteur that the Agency must inform the European Parliament on these key indicators and their links to Eurojust's objectives, budget and work programme."
"Linking indicators to the objectives, budget and work programme of the Agency will allow stakeholders to evaluate Eurojust's performance better."
"It is noted that the Court of Auditors did not comment on the level of carryovers and cancellations of appropriations in 2009."
"I congratulate the Agency on establishing measures to estimate the market value of relevant products and services before commencing a procurement procedure."
"I voted in favour of granting 2009 discharge to Eurojust since, as the report shows, it has managed its resources extremely well and, by using many indicators to explain its financial situation, has also done so extremely transparently."
"I do however regret the continued requests that the Court of Auditors has had to make regarding public procurement and recruitment procedures, which have still not received an adequate response or solution."
"in writing. - (PT) Eurojust is a European Union body which helps researchers and the representatives of public prosecutors across the EU work together in the fight against cross-border criminal activity."
"It plays a key role in the exchange of information and in extradition processes."
"The particular importance and sensitivity of these issues makes it necessary that Eurojust have means enabling it to pursue them effectively, although the necessary means are never enough, as is obvious when dealing with justice and crime fighting."
"Effective human resources management appears to be Eurojust's main problem."
"The fact that 24% of posts in Eurojust are vacant and various management positions are occupied by ineffective personnel gives rise to fears about the continuity and efficient pursuit of Eurojust's activities."
"in writing. - (LT) I abstained from the vote on this document, although the Committee responsible decided to approve the closure of the accounts of Eurojust for the financial year 2009."
"The Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"I abstained because the Court of Auditors again found deficiencies in procurement procedures, as in the previous three years."
"The Court of Auditors has once again also noted shortcomings in the planning and implementation of recruitment procedures, while the subsidy to the Agency in 2009 was 6.4% more than in 2008."
"Financial control on implementing the European Union budget takes place on three levels: internal control, within each institution; external control, carried out by the European Court of Auditors; and a discharge procedure carried out by Parliament."
"Today's vote sees Eurojust granted discharge in respect of the implementation of its budget for the financial year 2009."
"I voted in favour because, following audits carried out by the Court of Auditors and the Committee on Budgetary Control, the Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"in writing. - I voted to give discharge to Eurojust and congratulate the agency for establishing measures to estimate the market value of relevant products/services before commencing a procurement procedure."
"I consider this initiative an important practice to be followed by other agencies."
"I welcome, in addition, the agency's annual procurement plan for 2009 which greatly helped Eurojust's units and services in the management of their tenders."
"I consider that these initiatives improve the authorising officer's guidance and control."
"in writing. - This grants the Administrative Director of Eurojust discharge in respect of the implementation of Eurojust's budget for the financial year 2009."
"Through today's resolution Parliament grants the Administrative Director of Eurojust discharge in respect of the implementation of Eurojust's budget for the financial year 2009."
"Parliament notes with satisfaction that the Court of Auditors does not comment on the level of carryovers and cancellations of appropriations in 2009 and that the discharge for the implementation of the budget for the Agency should be further based on its performance throughout the year."
"in writing. - (DE) I did not vote in favour of the discharge."
"This was mainly because, according to the report, just four of the 26 recommendations made by the Internal Audit Service in 2008 have been implemented and the implementation of 15 of the other recommendations is already more than 12 months overdue."
"This circumstance must be remedied immediately before any further discharge can be granted."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this document and endorsed discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (FRONTEX) for the financial year 2009."
"The Court of Auditors reported that the Agency's annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"In June 2009, the Management Board of the Agency adopted a multiannual plan for the period 2010-2013, which will enable the Agency to plan its activities and risk-assess them more effectively."
"I welcome the Agency's initiative of launching, in 2009, the so-called Frontex Performance Management System to better inform the Agency's Governing Board by providing it with data on the impact of the Agency operations."
"I also agree with the rapporteur that it is necessary for the Agency to improve its financial management with regard to the reimbursement of costs incurred by Member States by identifying, with those Member States, deficiencies and difficulties so as to implement, together, the appropriate solutions."
"I voted in favour of granting 2009 discharge to the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (Frontex) because, as the report states, its accounts and transactions, taken as a whole, are shown in the analysis to be positive, regular and legal."
"However, I must agree with the report where it states that due to a number of inconsistencies, procedures lacking transparency and carryovers revealed in the budget, the Agency should improve its financial management."
"in writing. - (PT) The duties of the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (Frontex) are to support Member States in the training of border guards, including the establishment of common training guidelines; to carry out risk analysis; to monitor the development of relevant research on the subject of controlling and observation of external borders; to support the Member States in any circumstances requiring increased operational and technical assistance at external borders; and to provide the Member States with the necessary support in the area of mass return operations."
"The increasing migration pressure on the Union's borders and the need for coordination between Member States amply justifies Frontex being equipped with sufficient means for carrying out the duties with which it has been entrusted."
"However, I share the rapporteur's concerns about the 27% overstatement of the pre-financing costs to border authorities highlighted by the Court of Auditors and the advances made in excess."
"in writing. - (LT) I abstained from the vote on this document, although the Committee responsible decided to approve the closure of the accounts of the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (FRONTEX) for the financial year 2009."
"The Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"I abstained because the European Parliament is concerned that the Court of Auditors has reported carry-overs which were already reported in its 2006, 2007 and 2008 annual reports, and regrets, in particular, the high level of carry-overs and cancellations since 2006."
"The Court of Auditors also reported, for the second year running, that the Agency paid out amounts on the basis of unilateral grant decisions signed by the Agency, while the rules in force make no provision for this type of instrument."
"The Court of Auditors reported the overstatement by 27 % of the costs for pre-financing to border authorities in the 8 cases audited."
"For the activities which ended in 2009, more than 40 recovery orders had to be issued to recover advances made in excess."
"The Agency's budget for the year 2009 was nearly 28% greater than the previous year."
"I believe that the observations made and concern expressed must be taken into account and appropriate action taken."
"Financial control on implementing the European Union budget takes place on three levels: internal control, within each institution; external control, carried out by the European Court of Auditors; and a discharge procedure carried out by Parliament."
"I voted in favour of granting discharge in respect of the implementation of Frontex's budget for the financial year 2009 because the audits carried out by the Court of Auditors and the Committee on Budgetary Control showed that the Agency's transactions were all perfectly legal and regular."
"in writing. - I voted to give discharge to Frontex, but observe that the Court of Auditors reported, for the second year running, that the agency paid out amounts on the basis of unilateral grant decisions signed by the agency, while the rules in force make no provision for this type of instrument."
"I note that the amount paid out was more than EUR 28 000 000 in 2009, and was EUR 17 000 000 in 2008."
"I welcome, nevertheless, the agency's initiative, made in response to the Court's observation, of signing a framework Partnership Agreement with Member State border authorities."
"in writing. - This grants the Executive Director of the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union discharge in respect of the implementation of the Agency's budget for the financial year 2009."
"in writing. - (IT) Through today's resolution Parliament grants the Director of the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union discharge in respect of the implementation of the Agency's budget for the financial year 2009."
"Parliament underlines that the Court of Auditors has stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"Parliament calls on the Agency to improve its financial management with regard to the reimbursement of costs incurred by Member States by identifying, with those Member States, the roots of the problem so as to adopt shared solutions."
"Due to increased immigration flows, Frontex is required to play an active role in guarding the European borders."
"According to Frontex, 95% of illegal immigrants entering Europe enter via Greece."
"Deporting an illegal immigrant costs EUR 6 500 and, under Dublin II, the country of entry is responsible for their deportation."
"The Member States on the external borders of the EU are all under pressure from immigration and have turned into 'immigration camps' for Europe."
"We need to support Frontex both financially and operationally and make the external borders of the EU more secure."
"We also need a mechanism for allocating the overall number of immigrants between all Member States."
"The vote on this budget discharge definitively approves the increase in the expenditure of the European agency Frontex on its task of controlling our external borders."
"That significant increase in the budget between 2006 and 2009 was both necessary and legitimate."
"It corresponds to a need to strengthen coordination of the Member States in the fight against illegal immigration."
"As the symbol of EU migration policy, Frontex must ensure that its budget is spent on concrete measures to control migration flows."
"I welcome, in this connection, the launch of a performance management system to give the agency's operations greater visibility."
"The outcome-oriented system helps to compare operations over time and hence to evaluate them."
"This 'yes' vote is also, in my view, a strong political message from the European Parliament in favour of the European immigration policy developed under the French Presidency of the Union."
"A sovereign responsibility that previously fell to the Member States, border security is now handled at European level."
"This shared management of borders is an essential safeguard allowing for the full exercise of one of the EU's fundamental freedoms: the free movement of persons within the Schengen area."
"in writing. - (DE) I abstained from voting."
"The annual accounts for 2009 have been declared reliable on all essential points."
"Frontex also initiated new initiatives to analyse its measures, including their impact, and to improve the transparency and objectivity of staff selection."
"However, the European Court of Auditors found deficiencies again in 2009 that had already been highlighted every year since 2006."
"This repeated failure to address these deficiencies and successfully remedy them is unacceptable."
"in writing. - (LT) I endorsed this report and discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European GNSS Supervisory Authority for the financial year 2009."
"The Court of Auditors judged that the Authority's annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"I welcome the fact that most of the activities and assets related to the EGNOS and Galileo programmes were transferred to the Commission in December 2009."
"It is noted that the final budget for 2009 did not include information on the Authority's revenue."
"Irregularities were also found in staff selection procedures."
"The Agency must redress these deficiencies and inform the European Parliament as laid down."
"I voted in favour of granting discharge in respect of the 2009 budget of the European GNSS Supervisory Authority because it has been well managed in accounting terms and the figures provided are considered reliable."
"However, some irregularities remain in the field of human resources, particularly in terms of staff selection procedures, which are thought to lack transparency."
"I therefore hope that the aforementioned Authority will strive to make improvements in this area."
"in writing. - (PT) The duties of the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) Supervisory Authority are to oversee the management of public interest with regard to related European programmes and to act as their regulatory body."
"The competences of the Galileo joint venture, which came to an end on 31 December 2006, were transferred to it from 1 January 2007."
"Temporarily based in Brussels, the regulation provides for it undertaking, inter alia, the following duties, which are currently being revised: management of the contract with the operator charged with running the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS), inherited from the Galileo joint venture; coordination of action by Member States on the frequencies necessary for the system to operate; cooperation with the Commission on drawing up proposals in relation to the programme; modernisation of the system; management of all aspects in relation to the system's protection and safety; activities as European authority for GNSS safety approval; and management of the research activities necessary for developing and promoting European GNSS programmes."
"This list of competences denotes the importance conferred on the GNSS Supervisory Authority and reinforces the demands placed on it to keep its activities and spending within the assigned budget, and to keep to the rules governing the budget's implementation."
"in writing. - (LT) I abstained from the vote on this document, although the Committee responsible decided to approve the closure of the accounts of the European GNSS Supervisory Authority for the financial year 2009."
"The Authority's budget for the year 2009 was EUR 44 400 000, which is a decrease of 64% from the financial year 2008."
"I abstained because Parliament regrets the deficiencies in staff selection procedures, which put at risk the transparency of these procedures."
"It is necessary to make procedures more transparent, so that in future uncertainty as regards the activities of this Authority can be eliminated."
"Through today's vote Parliament has granted the Executive Director of the European GNSS Supervisory Authority discharge in respect of the implementation of the Authority's budget for the financial year 2009."
"I voted in favour on the basis of the evaluations and reports completed by the Court of Auditors and the Committee for Budgetary Control, which declared that they have obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"in writing. - I voted to give discharge to the European GNSS Supervisory Authority because the Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"in writing. - This grants the Executive Director of the European GNSS Supervisory Authority discharge in respect of the implementation of the Authority's budget for the financial year 2009."
"Through today's resolution Parliament grants the Executive Director of the European GNSS Supervisory Authority discharge in respect of the implementation of the Authority's budget for the financial year 2009."
"Parliament stresses deficiencies in staff selection procedures, which often put the transparency of these procedures at risk."
"Parliament notes also that the final budget published by the Authority on 31 March 2010 did not reflect the final budget for 2009 approved by the Administrative Board and did not include its revenue."
"Parliament therefore urges the Authority to remedy the situation and inform the discharge authority of the change."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this document and discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the Artemis Joint Undertaking for the financial year 2009."
"According to information provided by the Court of Auditors, the Joint Undertaking's annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable and the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"The Joint Undertaking is in a start-up phase and had not yet fully established its internal control and financial reporting systems by the end of 2009."
"The introduction of these systems needs to be successfully completed as a matter of urgency."
"In 2009 the Joint Undertaking's utilisation rates for commitment and payment appropriations were 81% and 20% respectively."
"I agree with the rapporteur that the Joint Undertaking is still in a start-up period and therefore understand the relatively low utilisation rate for payment appropriations."
"I also feel that, in view of the size of its budget and the complexity of its tasks, the Joint Undertaking should consider establishing an audit committee, reporting directly to the governing board."
"I voted in favour of granting 2009 discharge to the Artemis Joint Undertaking because it has managed its finances extremely well for an agency which is still in the start-up period."
"I therefore think that improvements can be made in the future and that the inconsistencies reported in the accounts for this financial year can be corrected."
"in writing. - (PT) The Artemis Joint Undertaking will implement a common technological initiative (CTI) in the area of incorporated information technology systems."
"This public-private partnership is essentially aimed at supporting the cofinancing of research initiatives at European level, as well as improving cooperation between the various operators in the sector."
"As the rapporteur rightly points out, it was created with a view to defining and implementing a 'research agenda' for the development of key technologies for embedded computing systems across different application areas in order to strengthen European competitiveness and sustainability, and allow the emergence of new markets and societal applications."
"The company is still in its infancy, allowing us great expectations in relation to its future achievements, and for the hope that it will do to the investment being made justice."
"in writing. - (LT) I endorsed this document, because the Committee responsible decided to approve the closure of the accounts of the Artemis Joint Undertaking for the financial year 2009."
"The Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"The Joint Undertaking final 2009 budget included commitment appropriations of EUR 46 000 000 and payment appropriations of EUR 8 000 000, and the utilisation rates for commitment and payment appropriations were 81% and 20% respectively."
"I believe that the Joint Undertaking is still in a start-up period and therefore understand the relatively low utilisation rate for payment appropriations."
"Both the Court of Auditors and the Committee on Budgetary Control issued a positive opinion on the implementation of the budget of the Artemis Joint Undertaking for the financial year 2009."
"For these reasons, Parliament today voted to grant discharge for the financial year 2009."
"The audits carried out showed that the accounts of the Joint Undertaking were reliable and that the underlying transactions were legal and regular."
"I do however think it would be helpful if the Joint Undertaking heeded the call for it to improve its documentation of IT processes and activities and the mapping of IT risks, and also to develop a business continuity plan and a data protection policy."
"in writing. - I voted to grant discharge to the Artemis Joint Undertaking but I believe that, in view of the size of its budget and the complexity of its tasks, the Joint Undertaking should consider establishing an audit committee reporting directly to the governing board."
"in writing. - This grants the Executive Director of the Artemis Joint Undertaking discharge in respect of the implementation of the Joint Undertaking's budget for the financial year 2009."
"in writing. - (IT) Through today's resolution Parliament grants the Executive Director of the Artemis Joint Undertaking discharge in respect of the implementation of the Joint Undertaking's budget for the financial year 2009."
"Parliament underlines that the Joint Undertaking was set up in December 2007 to define and implement a 'Research Agenda' for the development of key technologies for embedded computing systems across different application areas in order to strengthen European competitiveness and sustainability, and allow the emergence of new markets and societal applications."
"in writing. - (LT) I endorsed this report and discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the Clean Sky Joint Undertaking for the financial year 2009."
"According to information provided by the Court of Auditors, the Joint Undertaking's annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable and the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"The Joint Undertaking is in a start-up phase and had not yet fully established its internal control and financial reporting systems by the end of 2009."
"The introduction of these systems needs to be completed."
"I agree with the rapporteur's opinion that, in view of the size of its budget and the complexity of its tasks, the Joint Undertaking should consider establishing an audit committee, reporting directly to the governing board."
"I also believe that the Joint Undertaking must further develop provisions on membership and cofinancing."
"I hope that in future the Clean Sky Joint Undertaking will accelerate the development, validation and demonstration of clean air transport technologies in the EU, so that these can be deployed at the earliest opportunity."
"in writing. - (BG) I have a few comments to make about the operation of the Clean Sky Joint Undertaking, which is why I am not supporting the discharge in respect of the implementation of its budget for the financial year 2009."
"First of all, ever since the Joint Undertaking was set up in 2007, no agreement has been signed yet with Belgium concerning office accommodation, privileges and immunities and other support."
"How can a company operate properly without these basic needs being guaranteed?"
"It comes as no surprise that the research activities pre-financed in 2008 were not fully implemented during 2009 and that only 65% of the pre-financing was used."
"However, what concerns me the most is that the Joint Undertaking had not yet fully established its internal control and financial reporting systems, which jeopardises transparency in the spending of money coming from European taxpayers."
"I voted in favour of granting discharge in respect of the 2009 budget of the Clean Sky Joint Undertaking because, despite a number of irregularities in the Undertaking's budget, I think that we can be confident of future improvements in its auditing performance since it is still in the start-up phase."
"in writing. - (PT) The creation of the Clean Sky Joint Undertaking is due to the need to promote the development, validation and demonstration of clean air transport technologies in the EU, to be implemented as soon as possible."
"As with the Artemis Joint Undertaking, it is only just starting out."
"This does not mean that there are not already procedures and practices in need of correction, in particular in areas concerning budgetary structure, as is rightly highlighted by the rapporteur."
"in writing. - (LT) I endorsed this document, because the Committee responsible decided to approve the closure of the accounts of the Clean Sky Joint Undertaking for the financial year 2009."
"The Clean Sky Joint Undertaking was set up in December 2007 to accelerate the development, validation and demonstration of clean air transport technologies in the EU, so that these can be deployed at the earliest opportunity."
"The Joint Undertaking is in a start-up phase and had not yet fully established its internal control and financial reporting systems by the end of 2009."
"The Joint Undertaking final 2009 budget included commitment appropriations of EUR 91 000 000 and payment appropriations of EUR 60 000 000, and the utilisation rates for commitment and payment appropriations were 98% and 1% respectively."
"I believe that the Joint Undertaking is still in a start-up period and therefore understand the relatively low utilisation rate for payment appropriations."
"Both the Court of Auditors and the Committee on Budgetary Control have issued a positive opinion on the implementation of the budget of the Clean Sky Joint Undertaking for the financial year 2009."
"For these reasons, Parliament today voted to grant discharge for the financial year 2009."
"The audits carried out showed that the budget of the Joint Venture was reliable and that the underlying transactions were legal and regular."
"I do however think it would be helpful if the Joint Undertaking heeded the call for it to complete the implementation of its internal controls and financial information system, above all in view of the size of its budget and the complexity of its tasks."
"Mr President, I voted in favour of granting discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the Clean Sky Joint Undertaking for the financial year 2009."
"I am aware that the Joint Undertaking is still in a start-up period."
"Unfortunately, there have been many delays in the projects at this stage, with 65% of pre-financing having been used."
"In addition, no decisions have yet been taken regarding the headquarters in Belgium, which makes it significantly more difficult for the Clean Sky Joint Undertaking to function efficiently."
"in writing. - I voted to grant discharge to the Clean Sky Joint Undertaking."
"I recognise that the Joint Undertaking is still in a start-up period."
"I am concerned, nevertheless, that the research activities pre-financed by the Commission in 2008 on behalf of the Joint Undertaking were not fully implemented during 2009 and that, as a result of delays in the projects, only EUR 8 700 000 or 65 % of the EUR 13 600 000 pre-financing was used."
"I am particularly concerned that the adoption, structure and presentation of the approved budget of the Joint Undertaking for 2009 were not in line with Regulation (EC) No 71/2008 setting up the Clean Sky Joint Undertaking, or with the Financial Rules of the Joint Undertaking."
"I therefore urge the Joint Undertaking to rapidly remedy this grave deficiency."
"in writing. - This grants the Executive Director of the Clean Sky Joint Undertaking discharge in respect of the implementation of the Joint Undertaking's budget for the financial year 2009."
"Through today's resolution Parliament grants the Executive Director of the Clean Sky Joint Undertaking discharge in respect of the implementation of its budget for the financial year 2009."
"Parliament is of the opinion that, in view of the size of its budget and the complexity of its tasks, the Joint Undertaking should establish an audit committee, reporting directly to the Governing Board."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this document and discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the Joint Undertaking for the implementation of the Joint Technology Initiative on Innovative Medicines for the financial year 2009."
"According to information provided by the Court of Auditors, the Joint Undertaking's annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable and the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"The Joint Undertaking is in a start-up phase and had not yet fully established its internal control and financial reporting systems by the end of 2009."
"The introduction of these systems needs to be completed."
"I agree with the rapporteur that the Joint Undertaking should further develop provisions on membership and cofinancing and complete the implementation of its internal controls and financial information system."
"I hope that in future the Innovative Medicines Initiative Joint Undertaking will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the drug development process and will help the pharmaceutical sector produce more effective and safer innovative medicines."
"in writing. - (BG) In my view, the Joint Undertaking for the implementation of the Joint Technology Initiative on Innovative Medicines ought to be completely financed by pharmaceutical companies or by its other members who have the biggest interest in the operation of this undertaking."
"For this reason, I do not support the discharge in respect of the implementation of this undertaking's budget for the financial year 2009."
"I voted in favour of granting 2009 discharge to the Joint Undertaking for the Implementation of the Joint Technology Initiative on Innovative Medicines because, as the report shows, the Court of Auditors has deemed the Undertaking's accounts and the underlying transactions to be reliable."
"I think, however, that even though it is to some extent justifiable as it is still in the start-up phase, the Undertaking should complete the implementation of its control systems and operate more carefully and transparently in the coming years."
"in writing. - (PT) The Joint Undertaking is aimed at the process of developing pharmaceuticals that are more effective and efficient, so that the pharmaceutical sector can produce innovative medicines that are safer and more effective."
"Therefore, the Joint Undertaking's objectives are to contribute to the delivery of the Seventh Framework Programme, and to supporting pharmaceutical research and development in Member States, and in countries associated with the Seventh Framework Programme."
"It encourages participation by small and medium-sized enterprises in its activities, and cooperation between the private sector and universities."
"It is still at the embryonic stage, so we cannot foresee clearly how its budgeting will be implemented in future."
"However, it should continue to finish off its internal control and information systems, in particular."
"in writing. - (LT) I endorsed this document, because the Committee responsible decided to approve the closure of the accounts of the Joint Undertaking for the implementation of the Joint Technology Initiative on Innovative Medicines for the financial year 2009."
"The Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"The Innovative Medicines Initiative Joint Undertaking was set up in February 2007 to significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the drug development process with the long-term aim of helping the pharmaceutical sector to produce more effective and safer innovative medicines."
"The Joint Undertaking is in a start-up phase and had not yet fully established its internal control and financial reporting systems by the end of 2009."
"At the same time, the Joint Undertaking final 2009 budget included commitment appropriations of EUR 82 000 000 and payment appropriations of EUR 82 000 000, and the utilisation rates for commitment and payment appropriations were 97% and 1% respectively."
"In view of the Court of Auditors' statement that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable, and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, I voted in favour of granting discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the Joint Undertaking for the Implementation of the Joint Technology Initiative on Innovative Medicines for the financial year 2009."
"As we know, every debate on discharge has its own particular context, and the context of today's debate is the economic and financial crisis, which has caused financial and budgetary problems for a number of Member States."
"Therefore, also in view of more effective controls, I join in the request made to the Joint Undertaking to include in its Financial Rules a specific reference to the powers of the Internal Audit Service of the Commission as its internal auditor."
"in writing. - I voted for discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the Joint Undertaking for the implementation of the Joint Technology Initiative on Innovative Medicines for the financial year 2009."
"I urge the Joint Undertaking to complete the implementation of its internal controls and financial information system as a matter of urgency."
"in writing. - This grants the Executive Director of the Joint Undertaking for the implementation of the Joint Technology Initiative on Innovative Medicines discharge in respect of the implementation of the Joint Undertaking's budget for the financial year 2009."
"in writing. - (IT) Through today's resolution Parliament grants Executive Director of the Joint Undertaking for the Implementation of the Joint Technology Initiative on Innovative Medicines discharge in respect of the implementation of its budget for the financial year 2009."
"Parliament calls on the Joint Technology Initiative to include in its Financial Rules a specific reference to the powers of the Internal Audit Service of the Commission as its internal auditor, on the basis of the provision set out in the framework Financial Regulation for Community bodies."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this report and discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the SESAR Joint Undertaking."
"According to information provided by the Court of Auditors, SESAR's annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable and the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"The Joint Undertaking is in a start-up phase and had not yet fully established its internal control and financial reporting systems by the end of 2009."
"The introduction of these systems needs to be completed."
"I agree with the rapporteur that the Joint Undertaking must begin to put in place an integrated management system, allowing costs to be allocated to specific work packages and funding sources of operational costs to be identified."
"Furthermore, it is important to set out the conditions under which unspent funds would be transferred to the following year."
"in writing. - (BG) The Joint Undertaking to develop the new generation European air traffic management system (SESAR) is an important initiative."
"However, at a time of financial crisis and difficulties in many Member States, I do not think that it is appropriate for us to be spending millions of euros in this manner."
"I voted in favour of granting 2009 discharge to the SESAR Joint Undertaking because that recently formed undertaking has convinced the Court of Auditors of its reliability."
"The effort that the institution is making to complete the implementation of its internal control systems is already well known, but I think further endeavours ought to be made in this area in order to guarantee the transparency and reliability of the accounts."
"in writing. - (PT) This Joint Undertaking aims to modernise the European air traffic management system, and it should bring together the Union's efforts towards research and development under the scope of the Single European Sky Air Traffic Management (ATM) Research (SESAR)."
"The safety of Europeans, who increasingly use the services of airlines, as well as of airline employees, necessitates a particular level of performance in seeking the best solutions for managing this type of traffic, as well as monitoring and comparing the methodologies already applied in the various Member States, with a view to everyone adopting the best practices and safe, economical and innovative solutions."
"As with other companies in their early life, SESAR has not yet completely put its internal controls or its financial information systems in full working order."
"It will need to do so as soon as possible."
"I endorsed this document, because the Committee responsible decided to approve the closure of the accounts of the SESAR Joint Undertaking for the financial year 2009."
"The Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"The Joint Undertaking final 2009 budget included commitment appropriations of EUR 325 000 000 and payment appropriations of EUR 157 000 000, and the utilisation rates for commitment and payment appropriations were 97.1% and 43.2% respectively."
"The Court of Auditors found that important steps were taken in 2009 to establish control systems, but expresses concern that an integrated tool to manage financial, budget and operational information was not in place at year-end."
"However, in response the Joint Undertaking stated that financial systems were ready and in place by May 2010."
"Cases where internal controls do not operate correctly must be eliminated."
"Notwithstanding a few gaps and irregularities revealed by the Court of Auditors during its analysis and assessment of the budget of the SESAR Joint Undertaking, I voted in favour of granting discharge for the financial year 2009."
"However, I think that, in order to avoid the same mistakes being made in future procedures, SESAR should complete and implement internal control systems and a financial information system which would allow for the most reliable and accurate assessment possible of the budgetary transactions for each financial year."
"in writing. - I voted for discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the SESAR Joint Undertaking for the financial year 2009."
"Nevertheless, I am concerned that an integrated management system - allowing costs to be allocated to specific work packages and funding sources for operational costs to be identified - was not in place by December 2009."
"in writing. - This grants the Executive Director of the SESAR Joint Undertaking discharge in respect of the implementation of the Joint Undertaking's budget for the financial year 2009."
"Through today's resolution Parliament grants the Executive Director of the SESAR Joint Undertaking discharge in respect of the implementation of its budget for the financial year 2009."
"Parliament welcomes the fact that the Court of Auditors found the Joint Undertaking's annual accounts for 2009 to be reliable and the underlying transactions to be, in all material respects, legal and regular."
"Responsibility for public statements made by MEPs lies, first and foremost, with the people who make them."
"Intervention from Parliament in terms of analysing the context, the occasion or whether the person who made the public statement was entitled to do so or not only happens in exceptional cases."
"However, this action is obligatory when the person who made the statement is held accountable for the content of the idea expressed."
"Such an exceptional case, which it was the European Parliament's duty to investigate, is that involving MEP Luigi de Magistris, summoned before the courts in his own country in connection with an interview given to an Italian newspaper as a member of a political party represented in European structures."
"Looking beyond making the statement or its implications in domestic policy terms, the right of an MEP to express himself or herself must be recognised as a freedom and therefore defended."
"Just like Luigi de Magistris, any other MEP enjoys immunity from any inquiry or detention resulting from opinions expressed or votes cast."
"In this respect, any attempt to prevent MEPs from expressing their opinions on matters of public interest cannot be approved in a democratic society."
"in writing. - (PT) This report is on the request for defence of the immunity and privileges of our fellow Member, Mr De Magistris, requested under the terms of Articles 8 and 9 of the Protocol on the Privileges and Immunities of the European Union, and Article 68 of the Constitution of the Italian Republic, as amended by Constitutional Law No 3 of 29 October 1993, because he was summoned before the Court of Benevento by a Member of this House, Mr Mastella, following an interview with an Italian newspaper."
"Taking into account established practice in this Parliament, considering that the legal proceedings are of a civil or administrative law nature, and mindful of the Opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs, I am voting in favour of waiving the parliamentary immunity of our fellow Member, Mr De Magistris."
"in writing. - (LT) I endorsed this report, because the Committee on Legal Affairs believes that in giving the interview in question, Mr Luigi de Magistris was acting in performance of his duties as a Member of the European Parliament and carrying out political activities by expressing his opinion on a matter of public interest to his constituents."
"Attempts to prevent Members of Parliament from expressing their opinions on matters of legitimate public interest and concern, and from criticising their political opponents, by bringing legal proceedings are unacceptable in a democratic society and represent a breach of Article 8 of the Protocol, which is intended to protect Members' freedom of expression when performing their duties in the interests of Parliament as an institution of the European Union."
"On the basis of the above considerations and pursuant to Article 6(3) of the Rules of Procedure, after considering the reasons for and against defending the Member's immunity, the Committee on Legal Affairs recommends that the European Parliament should defend the parliamentary immunity of Mr Luigi De Magistris."
"in writing. - I voted for this report because the committee responsible considers that, in giving the interview in question, Luigi de Magistris was acting in the performance of his duties as Member of the European Parliament and carrying out political activities by expressing his opinion on a matter of public interest to his constituents."
"To seek to prevent Members of Parliament from expressing their opinions on matters of legitimate public interest and concern and from criticising their political opponents by bringing legal proceedings is unacceptable in a democratic society and in breach of Article 8 of the Protocol, which is intended to protect Members' freedom of expression in the performance of their duties in the interests of Parliament as an institution of the European Union."
"in writing. - Mr de Magistris was summoned to court on charges of slander."
"In connection with this, he asked the European Parliament for protection of his parliamentary immunity and privileges."
"In line with the report, the Committee on Legal Affairs recommends that the European Parliament should protect the immunity of Mr de Magistris."
"I voted 'in favour'."
"Parliament has received a request to waive the parliamentary immunity of our fellow Member, Mr De Magistris, who has been summoned by the Court of Benevento, on behalf of Mr Mastella, Member of the European Parliament, in relation to an interview which Mr De Magistris gave to an Italian newspaper, on 31 October 2009."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs has made a statement on the issue, having adopted a report in which it was decided not to lift parliamentary immunity."
"In fact, it was thought Mr De Magistris was carrying out his duties as a Member of the European Parliament when he made his comments."
"According to the report, he was acting in performance of his duties as Member of the European Parliament and carrying out political activities by expressing his opinion on a matter of public interest to his constituents."
"I voted in favour because I advocate freedom of expression for Members when performing their duties, and in order to defend the interests of the European Parliament as an institution."
"However, I should add that I believe those with political responsibilities in general, including Members, should always tell the truth and use language respectful of their interlocutors, which does not always happen."
"in writing. - This is to defend the immunity of Mr de Magistris, as in giving the interview in question Mr de Magistris was acting in performance of his duties as an MEP and carrying out political activities by expressing his opinion on a matter of public interest to his constituents."
"in writing. - (BG) I defend the privileges and immunity of Bruno Gollnisch and I think that the persecution he is being subjected to is of a purely political nature."
"His immunity must be defended so that he can continue to carry out his duties as a fully-fledged Member of the European Parliament."
"In such cases, a vote is taken on defending an MEP's immunity during a part-session (naturally when he or she belongs to a large political group), which leads me to think that double standards are occasionally applied in the European Parliament, thereby sweeping away confidence in the entire institution."
"You know how committed I am to democratic values ..."
"Bruno Gollnisch, MEP and intellectual guru of the Front National, has requested the defence of his parliamentary immunity in connection with measures applied by the French authorities as part of a criminal investigation involving Mr Gollnisch in his role as President of the Front National in the Rhône-Alpes Regional Council and in which the International League against Racism and Anti-Semitism brought a claim for compensation in January 2009 for incitement to racial hatred."
"Article 8 of the chapter on law and procedure on the immunity of Members of the European Parliament stipulates that the latter shall not be subject to any form of inquiry, detention or legal proceedings in respect of opinions expressed or votes cast by them in the performance of their duties."
"Article 26(2) of the Constitution of the French Republic stipulates the same thing."
"At a time when the Front National is riding high in the French polls and when one may question that party's move into the mainstream (in both media and political terms), I am satisfied that the European Parliament will not defend Mr Gollnisch's parliamentary immunity and have called for it to be lifted so that the courts can do their job."
"This report is on the request for the defence of the privileges and immunity of our fellow Member, Mr Gollnisch."
"The request was made when the French police attempted to arrest him, in order to appear before the French judicial authorities in a case concerning the expression of political opinions."
"The case concerns an accusation of incitement to racial hatred made by the International League against Racism and Anti-Semitism (LICRA) following the publication of a press release on the site of the Front National Group in the Rhône-Alpes Regional Council, of which Mr Gollnisch was president."
"Taking into account established practice in this Parliament and the Opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs, I agree with the rapporteur's position and am voting in favour of waiving the parliamentary immunity of our fellow Member, Mr Gollnisch."
"in writing. - (LT) I endorsed this report, because Article 8 of the Protocol on the Privileges and Immunities of the European Union was not invoked by Bruno Gollnisch in his request for defence of immunity and it is not applicable in this case."
"In order to decide whether or not to defend parliamentary immunity, Parliament applies its own consistent principles."
"The Committee responsible has found no evidence of a sufficiently serious and precise suspicion that the case has been brought with the intention of causing political damage to the Member."
"Secondly, the case does not come within the scope of Bruno Gollnisch's political activities as member of the European Parliament."
"It concerns instead activities of a purely regional and local nature of Bruno Gollnisch as regional councillor for Rhône-Alpes, a mandate which is distinct from that of a Member of the European Parliament."
"Thirdly, Bruno Gollnisch has given an explanation of the publication of the incriminated press release by his political group in the Rhône-Alpes Regional Council, stating that it had been written by the Front National team in that region, including its head of communications."
"The application of parliamentary immunity to such a situation is considered to constitute an undue extension of those rules, which are intended to avoid any interference with the functioning and independence of Parliament."
"Finally, it is not for Parliament but for the competent judicial authorities to decide, whilst respecting all democratic guarantees, to what extent French law on incitement to racial hatred has been broken and what the judicial consequences might be."
"Having considered all the arguments, the Committee on Legal Affairs recommends that the European Parliament should waive the parliamentary immunity of Bruno Gollnisch."
"in writing. - After considering the reasons for and against defending the Member's parliamentary immunity, I agree with the recommendation of the Committee on Legal Affairs that Parliament should not defend the immunity of Bruno Gollnisch."
"Stigmatisation and incitement to hatred on the grounds of religious affiliations are considered offences in France and this situation is equivalent to flagrante delicto."
"Mr Gollnisch publicly took a stand in support of an outrageous press release."
"This press release equates Muslims with thugs."
"It talks about 'invasion and destruction of our cultural values by Islam'."
"Mr Gollnisch will be able to present his defence."
"Waiving his immunity allows this to happen."
"I am therefore voting against his request to protect his parliamentary immunity."
"Mr Gollnisch has requested that the European Parliament defend his parliamentary immunity in connection with measures which he claims restrict his freedom applied by the French authorities as part of the judicial investigation of an action and claim for compensation (plainte avec constitution de partie civile) brought by the International League Against Racism and Anti-Semitism on 26 January 2009 against an unnamed person for incitement to racial hatred."
"It was concluded that the case does not fall within the scope of Mr Gollnisch's political activities as Member of the European Parliament, concerning instead activities of a purely regional and local nature as a Rhône-Alpes regional councillor, a mandate to which Mr Gollnisch was elected by direct universal suffrage and which is distinct from that of Member of the European Parliament."
"There is no evidence in the investigation carried out of fumus persecutionis: in other words, the intention of causing political damage to the Member."
"I voted for this report, which decides not to defend Mr Gollnisch's privileges and immunity, leaving it to the competent judicial authorities to decide, whilst respecting all democratic guarantees, to what extent French law on incitement to racial hatred has been broken and what the judicial consequences might be."
"in writing. - The case concerned does not fall within the scope of Mr Gollnisch's political activities as an MEP but it relates to his purely regional and local capacity as Rhône-Alpes regional councillor."
"Thus we have decided not to defend the immunity."
"in writing. - (BG) I defend the privileges and immunity of Bruno Gollnisch and I think that the persecution he is being subjected to is of a purely political nature."
"His immunity must be defended so that he can continue to carry out his duties as a fully-fledged Member of the European Parliament."
"This is why I voted against the withdrawal of his immunity."
"in writing. - I voted against the removal of the Parliamentary immunity of Bruno Gollnisch because: 1."
"I believe in free speech and the words complained of were not incitements to violence and were not abusive or insulting."
"The comments were about the intolerance of Islamic regimes towards people deemed to be heretics."
"2."
"No debate was allowed before these most important votes (dealing with the fundamental rights of an MEP) were taken."
"3."
"The proposal to lift Bruno Gollnisch's immunity (and the eventual decision to lift it) were inconsistent with the proposal to allow the German MEP Elmar Brok to retain his immunity from prosecution for an (alleged) greed offence of tax evasion."
"It is clear that the prosecution is a vexatious one, by a private organisation, designed to deprive Mr. Gollnisch of his elected position and his good name."
"in writing. - (NL) The mere fact that a fellow member of ours who risks losing his parliamentary immunity has not been given the chance to defend himself in plenary is reason enough to vote against this report which argues for the abolition of such immunity."
"It is, moreover, outrageous and not in keeping with the nature that members of parliament should lose their immunity and be taken to court for expressing their opinions."
"If the European Parliament wants to be taken seriously by the voters in the future, then it must, unambiguously and without any compromise, stand up for the right of its own members and of all of Europe's citizens to freedom of expression."
"This report is on the request to waive the privileges and immunity of our fellow Member, Mr Gollnisch, submitted to the European Parliament by the Prosecutor at the Court of Appeal of Lyon concerning the investigation carried out as a result of an action and claim for compensation brought, on 26 January 2009, by the International League against Racism and Anti-Semitism (LICRA) regarding the publication of a press release on the site of the Front National Group in the Rhône-Alpes Regional Council, of which Mr Gollnisch was president."
"Taking into account established practice in this Parliament, given that the application for parliamentary immunity is misused in this case, and in the light of the Opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs, I agree with the rapporteur's position and am voting in favour of waiving the parliamentary immunity of our fellow Member, Mr Gollnisch."
"in writing. - I voted to oppose the removal of the Parliamentary immunity of Bruno Gollnisch because: 1."
"Free speech is a core value of our society and the cornerstone of our democracy."
"It should not be curtailed by political opponents."
"The comments attributed to Mr Gollnisch were not incitements to violence and were not abusive or insulting."
"The comments were about the intolerance of Islamist regimes towards Unbelievers."
"2."
"No debate was allowed before the votes on this issue, which affect the fundamental rights of an MEP."
"3."
"The proposal to lift Bruno Gollnisch's immunity (and the politically motivated decision to lift it) were inconsistent with the proposal to allow the German MEP Elmar Brok to retain his immunity from prosecution for an (alleged) greed offence of tax evasion."
"It is clear that the prosecution is a vexatious one, by a private organisation, designed to deprive Mr Gollnisch of his elected position and his good name."
"It is equally clear that, in the increasingly intolerant atmosphere of Political Correctness that is permeating the Parliament, some MEPs are more equal than others."
"I endorsed this document, because firstly, the Committee responsible has found no evidence of a sufficiently serious and precise suspicion that the case has been brought with the intention of causing political damage to the Member."
"Secondly, the case does not come within the scope of Bruno Gollnisch's political activities as a Member of the European Parliament."
"It concerns instead activities of a purely regional and local nature of Bruno Gollnisch as regional councillor for Rhône-Alpes, a mandate which is distinct from that of a Member of the European Parliament."
"Thirdly, Bruno Gollnisch has given an explanation of the publication of the incriminated press release by his political group in the Rhône-Alpes Regional Council."
"The application of parliamentary immunity to such a situation is considered to constitute an undue extension of those rules, which are intended to avoid any interference with the functioning and independence of Parliament."
"Finally, it is not for Parliament but for the competent judicial authorities to decide, whilst respecting all democratic guarantees, to what extent French law on incitement to racial hatred has been broken and what the judicial consequences might be."
"It is noted that by adopting a decision to waive the Member's immunity, the European Parliament is allowing the competent national authority to hold the person accountable (given that there is no interference with the functioning and independence of the institution) and by no means does this decision confirm the Member's guilt or express an opinion as to whether certain actions or views justify investigation."
"Having considered all the arguments, the Committee on Legal Affairs recommends that the European Parliament should waive the parliamentary immunity of Bruno Gollnisch."
"My long spell as a parliamentarian both in the French National Assembly and in the European Parliament (27 years) enables me to say that the attitude of the latter in lifting Mr Gollnisch's parliamentary immunity was particularly abhorrent."
"The MEP was not allowed to take the floor to defend himself before his fellow Members, who incidentally did not take the trouble to read up on the facts of the case."
"Had they done so, they would have learnt that Mr Gollnisch was only indirectly responsible in this affair and that it related to his freedom of political expression."
"To give lessons on democracy and respect for human rights is one thing; to respect them in one's own institution is quite another."
"Using a judicial procedure to try to prevent Members of Parliament from expressing their point of view on matters of legitimate public interest and concern and from criticising their political opponents is unacceptable in a democratic society and constitutes a breach of Article 8 of the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities of the European Union, which aims to protect its members' freedom of expression."
"I wholly support this concept."
"However, as far as Mr Rapkay is concerned it only applies to Mr De Magistris, who is being prosecuted for libel, and not to Bruno Gollnisch, who is being prosecuted for expressing political opinions."
"This is a case of double standards."
"How is it more in the public interest and more democratic for us to know what Mr De Magistris thinks of a fellow Member than for us to know what the Front National thinks about the riots in Romans or the dangers of mass immigration?"
"It is precisely because the opponents of Bruno Gollnisch did not like the press release in question, even though it is of greater public interest, that he is losing his immunity."
"Freedom of expression for this Parliament's elected representatives should not be a movable goalpost and should not depend on whether or not a person's face fits."
"It is unworthy of you to adopt this report."
"in writing. - I support the waiver of Bruno Gollnisch's immunity so that he can stand trial for the offence of incitement to racial hatred."
"Stigmatisation and incitement to hatred on the grounds of religious affiliations are considered offences in France and this situation is equivalent to flagrante delicto."
"Mr Gollnisch publicly took a stand in support of an outrageous press release."
"This press release equates Muslims with thugs."
"It talks about 'invasion and destruction of our cultural values by Islam'."
"Mr Gollnisch will be able to present his defence."
"Waiving his immunity allows this to happen."
"I am therefore voting against his request to protect his parliamentary immunity."
"I voted against the waiver of Bruno Gollnisch's immunity because the explanatory statement given by the Committee on Legal Affairs, which recommended the waiver to plenary, was entirely arbitrary."
"If Mr Gollnisch is charged over a press release written by the political office of the Front National, then of course this activity should be seen as falling within the scope of his EU mandate."
"The argument that this took place as part of his activities as a regional councillor is not decisive because the EU mandate cannot be seen as a part-time occupation or similar."
"Had Mr Gollnisch made the same statement in a part-session of the European Parliament or in one of his committees, would the same argument be being made?"
"The content of the press release serving as a basis for extradition is moreover 100% covered by freedom of expression."
"If politically unpopular statements are now to form a basis for extraditions then it shows once again what the European Parliament thinks of real democracy."
"This report is on the waiver of the parliamentary immunity of our fellow Member, Mr Gollnisch, at the request of a French public prosecutor, so that a complaint alleging incitement to racial hatred can be investigated and so that, if appropriate, Mr Gollnisch can be tried before the French Court of First Instance, Appeal Court and Court of Cassation."
"The waiver of Mr Gollnisch's immunity relates to an alleged offence of incitement to racial hatred as a result of a press release issued on 3 October 2008 by the Rhône-Alpes Region Front National Group, of which Mr Gollnisch was president, so these activities were of a purely regional and local nature as a Rhône-Alpes regional councillor, a mandate to which Mr Gollnisch was elected by direct universal suffrage and which is distinct from that of Member of the European Parliament."
"There is no evidence in the investigation carried out of fumus persecutionis: in other words, the intention of causing political damage to the Member."
"I voted for this report, which decides not to defend Mr Gollnisch's privileges and immunity, leaving it to the competent judicial authorities to decide, whilst respecting all democratic guarantees, to what extent French law on incitement to racial hatred has been broken and what the judicial consequences might be."
"in writing. - The case is identical to the previous one (see, but here the request for the waiver of immunity was forwarded by the French authorities."
"The Prespa Lakes basin (Prespa Park) is shared between Greece, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) and Albania."
"The first is a Member State of the European Union, the second is a candidate for EU accession and the third is a potential candidate for EU accession."
"Albania and the FYROM have concluded a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU, and the development of a sustainable economy and green infrastructure, which will naturally lead to job creation at local level, will create a significant potential for employment, thereby contributing to the realisation of the Europe 2020 Strategy."
"Furthermore, better use of resources, sustainable economic development and nature conservation can and must go hand-in-hand, and should likewise reinforce cooperation with neighbouring countries for their integration into Europe."
"For all of the aforementioned reasons, I am voting for this draft agreement."
"I am in favour of consenting to the European Union's participation in the Agreement on the Protection and Sustainable Development of the Prespa Park Area entered into by Greece, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Albania."
"I take this view because the park is a natural area of international importance, owing to its geomorphology, ecology, biodiversity and cultural significance."
"I also support the objectives and the principles outlined in the agreement, which are based on the sustainable use of natural resources, a focus on the conservation of ecosystems and biodiversity, and the prevention, control and reduction of water pollution in the Prespa Lakes."
"in writing. - (PT) I welcome the efforts made by Member States to work alongside non-EU countries to make resource use more sustainable."
"As such, I am voting to conclude the Agreement on the Protection and Sustainable Development of the Prespa Park Area, since I believe it is important for the development of the three countries that share it: Greece, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Albania."
"I also believe this park is important for the environment, for natural conservation and for a whole series of positive knock-on effects that could arise from this type of collaboration, not least the strengthening of good relations in the Balkans region."
"I welcome the conclusion of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Union, Albania and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), which aims to establish cooperation between all those sharing the Prespa Lakes basin, so as to ensure integrated protection of the ecosystem and the park's sustainable development."
"This agreement demonstrates the successful application of the Union's Water Framework Directive, to protect the environment, to raise the standard of living of the region's inhabitants and to lead to cooperation between the three countries: Greece, Albania and the FYROM."
"This will strengthen the spirit of good neighbourliness between the parties, in this particularly sensitive region of the Balkans."
"in writing. - (PT) This recommendation is on the draft Council decision concerning the conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of the Agreement on the Protection and Sustainable Development of the Prespa Park Area, which has been classified as such since 1977 and designated a protected cross-border area under the declaration of 2 February 2000, issued by the Prespa countries: Greece, Albania and the Republic of Macedonia."
"The European Union is aware of the urgent need to protect and safeguard natural resources, so, starting in the 1970s, it has adopted a legislative package, the ultimate expression of which is the 2000 Water Framework Directive."
"The objective of the agreement concerned is to establish cooperation between the EU and the above countries in order to promote the region's sustainable development and to protect its ecosystem, in particular through plans for the integrated management of the Prespa hydrographic basin."
"At a time when disasters resulting from climate change are increasing, I congratulate the Council on this project and would like to see it concluded as soon as possible."
"in writing. - (PT) The Prespa Lakes basin (Prespa Park) is shared between Greece, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Albania."
"It is extremely important to establish a living habitat for the conservation of many rare and/or endemic species of flora and fauna, also as a nesting place for birds threatened at global level, and as a place with a wealth of important cultural and heritage assets."
"The objective of the agreement is to establish cooperation in order to guarantee the integrated protection of the ecosystem and the sustainable development of the Prespa Park area, including the development of plans for the integrated management of the hydrographic basin."
"To this end, the countries involved in the agreement undertake to adopt the necessary measures, individually or in cooperation, in accordance with the principles of sovereign equality, territorial integrity, mutual benefit and good faith, with a view to the management of the waters of the Prespa, the prevention, control and reduction of pollution, the protection and conservation of the biodiversity, protection of the soil, the prudent use of natural resources and sustainable development."
"Therefore, we vote in favour of this report."
"in writing. - (PT) Prespa Park, or the Prespa hydrographic basin, shared between Greece, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Albania, is extremely important for establishing a living habitat for the conservation of numerous rare and/or endemic flora and fauna species, also as a nesting place for birds threatened at global level, and as a place with a wealth of important cultural and heritage assets."

"Therefore, we vote in favour of this report."
"in writing. - On February 2010, in the presence and with the participation of the European Union, Greece, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Albania signed the Agreement on the protection and sustainable development of the Prespa Park Area."
"The aim of this Agreement is to ensure the protection of Prespa Park Area and also a comprehensive ecosystem protection."
"Not only do lakes and their surroundings have ecological importance, but also this area is naturally unique due to its geomorphological, ecological, biodiversity and cultural significance."
"It is a vital habitat for the conservation of numerous rare fauna and flora species, as a nesting place of globally threatened birds, and as a depositary of significant archaeological and traditional heritage."
"It was therefore desirable to obtain the consent of Parliament to make sure that Agreement could be adopted."
"The Prespa area river basin on the borders between Greece, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Albania is an important natural area."
"The agreement to be signed by the European Union will contribute towards reaching some of the important objectives for protecting this area, defending the ecosystem and introducing the sustainable use of renewable energy."
"That it why I will vote in favour of the recommendation."
"in writing. - (LT) I endorsed this report, because the purpose of this agreement is to establish cooperation so as to ensure the integrated protection of the ecosystem and the sustainable development of the Prespa Park Area, including the drawing up of integrated river basin management plans, in accordance with international and EU standards."
"The Prespa Lakes Basin (Prespa Park Area) is shared between Greece, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Albania."
"The first is a Member State of the European Union, the second a candidate country for EU membership and the third a potential candidate country for EU membership."
"Albania and the FYROM have also concluded a Stabilisation and Association agreement with the EU."
"The Prespa Park Area is a natural area of international importance owing to its biodiversity and geomorphologic, ecological, and cultural significance."
"It is vitally important as a habitat for the conservation of numerous rare and/or endemic flora and fauna species, as a nesting place of globally threatened birds, and as a depositary of significant archaeological and traditional heritage."
"For these reasons, on 2 February 2010 these three countries signed the Agreement on the Protection and Sustainable Development of the Prespa Park Area, with the participation of the EU, which also requires the consent of the European Parliament."
"In order to attain this objective, the parties have committed themselves to taking the necessary measures and applying the best available techniques, individually and in cooperation, on the basis of sovereign equality, territorial integrity, mutual benefit and good faith."
"in writing. - I welcome this agreement on the protection and sustainable development of Prespa Park."
"The Prespa Park area is a natural area of international importance owing to its geomorphological, ecological, biodiversity and cultural significance."
"It is a vital habitat for the conservation of numerous rare and/or endemic fauna and flora species, as a nesting place of globally threatened birds, and as a depositary of significant archaeological and traditional heritage."
"This report is on the Prespa Lakes basin, whose geomorphological, ecological, biodiversity and cultural significance make it an internationally important natural space."
"It is a habitat vital to the conservation of numerous rare or endemic species of flora and fauna, as a nesting place for birds endangered at global level, and as a repository for valuable heritage in terms of archaeology and tradition."
"As such, an agreement is being concluded between Greece, Albania and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, which share this natural space, so as to establish cooperation on managing the waters of these lakes to prevent, control and reduce their pollution; to protect and conserve the area's biodiversity and protect its soil from erosion; to promote the sensible use of natural resources and sustainable development; to prevent the introduction of alien animal and plant species; and to regulate human activities with a negative impact on the area."
"I am convinced of the need to increase cooperation between the involved parties, always on the basis of respect for the principle of equality, of territorial integrity and of mutual benefit, so as to protect this area of exceptional value."
"I am therefore voting for this agreement."
"in writing. - (PT) The basis of this report is the draft decision of the Council relating to the signing of the agreement on the Protection and Sustainable Development of the Prespa Park Area; the Prespa hydrographic basin."
"The European Union has longstanding legislation protecting its waters, namely the 2000 Water Framework Directive, which establishes the objective of protecting all waters - rivers, lakes, ground-waters and coastal waters - and which, in the case of shared hydrographic basins extending beyond administrative and political borders, provides for the coordination of efforts in order to achieve this objective."
"The Prespa hydrographic basin is shared between Greece, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) and Albania."
"The FYROM is a candidate for EU accession and Albania is a potential candidate."
"It has therefore become necessary to establish an international agreement for pursuing the objectives of the Water Framework Directive, namely protecting biodiversity and the ecosystem services of this area."
"I voted in favour of this report, previously adopted unanimously by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety."
"in writing. - (PT) The Prespa hydrographic basin is shared between Greece, Albania and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia."
"As a source of biodiversity of undisputable ecological interest, and therefore also as a natural climate regulator, its protection is worthy of the efforts of the European Union in line with the Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC)."
"Pursuant to this directive, in the case of a hydrographic basin that extends beyond the territorial limits of the Union, it is necessary to implement coordination efforts between the countries involved and for this reason, on 2 February 2010 the Agreement on the Protection and Sustainable Development of the Prespa Park Area was concluded; the Commission was also involved, representing the EU."
"However, its final adoption by the Council requires the consent of the European Parliament."
"For the above reasons, I voted to adopt this agreement."
"in writing. - The Prespa Park area is a natural area of international importance owing to its geomorphological, ecological, biodiversity and cultural significance."
"It is a vital habitat for the conservation of numerous rare and/or endemic fauna and flora species, as a nesting place of globally threatened birds, and as a depositary of significant archaeological and traditional heritage."
"For these reasons, the three countries concerned signed the Agreement on the Protection and Sustainable Development of the Prespa Park Area on 2 February 2010, with the participation of the EU."
"The purpose of the agreement is to establish cooperation so as to ensure the integrated protection of the ecosystem and the sustainable development of the Prespa Park area, including the drawing up of integrated river basin management plans, in accordance with international and EU standards."
"Under Article 218(6)(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Council must secure the consent of the European Parliament in order to adopt the agreement."
"The European Union is equipped with long-standing legislation protecting its waters, of which the most important part is the Water Framework Directive."
"Under this legislation, where river basins extend beyond the territory of the Union, Member States shall endeavour to establish coordination with the non-Member States which share the river basin district."
"Where coordination takes the form of an international agreement, participation of the European Union as a Party is necessary to the extent that the agreement covers matters falling within the Union's competence."
"The Prespa Park Area is a natural area of international importance owing to its geomorphology, ecology, biodiversity and cultural significance."
"The text adopted today aims to establish cooperation so as to ensure the integrated protection of the ecosystem and the sustainable development of the Prespa Park Area, including the drawing up of integrated river basin management plans, in accordance with international and EU standards."
"The Agreement will contribute to the successful implementation of the Water Framework Directive, to protecting the environment, improving the living standards of local inhabitants and strengthening good neighbourly relations in a particularly sensitive area of the Balkans."
"in writing. - Last year the Commission and the other EU institutions reflected on the fact that we have not met our biodiversity targets."
"This is a deeply regrettable situation which must be changed, quickly and effectively, in order to protect biodiversity and the invaluable eco-services it provides us with."
"Cooperation with third countries is to be encouraged as much as possible, as this is also a global problem, so this agreement is to be warmly welcomed."
"in writing. - (PT) I am voting for Mrs Fraga Estévez's recommendation welcoming the European Commission's efforts toward the approval of the resolutions based on the Port State Measures Agreement by the Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs)."
"In the course of the plenary session of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) held in March 2010 in Busan. South Korea, a port state measures resolution tabled by the EU was adopted (resolution 2010/11)."
"Similar proposals were also tabled by the EU in other RFMOs, with a view to strengthening the port state measures they currently have in force and bringing them in line with the requirements of the agreement."
"Unfortunately, they could not be adopted in several cases owing to the opposition of a number of countries, such as some Latin American and small Pacific island countries."
"As advocated by the rapporteur, I too urge the European Commission to continue applying pressure to approve these proposals, as the measures provided for in the agreement will only be truly effective at combating illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing if and when they are applied in a comprehensive, uniform and transparent manner, in order to avoid loopholes that could be easily exploited by the IUU fishing operators."
"I supported the recommendation because the European Union must send out a strong message against illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing."
"The European Union is a major international player on issues regarding the management of fishing."
"As such it must lend its support to anything relating to the enforcement of international rules on infringements."
"Mrs Fraga Estévez has welcomed the efforts made by the European Commission for the adoption of resolutions based on the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation's Port State Measures Agreement."
"In committee, we strongly supported the idea of continuing to push for these proposals."
"Indeed, illegal fishing includes declared ships that fish for undersized species as well as fishing by unauthorised boats in protected areas or too close to coastlines."
"Unfortunately, illegal fishing accounts for some 60% of the products that arrive on our markets, and this causes uncertainties about their quality and makes them difficult to trace."
"This is why we believe that Europe should set an example to all other countries operating in this sector, which end up gaining an advantage on international markets because they do not have to respect any of the limits imposed on our fishermen."
"I voted for Mrs Fraga's recommendation on the draft Council decision on the approval of the Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing."
"I voted in favour because the content of the initiative will be a crucial contribution to the current global struggle against illegal fishing."
"Its content will be effective if it is comprehensively, uniformly and transparently applied."
"The shortage of fish stocks at global level and not, therefore, only in our own seas, is gradually becoming an urgent problem."
"We know that marine life is essential not only for a substantial part of the human diet, but also for the health of the entire ecosystem."
"It is therefore important that all levels of government - from the regions and central governments right up to the European Union - should do everything in their power to bring in regulatory measures and legislative instruments that will help protect fish stocks, which is the only guarantee of the long-term sustainability of fishing activities."
"I voted in favour of this parliamentary recommendation to the Council so that the Council may proceed, on behalf of the EU, to adopt the Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing."
"If implemented correctly by national bodies, this international agreement will be an important tool for ensuring the long-term protection of marine life and the sustainable exploitation of fish stocks."
"I voted for this report, because with it the European Parliament consented to the approval of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation Agreement, which would promote responsible exploitation of fishery resources and marine eco-systems."
"This agreement provides for specific instruments to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing in EU territorial waters more effectively."
"These instruments provide for minimum standards which should underpin the adoption of measures by States in order to monitor, control and inspect foreign-flagged fishing vessels wishing to use their harbours."
"The instruments in this agreement could be applied not only to fishing vessels, but also vessels used for fishing related activities, such as transport vessels which may be used to carry fisheries products."
"The fight against IUU fishing constitutes an essential component of the common fisheries policy and the EU should be able to foster international cooperation on this matter by participating actively and constructively in the adoption of an international instrument on port state measures."
"Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing is considered as one of the main threats to the resources of the fishing market where the European Union enjoys an important global position."
"In this case, devising a common EU-level fisheries policy, aimed at protecting the sustainable exploitation of living aquatic resources is an absolutely natural concern."
"The agreement being proposed to the Council for adoption has been drafted precisely to meet these international requirements on preventing, deterring and eliminating illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing through the implementation of effective measures by the state where the port is located."
"These are measures which, once the Agreement has been adopted, should go from being a voluntary model to a package of mandatory minimum standards for port states, with the aim of monitoring, controlling and inspecting foreign-flagged fishing vessels using their harbours."
"The fact that the set of measures whose implementation comes under the remit of the port states are produced, all the same, by an international instrument is a bonus."
"The global overview of this practice of IUU fishing can result in better monitoring of fishing activities overall."
"It is more cost-effective in terms of organisation and implementation."
"I voted in favour of the text presented by Mrs Fraga Estévez, to whom I should like to express my appreciation for the work carried out."
"Indeed, I believe that the European Union should use every instrument at its disposal to prevent and combat illegal trade while at the same time preserving the fishing market, which has always been a robust pillar of the common fisheries policy."
"It is therefore high time for stringent rules to be adopted and, above all, respected."
"Ships that do not observe European and international rules on fishing should be banned and greater information on all ships that request access to ports should be guaranteed."
"Let us not forget that Europe - which is ranked third among the world's fishing powers - has been working for years to ensure that Member States and third countries respect the rules, in order to guarantee a sustainable fishing market and protect the marine environment from possible damage."
"in writing. - (PT) I agree with the draft Council decision on the approval, on behalf of the European Union, of the Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing."
"I believe that the effectiveness of such measures is essential to guaranteeing the conservation and sustainability of marine ecosystems, and therefore to the exploitation of the seas and corresponding industries."
"To guarantee this effectiveness, it is necessary for these measures to be applied harmoniously by the Member States by controlling the unloading of boats, transhipments and other operations performed at their ports."
"Therefore, I wish to emphasise the importance of the point proposed relating to the information-sharing mechanism, which must underpin this agreement."
"in writing. - (PT) Illegal fishing is a phenomenon that endangers all the measures that the international community and the European Union in particular have taken to allow robust and dynamic fishing activity to be balanced with the necessary replenishment of fish stocks."
"In 2007, the Committee for Fisheries of the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) agreed to draw up a legally binding international instrument on port state measures to deter illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing."
"Later, in 2009 an agreement was adopted in Rome, and the intention now is to approve it on behalf of the EU."
"In view of the importance of this issue, particularly for a maritime nation such as Portugal, I am voting to approve this agreement."
"In 2001, the United Nations Organisation for Food and Agriculture (FAO) created an International Plan of Action to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing (IPOA-IUU)."
"In 2005, the FAO approved a series of measures that port states for fishing or fish-transportation vessels must adopt to combat illegal fishing."
"The preservation of natural resources, particularly marine resources, is a constant concern of the European Union, which seeks to prevent illegal fishing with all the means at its disposal."
"It has therefore closely followed all the measures approved by the FAO, playing an active and constructive role, not least in drawing up the agreement adopted at the 36th session of the FAO Conference held in Rome 18-23 November 2009."
"I agree with the position adopted by the rapporteur with regard to urging the European Commission, not only to conclude the present agreement, but also to continue to apply pressure to international agencies, particularly the FAO, with a view to the approval of the envisaged measures."
"This agreement was approved at the 36th session of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) Conference held in Rome in November 2009, rounding off a debate process that had been preceded by a set of other agreements and codes of conduct adopted over the last two decades under the umbrella of the FAO."
"Illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing constitutes a global threat to the sustainable exploitation of live aquatic resources."
"Therefore, the fight against IUU fishing must be a central concern of any fisheries policy, as well as an essential element of international fisheries management of at the competent forums."
"The objective of this agreement is to prevent, deter and eliminate IUU fishing through the use of effective port state measures, thereby guaranteeing the long-term conservation and sustainable use of living marine resources and marine ecosystems."
"Experience proves the good cost-effective relationship and the crucial role played by port state measures, in conjunction with other instruments, in the fight against IUU fishing."
"This agreement also supports an expanded definition of IUU fishing, in order to include a wide range of unregulated fishing operations."
"Therefore, we voted in favour of this report."
"This agreement was approved at the 36th session of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) Conference held in Rome in November 2009, rounding off a debate process that had been preceded by a set of other agreements and codes of conduct adopted over the last two decades under the umbrella of the FAO."
"Illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing constitutes a global threat to the sustainable exploitation of live aquatic resources."
"Therefore, the fight against IUU fishing must be a central concern of any fisheries policy, as well as an essential element of international fisheries management of at the competent forums."
"The objective of this agreement is to prevent, deter and eliminate IUU fishing through the use of effective port state measures, thereby guaranteeing the long-term conservation and sustainable use of living marine resources and marine ecosystems."
"Experience proves the good cost-effective relationship and the crucial role played by port state measures, in conjunction with other instruments, in the fight against IUU fishing."
"Therefore, we voted in favour of this report."
"in writing. - In November 2009, the FAO Conference approved the Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing that may help to minimize this type of fishing and ensure the long-term conservation and sustainable use of living marine resources and marine ecosystems, as well."
"As the European Union is one of the main representatives of international fisheries and one of the main global markets for fishery products, it is suitable and appropriate to promote the adoption of such proposals by the European institutions, too."
"The aim of the FAO Conference, to which this decision relates, is to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing through effective port state measures."
"Basically, 'port state measures' means those measures that coastal states may apply to vessels that are not allowed to fly their flags in port or are seeking permission to enter a port."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this document, because the objective of the agreement is to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing through the implementation of effective port state measures, thereby ensuring the long-term conservation and sustainable use of living marine resources and marine ecosystems."
"The agreement will be applied by parties, in their capacities as port states, for vessels not entitled to fly their flags, while seeking entry to ports or while they are in port."
"It covers not only fishing vessels, but also vessels used for fishing related activities, such as transport vessels which may be used to carry fisheries products."
"It also endorses a broad definition of IUU fishing, so as to include a wide range of unregulated fishing operations."
"The annexes, as an integral part of the agreement, specify the information to be provided in advance by vessels seeking entry to the parties' ports as well as guidelines for inspection procedures, the handling of inspection results, information systems and training requirements."
"Parties should cooperate to establish an information-sharing mechanism, preferably coordinated by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), in conjunction with other relevant multilateral and intergovernmental initiatives, and to facilitate the exchange of information with existing databases relevant to the agreement."
"According to scientific forecasts, by the mid-21st century it will become normal for Earth's seas and oceans to be empty, as a result of our unwise management of the natural resources of fish and seafood."
"In spite of the restrictions and bans which have been introduced, much illegal fishing goes on, or even fishing that can be considered pillaging."
"It is therefore necessary to step up monitoring, in order to prevent the destruction of aquatic ecosystems, and a subsequent ecological disaster."
"A rational fisheries policy is particularly important in view of the food crisis, which is a threat we are facing at the same time as the human population is growing."
"As the largest market for such products, the European Union should therefore support measures aimed at preventing violations of fisheries legislation."
"in writing. - I welcome this agreement, the objective of which is to prevent, deter and eliminate IUU fishing through the implementation of effective port State measures, thereby ensuring the long-term conservation and sustainable use of living marine resources and marine ecosystems."
"I voted for this report on the Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing, because I believe that this type of fishing implies a serious global threat to living aquatic resources."
"The market is insatiable and exhausts natural resources."
"We must curb industrial, pillaging fishing techniques."
"The exhaustion of fisheries resources is an environmental problem, but also a social one."
"I therefore welcome this positive report on the agreement adopted by the 36th session of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) Conference, which brings to a close a long period of debate that had already led to the adoption of a number of codes of conduct."
"I believe that combating illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing must be a key element of any fisheries policy worthy of the name."
"I am therefore voting for this report on an agreement whose established goals are to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal fishing by applying effective measures in the port state and, in this way, to enable long-term conservation, and the rational and sustainable exploitation of marine ecosystems."
"in writing. - I know that the objective of the Agreement is to prevent, deter and eliminate IUU fishing through the implementation of effective port state measures, thereby ensuring the long-term conservation and sustainable use of living marine resources and marine ecosystems."
"As of 31 January 2011, 23 FAO Members had signed the Agreement and two instruments of accession had been deposited."
"As the European Union is a major player in international fisheries and one of the main global markets for fishery products, the rapporteur proposes that Parliament gives its consent to the conclusion of the Agreement and firmly supports and encourages the European Commission to continue to push for the adoption of these proposals."
"I voted 'in favour'."
"The objective of the agreement concerned is to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, undeclared and unregulated (IUU) fishing through the use of effective port state measures, thereby ensuring the long-term conservation and sustainable use of living marine resources and marine ecosystems, including not only fishing vessels, but also ships that may be used to transport fish products."
"It also supports an expanded definition of IUU fishing to include a wide range of unregulated fishing operations."
"This agreement is part of the International Plan of Action to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing (IPOA-IUU), created by the United Nations (UN) Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) as part of the UN code of conduct on responsible fishing."
"Since IUU fishing is one of the major scourges of the current fishing industry, this agreement is particularly important, especially at a time when the EU is working on the new common fisheries policy (CFP)."
"I therefore voted for this report."
"in writing. - The approval of the Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing (the Agreement) is to be welcomed."
"The Agreement is a vital tool in ensuring that the EU is well equipped to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing in our waters."
"Ireland, and in particular Ireland South, has a thriving fishing industry and this Agreement will help to fight against IUU fishing as one of the most serious global threats to the sustainable exploitation of living aquatic resources."
"It is incredibly important that the EU has participated in this process from the start and has played an active and constructive role in the drafting of the Agreement, as the fight against IUU fishing constitutes an essential component of the common fisheries policy."
"Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing constitutes a serious obstacle to sustainable development in so far as it may affect 'living aquatic resources'."
"The Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing has been concluded, under the aegis of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), and it requires European Parliament approval to be permanently binding for the Union, so I voted in favour of concluding this agreement, as it is a central point of the common fisheries policy."
"By adopting the report by Mrs Fraga Estévez at lunchtime today, Parliament has given its approval for the European Union to enter into a binding international agreement to combat illegal fishing, thereby demonstrating its commitment to responsible fishing also."
"It is worth reminding ourselves that illegal fishing is still one of the greatest threats to sustainable exploitation of marine biological resources and is as great a threat as intensive fishing."
"To combat this type of fishing, which depletes marine biological resources and ecosystems, is a vital goal for the European Union."
"Commissioner Damanaki's recent announcement of a new fishing control system, which will mean fish can be traced from their place of capture to the dinner table, is encouraging."
"The introduction of a new points system (building up to suspension of a licence) on 1 January 2012 is particularly important."
"This system aims to ensure that serious infringements are dealt with in the same way, with deterrent fines of a minimum of five times the market value of the illegally caught fish."
"This system of traceability, combined with control and sanction powers for inspectors deployed throughout European territory, is a vital tool for curbing illegal fishing."
"in writing. - Illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing remains one of the most serious global threats to the sustainable exploitation of living aquatic resources."
"The fight against IUU fishing is an essential component of the common fisheries policy, and the EU should be able to foster international cooperation on this matter by participating actively and constructively in the adoption of an international instrument on port state measures."
"The EU is a member of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and of 13 regional fisheries management organisations (RFMOs)."
"Port state mechanisms adopted within RFMOs have been implemented through EU law, which also provides for comprehensive rules on access to port services, landings and transhipments of fisheries products by third-country vessels in EU ports, and cooperation and assistance mechanisms between the EU and third countries."
"Illegal fishing represents one of the most serious global threats to the sustainable exploitation of living aquatic resources."
"The fight against this form of exploitation constitutes an essential component of the common fisheries policy and the EU should be able to foster international cooperation on this matter by participating actively and constructively in the adoption of an international instrument on port state measures."
"In 2001, the Food and Agriculture Organisation developed an International Plan of Action to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing."
"The plan adopted a holistic approach, elaborating actions to be taken by flag, coastal and port states."
"The document adopted today aims to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal fishing through the implementation of effective port state measures, thereby ensuring the long-term conservation and sustainable use of living marine resources and marine ecosystems."
"in writing. - Port State Measures are an important tool in the fight against illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing."
"IUU fishing is an international criminal activity which is damaging our marine ecosystems, threatening our food security, and ruining the livelihoods of those in the legitimate fishing industry."
"But our action against IUU fishing must not only comprise Port State Measures; we must also campaign to end the use of 'flags of convenience', which often allow vessels to operate illegally and with impunity."
"A global registry of fishing vessels could also be an important step, as could traceability of fishery products."
"in writing. - (PT) Preventing, deterring and eliminating illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing is a fundamental priority for the success of the common fisheries policy (CFP)."
"The objective of the agreement is to prevent, deter and eliminate IUU fishing through the use of effective port state measures, thereby ensuring the long-term conservation and sustainable use of living marine resources and marine ecosystems."
"IUU fishing continues to be one of the most serious global threats to the sustainable exploitation of living aquatic resources, and the EU has had an active and constructive role in the preparation of the present draft agreement."
"Through the facility provided by the international instrument relating to port state measures, the parties will deny entry to their ports if they have sufficient proof that the ship intending to enter has been involved in IUU fishing or related activities."
"In view of these considerations, I regard the agreement mentioned as an important contribution to the current international fight against IUU fishing and I am voting in favour of its approval."
"in writing. - (LT) Although Lithuania is small, the fishing sector plays an important economic and social role for small communities in my country."
"Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing poses a major threat to the sustainability of fishing in Lithuania."
"Fish stocks are wasted, the marine environment is destroyed and honest fishermen find themselves in an uncomfortable position."
"In the Baltic Sea alone, 3800 jobs are under threat because of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing."
"According to the Pew Environment Group, unreported fishing costs Lithuanian fishermen more than EUR 1.1 million every year."
"This is a huge sum of money given the size of my country and the fact that these problems can be avoided."
"Unregulated fishing is particularly destructive for cod fishing in the Baltic Sea, which is already in a poor state."
"Cod is the most valuable fish in the Baltic Sea and the majority of Lithuanian fishermen are dependent on cod stocks."
"However, our cod fishermen are faced with illegal, unreported and unregulated catches of 40% above official landings."
"If illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing came to an end, cod fishing in the Baltic Sea could recover."
"However, for that to happen we must fill the gaps enabling illegal operators to profit from their activities."
"We must impose harsher penalties against offenders."
"Millions of Europeans use the right to trade in the EU Internal Market, and to live, work and travel throughout the EU."
"The EU has legislation that allows cross-border claims and the mutual recognition of national courts' judgments."
"However, obtaining a legal judgment is only part of the process: citizens and companies must have the right to ensure that these judgments are effectively enforced."
"A necessary component of effective enforcement is that the courts may, as an interim measure, act swiftly to order disclosure and freezing of the debtor's assets."
"Without such a measure, rogue traders and other debtors can evade their responsibilities by simply moving their assets to another jurisdiction, thereby denying the creditor effective enforcement of the judgment in the Single Market."
"The citizen or small business will have spent both money and time in securing a court judgment, only to have to go before another Member State's courts with no guarantee of success or justice."
"This report threfore indicates the need for an effective regime for freezing and disclosure of debtors' assets, as such I am voting for it."
"The Internal Market is without doubt the most important instrument that the European Union has to foster growth in the wake in the recent financial crisis."
"The millions of citizens and businesses that reap the benefits of the Internal Market must be able to exercise their rights and be able to travel, work and live freely anywhere in Europe."
"This is why they must also have access to effective remedies if they intend to make a claim against another citizen or business that endangers these rights."
"Today, the European Union has instruments in place to enable cross-border claims and the mutual recognition of judgments of national courts."
"However, the actual right to have judgments enforced is still lacking."
"Establishing an effective system for the freezing and disclosure of debtors' assets, and stepping up cooperation between enforcement authorities in the Member States, are the best ways of filling these gaps."
"That is why I voted in favour of Mrs McCarthy's report."
"One necessary component of effective enforcement of judgments is that courts must be able, as an interim measure, to act swiftly to order a disclosure of the debtor's assets and to freeze them."
"Without such a measure, rogue traders and other debtors may evade their responsibilities by simply moving their assets to another jurisdiction, thus denying the creditor effective enforcement of the judgment in the Single Market."
"That is why we need to establish a genuine 28th system, by which I mean an additional, autonomous European protection mechanism to go alongside those available in the national courts."
"This preventive measure will also provide a further deterrent against payment delays and will force the disclosure of assets in cross-border claims."
"This report is important in terms of extending the Single Market to the area of cross-border pre-financing."
"At the moment, this activity is partially blocked due to the reluctance of creditors in one Member State to grant loans to debtors living in another Member State."
"One specific example is where a resident of one Member State wants to take out a mortgage with a bank located in another Member State."
"At present, this transaction is not possible, which means that consumers do not actually have the right to purchase products (banking, in this case) from any EU Member State."
"The reason for a bank refusing to give mortgages to anyone other than residents of the same Member State (even when the relevant bank is a multinational and is represented in a number of Member States by subsidiaries or branches) is that, in the event of a default on the loan, the bank is obliged to proceed with a forced execution procedure in accordance with lex rei sitae (the law of the state where the property for which the mortgage has been arranged by the lending bank is located) and not with the law of the state where the creditor has its registered office."
"If a 28th regime procedure is going to be instituted, in keeping with this report, this would facilitate cross-border credit-based transactions."
"The level of success in recovering unpaid debts is remarkably low."
"The removal of the debtor's assets to another country has become a major problem for many creditors."
"A regulation providing for free-standing remedies that would allow interim measures to be ordered before, during and after the main proceedings will represent significant progress for European citizens in the fight against these dishonest debtors."
"The majority of European citizens are employees, and during this time of economic crisis they are becoming caught up too often in insolvency proceedings as the companies they work for go bankrupt."
"As shadow rapporteur on Mrs Girling's draft opinion on insolvency proceedings, I felt there was a need for employees to be given greater legal protection and certainty, which should be harmonised, and above all to have effective remedy."
"I propose that when main insolvency proceedings are begun against an employer who is in debt the receiver should be allowed within a six-month period to order the preservation of assets, with backdated effect, where the company has taken steps to move its funds."
"in writing. - (CS) I agree that the European Order for the Preservation of Assets (EOPA) and the European Order for the Disclosure of Assets (EODA) should be independent corrective resources supplementing the resources available under national law, and should be applied only in transboundary cases."
"The issuing of an EOPA should be wholly at the discretion of the national court."
"The burden of proof should also rest with the applicant, who should submit proper evidence of the legal plausibility (fumus boni juris) and urgency (periculum in mora) of a case."
"These criteria should be assessed by national courts on the basis of the existing case-law of the European Court of Justice."
"The effect of an EOPA must apply only to the freezing of bank accounts and the temporary freezing of bank deposits, and it should not grant creditors any form of ownership rights to the assets of the debtor."
"Further thought should be given as to whether the order might apply to other kinds of asset, such as immovable property or a future asset (a receivable due soon or an inheritance)."
"A very large number of companies in the EU carry out their business activities within the Internal Market, while European citizens enjoy the right to settle, work or travel freely throughout the EU."
"As we also pointed out when we discussed the Single Market Act intended to deepen the Internal Market and promote cross-border transactions, including e-commerce, we need guarantees to be able to recover any cross-border debts."
"I fully support the notion in this report of asking the Commission to propose more effective instruments for implementing the legislation, to supplement those which already exist for dealing with cross-border claims, such as the Brussels I Regulation or the Small Claims Procedure."
"Courts should have the necessary instruments available to act swiftly and freeze the assets of the debtor or alleged debtor, however not under any circumstances."
"We must strike a balance between protecting creditors and protecting the rights of debtors to avoid any arbitrary situation."
"The possibility of obtaining an EOPA without any notification and prior hearing for the relevant party is an infringement on the debtor's rights and is contrary to current case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union."
"The report does not therefore provide the necessary balance as better protection is required for the rights of debtors."
"I voted in favour of Mrs McCarthy's report, which requests the Commission to propose a European Order for the Preservation of Assets and a European Order for the Disclosure of Assets."
"Both instruments should be free-standing remedies additional to those available under national law."
"There is a need for an effective system to prevent and penalise non-payment situations when these occur between subjects whose assets are located in different countries, because otherwise, the free movement of persons, goods, services and capital within the EU would compromise the legal certainty of the European public."
"Therefore, I welcome and agree with the recommendations to the Commission on the proposed measures relating to the freezing and disclosure of debtors' assets in cross-border cases."
"Late payments and unpaid debts harm businesses and consumers alike."
"Even when the courts have delivered a judgment, in practice it is often difficult for creditors to recover debts if no information is available on the whereabouts of the debtor and his assets."
"It is even more difficult when the debtor is domiciled in another Member State."
"At present the number of cross-border debts successfully recovered is particularly low, and the cost of cross-border debt recovery can be prohibitive and can deter parties from engaging in legal proceedings."
"The time has come to simplify and speed up the recovery procedure."
"In order to improve debt recovery within the European Union and thereby protect consumers more effectively and encourage trade between Member States, the Commission must propose new legislation on the freezing and transparency of debtors' assets."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of this report, because it tables a range of measures that will help to prevent rogue traders and other debtors from evading their responsibilities by transferring their assets to other jurisdictions, thereby denying the creditor effective enforcement of the judgment in the Single Market."
"At the time of the adoption of the Stockholm Programme, the Commission was asked to table specific proposals aimed at a simple and autonomous European system for the seizure of bank accounts and the temporary freezing of bank deposits."
"Current European legislation allows cross-border claims and the mutual recognition of national courts' judgments, but still fails to ensure that the resultant legal judgments are effectively enforced."
"As such, and following Parliament's adoption of various resolutions reinforcing this idea, in this own-initiative report, the rapporteur asks the Commission to introduce two instruments - a European Order for the Preservation of Assets (EOPA) and a European Order for the Disclosure of Assets (EODA) - to be implemented in national law and to concern only cross-border cases."
"These instruments aim to ensure the rapid implementation of measures by the courts, enabling the freezing of debtors' assets and preventing the relocation or transfer of their assets."
"Therefore, I congratulate the rapporteur and believe that these are necessary measures, ensuring greater legal certainty and security, and also defending a better functioning of the Internal Market."
"The opportunism and greed of members of the public and certain businesspeople are leading them to take advantage of the freedom of movement of people and goods throughout the European Union to harm third parties."
"In spite of current regulations, such as the Brussels I Regulation, the European Enforcement Order, the European small claims procedure and the order for payment procedure, it is not always not possible - and certainly not fast - to achieve effective enforcement of a legal judgment in the Single Market This report, containing a set of recommendations to the European Commission relating to the proposals tabled on the freezing and disclosure of debtors' assets in cross-border cases earns my full support, and I hope that in June, we will have a specific proposal with the measures to be adopted in this respect."
"We acknowledge the need to defend consumer rights in the EU Internal Market, particularly those of the most vulnerable."
"The EU currently already has legislation in place enabling cross-border claims and the mutual recognition of national courts' judgments, including the Brussels I Regulation, the European Enforcement Order, the European small claims procedure and the order for payment procedure."
"However, obtaining a legal judgment is only part of the process."
"The aim of this report is for members of the public and businesses to have the right to ensure these judgments are effectively enforced."
"A necessary component of effective enforcement is that the courts may, as an interim measure, act swiftly to order disclosure and freezing of the debtor's assets."
"There is a need for this measure, to guarantee the rights of individuals and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)."
"Naturally, this does not bring an end to our opposition to and reservations about fundamental aspects of the Single Market, its nature, objectives and impact."
"In the Internal Market created by the European Union, it is becoming increasingly necessary to defend the rights of consumers, particular those lacking adequate resources."
"The EU has legislation in place enabling cross-border claims and the mutual recognition of national courts' judgments, including the Brussels I Regulation, the European Enforcement Order, the European small claims procedure and the order for payment procedure."
"However, obtaining a judgment is only one part of the process."
"The rapporteur's aim with this report is for members of the public and businesses to have the right to ensure these judgments are effectively enforced."
"A necessary component of effective enforcement is that the courts may, as an interim measure, act swiftly to order disclosure and freezing of the debtor's assets."
"Without such a measure, rogue traders and other debtors may evade their responsibilities by simply moving their assets to another jurisdiction, thus denying the creditor effective enforcement of the judgment in the Single Market."
"The individual or small business will have spent both money and time in securing a legal judgment, only to have to go before another Member State's courts with no guarantee of success or justice."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this document, because the EU has legislation in place to enable cross-border claims and the mutual recognition of judgments of national courts, including the Brussels I Regulation, the European Enforcement Order, the Small Claims Procedure and the Order for Payment Procedure."
"However, getting the judgment is only one part of the process; citizens and businesses must have the right to have their judgments effectively enforced."
"One necessary component of effective enforcement is that courts must be able, as an interim measure, to act swiftly to order a disclosure of the debtor's assets and freeze them."
"Without such a measure, rogue traders and other debtors may evade their responsibilities by simply moving their assets to another jurisdiction, thus denying the creditor effective enforcement of the judgment in the Single Market."
"The European Institutions have drawn attention to the need for an effective regime for freezing and disclosure of debtors' assets."
"in writing. - (CS) I am personally in favour of the European Order for the Preservation of Assets and the European Order for the Disclosure of Assets becoming part of EU law."
"This is particularly true in view of legislative developments in recent years, when measures such as the European Enforcement Order, the Small Claims Procedure and the European Payment Order were incorporated into Union law, because these measures cannot be fully realised without the implementation of the European Order for the Preservation of Assets and the European Order for the Disclosure of Assets."
"Although I support the Commission's call to submit a proposal for legislative amendments to both measures, this does not mean automatic support for the Commission proposal."
"In assessing this proposal I will place emphasis above all on its specific form, stressing its use exclusively in transboundary cases, the jurisdiction for the exercise of these measures and also the restriction on the exercise of these measures only to cases where it is absolutely necessary."
"in writing. - I welcome this report which, if followed through by the Commission, should help victims of fraud."
"The current legal set-up protects the fraudster, leaving the victim lost in a quagmire of paperwork and expensive legal action."
"These proposals would reverse this unfair situation, giving victims a better chance of getting their money back."
"This report raises the problem of the banks' debt reimbursement guarantees."
"Banks benefit from preferential interest rates in order to guarantee their profits."
"However, they continue to levy disproportionately high rates on the debts of States and citizens."
"The urgent need is to save citizens and States who are victims of the banks, not the reverse."
"I shall vote against this report."
"In the current context of the European Internal Market, it is increasingly important to defend the rights of consumers, in particular those who are less well-off."
"European legislation allows for cross-border claims, as well as the mutual recognition of the decisions of national courts, but the current procedure for cross-border debt recovery is arduous and prohibitively expensive."
"The purpose of the report with recommendations on proposed interim measures for the freezing and disclosure of debtors' assets in cross-border cases is for European citizens and businesses to have the right for these decisions to actually be enforced."
"The lack of this type of measure sends a signal of impunity to recalcitrant debtors and makes it easier for rogue traders to evade their responsibilities, as they can simply move their assets to another jurisdiction to prevent a court judgment from actually being enforced."
"This forces citizens to go before another Member State's courts, with no guarantee that this costly process will have a favourable outcome."
"I have therefore been unable to vote against this report, which sets out measures aimed at protecting these rights."
"Freedom of trade and the smooth operation of the Internal Market in the EU come with rights and obligations attached."
"One of the public's basic rights is to suitable means of recourse in the event that they have a claim against an individual or against a company that has caused them a loss."
"In addition, care must be taken to ensure that any court judgments are enforced quickly, so that the individuals or companies responsible and liable for compensation have no margin to evade their responsibility by simply transferring their assets to another jurisdiction, thereby denying effective enforcement of the judgment on the debtor within the Single Market."
"This practical, yet important, loophole is identified in the own initiative report, which I voted in favour of."
"The most important instrument that the EU has to promote growth in the heat of the financial crisis is its Internal Market."
"At the moment, EU law is not effectively applied, particularly in the area of civil justice."
"In fact, the current level of payment of cross-border debts is very low, both with regard to the assets of private individuals and of businesses."
"This fact in itself discourages cross-border trade by sending a message of impunity to debtors, and damages the economic performance of the EU."
"In fact, the cost of the cross-border settlement of debts is currently prohibitive for creditors in cases where the debtor has assets in different Member States."
"This prevents the Internal Market from working properly."
"European Union measures are essential, in order to put an end to this situation and provide EU citizens with effective recourse should they have a claim against another citizen or company; measures that simplify and accelerate this payment process."
"Therefore, I voted in favour of this report, in which the European Parliament calls on the Commission to table legislative proposals on measures for the freezing and disclosure of the assets of debtors and alleged debtors in cross-border cases."
"To create a Single Market, parties must be given the necessary mechanisms that allow their debts to be settled throughout the Union."
"This concept gave rise to the Brussels I Regulation, for example, with the aim of setting up a single system for recognising legal judgments within the EU."
"However, it continues to be extremely difficult for a creditor to enforce a debt if the debtor's assets are divided between several Member States, which - there is no harm in repeating it - creates serious difficulties for the implementation of a true Single Market."
"The European Order for the Preservation of Assets (EOPA) and the European Order for the Disclosure of Assets (EODA) may prove to be good instruments for this requirement."
"Therefore, I voted for this report."
"in writing. - (DE) I voted in favour of the report because millions of citizens of the European Internal Market need effective legal means of asserting their claims against other citizens or against enterprises."
"People who exercise their right to live, work and travel within the EU should not in future be allowed to fall victim to unscrupulous profiteers and other debtors who evade their responsibilities simply by moving their assets to another country."
"In such cases creditors are often refused enforcement of the judgment in the Internal Market, as a result of which citizens or small enterprises lose money and time because they are referred to courts of other Member States once court proceedings have already been initiated."
"Moreover, to guarantee effective enforcement the courts must be able to order the disclosure and freezing of the debtor's assets within the context of measures to provide interim legal protection."
"The current legal provisions in the European Union, which allow the reciprocal recognition of national court rulings and cross-border claims, are not sufficient."
"Citizens and enterprises also need to have the right to have such rulings enforced effectively."
"This report signifies an important step against swindlers and in favour of the citizens and enterprises of the European Internal Market."
"in writing. - Millions of businesses make use of the right to trade in the EU's Internal Market."
"Millions of citizens make use of the right to live, work and travel across the EU."
"It is essential that in the Internal Market citizens have effective remedies in the event they have a claim against another citizen or business."
"The EU has legislation in place to enable cross-border claims and the mutual recognition of judgments of national courts, including the Brussels I Regulation, the European Enforcement Order, the Small Claims Procedure and the Order for Payment Procedure."
"But getting the judgment is only one part of the process; citizens and businesses must have the right to have their judgments effectively enforced."
"One necessary component of effective enforcement is that courts must be able, as an interim measure, to act swiftly to order the disclosure of the debtor's assets and freeze them."
"Millions of businesses operate in the European Union's Internal Market and millions of citizens make use of the right to live, work and travel in all Member States."
"It is therefore essential that in the Internal Market citizens have access to necessary and effective remedies in the event they have a claim against another citizen or business."
"Today, the European Union has legislation in place to enable cross-border claims and the mutual recognition of judgments of national courts."
"However, obtaining a judgment is often only one part of the process."
"The more than 500 million European citizens and their businesses must have the right to effective enforcement of judgments."
"One necessary component of effective enforcement is that courts must be able, as an interim measure, to act immediately to order a disclosure of the debtor's assets and to freeze them."
"The aim of the report we are adopting today is to call on the Commission to swiftly bring forward proposals on interim measures for the freezing and disclosure of debtors' assets in cross-border disputes."
"in writing. - I support this own-initiative report because it supports the creation of a European Order for the Preservation of Assets and a European Order for the Disclosure of Assets."
"I am voting for this proposal, because I agree with the discharge procedures, with suitable appropriations being proposed for each heading."
"in writing. - (NL) I cannot support discharge being granted to the European Commission or to the other institutions and bodies."
"The most important reason for that is that the error percentage remains too high."
"The report on the European Commission by rapporteur Chatzimarkakis spells out the areas of concern brilliantly."
"However, the Committee on Budgetary Control has failed to conclude that the grant of discharge should be postponed, despite the fact that that is exactly the tool we should be using to exert pressure on the European Commission and Member States to make improvements."
"For example, the national declarations of assurance."
"They help improve shared management, and that also means structural funds."
"The many complicated rules connected with structural funds and research grants present another major difficulty."
"This is why I have tabled an amendment to the report by Mr Garriga Polledo from the Special Committee on the Policy Challenges and Budgetary Resources for a Sustainable European Union after 2013."
"With my amendment, I request that the European Commission ensures every proposal is accompanied by an impact assessment."
"That impact assessment must be carried out independently, not by the European Commission itself."
"To conclude, reduction of the regulatory burden and national declarations of assurance should lead to fewer errors in financial management."
"By granting discharge, the European Parliament is throwing away the most important tool it has ever had at its disposal."
"The Chatzimarkakis report deserved a better fate."
"I voted in favour of granting 2009 discharge to the European Commission because, despite the difficulties in managing these funds, the result obtained by the Court of Auditors shows objective improvements."
"The greater audit transparency and the improved performance shown by all those involved in the management of European funds are the two main reasons that lead me to support this discharge."
"The vote on granting discharge to the Commission for the 2009 financial year has come at a very significant political moment, since the negotiations on the next multiannual financial framework will be marked by a revision of the financial regulation."
"This was therefore an opportunity for Parliament to give new impetus and vitality to a procedure that is not always taken seriously."
"Parliament has approved the Commission's budget spending for 2009, having obtained undertakings aimed at giving Member States more responsibility and improving control by national authorities of Union expenditure."
"More effective management and control systems must be established."
"In future, national political bodies will be obliged to sign national management declarations making them accountable for the way in which Union funds have been spent in their countries."
"The financial crisis that is currently shaking Europe also has implications for the EU budget."
"We cannot tolerate any scandal or mismanagement of expenditure."
"We Swedish Social Democrats have chosen to grant discharge to the Commission for the financial year 2009."
"However, we chose not to support the paragraphs relating to the EU's Staff Regulations."
"We believe that there may be a need for Commission staff to have additional travel days - some can have long distances to travel and may need to change planes or other forms of transport several times."
"In addition, changes to the EU's Staff Regulations can only be made within the framework of a codecision procedure between Parliament and the Council."
"Therefore, the discharge process is not the right forum for these issues."
"The reform of the Staff Regulations will be dealt with at a later date in the European Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs."
"I welcome the continuous improvements made in the last few years by the Court of Auditors with regard to the performance of all those in charge of funds."
"The transparency, sound management and responsibility of all the entities involved must always be a priority and example of the European Union."
"However, there is still a need to create real Member State responsibility with regard to their role in the shared management of Union cohesion funds, whilst it remains essential to introduce a system for analysing the viability of data submitted by national agencies and a mandatory national management declarations system."
"It is crucial that the Member States take responsibility for the proper use of EU funds, and develop serious and transparent control and simplification policies."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of the report on the 2009 Commission discharge because it gives an assurance of better management of payments in cases where funds are misused."
"I could not support some of the paragraphs from the report, which referred to the forthcoming review of the Staff Regulations of Officials of the European Communities."
"The reasons behind my decision are that revision of the Staff Regulations goes beyond the remit of the Committee on Budgetary Control and does not belong in the 2009 discharge report, but falls instead within the competence of the Legal Affairs Committee, which will be dealing with these issues in the near future."
"I believe that we have to take an overall approach and make a comprehensive review of the Regulations as a whole, rather than a fragmented one with various reports addressing various regulations."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of the report on discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the Commission for the financial year 2009, because it provides a better guarantee of management as regards payments, particularly when funds are misused."
"By adopting this decision the European Parliament grants the Commission discharge in respect of the implementation of the general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2009 and sets out its comments in related documents."
"I feel that it is necessary to simplify and reduce public procurement rules in order to reduce the overall incidence of errors."
"Governance problems between the Financial Regulation and the cohesion regulations can be avoided by better alignment of eligibility rules across various policies."
"Simplification, in particular in connection with the revision of the Financial Regulation, needs to ensure stable rules and management schemes in the long term."
"I regret that in considering the implementation of the budget for the 2009 financial year, the Court of Auditors has again chosen to focus on energy and research policies rather than on transport policy."
"There is nevertheless a need for greater transparency through the provision of proper information to taxpayers and budget authorities, and for regional and transport policies to be more closely coordinated, as at present only cursory consideration is given to the potential European added value of projects and, consequently, funds are not used as effectively as possible to eliminate bottlenecks and problems relating to border crossings or inadequate connections."
"in writing. - I strongly believe this report indicates the need for the Commission to undertake a thorough spending review in order to identify possible savings which would reduce pressure on the budget during this period of austerity."
"in writing. - I voted against the proposals to discharge the Commission of its obligation to report on its expenditure because the report was unclear."
"I did vote in favour of the motion for a resolution, as the general idea of cost efficiency in the EU is raised many times."
"I am in favour of cutting costs in relation to the Commission and its agencies."
"However, this may not be at the expense of rank-and-file workers in the Commission, as was suggested in Paragraph 81."
"I do not accept that workers should be forced to work longer as a result of cuts, regardless of who their employer is."
"Workers' rights should be guaranteed and defended."
"If their function has become obsolete, they should have access to similar jobs with the same conditions."
"Elected representatives enforcing a slashing of living standards for workers should, at the very least, accept that their own privileges undergo the same treatment."
"I will continue to urge that public representatives be paid an average skilled worker's wage and to advocate the elimination of unnecessary costs, perks, benefits and other privileges."
"in writing. - This grants the Commission discharge in respect of the implementation of the general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2009, and sets out its observations in the resolution that forms an integral part of the Decisions on discharge in respect of the implementation of the general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2009, Section III - Commission and executive agencies, and in its resolution on conclusions concerning the special reports issued by the Court of Auditors."
"Under Article 17(1) of the Treaty on European Union, the Commission shall execute the budget and shall do so, under Article 317 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, in cooperation with the Member States, on its own responsibility, having regard to the principles of sound financial management."
"By adopting this report, Parliament approves the granting of discharge to the Commission in respect of the implementation of the general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2009."
"in writing. - (DE) I have neither granted nor refused discharge for the Commission."
"The reason for this is that, on the one hand, the European Court of Auditors was once again unable to issue a positive statement for the Commission in 2009; on the other, the report makes it sufficiently clear that this is mainly due to the inadequate cooperation of the Member States as recipients of funding."
"Granting discharge to a deficient system does nothing to help this situation."
"Controls must be ensured before funds are handed out."
"in writing. - (SK) The Court of Auditors estimates that financial irregularities or even possible embezzlement of resources in 2009 account for 2-5% of all payments."
"This is far more than the annual contribution of Slovakia to the EU budget."
"We are expected to approve the accounts of the 27 European agencies, although I suspect that Europe would be better off without these agencies."
"What is more, in the draft budget for next year we are going to increase precisely those sectors in which the audit found the greatest discrepancies."
"Saddest of all is the fact that it makes no difference whether this Parliament gives or does not give its blessing to the management of the European agencies and institutions."
"Everything will continue as usual."
"The stricter rules for the redistribution and accounting of these resources will solve nothing, because they will lead to more bureaucracy and slower payments, thereby ultimately undermining the effectiveness of support programmes."
"I would therefore like to advocate a phasing out of redistribution, which is becoming a less than transparent instrument for the social engineering of today."
"It distorts the market, reduces competitiveness and deprives people of initiative and responsibility for how and where they live."
"The less money we redistribute on the basis of political priorities, the less risk of corruption there will be and the more viable will be Europe's regions and our entire economy."
"I support this report, especially what it says about the Special Report of the Court of Auditors on the reform of the sugar sector."
"That report drew attention to the significant problems evident in the sugar sector since it was reformed in 2006 and to the problems that former sugar producers now face."
"Without the report of the Court of Auditors those difficulties would not be reported."
"The sugar plants played an important role in the agricultural sector, particularly in Ireland, where there were processing plants in Cork and in Carlow, and it could be argued that the reform put an end to the sugar sector in Ireland."
"As stated in the report, insufficient information was provided about the impact on the processing regions, the impact of quota refusals on local economies, the jobs that would be lost and the distribution of compensation."
"There was a lack of transparency and information associated with the reform process for those working in the sector and for European taxpayers and there must now be clarity and honesty about the impact of the reform throughout the European agricultural sector."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this report."
"Every year the Court of Auditors presents special reports in the context of the Commission discharge."
"These special reports are of great importance when reflecting on and changing and adapting programmes and projects because they can result in a more efficient use of human and budgetary resources."
"On the basis of these reports, the Commission can take prompt action to remedy most of the shortcomings noted by the Court of Auditors."
"I was the rapporteur responsible for the working document of the Committee on Budgetary Control on the Special Report of the European Court of Auditors entitled ""Improving transport performance on Trans-European rail axes”."
"I believe that the Commission must take the necessary action in order to adapt the rail infrastructure to cater for trans-European services while creating missing links at cross-border locations, replacing or upgrading the old rail infrastructure and helping the Member States to alleviate various complications related to the different gauges and providing the necessary financial assistance."
"I voted in favour of granting 2009 discharge in respect of the general budget of the European Union because I take the view that the funds have been managed in a transparent and, overall, efficient way, including in the light of the particular circumstances that the European economy encountered in the period in question."
"I view the assessment made by the Court of Auditors in these special reports positively, because it is through these reports that we are able to access more clearly the information relating to how funds are spent, and also the need to reassess or adapt programmes and projects."
"All the information now provided by the Court of Auditors must be taken into consideration by the EU, particularly by the Commission as the main executive and management body of the EU budget."
"We must aspire to an exemplary optimisation of how the funds are handled and spent, based on simple and transparent rules founded on the principle of direct responsibility."
"I voted in favour of this document, because the Court of Auditors has managed to produce, every year, more and better special reports."
"Unfortunately, they do not always get the political attention they deserve because of the rules applicable in Parliament."
"These special reports are of great importance when reflecting on and changing and/or adapting programmes and projects, because they can result in a more efficient use of human and budgetary resources."
"I appreciate the positive attitude of the Commission to these processes and its willingness to take prompt action to remedy most of the shortcomings noted by the Court of Auditors in these reports."
"in writing. - I voted for this report, which underlines the need for more rigorous examination of projects at the application stage in order to prevent shortcomings, and, accordingly, invites the Commission to further improve the use of guidance and checklists by providing clearer criteria for assessing grant applications in order to enhance the effectiveness and consistency of the procedures and their results, and to ensure proper follow-up action in cases of non-provision of required information or action."
"in writing. - This welcomes the fact that the Court of Auditors has managed to produce, every year, more and better special reports; regrets the fact that, unfortunately, they do not always get the political attention they deserve because of the rules applicable in Parliament; points out that those special reports are of great importance when reflecting on and changing and/or adapting programmes and projects, because they can result in a more efficient use of human and budgetary resources; and appreciates the positive attitude of the Commission to those processes and its willingness to take prompt action to remedy most of the shortcomings noted by the Court of Auditors in those reports."
"By adopting this report Parliament emphasises the fact that the Court of Auditors has managed to produce, every year, more and better special reports."
"Unfortunately these reports do not always receive the political attention they deserve, even though they are of great importance when reflecting on, changing and adapting programmes and projects because they can result in a more efficient use of human and budgetary resources."
"Today's text underscores once again our appreciation of the positive attitude of the Commission and its willingness to take prompt action to remedy most of the shortcomings noted by the Court of Auditors in the reports in question."
"I am voting for this proposal, because I agree with the discharge procedures, with suitable appropriations being proposed for each heading."
"in writing. - (LT) I endorsed this report and discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Parliament for the financial year 2009."
"The Court of Auditors found the payments as a whole to be free from material error."
"It found no material weaknesses when assessing the compliance of supervisory and control systems with the Financial Regulation."
"The Secretary-General of the European Parliament certified his reasonable assurance that Parliament's budget has been implemented in accordance with the principles of sound financial management and that the control framework put in place provides the necessary guarantees as to the legality and regularity of the underlying operations."
"I agree with the rapporteur that it is necessary for Parliament, along with all Union institutions, to find the most cost effective ways of using financial and staff resources, including possible savings, as well as electronic tools and methods, to provide efficient services."
"I believe that the Secretary-General of the European Parliament must propose arrangements to ensure that use of the general expenditure allowance is transparent in all cases and that it is used for the purposes intended."
"I also agree that Parliament should only have one workplace in the same location as the other Union institutions."
"Currently the decision to change this situation - and to make some EUR 160 000 000 of savings annually, as well as to considerably lessen Parliament's carbon footprint - lies exclusively with the European Council."
"We need to further rationalise the missions between the three working places, justifying and monitoring them better in order to avoid unnecessary missions and costs."
"I voted for this discharge."
"As far as I am concerned, the European Parliament's operating budget is in keeping with the financial climate."
"Several of the comments on increasing transparency are along the right lines."
"I also consider it reasonable for Parliament to award prizes, especially for the purpose of supporting European cinema."
"Added to this, the sums in question are basically symbolic."
"I voted for the report on discharge in respect of the implementation of the European Union general budget for the financial year 2009, in relation to the European Parliament."
"I should like to stress that, in the section on major changes in budget management during 2009, I voted for item 5 because I understand that the general expenditure allowance paid into our accounts must be handled transparently in all cases and must be used for the purposes intended."
"Therefore and to that end, I agree that it should be the Secretary-General who adopts the appropriate measure."
"I voted in favour of granting Parliament discharge in respect of its 2009 budget because I take the view that, overall, the resources have been managed wisely."
"I remain highly sceptical about the division between the three places of work: it creates waste and stress and, symbolism aside, I think there is a fairly urgent need to take steps to get rid of this tripartite system, which has an economic and environmental cost."
"In view of the current economic situation, the European Parliament has a duty to set an example in terms of cutting costs."
"Among the intended cost-saving measures, it has been decided that an interpretation service will automatically be provided for meetings of working groups in six languages only (French, German, English, Polish, Spanish and Italian), whilst other languages will only be made available if Members request them."
"Other demands include rules restricting long distance journeys by official Parliament cars."
"The resolution also calls for a long-term review of Parliament's budget with a view to reducing costs."
"This vote also provided an opportunity to revive the debate on where the seat of the European Parliament should be."
"However, this situation is linked to a historical background and to legal statutes that cannot be challenged on the basis of often mistaken attacks concerning the costs or problems associated with the dispersal of the European Parliament's premises."
"There is no question of choosing between Strasbourg and Brussels in this instance, since according to the Treaties that founded our Union in the beginning, Strasbourg is the rule and Brussels the exception."
"Once again, I voted in favour of this report which points out that real savings could be made if Parliament only had one workplace, in the same city as the European Union's other institutions (in other words Brussels)."
"The report of the Secretary-General on Parliament's preliminary draft estimates for 2011 itself draws attention to the huge annual costs arising from the geographical split of Parliament, estimated at some EUR 160 000 000, which accounts for 9% of Parliament's total budget."
"It is true that at present the decision to change this situation, and in doing so to make some EUR 160 000 000 of savings per year, whilst at the same time considerably lessening Parliament's carbon footprint, lies solely with the Council."
"However through this vote, I call upon Parliament's President and the Members who are negotiating the Union budget on behalf of Parliament to suggest to the Council that it take steps to ensure that the Union can make these savings."
"I voted for the report on discharge of the European Parliament budget 2009, since it contributes to scrutiny of how funds are used by the European institutions."
"I believe that it would be useful to review the European Parliament budget in the long term, in order to reduce costs and create resources for the efficient functioning of the Parliament in the context of its increased competences arising from the Treaty of Lisbon."
"in writing. - (SV) I would like to emphasise that, as a public institution, the European Parliament must strive to demonstrate as much openness and transparency as possible."
"I also believe, particularly in view of the current economic situation, that Parliament must review its expenditure and identify savings and ways to increase efficiency."
"Parliament ought to have a more in-depth debate on these issues, which is why I would like to provide more room for the discharge debate."
"I also have a positive view of the principle that the European Parliament should have a common air miles system to provide the benefit of cheaper air travel."
"Finally, I do not believe it is wrong for Parliament to award cultural prizes."
"However, I am highly critical of Parliament's Prize for Journalism, and I do not believe that it is appropriate for Parliament to award prizes to journalists whose task it is to critically examine the European Parliament."
"I therefore believe that this prize should be abolished."
"in writing. - On the discharge Report of the European Parliament for 2009, I voted in line with my political Group against paragraph 143 on airmiles."
"The same concept is already covered by paragraph 199 on which I voted in favour."
"Paragraph 119 is more comprehensive and more practical for implementation purposes."
"We Swedish Social Democrats have chosen to grant discharge to the European Parliament for the financial year 2009."
"We would like to emphasise that, as a public institution, the European Parliament must strive to demonstrate as much openness and transparency as possible."
"We therefore chose to support paragraph 5, which calls for greater transparency with regard to Members' expenditure allowance."
"We also believe, particularly in view of the current economic situation, that Parliament must review its expenditure and identify savings and ways to increase efficiency."
"Parliament ought to have a more in-depth debate on these issues, which is why we would also like to provide more room for the discharge debate."
"We also have a positive view of the principle that the European Parliament should have a common air miles system to provide the benefit of cheaper air travel, even though we find it difficult to see how this could be implemented in practice."
"Finally, we do not believe it is wrong for Parliament to award cultural prizes."
"However, we are highly critical of Parliament's Prize for Journalism, and do not believe that it is appropriate for Parliament to award prizes to journalists whose task it is to critically examine the European Parliament."
"We therefore believe that this prize should be abolished."
"in writing. - (LT) I abstained from the vote on this document, although the audit of the Court of Auditors states that, as regards administrative expenditure in 2009, all the institutions satisfactorily operated the supervisory and control systems required by the Financial Regulation and the transactions tested were free from material error."
"The Secretary-General also certified, on 2 July 2010, his reasonable assurance that Parliament's budget has been implemented in accordance with the principles of sound financial management and that the control framework put in place provides the necessary guarantees as to the legality and regularity of the underlying operations."
"I believe that the current financial situation necessitates that the Parliament, along with all Union institutions, finds the most cost effective ways of using financial and staff resources, including possible savings, as well as electronic tools and methods, to provide efficient services."
"We need to carry out a long-term review of the European Parliament budget and determine the money that can be saved in the future, in order to reduce costs and find the funds to enable Parliament to operate efficiently as one of the legislative bodies."
"I would also point out that citizens have the right to know how the money they pay in taxes is spent and how the Union's institutions and political bodies use the powers they are given."
"in writing. - (DA) The Danish Liberal Party is opposed to paragraph 112."
"It is vital that there continues to be equality for the European languages in the EU."
"Apart from this paragraph, the report contains a number of sensible initiatives."
"in writing. - (DE) As regards paragraph 129 of the report on the '2009 discharge: EU general budget - European Parliament', which concerns the 'voluntary pension fund', I wish to state that I am categorically voting against this because it involves using taxpayers' money to finance pension funds for Members of the European Parliament (paragraph 129(i))."
"There is no reason not to raise the retirement age for the Scheme from 60 to 63 (paragraph 129(ii))."
"It is a good thing for the managers of the Fund to be called upon to adopt a more prudent and balanced investment strategy (paragraph 129(iii))."
"As a matter of principle I am in favour of phasing out the present pension scheme."

"It was a good thing for the managers of the Fund to be called upon to adopt a more prudent and balanced investment strategy (paragraph 129(iii))."
"As a matter of principle I am in favour of phasing out the present pension scheme."
"in writing. - I voted for the amendment which calls for greater transparency when signing off MEPs' General Expenditure Allowance."
"in writing. - (RO) I voted for this report as I think that some measures are needed, aimed at both making MEPs' activities more efficient and improving the performance of the institution's officials and infrastructure in terms of security, IT, visitor access and reducing the carbon footprint."
"The security policy must be reviewed by implementing a smart, state-of-the-art security system for Parliament, using measures inside buildings and access control procedures, as well as in the area of the EU institutions."
"On the ICT front, improvements are required with regard to wireless network access inside the institution's buildings."
"On the other hand, the ICT department should propose specific measures for replacing hard copy administrative documents with environmentally-friendly, electronic versions."
"The EU's institutions are a major tourist attraction in Brussels."
"Surveys show that the influx of tourists is higher during holiday periods and at weekends."
"The operation of the visitors centre and visit programme ought to be adapted to these demands."
"Meeting the 30% reduction target in carbon emissions by 2020 is a priority."
"I support the initiative in favour of replacing the current car fleet with environmentally-friendly vehicles, given the small distances travelled, which is appropriate for the battery life of electric vehicles."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution as the general idea of cost efficiency in the EU is brought up."
"I am in favour of cutting costs related to the European Parliament."
"However, savings cannot be made at the expense of ordinary workers working in the European Parliament; their rights should be safeguarded at all times."
"I support spending on the promotion of accessible artistic and cultural events which can enrich the lives of the population; this is why is supported the LUX film prize, despite misgivings on the seemingly large budget spent on this particular award."
"Savings can, and should, be made by limiting the expenses and wages of MEPs, for instance by linking the daily allowance to vouched-for expenses."
"I also supported the raising of the retirement age for MEPs from 60 to 63."
"I feel that representatives enforcing a slashing of living standards for workers should at the very least accept that their privileges undergo the same treatment."
"However, I do not agree that the retirement age for workers should be raised."
"I will continue to support workers and trade unionists in their struggle against the increase in the retirement age."
"in writing. - (DE) I cannot vote for the discharge of the European Parliament budget on the basis that the wandering circus between Brussels and Strasbourg alone is unsustainable for taxpayers."
"The European Parliament should have a single location rather than relocating lock, stock and barrel for one week a month."
"in writing. - Among other things, the adopted text establishes that the EP takes note of the budgetary constraints many Member States face as a result of the financial and economic crisis and the need to critically review potential savings at all levels including at Union level; and, in light of this situation, stresses that real savings could be achieved if Parliament only had one workplace in the same location."
"The audit carried out by the Court of Auditors indicates that, as regards administrative expenditure in 2009, all the institutions satisfactorily operated the supervisory and control systems required by the Financial Regulation, and the transactions tested were free from material error."
"On 2 July 2010, the Secretary-General certified with reasonable confidence that Parliament's budget had been implemented in accordance with the principles of sound financial management and that the control framework put in place provides the necessary guarantees as to the legality and regularity of the underlying operations."
"The report that we are adopting today grants the President discharge in respect of the implementation of the European Parliament budget for the financial year 2009."
"in writing. - I support greater transparency in the Parliament and I especially welcome transparency in regard to the GEA."
"I voted in favour of Mr Itälä's report, but I have reservations about recital 113."
"I totally disagree with this recital, which proposes a new system for interpretation services for 'working groups'."
"I cannot agree with it, because the proposed system: does not square with the principle of equal treatment of the Union's official languages and of their users; will eventually undoubtedly lead to the exclusion of languages other than the six mentioned; will, in practice, be impossible to run in a workable fashion, for the simple reason that the member concerned will have to submit a request for interpretation in a supplementary language before they get to see the agenda; risks turning the language policy into a power game."
"If we really want to make savings when it comes to languages, then we should demand that this system apply equally to everyone."
"If we cease to attach so much importance to the principle that some members should be allowed to speak in their own language, this will become less important for other members, too."
"There is, therefore, only one alternative if we have to economise on interpretation services in the 'working groups': use of English, and English only, as the medium of both speaking and listening."
"In that case, everyone will be equal before the law and we will be able to make savings."
"in writing. - I was unable to support granting discharge to the European Parliament as some concerns remained unresolved."
"Although Parliament has taken steps to improve its budget and make savings, questions remain over some issues such as funding for prizes, which are currently paid for by the tax payer."
"In addition to this, the final report failed to acknowledge the amount of money being wasted on Strasbourg."
"The report did, however, show that some progress is being made."
"Following today's vote, new rules will need to be put in place to ensure that MEPs from all EU countries take steps to ensure the transparency of their office expenses."
"The report also called for a review of Parliament's expenditure in order to guarantee savings are made in future."
"I am voting for this proposal, because I agree with the discharge procedures, with suitable appropriations being proposed for each heading."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this report and agreed that the European Parliament should postpone its decision to grant discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the Council for the financial year 2009."
"The Council has not accepted any invitation to officially and formally meet Parliament's Committee on Budgetary Control, responsible for the discharge procedure, or its rapporteur to discuss matters concerning the Council budget execution for 2009."
"The Council also refused to provide a written answer providing Parliament with the information and documents it requested."
"I agree with the rapporteur that the Council must provide Parliament's Committee on Budgetary Control with comprehensive written answers, as well as all the required documents, by 15 June 2011 at the latest."
"The Council must also be accountable to the public for the funds entrusted to it, and in order to facilitate the exchange of information in the discharge procedure, it must follow the same approach as the other institutions."
"I voted against granting discharge in respect of the 2009 general budget of the Council because the Council has refused to respond to questions from Parliament on this topic and has failed to provide the essential documents that Parliament has requested."
"I am therefore in favour of postponing the 2009 discharge."
"Once again, the decision just adopted reflects the persistent lack of cooperation by the Council in the implementation and transparency of its budget."
"In the name of transparency, which the public needs, and rigour, I do not consider the Council exonerated from its responsibility of publishing accounts for the funds available to it."
"Therefore, I agree with the rapporteur regarding his decision to postpone the decision on discharge of the Council's accounts until the latter supplies the information and documents requested by the rapporteur and also a complete list of budget carryovers."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this document, because it postpones its decision on granting the Secretary-General of the Council discharge in respect of the implementation of the Council budget for the financial year 2009."
"The reasons for the postponement of the discharge decision are as follows: Firstly, the Council has not accepted any invitation to officially and formally meet Parliament's Committee responsible for the discharge procedure or its rapporteur to discuss matters concerning the Council budget execution for 2009."
"Secondly, the Council refused to provide a written answer providing Parliament with the information and documents requested from the Council in the annex to a letter of 14 December 2010 signed by the rapporteur."
"Thirdly, Parliament has not received fundamental documents from the Council, such as the full list of budgetary transfers."
"I voted in favour of this decision, because it is my deep conviction that citizens have the right to know how the money they pay in taxes is spent and how the institutions and political bodies use the powers they are given."
"As required each year, the European Parliament has delivered its opinion on whether or not the Union budget has been properly implemented by the various agencies and institutions who are responsible for it."
"The allocated sums are earmarked for specific purposes, and the aim of the discharge procedure is to check in retrospect that these purposes have been adhered to."
"This is an important prerogative of Parliament, as illustrated for example by its influence on the resignation of the Santer Commission in 1999."
"This year, together with the vast majority of Members of the European Parliament, I refused to grant the Council of Ministers discharge in respect of its activity in the 2009 financial year."
"The institutions whose activities are audited by Parliament through the Committee on Budgetary Control, of which I am a member, are obliged to cooperate with that committee, for example by providing it with all the documents that are needed to ascertain that public money is being properly used."
"However, in this instance the Council's cooperation was completely inadequate."
"This is why we decided to postpone the discharge until the autumn, so that the checks required for the sake of budgetary transparency can be carried out."
"Sets out its observations in the resolution below; 3. Instructs its President to forward this Decision and the resolution that forms an integral part of it to the Council, the Commission, the Court of Justice of the European Union, the Court of Auditors, the European Ombudsman and the European Data Protection Supervisor, and to arrange for their publication in the Official Journal of the European Union (L series)."
"Through today's report Parliament postpones its decision on granting the Secretary-General of the Council discharge in respect of the implementation of the Council budget for the financial year 2009."
"in writing. - I supported Parliament's decision to postpone granting discharge to the Council as I believe the Council has not provided Parliament with sufficient information regarding its accounts."
"The Council needs to be scrutinised in the same way as every other European institution, and written documents must be provided in order for discharge to be granted."
"The report put a number of questions to Council, many of which have not been answered."
"Without concrete explanations from the Council on specific issues, it is not possible to give them the green light for their accounts."
"The decision to grant discharge will be taken at a later date, when sufficient information has been provided."
"in writing. - (DE) I voted in favour of postponing the decision on the Council discharge for 2009."
"In the light of the new situation created by the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon the continuing refusal of the Council to be subjected to a discharge procedure - thereby taking accountability into account - is unacceptable."
"The Council's expenditure needs to be monitored just as much as that of the other Union bodies if due account is to be taken of the European Transparency Initiative."
"I am voting for this proposal, because I agree with the discharge procedures, with suitable appropriations being proposed for each heading."
"in writing. - (LT) I endorsed this report and discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the Court of Auditors for the financial year 2009."
"For the financial year 2009, the accounts of the Court of Auditors were audited by an external firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers."
"In its conclusions it did not make any significant observations relating to the Court of Auditors."
"I welcome the audit strategy of the Court of Auditors for the period 2009-2012 and support its priority goals - maximising the overall impact from its audits and increasing efficiency by making best use of resources."
"I expect the Court of Auditors to demonstrate the progress in this direction."
"I agree with the rapporteur that in future the Court of Auditors must include more complete information in its reports on the agencies, in particular as regards the conclusions of internal auditors' reports."
"I welcome the measures the Court of Auditors is taking to reform and continuously improve its role in line with Parliament's call for its assessments and audits to have a broader and deeper impact, and for its data to be more reliable."
"It is also noted that there has been steady improvement as regards the proportion of men and women on the staff of the Court of Auditors."
"There has been a reduction in the disparity at assistant, head of unit and director levels."
"I voted in favour of granting discharge in respect of the 2009 general budget of the Court of Auditors because the majority of the pre-established objectives relating to the budget have been met, and detailed and transparent information has been provided."
"I welcome the exhaustive analysis carried out by an external consultant, confirming that the financial statements of the European Court of Auditors give a true and fair picture of its financial situation, and also that funds were correctly used for their intended purposes."
"I also welcome the 2009-2012 audit strategy of the Court of Auditors, which aims to maximise the global impact of its audits and increase efficiency through better use of resources."
"I therefore congratulate the Court of Auditors on its excellent performance in 2009 and agree with the rapporteur with regard to all his conclusions."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this document, because the Secretary-General of the Court of Auditors is granted discharge in respect of the implementation of the Court of Auditors budget for the financial year 2009."
"It is also important that the Court of Auditors is urged to consider the possibility of reorganisation, so that some members would be responsible for certain policy areas and other members for groups of Member States, if national audit authorities are unable to control expenditure from the Union budget effectively."
"It is also noted that recently the number of members of the Court of Auditors has practically doubled, while the number of policy areas have not, and the Court of Auditors could exercise this option."
"Independence, integrity, impartiality, excellence and professionalism are the core values of the Court of Auditors and, in my opinion, we need to underline and uphold them."
"I voted in favour of granting discharge in respect of the European Union general budget for the financial year 2009, Section V - Court of Auditors."
"As we know, the external audit of the EU's budget is carried out by the Court of Auditors itself."
"Therefore, as in the two previous financial years, an external firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers, was appointed to audit its budget."
"The Court of Auditors was commended for the quality of its Annual Activity Report, which showed that its transactions and activities were legal and completely reliable."
"in writing. - I voted for this report and in doing so welcome the audit strategy of the Court of Auditors for the period 2009-2012 and support its priority goals (maximising the overall impact from its audits and increasing efficiency by making best use of resources)."
"I expect the Court of Auditors to report on the steps taken to implement this audit strategy as well as to demonstrate the progress in this direction using the Key Performance Indicators (KPI), in particular with the introduction of KPI 1 to 4 in 2010."
"I particularly welcome the plan to publish follow-ups in respect of the special reports to increase their impact."
"in writing. - This grants the Secretary-General of the Court of Auditors discharge in respect of the implementation of the Court of Auditors budget for the financial year 2009."
"in writing. - (IT) Through today's resolution Parliament grants the Secretary-General of the Court of Auditors discharge in respect of the implementation of the Court of Auditors budget for the financial year 2009."
"Parliament is concerned by the decrease of detailed information in the Court of Auditors' specific annual reports on the agencies and encourages the Court of Auditors in the future to include more complete information in its reports on the agencies, in particular as regards the conclusions of internal auditors' reports."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted against the decision to grant discharge in respect of the implementation of budget of the European Economic and Social Committee for the financial year 2009."
"On 11 March 2011, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) decided to open an investigation into dubious practices by the EESC's secretariat."
"I agree with the rapporteur that the EESC and OLAF should report to the European Parliament on the progress and outcome of the case."
"The EESC and must cooperate fully with OLAF and provide all necessary assistance to OLAF agents to carry out their investigation."
"I believe that the European Parliament Committee on Budgetary Control, responsible for the discharge procedure, must follow up the issue closely in order to obtain additional information on the impact of the OLAF investigation and to take into account the outcome in the 2010 discharge."
"Furthermore, I believe that the allegations presented to OLAF clearly affect the reputation of the Union, because they are directed against one of the European Union's institutions."
"in writing. - (BG) I did not support the discharge in respect of the implementation of the European Union general budget for the financial year 2009, Section VI - European Economic and Social Committee."
"Everyone is aware that this institution's 2009 budget was investigated by OLAF."
"I think that the European Parliament requires more information about events to be able to make the correct decision about this discharge."
"Based on the information provided so far, there are internal breaches in this European institution, described as serious problems relating to the operation of its secretariat."
"I voted in favour of granting the European Economic and Social Committee discharge in respect of its 2009 budget because, despite the issues raised by the recent European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) investigation, I am confident that it is possible to clarify the aspects that were not transparent and to improve reporting procedures for the future."
"We Swedish Social Democrats chose not to grant discharge at this stage to the European Economic and Social Committee for the financial year 2009."
"Following an internal notification OLAF decided to open an investigation, and therefore, in order to be in possession of all the necessary facts, we would like to await the result of this investigation before we grant discharge."
"It is with considerable concern that I note the whistle-blowing in the case of possible mismanagement of the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC), and that it is now the subject of a pending action of the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF)."
"I agree with the rapporteur when he insists that both the EESC and OLAF keep the discharge authority informed about the progress and outcome of the case in question."
"The allegations just made may have a detrimental effect on the EU's reputation, since they refer to the internal workings of one of its institutions, and we need to know whether the identified disruption practices are limited to an isolated action or represent continuous irregularities."
"Nevertheless, I would congratulate the Court of Auditors on the report it has drawn up relating to the EESC and the developments it achieved during the financial year 2009, and I agree with the rapporteur's conclusions."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this document, because the Secretary-General of the European Economic and Social Committee is granted discharge in respect of the implementation of the European Economic and Social Committee budget for the financial year 2009."
"The European Economic and Social Committee is urged to carry out a comprehensive review of expenditure in 2011 in all areas of activity, in order to ensure that all expenditure pays off and it is possible to ascertain areas where savings might be made, which would reduce pressure on the budget in this period of austerity."
"I am pleased that the Court of Auditors indicated in its Annual Report that the audit did not give rise to any significant observations as regards the EESC."
"In 2009, the EESC had commitment appropriations available amounting to a total of EUR 122 000 000 (EUR 118 000 000 in 2008), with a utilisation rate of 98.02 %, which is above the average of the other institutions (97.69 %)."
"in writing. - In voting on this report I call on the EESC, and in particular on its Secretary-General, to cooperate fully with OLAF and to provide all necessary assistance to OLAF agents in carrying out their investigation in relation to allegations of maladministration."
"in writing. - This grants the Secretary-General of the European Economic and Social Committee discharge in respect of the implementation of the European Economic and Social Committee budget for the financial year 2009."
"Through today's resolution Parliament grants the Secretary-General of the European Economic and Social Committee discharge in respect of the implementation of the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) budget for the financial year 2009."
"Parliament considers that the allegations presented to the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) clearly affect the reputation of the Union as they refer to the internal functioning of one its institutions, the EESC, and relate to a serious malfunctioning by its secretariat."
"Parliament also considers that the identified disruption practices are not limited to a single action, but may represent continuous irregularities that constitute an alleged case of maladministration."
"I voted in favour of this report and endorsed the European Parliament's decision to grant discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the Committee of the Regions (CoR) for the financial year 2009."
"The Court of Auditors indicated in its annual report that the audit did not give rise to any significant observations as regards the CoR."
"I welcome the fact that in 2009 the CoR updated its budget-analytical monitoring tool (BudgetWatch), providing more comprehensive information on the CoR's budget, facilitating the implementation of the CoR's budgetary resources and identifying the areas which require management attention."
"I agree with the rapporteur that CoR members must declare their financial interests, disclosing relevant information on declarable professional activities."
"The CoR must follow up this issue in its Annual Activity Report."
"in writing. - (BG) I do not support the discharge in respect of the implementation of the Committee of the Regions' budget because this institution is only a consultative body."
"As it is also a body representing the interests of the European regions, I think that its funding should come entirely from the regions."
"in writing. - (IT) I voted in favour of authorising discharge of the 2009 general budget of the Committee of the Regions."
"I did so not only because the annual activities reports been admirably prepared, but also because the techniques for editing and collecting information have been innovated and improved in pursuit of greater transparency."
"I welcome the conclusions of the audit of the Court of Auditors, whose annual report states that the audit did not give rise to any significant findings."
"I also welcome the excellent performance and high quality that continues to characterise the annual reports on the activities of the Committee of the Regions."
"Finally, I agree with the rapporteur's conclusions and commend the Committee of the Regions on including the follow-up given to Parliament's previous discharge decisions."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this document, because the Secretary-General of the Committee of the Regions (CoR) is granted discharge in respect of the implementation of the CoR budget for the financial year 2009."
"The CoR is urged to carry out a comprehensive review of expenditure in 2011 in all areas of activity, in order to ensure that all expenditure is beneficial and to ascertain possible savings, because this would reduce pressure on the budget in this period of austerity."
"In 2009, the CoR had commitment appropriations available amounting to a total of EUR 88 000 000 (EUR 93 000 000 in 2008), with a utilisation rate of 98.37 %, which is above the average of the other institutions (97.69 %)."
"At the same time, the Court of Auditors indicated in its annual report that the audit did not give rise to any significant observations as regards the CoR."
"I commend the CoR for the consistently high quality of its Annual Activity Reports, and welcome the inclusion of the follow-up to the Parliament's previous discharge decisions."
"in writing. - (IT) First of all, I would like to thank all those who worked on the text as well as to congratulate the Committee of the Regions, whose audit has not given rise to any significant observations."
"I would highlight, moreover, that in 2009 the Committee of the Regions had a total of EUR 88 million of available commitment appropriations (2008: EUR 93 million), with a utilisation rate of 98.37%, which is higher than the average of other institutions (97.69%)."
"All transactions and activities carried out by the Committee of the Regions were completed in a wholly legal and regular manner."
"in writing. - I voted for this report giving discharge to the Committee of the Regions (CoR), and I am pleased that, in our resolution, Parliament 'reconfirms its position that, in the interests of transparency, declarations of financial interests of members of all Union institutions should be accessible on the Internet via a public register; reminds the CoR of its request that CoR members declare their financial interests, disclosing relevant information on declarable professional activities and remunerated posts or activities; notes with satisfaction the CoR response on the matter, in particular the letter of the president of the CoR of 11 February 2011; requests the CoR to follow up this issue in its Annual Activity Report'."
"in writing. - This grants the Secretary-General of the Committee of the Regions discharge in respect of the implementation of the Committee of the Regions budget for the financial year 2009."
"in writing. - (IT) With today's resolution, Parliament grants discharge to the Secretary-General of the Committee of the Regions for the implementation of the budget of the Committee of the Regions for the financial year 2009."
"Parliament commends the Committee of the Regions for the consistently high quality of its Annual Activity Reports and welcomes the inclusion of the follow-up to Parliament's previous discharge decisions."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this report and endorsed the European Parliament's decision to grant the Commission discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the Eighth, Ninth and Tenth European Development Funds (EDF) for the financial year 2009."
"The EDF is the main instrument for providing Union development aid to the people of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries and the overseas countries and territories."
"The Court of Auditors judges that the final annual accounts of the Eighth, Ninth and Tenth EDFs present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the EDFs as of 31 December 2009."
"I also agree with the rapporteur that there should be EDF budgetisation, which will strengthen the democratic control, accountability and transparency of funding and will provide more coherence in Union policy concerning ACP countries."
"I also believe that, within the scope of the revision of the guidelines on budgetary support by the Commission, particular attention must be given to supervisory and control systems."
"The Commission must strengthen monitoring and annual reporting on compliance."
"in writing. - (BG) During a financial crisis, the European Union needs to focus its expenditure on dealing with the crisis."
"Around 15% of citizens in the European Union live below the poverty threshold."
"What significance do the Eight, Ninth and Tenth European Development Funds have for these people?"
"I am not against the European Development Funds, but I think that, in order to support the other countries, the European Union needs to deal with its own problems first."
"I am sure that these 15% of European Union citizens expect the same."
"I voted in favour of the authorisation to discharge the Eighth, Ninth and Tenth European Development Funds for 2009."
"I did so because, on reading the report, I was able to see how effectively the resources have been managed with respect to achieving the established objectives."
"Moreover, I agree with the development priorities and believe that the accounting procedures are perfectly calibrated for the ex-ante prevention of errors, fraud and hoarding by subjects with no entitlement."
"The European Development Funds (EDF) continue to constitute the principal instrument that the EU has for granting development aid to the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries and the Overseas Countries and Territories (OCTs) and, though implemented according to specific financial rules, remain outside the EU budget."
"It therefore urgently needs to be integrated with the EU budget to enable increased democratic control, accountability and transparency of financing."
"This report makes an exhaustive analysis of the budgetary situation of the eighth, ninth and tenth EDF, drawing attention to some important questions that urgently require the review and implementation of ex ante controls in the delegations and internal control systems of the partner countries, particularly with regard to public tender procedures."
"Finally, this report shows once more that there is still a long way to go with regard to management of the EDF and their proper use, which is why I agree with all the rapporteur's conclusions and congratulate him on his work."
"Greater consistency is needed in EU development aid and cooperation policy, particularly with regard to the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries."
"This is even more important now, when these countries are faced with enormous pressures - and even blackmail - from the EU to accept impositions in the form of the 'Economic Partnership Agreements' that threaten their interests and compromise the effectiveness of the support provided under instruments such as the European Development Funds (EDF)."
"The rapporteur maintains that the incorporation of the EDF into the Union budget will strengthen democratic control, accountability and transparency of financing."
"We would stress the warning that this incorporation of the EDF into the EU general budget must not lead to an overall reduction in development spending with regard to the two current finance instruments."
"As the rapporteur mentioned it, we would also stress the need to study and assess the best ways to increase destination countries' capacities for absorbing EDF aid, which immediately means the profound involvement of both governments and peoples in outlining and implementing programmes, and in setting priorities."
"As the rapporteur says, full knowledge of appropriate expenditure is also necessary."
"We are well aware that greater consistency is needed in EU development aid and cooperation policy, particularly with regard to the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries."
"This is even more important now, when these countries are faced with enormous pressures - and even blackmail - from the EU to accept impositions that threaten their interests and compromise the effectiveness of the support provided under instruments such as the European Development Funds (EDF); the so-called Economic Partnership Agreements are a good example."
"The report maintains that the incorporation of the EDF into the Union budget will strengthen democratic control, accountability and transparency of financing."
"We would stress the warning that this incorporation of the EDF into the EU general budget must not lead to an overall reduction in development spending with regard to the two current finance instruments."
"As the rapporteur mentioned it, we would also stress the need to study and assess the best ways to increase destination countries' capacities for absorbing EDF aid, which immediately means the profound involvement of both governments and peoples in outlining and implementing programmes, and in setting priorities."
"in writing. - I voted to give discharge to the European Development Funds."
"I welcome the fact that Parliament, in its report, reiterates its support for EDF budgetisation, which will strengthen the democratic control, accountability and transparency of funding and will provide more coherence in Union policy in relation to the ACP countries."
"The report refers to the Commission's statement to the effect that it wants to propose to incorporate the EDF into the Union budget during discussions on the next financial framework, and that it will keep Parliament's Committee on Budgetary Control fully informed of this initiative."
"Parliament insists, however, that the incorporation of the EDF into the Union budget must not lead to any overall reduction in development spending with respect to the two current funding instruments."
"It urges the Council and the Member States to respond positively to the Commission's proposal and to agree that the EDF will be fully incorporated in the Union budget from 2014 onwards, as part of the next financial framework."
"It believes this measure to be long overdue, and that budgetisation of the EDF should take place at the earliest possible date."
"in writing. - This grants the Commission discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the Eighth, Ninth and Tenth European Development Funds for the financial year 2009."
"With today's resolution, Parliament grants the Commission discharge for the execution of the budget of the Eighth, Ninth and Tenth European Development Funds (EDFs) for the financial year 2009."
"I stress that Parliament notes that the EDF is not integrated in the EU budget, despite being the main instrument for providing Union development aid to the populations of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries as well as the Overseas Countries and Territories (OCT)."
"in writing. - (DE) I voted in favour of Mr Staes' report, because among other things he speaks once again in favour of the European Development Funds (EDFs) being included in the budget, thereby fulfilling the principles of democratic control, accountability and transparency of funding."
"On the other hand, he was also critical of certain weaknesses found, such as those found by the European Court of Auditors relating to public procurement procedures and a wide variety of other controls."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this report and agree that the European Parliament should postpone its decision to grant discharge in respect of the implementation of budget of the European Medicines Agency for the financial year 2009."
"In its report on the accounts of the Agency, the Court of Auditors qualified its opinion on the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions."
"The Court of Auditors found errors in the procurement procedures corresponding to a significant amount of the Agency's total budget for the financial year 2009."
"I agree with the rapporteur that the Agency must improve the quality of its procurement procedures in order to put an end to the shortcomings identified by the Court of Auditors."
"The Agency's Internal Audit Service found particularly serious shortcomings in the area of medicine evaluation."
"I find it unacceptable that the Agency does not apply the relevant rules effectively, meaning that there is no guarantee that the evaluation of human medicines is performed by independent experts."
"The Agency is not complying effectively with its code of conduct by setting out principles and guidance on independence and confidentiality applicable to the management board and committee members, experts and Agency staff."
"I agree that the Agency must inform the European Parliament of the steps it has taken since its inception to ensure the independence of its experts."
"I voted against the authorisation to discharge the 2009 general budget of the European Medicines Agency."
"I did so because, as reported by the Court of Auditors, there were some irregularities in the transactions on which the accounts are based, which cause concerns about the correct use of funds."
"I am therefore in favour of postponing the closure of accounts for the financial year 2009 so that further management checks can be carried out."
"In the absence of sufficient guarantees as to the independence of the experts recruited to perform scientific assessments on medicines for human use, we have voted to postpone granting the Executive Director of the European Medicines Agency discharge in respect of the implementation of the Agency's budget for the financial year 2009."
"In particular, this issue of independence concerns the assessment of the appetite suppressant benfluorex, the active ingredient in the product Mediator, which may have suffered from conflicts of interest."
"It appears that this drug may have been responsible for the deaths of an estimated 500-2 000 people and caused severe heart damage in thousands of others."
"This case reveals a degree of failure of expert assessments and raises the question of the experts' skill and independence in our risk society."
"We must therefore be seen to be extremely vigilant."
"This is why we refused to give our blanket approval."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of the report on discharge of the budget of the European Medicines Agency for the financial year 2009, since it contributes to scrutiny of how funds are used by the European institutions."
"However, I consider it necessary to introduce improvements with regard to the identification and management of conflicts of interest, and to procurement procedures."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this document, because it postpones the decision on granting the Executive Director of the European Medicines Agency discharge in respect of the implementation of the Agency's budget for the financial year 2009 and postpones the closure of the accounts of the European Medicines Agency for the financial year 2009."
"The main reasons are as follows: failure to issue a formal invitation to tender, failure to prepare detailed technical specifications in advance, failure to clearly define in the technical specifications all the products to be purchased before the negotiation started, failure to appoint an evaluation committee and failure to prepare an evaluation report."
"The shortcomings indicated in the report also need to be remedied, because the Agency is a source of important scientific advice, science-based recommendations, and best practice for medicine evaluation and supervision in the Union."
"With today's vote Parliament has decided to postpone the closure of the accounts of the European Medicines Agency for the financial year 2009."
"We felt unable to grant discharge because, as a result of the checks and assessments carried out, the Court of Auditors revealed several matters of significant importance."
"The main concerns regard the management of procurement procedures and criteria used for recruiting staff."
"I therefore add my voice to the request for information made to the Agency, in which the Agency is also urged to inform the discharge authority, by 30 June 2011, of the measures taken and improvements achieved regarding all these worrying issues."
"As it is required to do each year, the European Parliament has been asked for a decision on whether the Union budget has been properly implemented by the various agencies and institutions who are responsible for it."
"The sums are allocated for specific purposes and the aim of the discharge procedure is to check in retrospect that these purposes have been adhered to."
"This is an important prerogative of Parliament, as illustrated for example by its influence on the resignation of the Santer Commission in 1999."
"This year, together with the vast majority of Members of the European Parliament, I refused to grant the European Medicines Agency discharge in respect of its activity in the 2009 financial year This is because the independence of experts recruited to perform scientific assessments on medicines for human use has not been properly guaranteed."
"For example, doubts still remain about possible conflicts of interest in relation to the assessment of the appetite suppressant benfluorex."
"The agency's procurement procedures and criteria for recruiting staff have also attracted criticism."
"While the Mediator scandal prompts us to reinforce our precautions before allowing medicines to be placed on the market, the serious malfunctioning of the European Medicines Agency must be penalised."
"in writing. - The report on the 2009 discharge for the European Medicines Agency provided for postponement of the discharge."
"I voted in favour of this report for three main reasons."
"Firstly, the European Court of Auditors found serious irregularities in several procurement procedures, including in one IT contract worth around EUR 30 million."
"Because of these errors, best value for money was not ensured."
"Secondly, the European Medicines Agency breached personnel selection rules, and thirdly it failed to prevent conflicts of interest: a month after retiring from the Agency, the former Executive Director joined a consultancy which, inter alia, advises pharmaceutical companies on developing new medicinal products and reducing the time period to their market introduction."
"Although the European Medicines Agency Management Board eventually decided to set limits with regard to the former Executive Director's new and future professional activities, the discharge authority needs further explanations from the Agency on how cases of conflict of interest are actually handled."
"I voted in favour of postponing the decision on discharge for the 2009 financial year, as the Court of Auditors qualified its opinion on the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying the accounts for the 2009 financial year."
"Among other things, the Court drew attention to carryovers and cancellations of significant budget appropriations: for example 38% of the budget under the title 'Buildings, Equipment and Miscellaneous Operating Expenditure' was carried over to 2010."
"EUR 14.8 million of this carryover was for activities as yet not implemented (or, in some cases, for goods not received) at the year-end, which is at odds with the budgetary principle of annuality."
"The Court of Auditors highlighted weaknesses in the management of fees, with significant delays in issuing recovery orders (up to 21 months), as well as weaknesses in the Agency's treasury policy and failings in its management of procurement procedures."
"The report notes that, of the 32 recommendations drawn up by the Internal Audit Service (IAS), one recommendation, on the Agency's implementing procedures regarding experts, was classed as 'critical' and 12, relating primarily to human resources management and management of conflicts of interest calling staff members into question were classed as 'very important'."
"in writing. - This postpones Parliament's decision on granting the Executive Director of the European Medicines Agency discharge in respect of the implementation of the Agency's budget for the 2009 financial year."
"With today's resolution, Parliament postpones the decision to grant discharge to the Executive Director of the European Medicines Agency for the execution of the Agency's budget for the financial year 2009."
"Parliament's decision to postpone is due to the fact that in its report on the annual accounts for 2009, the Court of Auditors has qualified its opinion as to the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions."
"I voted in favour of the Stavrakakis report proposing to postpone the decision on discharge for the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) in respect of the 2009 financial year."
"The Court of Auditors qualified its opinion on the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying its accounts for the 2009 financial year."
"I consider that Members of Parliament need further evidence before they can propose to grant or refuse discharge to this agency."
"A hearing with EMEA has been scheduled to this effect for mid-July."
"in writing. - (LT) I endorsed this report and discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights for the financial year 2009."
"According to information provided by the Court of Auditors, the Agency's annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"I agree with the rapporteur that the Agency must improve its budgetary and recruitment planning in order to redress the lack of consistency between its budgetary and staff forecasting, and to make progress in ensuring, as far as possible, a realistic evaluation of tenders."
"The Agency must inform the European Parliament of the actions taken to improve the programming and monitoring of its contracts, in order to avoid, in future, the deficiencies reported by the Court of Auditors."
"The Agency must take all the measures necessary to implement the recommendations made by the Court of Auditors."
"The agency's purpose is to provide the institutions and authorities of the European Union and its Member States with assistance and skills in the field of fundamental rights, and to help them adopt measures and define appropriate action, within the scope of EU law."
"The agency's main tasks are to collect, analyse and publish objective, reliable and comparable information on the fundamental rights situation in the EU; to improve the comparability and reliability of data using new methods and rules; to carry out and/or promote research work and studies in the field of fundamental rights; to formulate and publish conclusions and opinions on specific issues, either on its own initiative or at the request of the European Parliament, Council or Commission; and to promote dialogue with civil society in order to make the general public more aware of fundamental rights."
"I am pleased to note that, having opened its investigation of the agency in 2008, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) closed it with no further action."
"I voted in favour of this document, because the Director of the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights is granted discharge in respect of the implementation of the Agency's budget for the financial year 2009."
"The Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"It goes without saying that out of the nine recommendations of the Internal Audit Service (IAS), following an audit on financial management, four are still to be implemented by the Agency."
"These concern financing decisions, information needs for reporting and monitoring purposes, work programmes showing all available resources of the budget, and financial procedures and checklists."
"The Agency must take measures to implement the recommendations."
"The Court of Auditors has been able to obtain reasonable assurances that the annual accounts of the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights for the financial year 2009 are in all material respects reliable and that the underlying transactions, taken as a whole, are legal and regular."
"The Court of Auditors commented that the Agency could improve its budgetary and recruitment planning, notably as regards transfers between titles, the high vacancy rate (21%) and the high volume of appropriations carried forward."
"The Agency must take all necessary steps to improve the situation."
"In today's vote I have given my backing to the request for discharge with respect to the implementation of the budget of the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights for 2009."
"After careful assessment of the Agency's budget, the Court of Auditors, which is responsible for external financial control, declared that it has obtained reasonable assurances as to the legality and reliability of the pertinent transactions."
"I believe, however, that the request made to the Agency to make efforts to improve its budgetary and recruitment planning is absolutely fair."
"In the same vein, I applaud the resolve shown by the Agency to avoid future recurrences of the shortcomings highlighted by the Court of Auditors in its report."
"in writing. - I voted for this resolution on the Agency for Fundamental Rights and I support calls on the Agency to make progress in ensuring, as far as possible, a realistic evaluation of tenders."
"The resolution notes that the Court of Auditors reported on this issue in respect of the award of three framework contracts of a total amount of EUR 2 575 000, and stresses, in particular, that in these three cases the financial offers differed considerably both in unit prices and in the tenderers' estimates of the number of man-days necessary for implementation of the same scenario."
"in writing. - This grants the Director of the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights discharge in respect of the implementation of the Agency's budget for the financial year 2009."
"With today's resolution Parliament grants discharge to the Director of the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights for the implementation of the Agency's budget for the financial year 2009."
"Parliament welcomes the Agency's pledge to improve the planning and monitoring of its contracts to avoid, in the future, the deficiencies reported by the Court of Auditors."
"Parliament therefore calls on the Agency to inform the discharge authority of the action taken in this respect."
"in writing. - (LT) I endorsed this report and discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Joint Undertaking for ITER and the Development of Fusion Energy for the financial year 2009."
"According to information provided by the Court of Auditors, the Joint Undertaking's annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable and the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"The Joint Undertaking is in a start-up phase and had not yet fully established its internal control and financial reporting systems by the end of 2009."
"The introduction of these systems needs to be completed immediately."
"The Joint Undertaking's utilisation rate for payment appropriations was 65.3%."
"I agree that the Joint Undertaking is still in a start-up period and that the underspending mostly relates to delays in the progress of the Euratom fusion programme, as was also reported by the Court of Auditors in 2008."
"I agree with the rapporteur that it is important to provide for the conditions under which unspent funds are transferred to the following year."
"In view of the size of its budget, the Joint Undertaking should establish an audit committee."
"I voted in favour of authorising the 2009 discharge in respect of budget of the Joint Undertaking for ITER and the Development of Fusion Energy because the report shows that the accounts and the pertinent transactions are held to be reliable."
"Some inconsistencies were found, though these were due to the fact that the Joint Undertaking concerned is still in its start-up phase."
"I therefore believe that, under the careful guidance of the Commission, the auditing system and budgetary management could be improved and that the Joint Undertaking could finish implementing its internal controls and financial reporting systems."
"The objectives of the joint undertaking are to provide the contribution of the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) to the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) International Fusion Energy Organisation and to 'Broader Approach' activities with Japan for the rapid realisation of fusion energy, and to prepare and coordinate a programme of activities in preparation for the construction of a demonstration fusion reactor (DEMO) and related facilities including the International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility (IFMIF)."
"In addition to its other activities, the main tasks of the joint undertaking are to oversee the preparation of the site for the ITER project, to provide the ITER organisation with material, financial and human resources, to coordinate scientific and technological research and development activities in the field of fusion, and to act as an interface with the ITER organisation."
"The Court of Auditors identified, and the rapporteur emphasised, the existence of various aspects of the budget to be improved, in particular those relating to the exceptions to budgetary principles, to the role of the Commission's Internal Audit Service, to the creation of an audit committee, to the late payment of members' contributions, and to the rules relating to the award of grants."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this document, because the Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"The European Joint Undertaking for ITER and the Development of Fusion Energy is in a start-up phase and had not yet fully established its internal control and financial reporting systems by the end of 2009."
"It should also be recognised that consequently the underspending mostly relates to delays in the progress of the Euratom fusion programme, as was also reported by the Court of Auditors in 2008."
"The Joint Undertaking must amend its Financial Regulation in order to integrate the Court of Auditors' recommendations made in its Opinion No 4/2008 on that Regulation."
"I believe that further improvement is necessary in relation to the exceptions to budgetary principles, the role of the Internal Audit Service, the establishment of an audit committee, late payment of members' contributions, the rules on the award of grants and the transitional provisions set out in Article 133 of the ITER Financial Regulation."
"in writing. - I voted to give discharge to the Joint Undertaking for ITER and the Development of Fusion Energy."
"I am of the opinion that, in view of the size of its budget and the complexity of its tasks, the Joint Undertaking should establish an audit committee, reporting directly to the Governing Board."
"in writing. - I have voted AGAINST granting the Director of the European Joint Undertaking for ITER and the Development of Fusion Energy discharge in respect of the implementation of the Joint Undertaking's budget for the 2009 financial year."
"Through today's resolution Parliament grants discharge to the Director of the European Joint Undertaking for ITER and the Development of Fusion Energy for the implementation of the Joint Undertaking's budget for the financial year 2009."
"Parliament urges the Joint Venture to amend its Financial Regulation in order to integrate the Court of Auditors' recommendations."
"Parliament has approved the implementation of the 2009 budget of the forward-looking international scientific project ITER."
"I welcome this vote, which negates the futile polemics about the viability of this undertaking, which is the only one of its kind in the world."
"Parliament has drawn attention to the problems and delays during the start-up phase and has called for its internal audit system to be improved."
"I see in this a signal of encouragement aimed at guaranteeing the long-term future and success of this undertaking in which the world's major powers are participating."
"I wanted to use my vote to reaffirm my confidence in this extremely ambitious scientific adventure, which is expected to have significant benefits."
"Fusion is designed to provide the world's population with energy that is clean, permanent and safe."
"It will contribute towards our steps to combat global warming and towards our energy independence."
"We must set aside resources that are in keeping with the significance of the issues at stake, and I would like to explain for information purposes that the size of the budget allocated and the delays we have noted relate to the technical and organisational complexity of this unique project."
"It is down to the EU to preserve its image by strengthening its commitment to ITER and demanding that its partners do the same."
"I am voting for this proposal, because I agree with the discharge procedures, with suitable appropriations being proposed for each heading."
"The times of crisis we are experiencing require us to pay particular attention to the way the EU's financial resources are spent."
"The priorities set out by Parliament must be fully respected in order to increase savings by exercising increasingly rigorous financial management."
"Results can only be improved through continuous self-criticism, which will enable the correction of all trajectories that deviate from the objectives set by the EU."
"Since the Committee on Budgetary Control proposes the adoption of this discharge, I agree with the rapporteur's recommendations and am voting for this report."
"In the wake of the floods that devastated Pakistan in 2010, the Council called for emergency measures to support the country."
"I tabled an amendment rejecting the regulation proposed by the Commission, as trade preferences of this nature are a good idea in theory but not in practice."
"Our response to a humanitarian crisis cannot be based on trade, especially considering that it is now one year on from the disaster and the urgency is not as strong."
"This type of support is illogical and prejudicial, as some people in Europe, in particular those working in the textiles industry in several of the southern countries, will end up paying for support for Pakistan that we should all be paying for collectively."
"Furthermore, by only targeting certain industries, we are not helping all Pakistanis."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this report."
"Presented after the unprecedented floods that devastated last summer a vast portion of Pakistan's territory, the Commission's proposal seeks to extend autonomous trade preferences to this country concerning 75 product lines of interest to Pakistan (mostly textile and clothing) in the form of exemption from custom duties, with the exception of one product (ethanol) for which a tariff-rate quota would apply."
"in writing. - (BG) I fully support the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council introducing emergency autonomous trade preferences for Pakistan."
"Trade preferences are hugely important to Pakistan because they will provide sustainable development to a country which has suffered several natural disasters recently."
"In addition to concluding the agreement with Pakistan, the European Union will have to play a key role in convincing India to support the agreement within the framework of the World Trade Organisation."
"I welcome the aid given to Pakistan by the European Union, as the world's largest donor of humanitarian aid, following natural disasters that devastated the country's economy and population."
"However, the use of EU trade policy as a form of humanitarian and development aid is deeply flawed."
"In my view, the Commission should never propose such measures without having first quantified the economic and social impact on the various regions of the EU."
"One of the most serious results of these measures could be in Portugal, where the textile and clothing industry represents 11% of exports and 160 000 jobs, and would be hit hard by subsidised competition from Pakistan."
"In the wake of the severe floods that hit Pakistan in the summer of 2010, the European Union wished to provide aid in the form of exceptional trade preferences."
"Whilst the purpose behind this initiative is commendable, it is worth questioning how useful it will be in practice and to ask ourselves whether this economic aid will actually reach the Pakistani people, especially small-scale producers and farmers who have been particularly affected by the floods."
"The Commission's trade-based aid plan must go through a specific procedure: it must obtain Parliament's approval but also that of the WTO, since these trade preferences deviate from basic international trade rules."
"Parliament has just given the Commission the green light to continue talks with the WTO but has insisted on restricting their duration and scope."
"One might question the wisdom of choosing this slow, drawn-out aid procedure instead of other faster, more effective forms of aid that would have already reached Pakistan by now."
"I voted in favour of this report."
"I was keen in particular that we should ensure effective monitoring of the trends of imports of products covered by this Regulation as far in advance as possible and establish customs surveillance on these imports."
"I am also in favour of the idea that a quarterly report should be submitted on the application and implementation of the monitoring."
"This report is on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council introducing emergency autonomous trade preferences for Pakistan."
"In terms of humanitarian aid, the European Union always leads the way."
"That was the case last summer, when floods devastated a large part of Pakistan, with enormous human and material losses."
"In addition to humanitarian assistance in the first hours of the disaster, the EU also has sought other ways to support the economic recovery of the country embodied in the proposed regulation."
"However, we have to ensure protection against aspects that could damage some European trade sectors, namely textiles."
"In addition, I belief that 'trade preferences' are not the right way to help a country that is the victim of a disaster."
"These preferences may even give rise to a dangerous precedent."
"We cannot forget that the current economic and financial crisis has placed those companies most exposed to globalisation in a vulnerable situation, and it is not acceptable that 'trade preferences' could have a detrimental effect on them."
"We Swedish Social Democrats support the Commission's proposal to suspend all duties on certain imports from Pakistan for a limited time following the floods there last year."
"As the purpose of these trade preferences is to try to support Pakistan's recovery and future development, we believe that they should be offensive and far-reaching without safeguard measures for the EU, particularly as they are to be for a limited time only."
"We advocate respect for human rights, including the rights of workers, and for social and environmental standards and democratic principles and for this to always be included as conditions in a trade agreement."
"We voted against the extensive human rights requirements proposed in the report, as it is completely unreasonable to expect Pakistan to be able to comply with them before the trade preferences are intended to begin."
"Instead, we believe that the EU should have demanded improvements in these areas that could have been implemented quickly, particularly in view of the fact that these demands will be made if a trade agreement between the EU and Pakistan should be entered into at a later date."
"As we have already said more than once, the tragedy Pakistan has suffered requires European solidarity."
"However, this cannot be a pretext for putting the textile industry of several Member States, such as Portugal, at risk."
"There are other ways of showing solidarity: more effective forms of aid, aimed at re-establishing the affected areas and improving the living conditions of the affected people; based on a policy of effective and lasting development cooperation and aid, which supports the integrated and sustainable development of local communities."
"There are also, however, more equitable forms of aid."
"These trade concessions mainly benefit the major European importers, who thus see long-held aspirations satisfied."
"On the other hand, they damage the textile industry and the countries and regions most dependent on it."
"All this against a backdrop of a severe economic crisis and high unemployment."
"While it is true that there is no way the measures proposed by the Commission can be a pretext for new job losses and increased exploitation in European industry, at the same time, we cannot ignore the objective difficulties that they will create."
"The report acknowledges these, amongst attempts to 'sugar the pill' with the introduction of safeguards that do not change its substance."
"in writing. - (PT) This is just another example of defending the interests of European Union's large companies and financial institutions, at the expense of industry in the countries with the most fragile economies."
"By introducing emergency autonomous trade preferences for Pakistan, the European Commission is bringing the narrow commercial interests of a few - business, pure and simple - into the field of humanitarian aid."
"It is an exercise in hypocrisy, which uses the natural disaster that has devastated Pakistan to satisfy the aspirations of a few big companies in the EU's powers, which will damage the EU textile industry, and the countries and regions most dependent on it."
"It is a serious blow for a sector that has been hit hard by the liberalisation of world trade; that is concentrated in regions with high levels of unemployment and poverty, and little economic diversification, such as several regions in northern and central Portugal."
"Therefore, we voted for the proposal to reject the agreement, and regret that it was not adopted."
"However, we also voted for it to return to the Commission, in the hope that it is still possible to take into account the position of the Portuguese Parliament, which adopted a resolution against these trade concessions."
"The necessary solidarity with Pakistan must be genuine aid based on development aid and cooperation policy."
"Last year, there were severe floods in Pakistan."
"The Commission's idea for financing reconstruction consisted in opening up EU territory to imports of textiles and other sensitive products without imposing customs duties or, in most cases, quotas, with no consideration for the threat that European businesses would face from this new one-sided competition."
"This alone would have been sufficient grounds for voting against this report."
"This House refused to reject the report, even though a clause was introduced stating that this special trade agreement may be ended if Pakistan is found to be supporting terrorist organisations."
"It contented itself with postponing the final vote."
"It seems that we really do need to dispel the ambiguities as to where the Pakistani authorities really stand once and for all, whether it be on sheltering terrorists, helping the Taliban, especially in tribal areas, or persecution of Christians."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this document."
"Presented after the unprecedented floods that devastated last summer a vast portion of Pakistan's territory, the Commission's proposal seeks to extend autonomous trade preferences to this country concerning 75 product lines of interest to Pakistan (mostly textile and clothing) in the form of exemption from custom duties, with the exception of one product (ethanol) for which a tariff-rate quota would apply."
"However, although the autonomous trade preferences would be extended to Pakistan for 3 years, a full impact assessment of the proposed measures has not been carried out by the Commission prior to the adoption of the proposal for a regulation."
"In addition, it should be noted that the Commission's proposal does not impose any burden on Pakistan in the field of human and social rights, contrary to what would have happened had GSP+ status been granted to this country."
"Although it might be argued that, due to the particular set of circumstances that led to the decision to grant autonomous trade preferences to Pakistan, the proposed measures will not create a binding precedent, this explanation is not entirely convincing."
"Indeed, it cannot be excluded that the decision to grant autonomous trade preferences for flood-stricken Pakistan may be followed by other similar initiatives in the future."
"Furthermore, there is a risk that adopting autonomous trade preferences decoupled from any kind of human rights conditionality would in fact undermine the current system of EU preferences based on the respect of a set of fundamental rights and values."
"in writing. - (DE) The European Union is known throughout the world for providing assistance where assistance is needed."
"The EU proved this once again by rapidly making aid payments following the dramatic floods and their repercussions in Pakistan in 2010."
"As a next step, the Commission intended giving Pakistan a lift economically and guaranteeing that duties will be suspended on textiles and ethanol."
"This approach seems to be highly controversial."
"The fact is, however, that this initiative first has to be given the green light at World Trade Organisation (WTO) level."
"Only then should Parliament become active and make a decision."
"in writing. - I very much regret that, during the vote on autonomous trade preferences for Pakistan, Parliament agreed to reduce the length of the benefits to one year, thus reducing significantly any gain to Pakistan."
"I voted in favour, particularly in consideration of the amendment in which we see that: 'Without prejudice to the conditions set out in paragraph 1, entitlement to benefit from the preferential arrangements introduced by Article 1 is subject to respect for human rights, including core labour rights, and the fundamental principles of democracy by Pakistan.'"
"Respect for human rights must be a necessary precondition for any kind of agreement with third countries."
"This report allows us to make the aid we grant an already devastated country dependent on that country's undertaking to give up all forms of trade protectionism."
"This is an inequitable proposal and I am voting against this report."
"in writing. - As is known, after the unprecedented and devastating floods in Pakistan in July and August 2010, the European Council at its meeting on 16 September mandated Ministers to agree urgently a comprehensive package of short-, medium- and longer-term measures which will help underpin Pakistan's recovery and future development."
"The draft regulation extends autonomous trade preferences to Pakistan by suspending for a limited period of time all tariffs for certain products of export interest to Pakistan."
"A list of 75 dutiable product lines of importance for Pakistan's exports has been established (mainly textile and clothing)."
"The selected product lines amount to almost EUR 900 million in import value, accounting for about 27% of EU imports from Pakistan (EUR 3.3 billion)."
"I voted 'in favour'."
"in addition to promising over EUR 415 million in immediate aid, the EU is also responding to the flood disaster in Pakistan by means of exceptional trade measures to boost Pakistan's exports."
"The European Commission proposed a package of 75 tariff lines relating to Pakistan's main export sectors in the areas worst affected by the floods."
"Pakistan's trade with the Union consists mainly of textiles and clothing products, which according to information from the Commission accounted for 73.7% of Pakistani exports to the Union in 2009."
"In the EU's assessment, granting these trade preferences should only cause limited adverse effects on the Internal Market and should not affect negatively the least developed members of the World Trade Organisation (WTO)."
"Notwithstanding this, it must be expected that the unilateral suspension of duties will lead to infringement proceedings at the WTO."
"If Pakistan is allowed to join the ranks of those countries that enjoy preferential tariff rates - in other words, if it is to be included in the so-called 'GSP+' list - then the matter could be said to have resolved itself."
"Uncoordinated hasty reactions are hardly helpful."
"The textile and clothing industry in particular is in a time of crisis in a number of Member States as a result of transformation."
"Negative effects of the trade preferences cannot therefore be ruled out, which is why I rejected the report."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted against granting trade preferences to Pakistan through exemption from import duties on the pretext of the floods that occurred last year."
"I do not think there is any logic in using exceptional trade preferences, against the rules of international trade law, as a means of emergency aid, which has its own instruments."
"The European Union has never done this before and nor have other countries."
"No other developed country has followed the same path: not the US, Japan, Australia, New Zealand or Canada."
"Even if the advantages given to Pakistan were a kind of 'prize' for its role in Afghanistan, I believe using trade preferences as a political instrument establishes a dangerous precedent."
"Moreover, the trade advantages given to Pakistan will be paid for by the European industries most affected, namely the textile industry of southern Europe, and also by the poor countries that export the same products to Europe, which will suffer from the diversion of European imports to Pakistan, for example Bangladesh or the countries of North Africa."
"However, I voted in favour of the tabled amendments, which substantially mitigate the negative impact of the proposal: safeguard clause, limit of one year and the human rights clause."
"in writing. - (DE) Nobody is disputing that developing countries - such as Pakistan, which has been repeatedly devastated by floods - must be supported."
"Nonetheless, the EU must ensure that its partner countries in such trade agreements also meet certain requirements, particularly if duties are to be suspended."
"We cannot allow such suspension of duties to damage our domestic textiles industry - with the EU having not the slightest concern over whether these products are produced using child labour or whether the funds received go directly towards supporting terrorism."
"Wide-ranging duty exemptions must therefore be linked to an absolute obligation to respect human rights."
"I am thinking, for example, of Christian minorities and women's rights."
"The blasphemy law in that country is particularly worrying: anyone who insults Mohammed is sentenced to death."
"Fundamentalism is widespread in Pakistan across all levels of society - all the more so since the death of Osama Bin Laden - including among the students at the famous International Islamic University."
"The argument that the trade preferences promote prosperity and combat radicalism therefore does not hold water."
"The EU must not simply grant trade preferences where this ignores important matters of basic law."
"I therefore voted against the report."
"Following the floods that devastated a vast portion of Pakistan's territory last summer, the Commission tabled a proposal to grant the country extensive autonomous trade preferences in the form of exemption from customs duties, affecting 75 product lines of interest to Pakistan: essentially textiles and clothing."
"This measure, presented as temporary, but for a period of three years, would have a major impact on Portuguese textiles, so I voted against this report."
"However, since the report has been adopted, I successfully advocated limiting the duration of the trade preferences to one year from the date these measures come into force, in order to minimise the repercussions on Portuguese textiles."
"The period could potentially be extended following a thorough assessment of the impact on European textiles, to be presented by the Commission."
"Finally, I also voted for - again thinking of Portuguese textiles - the introduction of a safeguard clause, which provides for the re-establishment of common customs tariff duties on a given product at any time if it is being imported from Pakistan under conditions that cause, or threaten to cause serious problems for an EU producer of similar or directly competing products."
"in writing. - The Greens welcomed from the start the idea of supporting Pakistan's efforts to overcome the hunger and misery following the floods."
"However, our main criticism was that it was a measure focusing on a country affected by terrorism without naming this political agenda, and without embedding the measures in a set of measures concerning the political context."
"Furthermore, the Greens feared that the measures might pave the way for the inclusion of Pakistan in the GSP+ scheme without the country having signed and implemented the corresponding labour and environmental conventions (let alone the Geneva Conventions)."
"Finally, the Greens wished to exclude ethanol from the list of duty-free products, as it would be made out of sugar cane, which would replace food crops, constitutes a GHG-intensive crop and does not create a significant number of jobs."
"Unfortunately, none of the Green amendments was adopted in INTA."
"The text has finally been referred back to the committee."
"The proposal adopted today came about after the unprecedented floods that last summer devastated a vast portion of Pakistan's territory."
"The final document intends to grant autonomous trade preferences to the country in relation to 75 product lines of interest (mainly textiles and clothing) in the form of exemption from customs duties, with the exception of one product (ethanol) for which a tariff rate quota applies."
"The proposed measures should be welcomed as a perfect example of the synergies that the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon has made possible."
"The European Union and its Member States have already generously provided Pakistan with humanitarian aid, but the extension of trade preferences in this country is part of a larger package of measures that would address the medium and long-term economic consequences of the catastrophic floods."
"Ensuring the recovery and future sustainable development of Pakistan is extremely important, not only for its citizens, but also for the security and stability of the region."
"A stable and prosperous Pakistan that is not subject to extremist or fundamentalist tendencies is obviously in the interests of the European Union."
"in writing. - When we first heard in October 2010 of the Commission's plans to help Pakistan recover from its awful flooding by removing some customs tariffs, Greens were enthusiastic to help."
"We still are, but a once-simple idea has become over-complicated and unworkable."
"Originally the scheme was for 3 years, although we wanted longer to increase investor confidence."
"But after various business and interest groups had got involved the proposal was reduced to 12 months only - with quarterly reviews!"
"Further, any deal needs a waiver from the World Trade Organisation, which they haven't approved as some member countries (notably India) are worried about the effect that duty-free Pakistani textiles would have on their own markets."
"There has been no progress in 5 months, and it's unlikely we'll see any soon, if ever."
"In Plenary today I supported an amendment to send the whole report back to committee for re-working."
"In doing so I wasn't voting against helping Pakistan, but I was recognising the report before us simply wouldn't deliver what Pakistan needs."
"For me, a major stumbling block has been the WTO."
"I believe this organisation needs comprehensive reorganisation into a properly democratic, accountable and transparent body."
"The natural disaster suffered by the people of Pakistan last August touched all of us and deserves the solidarity of the European Union."
"The European Union must show its support for Pakistan and help to minimise the devastating effects of the floods, as it has done through its policy of humanitarian aid and international cooperation when other tragic events have occurred."
"However, trying to use common trade policy to express this solidarity might have undesirable repercussions for the future, both in this specific case and in others that could arise."
"At Internal Market level, the effects are negative for the production of European countries like Portugal."
"However, the effects at international level are also worrying, because they will create a waiver in the World Trade Organisation (WTO), in a key sector for many developing countries."
"Therefore, and also bearing in mind that an impact assessment must be encouraged to assess the repercussions of the agreement inside the EU, I voted in favour of Amendment 43, which rejects the European Commission proposal to grant preferences to Pakistan."
"in writing. - (LT) It is time for the EU to reconsider its long-term trade programme."
"We cannot pretend that certain developing countries granted special status by the EU are the same countries they were a decade ago."
"Some of these countries (such as Brazil, Russia, Argentina, Saudi Arabia and Qatar) are currently the strongest economically."
"Meanwhile, countries like Lithuania are struggling to make ends meet."
"If Pakistan is granted trade preferences for textiles, as proposed in this report, Lithuania would find itself in a vulnerable position, as textiles account for almost 6% of all our exports."
"Furthermore, the EU should pay more attention to the situation of its trade partners in the area of human rights."
"Respect for human rights and democratic principles must be a fundamental element of EU trade policy."
"There can be no compromise on these matters. I am therefore concerned by the Commission's proposal to grant Pakistan autonomous trade preferences."
"Of course, the EU is keen for Pakistan to enjoy stability and prosperity, but in the face of the crisis we should get our priorities right."
"As events in the last few weeks have shown, Pakistan remains a hotbed of terrorism and extremism."
"The EU should be careful not to send out the wrong message."
"The current system of foreign direct investment, governed by a myriad of overlapping and sometimes conflicting bilateral investment treaties (BITs) of the Member States has to be replaced - in a reasonable time span - by a new framework of modern EU investment treaties consistent with cross-cutting EU policy goals."
"I also support the rapporteur's position, which strongly supports the coexistence approach of the Commission's proposal for a regulation."
"It is undoubtedly essential that, by way of an authorisation process, the Member States' existing BITs remain in place and that, under clear conditions, Member States be allowed to renegotiate existing BITs, finalise pending ones, and enter into negotiations for new ones."
"Legal certainty will, however, remain a relative term as long as the transition of the investment protection regime is not completed, and given validity terms of existing BITs of Member States under international public law."
"I am voting for the report, with the caveat that there is a need to continue debating the matter so that it will have a better legal framework."
"Since the Treaty of Lisbon, investment has been an area of exclusive EU competence."
"Parliament therefore initially gave its verdict on the shape of the future European investment policy."
"This is the report I myself drafted, which was voted on during the last part-session in April 2011."
"In Mr Schlyter's report, Parliament has now examined transitional arrangements for managing investment agreements that Member States have already concluded with third countries."
"As in the vote in committee, I advocated a Community vision and stated that agreements that were already standing should be closely examined by the Commission in order to check their compatibility with the Treaties and with Union law and Union policy, in particular the objectives of the Union's external action on sustainable development."
"However, the vision that has prevailed in the end is a right-wing vision in which protection of private investors is given priority over these objectives based on the general interest."
"Unfortunately the negotiations that will now be entered into with the Council are not likely to correct our aim, in an EU in which the good of the Union as a whole is rarely able to withstand national egotism."
"in writing. - (LT) Before the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, Member States mostly maintained bilateral agreements with third countries relating to investment."
"Following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, foreign direct investment fell within the exclusive competence of the EU and became an integral part of the EU's common commercial policy."
"I endorsed this report, which provides for a transitional period for this competence to be transferred to EU level, which in future will help ensure a high level of protection for investors against arbitrary actions by third countries."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this report, because following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the EU's common commercial policy became one of the common EU policy areas where the EU is given exclusive competence."
"Thus investment policy, an area which falls under the common commercial policy, must also be coordinated at EU level."
"Currently Member States comply with partly overlapping but often conflicting bilateral investment agreements with third countries, and this hampers the objectives of the EU's common commercial policy, and the formation of the image of the EU as a single trade area in transnational and global trade."
"This report's most important objective is the smooth transition from investment policies pursued by Member States individually to a common EU investment policy, ensuring legal certainty for all parties, and agreements already concluded for participants in the transitional period, when the old legal framework is being replaced by the new regulation."
"Essentially this report addresses two fundamental issues - a timeline for the transition, and the cases and procedures for withholding authorisation to hold negotiations with third countries, which the Commission gives a Member State during the transitional period."
"I supported this report by voting in favour because I believe that we need rules during the transitional period to ensure legal certainty and avoid conflicts and gaps in the law."
"In fact, Mr Schlyter's report arises from the proposal for a regulation of the Commission that provides for the exclusive competence of the EU on foreign direct investment, replacing the agreements put in place by the 27 Member States and also establishing a necessary transition period to be applied to existing bilateral treaties."
"Finally, I agree with Mr Schlyter on the importance of a fixed date to mark the end of the transitional period so as to safeguard the European economy's competitiveness and to provide investors with a clear picture of current and future regulatory standards."
"in writing. - (CS) The adoption of the approved regulation is necessary, for the current system, which is created through a large number of mutually overlapping and sometimes even conflicting bilateral agreements on investments concluded by Member States, must be replaced within a reasonable period of time by a new system of modern investment agreements concluded by the EU, which will be in line with the general goals of EU policy."
"The regulation is therefore the logical and only possible reaction for enshrining policy in the area of direct foreign investments as exclusive powers of the EU, which forms part of the EU's common commercial policy."
"The policy has the important role of ensuring a high level of legal certainty in a period of transition."
"I therefore wholly agree with the Commission proposal, which counts on coexisting agreements."
"It is essential for existing Member State agreements on investment to remain in force on the basis of the approval procedure, and for Member States to be able to negotiate changes to them under clear conditions, to complete the ongoing negotiations and to begin negotiations on new agreements."
"In the interests of harmonisation of the EU's foreign policy, I am voting to change the current system of bilateral investment treaties between the Member States and third countries."
"I also share the concern expressed by the rapporteur with regard to ensuring legal certainty during the transition process, meaning there is a need to introduce a deadline for this and to clarify the conditions for withholding authorisation."
"It ought to be possible to coordinate and make decisions on Member States' individual investment policies at EU level."
"The current system is marked by countless bilateral treaties that cross over or double up on each other and are often basically contradictory."
"As we work on formulating a proper European investment policy therefore, I felt it would be beneficial to vote in favour of obliging Member States to make provision, when renegotiating bilateral treaties or negotiating new treaties, for a dispute settlement mechanism in which the Commission would be allowed to participate, even in a purely advisory capacity, and for confidentiality requirements to be lifted in order to allow the EU's executive body to take part in such a capacity."
"I also requested that the Commission should present a report to Parliament and the Council, no later than five years after this regulation enters into force, on the situation regarding re-examination of existing bilateral agreements, relating in particular to the number of bilateral agreements that the different Member States may have renegotiated."
"With the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, pursuant to Articles 206 and 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), foreign direct investment becomes the exclusive competence of the European Union."
"At the moment, many bilateral agreements are in force and they now urgently need to be replaced by a new framework of EU investment treaties consistent with its cross-cutting political objectives."
"The intention is now to find fair and effective transitional measures that will safeguard the bilateral agreements in force and not disregard the expectations of investors."
"Therefore, we must avoid legal loopholes and ensure a considered transition."
"As such, I call on all those involved in the trialogues to properly weigh up the need to protect legitimate expectations and the correct application of the Treaty of Lisbon, paying particular attention to the articles relating to the re-examination and withdrawal of authorisation."
"I would commend the rapporteur on all the efforts made, but I call for greater consideration and compromise."
"This report is on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing transitional arrangements for bilateral investment agreements between Member States and third countries."
"Pursuant to Article 207(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), this is the exclusive competence of the European Union, as it relates to matters of foreign direct investment."
"Without questioning the need for the Member States' existing bilateral treaties to remain in force, I agree with the rapporteur's position in the sense of ensuring a high degree of legal certainty during the transition period, and also with the three reasons for withdrawing authorisation for a bilateral treaty: 'conflicts with the law of the Union', 'overlap, in part or in full, with an agreement in force with that third country and this specific overlap is not addressed in the latter agreement' and treaties that might 'constitute an obstacle to the development and the implementation of the Union's policies relating to investment'."
"Trade policy is yet another area in which competences have been withdrawn from the Member States, with the EU then having 'exclusive competence'."
"This is the foundation for this proposal for a regulation: in other words, applying Article 207(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which provides for the exclusive competence of the EU in matters of foreign direct investment as part of the common commercial policy."
"The importance of trade policy and, of course, of investment policy as instruments for promoting the interests of a country and its people according to its specific characteristics and conditions are all too clear."
"What is also clear - as in the case of Portugal, for example - is the damage that results from trade and investment policies that do not give due consideration to the interests, circumstances and conditions of the country, since they are essentially decided by the major powers of the EU in defence of the interests of their major companies; the balance within the EU tipped decisively towards these powers when the Union strengthened its competences."
"Among other serious aspects, this regulation intends to give the Commission the power to withdraw authorisations, to ask Member States to negotiate or reject bilateral investment treaties (BITs) and to approve new BITs."
"Those the reasons why we voted against."
"It is well known that the European Union has exclusive competence in matters of external trade policy, which is the basis for this proposal for a regulation."
"It is founded on Article 207(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which provides for the exclusive competence of the EU in matters of foreign direct investment as part of the common commercial policy."
"However, in general, the European Commission's positions do not respect the interests of all the Member States equally."
"The importance of trade policy and, of course, of investment policy as instruments for promoting the interests of a country and its people according to its specific characteristics and conditions are all too clear."
"What is also clear - as in the case of Portugal, for example - is the damage that results from trade and investment policies that do not give due consideration to the interests, circumstances and conditions of the country, since they are essentially decided by the major powers of the EU in defence of the interests of their major companies; the balance within the EU tipped decisively towards these powers when the Union strengthened its competences."
"Among other serious aspects, this regulation intends to give the Commission the power to withdraw authorisations, to ask Member States to negotiate or reject bilateral investment treaties (BITs) and to approve new BITs."
"That is why we voted against."
"in writing. - This report deals with international investment treaties with third countries."
"The main objective of these treaties is to provide a high level of protection for investments and investors against arbitrary actions of governments of states receiving the investment."
"Before the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, the Member States were in charge of negotiating the signing of these investment agreements."
"With the Lisbon Treaty, foreign direct investment has become an exclusive competence of the EU and an integral part of the EU's external trade policy."
"Personally I think EU development policy might be superior to the trade and investment policy of the Union."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this document, because it is proposed that the Regulation should provide the faculty for the Commission to withhold an authorisation, to request Member States to renegotiate or terminate a Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT), and to have the Commission's approval for newly negotiated BITs."
"It also lays down conditions on how, when and what it is possible to negotiate."
"Following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, foreign direct investment is included in the list of matters falling under the common commercial policy."
"In accordance with Article 3(1)(e) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (hereinafter ""the Treaty”), the Union has exclusive competence with respect to the common commercial policy."
"Accordingly, only the Union may legislate and adopt legally binding acts within that area."
"The Member States are able to do so only if empowered by the Union, in accordance with Article 2(1) of the Treaty."
"That relationship will develop further as the Union exercises its competence in common investment policy with the main goal of creating the best possible investment protection system for all Member States' investors equally and equal investing conditions on third country markets."
"As the new investment policy will be developed in view of the transitional validity of bilateral investment agreements concluded by Member States, it should acknowledge the rights of investors whose investments fall into the scope of those agreements and should ensure their legal certainty."
"The Commission should take the necessary steps towards a progressive replacement of all existing agreements on investment with new agreements that should provide for the best possible level of protection."
"in writing. - (DE) Since the Treaty of Lisbon the Commission has had the exclusive power to negotiate and conclude bilateral investment agreements with third countries."
"There are more than 1 000 agreements in existence and negotiations led by Member States are currently under way for around 200 more."
"In order that this transfer of competence does not result in a hard landing for the EU, the Member States should continue to be able to guarantee legal certainty for investors during a transitional period."
"Parliament sent a strong signal in the first reading and advocates a solid, secure phase for the transfer of powers."
"in writing. - (RO) Investment agreements are still mandatory for Member States following the entry into force of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and they must be dealt with under the EU's exclusive competence in the area of direct foreign investments."
"This proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council will authorise for all the investment agreements currently in force between Member States and third countries to remain in place."
"I think that this will allow us to offer an explicit guarantee of legal certainty concerning the conditions which investors are subject to."
"Furthermore, the proposal also sets out the conditions under which Member States will be able to negotiate and conclude new bilateral investment agreements with third countries, regarded as an exceptional transitional measure."
"in writing. - I voted for this report and welcome the fact that bilateral investment treaties are now part of the common commercial policy."
"This report forbids Member States from negotiating and even maintaining bilateral investment agreements with a third country if the agreements do not comply with the European Commission's views."
"National sovereignty is therefore abolished in this field."
"The Treaty of Lisbon has brought us to this point of banning any form of bilateral investment in support of another country and putting all the power in the hands of the Commission, an unelected body."
"I shall vote against."
"We cannot expect that what has failed at the level of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) - that is, bringing light into the jungle of bilateral investment agreements - will be successful at EU level."
"An attempt has been made at a higher level to introduce comprehensive multinational regulations for Foreign Direct Investment, or FDI, that would apply to all economic sectors."
"In the longer term this will probably be more likely to achieve the aim, but in reality it depends on how it is actually organised."
"The problem is that binding BIT arbitration judgments based on international law could entail commitments to investors by Member States that give rise to EU Treaty infringement proceedings."
"For this there is still no solution."
"There is just as little consideration in the report of the potential negative aspects of the investment policy, for example the fear among the domestic population of job losses and wage cuts due to outsourcing and the relocation of production."
"Direct investments are by no means the magic bullet they are made out to be."
"Certain developing countries have had to learn that the hard way."
"For these reasons I voted against this report."
"As a result of the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon, Member States have unfortunately lost their prerogatives regarding the management of foreign direct investment, which has become the exclusive competence of the Union."
"Such a significant change requires transitional rules governing its implementation: the report that we voted on today seems to be an acceptable compromise, since it protects the agreements already concluded by various States on a bilateral basis and also lays the groundwork for possible new, bilateral agreements, though they must be agreed on."
"The evaluation powers of the Commission are also well defined and limited, thus making it, de facto, less complicated for Member States who wish to continue their specific policy on foreign direct investment."
"For these reasons I decided to vote in favour of the report."
"I voted for this report on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing transitional arrangements for bilateral investment agreements between Member States and third countries."
"It is a case of applying Article 207(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which provides for the exclusive competence of the EU in matters of foreign direct investment as part of the common commercial policy."
"In a world of global transfers of assets and capital, and as a logical consequence of the EU's common commercial policy, the investment policy of Member States also has to be coordinated and decided at EU level."
"This means that the present system embodied by a myriad of overlapping and sometimes conflicting bilateral investment treaties (BITs) of the Member States has to be replaced - in a reasonable time span - by a new framework of modern EU investment treaties consistent with cross-cutting EU policy goals."
"The transition to an EU investment policy, bearing in mind the risky and long-term nature of foreign direct investment, is a long and complicated process."
"It is extremely important to ensure a high level of legal certainty during the transition period."
"Since, by virtue of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the area of foreign direct investment is an exclusive EU competence, there is a need to provide the European Union with the necessary means to move from a disparate perspective to a harmonised approach."
"As such, there is a need to find solutions enabling us to prevent legal uncertainty during the transitional period, but without risking the objectives guiding Union action."
"in writing. - As we feared, the tight vote against us in the Committee on International Trade on the crucial Article 5 (review of Member States' existing bilateral investment treaties (BITs)) and Article 6 (the possibility of withdrawing authorisation for a BIT) of Carl Schlyter's report on 'Transitional arrangements for bilateral investment agreements between Member States and third countries' has been confirmed by the vote in plenary."
"We had made it easier for Members to vote with us by tabling amendments on Articles 5 and 6, going just halfway towards what we had wanted (and had lost at the committee stage)."
"We thus left it to the S&D Group to re-table the original texts, in order to be perceived as representing the middle ground."
"Unfortunately, that strategy did not work out."
"We had a roll-call vote on this and we will analyse whether we nonetheless captured some support in the ALDE Group."
"We also lost our amendments concerning better transparency rules."
"We won only one amendment, of minor importance, on the recitals, which was clearly 'granted' to us by the EPP and ALDE Groups in order to appease us so that the Greens/EFA position in the final vote would be positive."
"However, we chose to reject the report (which was approved by 345 to 246 votes)."
"in writing. - Earlier this year, I made some enquiries to the European Commission in response to press reports about shipments of toxic waste from Italy to Romania."
"Although no evidence was found for the shipments, what was clear from the outcome of my enquiries was that we could benefit from more regular inspections of cargo, as this would act as a deterrent to those involved in the illegal shipment of waste."
"Such measures may have an additional impact in the case of developing countries because they may lack the capacity to properly monitor incoming shipments and therefore prevent the entry of toxic material into their territory."
"We should give serious consideration to the benefits of thorough, regular inspections coordinated at EU level, especially in the case of shipments to developing countries."
"Pursuant to Article 207(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the EU has competences in respect of foreign direct investment (FDI), as this type of investment is directly related to the new common commercial policy."
"The Treaty of Lisbon came into force at a time when many bilateral investment agreements with third countries were coming to an end and no transitional arrangements had been established to ensure an integrated move towards future agreements within the exclusive competence of the European Union."
"I think it is a good idea to undertake a reliable evaluation of all the bilateral agreements currently in force with third countries, and to adopt a strategy common to all Member States."
"As this report says, it is crucial that the rules laid down be transparent, be known to the main political players and be assessed within a maximum of 10 years."
"At a time when transactions involving assets and capital are becoming increasingly globalised, it is important that the European Union adopt a common investment policy in line with the strategy set out by all the Member States."
"in writing. - (PT) I am voting for this report by the Committee on International Trade."
"I adopt its position at first reading, taking over the Commission proposal."
"I call on the Commission to refer the matter to Parliament again if it intends to amend its proposal substantially or replace it with another text."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this report."
"The European Commission pledged up to EUR 500 million of assistance to Georgia at the October 2008 International Donors' Conference."
"The sources of the funding include both programmed funds under the envelope of the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI) and crisis instruments, such as the Instrument for Stability, Humanitarian Aid and Macro-Financial Assistance."
"The Georgian economy is beginning to recover following the double shock caused by the military conflict with Russia of August 2008 and the global financial crisis."
"However, the balance of payments and budgetary position remain weak and vulnerable due to the blockade of most direct trade with Russia and marked reduction in foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows."
"I endorse the allocation of EUR 46 million in financial assistance to Georgia, which will help reduce the short-term financial vulnerability still faced by the economy, while supporting reform measures aimed at achieving a more sustainable balance of payments and a more stable budgetary situation."
"There is a fundamental contradiction in the European Commission's proposal to grant further financial assistance to Georgia: it was the Commission itself that pointed out that Georgia's economy was recovering after the conflict with Russia three years ago, thereby insinuating that there was no need to 'assist' the Georgian Government with further funds to help the national economy in addition to those already provided in recent years."
"It is therefore not clear why the Georgian Government asked for more money, nor why the Commission immediately started working to mobilise nearly EUR 50 million."
"Given the internal political situation in Georgia and issues of legality and transparency in that country, we have no assurances that it will be well spent."
"I voted against the legislative resolution which allows Parliament to grant EUR 46 million to the Georgian Government."
"There are many economic, financial and employment-related problems in Europe and there are many areas which are forced to deal with crisis situations for which the institutions could do much more."
"The Commission should move first of all to focus all possible efforts on solving the problems of our citizens."
"in writing. - (LT) The European Parliament approved the Council decision to activate the Commission pledge of EU funds to Georgia."
"Prior to adopting the decision, the Commission assessed Georgia's economic situation and the country's financial prospects in 2010-2011, focusing on the balance of payments and budgetary needs."
"The Commission considers that the activation of the second part of the macro-financial assistance (MFA) pledged in 2008 is warranted."
"The new MFA would help Georgia to address the economic consequences of the conflict with Russia and the global crisis."
"The new MFA should support the economic reform agenda of the government and policy measures to strengthen public finance management (building on those of the previous operation and of the EU's sectoral budgetary support operation)."
"In addition, this assistance should help to foster economic and financial integration with the EU, in particular by exploiting the potential offered by the future Association Agreement, which aims at concluding a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement between the two parties."
"in writing. - (CS) As a member of the European Parliament's delegation to the EU-Armenia, EU-Azerbaijan and EU-Georgia Parliamentary Cooperation Committees, I welcome the decision to provide Georgia with macro-financial assistance of EUR 46 million, in order to help stabilise the Georgian economy and cover needs in respect of the balance of payments stipulated in the existing IMF programme."
"I consider it right and proper that EUR 23 million of this sum will be provided in the form of grants, and EUR 23 million in the form of loans."
"It is important that the relevant measures which Georgia should take to prevent and combat fraud, corruption and other irregularities relating to this assistance are set out in the memorandum of understanding, the loan agreement and the grant agreement, which will be agreed with the Georgian authorities."
"In the interests of greater transparency in the management and disbursement of the funds, the memorandum of understanding, the loan agreement and the grant agreement should also stipulate the possibility of checks, which also means on-the-spot checks and inspections by the Commission, including the European Anti-Fraud Office."
"In addition to this, we should also count on the possibility of carrying out audits, including random on-the-spot audits by the Court of Auditors."
"in writing. - (PT) I welcome efforts to promote prosperity beyond the EU's borders, because I consider our aid important in order for some third countries to be able to tackle their balance of payments crisis and restore the sustainability of foreign debt."
"Therefore, and bearing in mind the economic and social problems suffered as a result of the August 2008 armed conflict and the global financial crisis, I agree with the tabled proposal of additional macro-economic financial assistance for Georgia, with a view to supporting its process of economic stabilisation and covering the needs of its balance of payments."
"I also believe that this macro-economic assistance will have a positive effect on Georgia's relations with Member States, in addition to the critical role it will play in the country's government properly applying reforms."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of this report, because I believe that the mobilisation of the second part of the macro-financial assistance to Georgia is justified and relevant."
"Although the Georgian economy is recovering, this additional aid will help Georgia to deal with the economic consequences of the conflict with Russia and the global crisis, and also support the government's economic reform programme."
"in writing. - (PT) Georgia has faced serious problems recently, particularly after the military conflict between the country and Russia due to the separatist regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia."
"We are still a long way from being able to consider the option of the country's accession to the European Union - repeatedly referred to by President Saakashvili - a realistic possibility, given that Georgia does not meet the objective requirements allowing it to aspire to such a desire."
"That said, I believe it advantageous that Georgia express this wish and try to comply with European standards."
"As such, and since it is intended to seek to help the country overcome the economic and social difficulties suffered after the military conflict, I am voting to grant Georgia additional macro-financial assistance, which I hope can be used to the real benefit of its population."
"in writing. - (PT) This report is on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council providing further macro-financial assistance to Georgia."
"This is a European Commission proposal that provides for EUR 46 million in aid to this country and is the result of the armed conflict with Russia, a situation exacerbated by the global crisis."
"As this is the second part of aid guaranteed in 2008, which is intended to enable Georgia to meet the financial agreements with global and European financial institutions, as well as to support the economic reforms in progress in this country, I agree with this aid and am voting for it."
"However, I hope that Parliament and the Council will soon reach an agreement on the methodology for supervising the implementation of this aid, so that we all have greater peace of mind about the proper application of EU funds."
"With regard to this proposed additional macro-financial assistance, the observations we made about the decision to grant the previous macro-financial assistance to this country remain valid and relevant."
"We always advocate the EU's need to grant assistance in solidarity with countries that need it, and for this assistance to be directed at projects that serve the interests of the people."
"However, EU 'assistance' has demonstrated that it has little to do with solidarity."
"The interests of big companies and financial institutions, and of the major powers almost always overcome the genuine and real interests of solidarity."
"It is no different with Georgia."
"It is important to bear in mind that the proposed financial assistance is intended above all to finance the recommendations of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and its policy of structural adjustment: in other words, persisting with the same neoliberal policies that led to the economic and financial crisis that this country is facing."
"We also maintain the same reservations and concerns with regard to possible progress in terms of the militarisation of the Caucasus region as a result of the tensions with Russia, bearing in mind the region's energy wealth and geostrategic importance, which arouses the greed of the EU and its monopolies."
"in writing. - Georgia has experienced a sharp economic decline since the outbreak of the military conflict with Russia in August 2008."
"This resulted in huge direct and indirect damage; a large part of the population was displaced."
"The global financial crisis which broke out in autumn 2008 made the situation in Georgia even more complicated."
"The proposed assistance - part of a comprehensive EU package of up to EUR 500 million - aims to support Georgia's recovery following the armed conflict with Russia, and also helps Georgia address the consequences of the global economic and financial crisis."
"The assistance is to be allocated to the financing of the deficit of the state budget, and may help Georgia to overcome its acute financial problems."
"It is the duty of the European Union to continue helping Georgia, so that that country can develop and become a modern democracy, which could serve as an example to other countries in the region."
"Since the 'Rose Revolution', the Georgian Government has consistently implemented democratic reforms, modernising its country and carrying out difficult, unpopular economic and social reforms that are essential in the long term."
"As shown by the World Bank's 'Doing Business 2010' index, the business environment in Georgia is the 12th 'easiest' in the world."
"Only three European Union Member States are ranked above Georgia in this index."
"This country has had notable successes in fighting corruption, which is a significant problem in all post-Soviet countries."
"I am convinced that Georgia is an example to Caucasian region countries, and I have no fear in saying that this country can serve as an example to some EU Member States that currently lack the political courage to carry out reforms that would pave the way to growth and modernisation."
"In solving problems associated with Georgia, we must not forget that 20% of Georgia's territory is still under occupation."
"Russia must honour its agreement with respect to the territorial integrity of Georgia, and the European Union must consistently continue to remind Russia's leadership of this."
"in writing. - (DE) Supporting macro-financial assistance for Georgia, which was hit hard by the economic crisis, is something to be endorsed."
"The money promised by the EU is linked to clear conditions and will reach the right areas."
"This financial assistance, together with the funding from the IMF, will help stabilise the national budget and will have a positive effect on relations between the EU and Georgia."
"I voted in favour of granting additional aid to Georgia."
"This country stands out from the other countries involved in the Eastern Partnership on account of the reforms it has carried out in every area."
"I am particularly glad to see that the simplified legislative procedure was used during work on the report on further macro-financial assistance for Georgia, since this speeded up the entire process and made it possible to vote the report through more quickly."
"Georgia's economy has recovered after Russia's military invasion of 2008, and has done extremely well in comparison to other countries of a similar size in the difficult times of the global financial crisis."
"Since the Rose Revolution, numerous reforms have been carried out in Georgia aimed at liberalising and democratising the system in such a way as to make it more attractive to business, and to make it possible for a free-market economy and a democratic society to be established."
"Since 2004, Georgia has taken unprecedented steps in reducing the bureaucratic burden on businesses."
"Restrictions have been placed on the formalities necessary to start up in business."
"The tax system has been reformed, which has resulted in a five-fold increase in budgetary revenue."
"To sum up, Georgia has been opened up for free and unhindered trade."
"Georgia has practically eliminated the cancer of corruption in state institutions and the civil service by means of a series of public sector reforms (concerning the public prosecutor's office, the judiciary and the police) and political reforms."
"Today Georgia is regarded as a country with a dynamically developing economy."
"In view of the above, we should continue to spur Georgia on to further development, not only by setting requirements, but also by granting aid."
"in writing. - (RO) Georgia is one of the European Union's partner countries as part of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP)."
"It is in the European Union's vital interest to ensure stability at its eastern borders, which can be achieved through economic growth and political security."
"The package of macro-financial assistance intended for Georgia is in direct response to the economic and social difficulties which this country is faced with."
"Although Georgia's economy is showing signs of recovery, it is still fragile and vulnerable, and requires financial stability."
"Last but not least, the macro-financial assistance granted by the EU supplements the other financial instruments and aid granted to Georgia by the IMF, as well as by international and bilateral donors, providing Georgia with short-term macro-economic support."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this resolution on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council providing further macro-financial assistance to Georgia."
"The European Union has found itself a new mission."
"It is now applying the savage cuts in the social funds of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), via the European Financial Stability Fund applicable to the euro area and indeed the whole EU, through macro-financial assistance (MFA) outside the EU."
"In Georgia, the IMF has announced that it will not be continuing its 'aid'."
"There is therefore no longer any need to implement the IMF austerity plan."
"Through this MFA, the European Union is forcing Georgia to carry on implementing the plan regardless."
"This is unacceptable: I shall vote against."
"Georgia faces series financial problems following the armed conflict with Russia in 2008 and the impact of the global financial crisis."
"Back in January of this year, the EU approved a EUR 46 million aid package for Georgia, of which EUR 23 million is to be paid as a loan and a further EUR 23 million in the form of a grant to the country."
"The EUR 46 million forms part of an EU financial aid package worth around EUR 500 million which was approved by the EU back in October 2008."
"This second tranche of the EU's macro-financial assistance - the first having been implemented back in 2009-2010 - is intended to help Georgia meet its external financing requirement and is subject to strict conditions."
"Initial signs of its success can already be seen in the fact that real GDP grew by 6.3% in 2010, providing evidence of a revival of the economy."
"Nonetheless, it should be stated that there are indications that the money is not being used efficiently enough."
"In view of the budgetary situation of most EU Member States, this is unacceptable."
"Although I am fundamentally in favour of the financial assistance, I therefore abstained from voting in the final vote."
"I welcome the European Parliament's decision to approve the Commission's proposal to allocate a further EUR 46 million in macro-financial assistance to Georgia."
"This is significant support for a country loyal to European integration which will help mitigate two negative repercussions on the Georgian economy - the military conflict with Russia and the global economic and financial crisis."
"In order to increase the long-term viability of this assistance, the Commission must actively help to ensure targeted uptake, above all through measures to foster economic and financial integration with the EU, so that it would contribute to the swift conclusion of a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement between the EU and Georgia."
"A dialogue on visas is another measure that would have a clear stabilising influence that would also promote reforms."
"The EU-Georgia agreements on the simplification of the visa regime and readmission entered into force on 1 March 2011 and represent a welcome first step."
"I trust that the Commission will soon present an evaluation of the implementation of these agreements, so that by the next meeting of the EU-Georgia Cooperation Council it is possible to begin discussions on the course of further cooperation on visa issues."
"in writing. - (PT) This European Union macro-financial assistance is intended to help cover Georgia's external finance needs, identified in cooperation with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the context of the IMF stand-by arrangement for the sum of USD 1.17 billion, which has been in force since October 2008."
"Half the proposed aid will be supplied in the form of subsidies and the other half in the form of loans."
"Additional macro-financial assistance should help assist Georgia to deal with the economic consequences of the conflict with Russia and the world crisis, and also support the government's economic reform programme."
"I voted for this report, because I agree with the financial assistance concerned and also with the need - in spite of financial assistance being controversial - to guarantee a model for supervising the implementation of this assistance that enables Parliament and other institutions to find out about how these funds are being spent."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted to grant Georgia an additional EUR 46 million in macro-financial assistance because I consider it necessary in order to help the country overcome the social and economic difficulties arising from the conflict with Russia."
"in writing. - In line with our voting on macro-financial assistance (MFA) in the last parliamentary term, the suggestion was made that we abstain in this case because we do not think that MFA is very helpful so long as it is tied to whatever programme the International Monetary fund (IMF) is operating in the countries concerned."
"Indeed, there is no EU-specific financing strategy apart from the standard IMF macro-economic reform agenda."
"On the other hand, we do recognise that Georgia has financing needs and that there is an EU responsibility here."
"The Greens/EFA Group has, in the end, voted in favour."
"The adoption of today's report follows the position adopted at the first reading and confirms the view expressed by the Commission."
"The text we voted on asks the Commission to submit a new proposal in the event that it intends to modify it substantially or replace it with a new text."
"Further macro-financial assistance will help Georgia to deal with the global crisis, by supporting the government's reform programme."
"In fact, it will reduce the short-term financing problems facing the Georgian economy."
"Bearing in mind that this financial assistance is one-off assistance of limited duration, I voted in favour of the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council to grant additional macro-financial assistance to Georgia."
"Corrections to votes and voting intentions: see Minutes"
"Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting"
"(FR) Mr President, I would like to comment on point 16 of the Minutes, which quite rightly reports my request for a debate to be held on the waiver of my parliamentary immunity, something which you rejected."
"This therefore contradicts what the President of the sitting Mrs Angelilli said earlier, when she claimed that I had been given the floor yesterday to talk about the waiver of my parliamentary immunity, which is not true."
"This Parliament has therefore deprived one of its Members of a vital right to protection, without allowing either the party himself or anyone who may have spoken in his defence to speak on the subject in plenary, either during a debate or during their explanations of vote or any other occasion."
"I simply wanted this to be acknowledged, so thank you for having done that."
"I understand that your comment is intended for the Minutes."
"Thank you for this comment."
"Migration flows and asylum and their impact on Schengen (debate)"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on migration flows and asylum and their impact on Schengen."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, the developments in the Southern Neighbourhood and the ensuing migration flows are posing a serious challenge for the European Union."
"They have served to underscore the importance of looking at the whole issue of how we manage migration and refugee flows."
"Therefore the European Council in March called upon the Council and the Commission to submit before the June European Council a plan for the development of capacities to manage migration and refugee flows as a response."
"The conclusions adopted by the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 11 and 12 April 2011 and the communication issued by the Commission last week are important steps in this direction."
"The Presidency has convened an extraordinary meeting of the Council on Justice and Home Affairs for 12 May in order to discuss the issue of the management of migration and refugee flows."
"These discussions will help to prepare for the meeting of the European Council on 21 June which will address the same issues."
"We cannot of course stand idle in the face of events on the other side of the Mediterranean."
"The EU and the Member States are ready to assist both those displaced as a result of the latest developments in North Africa and those Member States most directly concerned."
"Over the past few months the EU and the Member States have made available approximately EUR 96 million of emergency humanitarian aid and we are committed to continue to provide further support as and when the situation requires."
"The Council has also invited all Member States to continue their support for UNHCR, the International Organisation for Migration, the Red Cross and all relevant actors, the efforts of which are paramount in helping those displaced as a consequence of protracted violence in Libya."
"Those Member States more directly affected by these developments are receiving contributions of funding, equipment and technical expertise; for example the Commission announced earlier that approximately EUR 25 million from emergency funds could be made available for Member States such as Italy and Malta."
"Furthermore, the newly-created European Asylum Support Office, although still in the process of becoming fully operational, is also available to help."
"Some Member States, including Hungary, have already said that they are ready to reallocate refugees from Malta in order to alleviate pressure on the authorities there."
"Apart from the specific measures intended to address this particular situation, the Council remains fully committed to the further development of the common European asylum system."
"Work is under way in the Council and Parliament and some progress has been already achieved, despite the technical difficulty and the politically sensitive nature of this subject."
"In general the management of migratory flows in the EU and in individual Member States requires the effective management of borders."
"As far as the management of external borders is concerned, Frontex has an important role to play in a number of ways, including the monitoring of the EU's external borders and providing operational support."
"In the light of the latest developments in North Africa, joint operation Hermes was launched on 20 February 2011 following a request from the Italian Government."
"This is aimed at preventing and detecting illegal border crossings to Lampedusa, Sicily, Sardinia and the Italian mainland."
"Frontex is also supporting the Italian authorities in second-line border control activities by the briefing and screening of migrants."
"The Council also welcomes the Commission's decision to mobilise supplementary funds needed by Frontex to continue its planned joint operations."
"We have urged Member States to provide further human and technical resources as required in support of the agency's operations, including Hermes."
"As you know, the new proposal concerning Frontex is in this House and we have been negotiating it."
"I very much count on the support of Parliament in bringing this legislative proposal to a conclusion and ensuring the success of the negotiations."
"Against the background of the recent migratory pressure from North Africa, the strengthening of Frontex has become a high priority for the Council."
"I would like to express my thanks to Mr Busuttil and the shadow rapporteurs for their good cooperation and I very much hope, as I have just emphasised, that a first-reading agreement can be achieved by June 2011, as was called for by the European Council in March."
"Developments in the southern Mediterranean, in particular in relation to the Tunisian migrants arriving in Lampedusa, have also raised questions about controls at internal borders."
"This in turn touches on the issue of freedom of movement within the European Union."
"The Council fully agrees with the view held by almost everyone here that the free movement of persons within the Schengen area is a major achievement."
"Those Member States that have asked for the revision of the Schengen system have also underlined that they were proposing this with the intention of preserving the free movement of our citizens, which is one of the cornerstones of the Union."
"Improving the security and governance of the Schengen area in a time of increased pressure is a means to this end."
"That said, in the light of the increased pressure on some external borders and the calls from Member States to strengthen the system of the Schengen rules, the Council needs to look into how we can further guarantee the principle of free movement and, at the same time, citizens' need for maintenance of a high level of internal security."
"At the Council meeting on 12 May 2011 the Presidency plans to initiate discussions on the various ideas on the Schengen acquis which have been put forward by the Commission in its communication on migration of 4 May."
"The Council looks forward in particular to examining the Commission's suggestions for a mechanism concerning the coordinated and temporary reintroduction of controls as a measure of last resort, based on objective criteria and respecting the Community method."
"The Council will also have a chance to discuss how to continue work on the revision of the Schengen evaluation mechanism to ensure more efficient and uniform implementation of the aquis."
"Of course our immediate priority is to deal with the effects of the dramatic events in the southern Mediterranean, but we also have to draw lessons for the future."
"In short we need to put in place a strategy for the longer term."
"Some of the issues which I have set out will help in creating such a strategy, but I look forward to discussions which can lead to a comprehensive approach to migration, fully in line with our global approach to migration."
"Along these lines Prime Minister Orbán has recently said that we should clearly differentiate between economic migrants and political refugees."
"Europe must welcome the latter if she wants to be true to herself."
"Europe must help, through means similar to a Marshall Plan, the countries of North Africa so as to create liveable conditions there, thus tackling the root causes of migration."
"That will require not only agreement amongst ourselves, but also consultations with our neighbours and in particular in partnership with the countries of Northern Africa, and it will need to take into account a wide range of factors such as international protection, migration, mobility and security."
"To conclude, from a wider perspective, our southern neighbours will be assisted by all available means in their transition to open, democratic and prosperous societies."
"This is the best possible way of addressing the push factors driving irregular immigrants towards our shores."
"President of the Commission. - Mr President, today we are here to debate migration and cross-border movement of European citizens, but let me start by reminding all of us that yesterday was the 61st anniversary of the Schuman Declaration, which laid the foundations of the European Union, and from that day began a process in which European people have been willing to come together and put aside their differences, to build a European continent without borders, where our citizens can move freely between countries."
"For regions like the one where we are now, here in Strasbourg and in Alsace generally, living on a frontier no longer equates with being restricted by borders, and the benefits extend far beyond these border regions."
"For the vast majority of European citizens, the right to move freely is the embodiment of the European project and one of the most tangible results of the European Union, and I am pleased to say that most Europeans use their right to the full - people make around 1.25 billion journeys as tourists within the European Union countries every year."
"That would be completely impossible without the European Union."
"I still remember when we had to overcome many difficulties in order to travel from my country, Portugal, to Spain."
"So it is indeed a great mark of the progress of civilisation that countries are able to lower barriers at their borders and let citizens move freely."
"Moreover, in terms of the economy too, free movement is central to the success of the Single Market and Europe's continued efforts to boost growth and jobs."
"To put it plainly, free movement is to Europe what foundations are to buildings."
"Remove it and the whole structure is undermined."
"Last week, the Commission presented a communication on a more structured approach to migration, referring, inter alia, to a proposal on a reinforced Schengen governance system."
"Other proposals will follow in the coming weeks, and here I want to praise the work of Commissioner Malmström who, with great intelligence and sensitivity, is doing her best to find the right approach to this complex matter."
"Let me concentrate on the governance of Schengen because I understand that this is the most important concern here in Parliament."
"Of course there are many other proposals, on the reinforcement of Frontex and on a common European asylum system, for example, but I hope we will have other occasions to discuss such issues in greater depth."
"Last year, the Commission put forward proposals to preserve and strengthen the Schengen evaluation mechanism as a central element in the acquis of our common project, and I want to emphasise that last year - i.e. well before the recent developments - the Commission had already identified some problems in the governance of Schengen."
"We will now update and complete these proposals and we will do all we can to achieve swift results."
"The current migration situation in the Mediterranean and the resulting pressures have highlighted some weaknesses and uncoordinated reactions by Member States in the management of Schengen."
"In the wake of these exceptional circumstances, we urgently need to reinforce the governance of Schengen and of the external borders."
"We need better coordination between the Commission and Member States and, above all, between Member States themselves."
"While recent events have provided a spark of urgency in bringing this matter to the table, the Commission is taking this opportunity, through the communication, to address the long-standing underlying inconsistencies and unresolved issues that have provided scope for some Member States to act unilaterally and not necessarily with a European Union perspective."
"It is time to nip this tendency in the bud: to stop it ab ovo."
"The Commission has already taken short-term measures to deal with the situation in the Mediterranean."
"In addition, the package we put forward last week urges rational reflection, taking into account short-term needs for strengthened external borders as well as a broader approach to asylum and migration."
"These issues must also be considered in the light of our neighbourhood policy, trade with North Africa and support for democratisation, as well as Europe's own long-term labour shortages and efforts to boost European competitiveness."
"This is not a knee-jerk reaction."
"This is not improvisation."
"This is and must be a broad range of measures built on the foundations of a strong and successful European policy, defining the best interests of the European Union and its citizens now and into the future."
"At the same time, the aim is to give relief to those Member States who are trying to cope with an unfair share of the migration burden."
"When thousands of people arrive on the shores of one country, it is not because they dream of living in Malta or Lampedusa; it is because they are seeking a better life in Europe."
"Countries that are more directly exposed to massive migrant inflows cannot be expected to deal with them alone."
"The rules on free movement of citizens benefit all countries in the European Union."
"It is the duty of all countries to support those countries that come under particular pressure at one time or another."
"This means that burdens have to be shared equitably."
"It also means that all Member States need to take their responsibilities seriously."
"When looking at burden sharing, all the pressures and all the contributions need to be taken into account, and this is the very spirit of the European Union: the management of crisis by solidarity and responsibility."
"Solidarity and responsibility are the key words in our response."
"Immigration is a European challenge."
"Immigration requires a European response."
"That is why the Commission's proposal aims to take Union governance of the Schengen system a step further, showing that there can be solidarity between Member States."
"This is about common governance, not unilateral moves."
"I emphasise once again that this is part of an overall approach."
"The strengthening of Frontex and the move to a common European asylum system are also aspects of such an approach."
"Allow me to make one point crystal clear: this is not about finding ways for Member States to reintroduce border controls."
"I firmly believe that to do so would not only catastrophically undermine what Europe has constructed over the past 61 years, but also sabotage the viability of our efforts to build a prosperous and integrated Europe for the future."
"Moreover, Member States already have the right to exercise this option unilaterally under the existing Schengen system."
"That right has been exercised in the past to help Member States cope with specific short-term exceptional circumstances, for example in the wake of terrorist attacks or in relation to the movement of drugs."
"These exceptions should remain exceptions, for I cannot emphasise strongly enough that reintroducing border controls is not a desirable development for Europe, neither in the current circumstances nor in relation to the future challenges that we will face sooner or later."
"They should be an absolute last resort."
"Moreover, we all know that internal controls can be sporadically useful but they are not part of a constructive approach to European integration, nor do they represent a cost-efficient long-term solution to monitoring movement and coping with immigration pressure."
"This has always been the case."
"The fact is that when faced with a massive arrival of migrants no Member State will ultimately be in a better position if it tries to deal with them alone."
"Only if Member States face the situation together, can a lasting solution be found."
"The proposals we put forward one year ago to strengthen Schengen, through an evaluation mechanism and intensified coordination of border surveillance, will help create a sense of Union-wide discipline and shared guidance in the system."
"They will ensure that, in the future, countries will not feel pressured to take decisions alone that affect all Schengen signatories."
"This is not, I emphasise, a new policy that undermines the Union."
"It is a chance to strengthen it - a step forward for joint European governance, not a step back."
"It is the intention to reinforce the Schengen acquis, not to depart from the Schengen acquis."
"We cannot be blind to the fact that recent events have revealed a problem in Schengen governance which we have to solve."
"If we do not reinforce existing mechanisms, Member States will continue to act alone."
"They will, in fact, be encouraged to act alone."
"We will be giving arguments to the populists, the extremists and, in some cases, the xenophobes who want to call into question the great acquis communautaire in this area."
"This is why we think the best way to avoid putting Schengen at risk is precisely to reinforce the rules of governance of Schengen and clarify some of its aspects."
"This is not, I insist, about caving in to pressure from any part of Europe."
"By enhancing our capacity to deal with crisis situations, it will put a more robust governance system in place that will equip decision-makers with better tools to resist populist or extremist pressure in the future."
"It is not a proposal intended simply to deal with short-term events, but there can only be real confidence in long-term solutions if we show that we can effectively address the short-term issues as well."
"It is not about turning back time: it is about getting the governance right today for the challenges Europe will surely face tomorrow."
"It is not about abandoning citizens' rights of free movement."
"It is about valuing their integrity by strengthening the rules."
"I am confident that this House will support our approach and our efforts."
"We are united in our determination to uphold the principles on which our Union is founded, against any populist temptation."
"We know that it is now fashionable in some quarters to be extremist or populist, or indeed sometimes to wave the flags of xenophobia."
"This is not what we are going to do."
"We will resist all these kinds of pressure, but to succeed in this we need to give citizens the confidence that we stand firm on two things: first on correcting the shortcomings of the existing system so that effective relief can be brought to situations of pressure and crisis; and, second, on ensuring, on this basis, full respect for human rights and the humanitarian principles on which our Union is founded."
"The people are ready to exercise solidarity, internally and externally, if they are confident that their security concerns are addressed decisively and comprehensively."
"I count on the support of this House in calling on the Member States to take the necessary decisions quickly."
"Our proposals are on the table."
"Now is not a time to wait: it is a time to act, so that an open European Union comes out of this challenge, united and stronger."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - (DE) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, as has already been emphasised, Schengen is one of the great achievements of our common European project."
"Citizens notice it on a daily basis when travelling around Europe."
"It is the realisation of the dream of Europe - a Europe without border controls."
"It must therefore first be made clear in this debate - particularly in view of the debate that has taken place in recent weeks - that we in this House will jointly ensure that this principle and the idea behind it are not derailed by any initiative or any debate."
"We will defend this principle in the European Parliament."
"In recent weeks there have been discussions concerning more than 25 000 refugees from Tunisia who have arrived in the Italian territory of Lampedusa."
"Yet a country such as Sweden has been accepting more than 25 000 people a year for years on end."
"There have been states that have accommodated much greater numbers of people relative to their own population that is currently happening on the southern border of Europe, yet nobody has ever thought of questioning Schengen because of the burden."
"I would therefore like to clearly stress at this stage that it is a pity that we seriously need to have a debate in Europe, of all places, on Schengen status as a result of this challenge that we must deal with together."
"Secondly, I should like to make it clear that we practise solidarity."
"When it comes to countries such as Malta - a small country that is massively affected and which has no hinterland - then we are currently practising solidarity."
"In addition to this solidarity, however, I should like to stress that the second basic principle is the responsibility that the countries themselves have."
"I must therefore also ask the Commission to look more into this."
"If courts in the European Union are now ruling that Dublin II is to be ineffective - in other words, that refugees are not to be deported to their states of first arrival - then we must ask the Commission how committed it will be to taking action against those states that are obviously not currently implementing the existing law."
"We are talking here about minimum standards in the European Union."
"I am therefore calling on the Commission to take action here, too."
"As regards the preparation for the Council, I have just three points to make."
"The first is that when it comes to migration then naturally we must expect more migration in the long term as a result of demographic change, but here in the European Union we currently have 24 million people without work and in Spain the youth unemployment rate is 30%."
"We should therefore proceed cautiously - very cautiously - when it comes to the issue of migration."
"My second point concerns strengthening Frontex, as has already been mentioned."
"My third point is that I would ask us all to ensure that those states that were about to join Schengen, namely Bulgaria and Rumania, are not left behind because of the current debate."
"They have done the work; they have made efforts."
"We are not asking for lower standards for joining, but if they meet the standards then it is only fair that Bulgaria and Rumania also have the right to become members of the Schengen area."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - (DE) Mr President, I do not share the opinion that the Commission's communication is a good one."
"I am very sorry, but I do not think it is."
"I think it is over the top and misguided."
"We are not dealing here with a crisis in the European Union."
"When 400 000 people travel from Libya to Tunisia, that is a crisis for Tunisia."
"When 20 000 people cross the Mediterranean to Europe, that is not a crisis for Europe."
"(Applause)"
"If the burden were sensibly spread across Europe then there would not be a problem at all."
"You gave the figures, Mr Weber."
"Nobody has got worked up over figures of such magnitude."
"I therefore do not believe that what you have presented is good, Mrs Malmström, because you have failed to quote Article 78(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)."
"I do not know whether you are familiar with it."
"Article 78(3) of TFEU states that in the event of one or more Member States being confronted by a sudden inflow of nationals of third countries, the Council, on a proposal from the Commission, may adopt provisional measures for the benefit of the Member State(s) concerned - after consulting the European Parliament, by the way."
"That is what Article 78(3) of the current Treaty says."
"By the way, temporary border controls were introduced on the basis of the Schengen regime of 2006 for the European Football Championship and for the football World Cup as a defence against hooliganism."
"There is no need whatsoever to give support to a populist initiative by two heads of government - who have their backs against the wall in their countries and are looking for an escape route by populist means - by tabling such a communication."
"(Applause)"
"Then what happened, President of the Commission?"
"A Northern League interior minister in Italy says: Tunisians all speak French; that is good - it means we can give them Schengen residence permits and they can all head off to France."
"The French President then naturally asks whether they have a screw loose."
"All the Tunisians coming to Italy now want to go to France?"
"You want to shove them onto us?"
"In that case, we will close the border."
"At that, Prime Minister Berlusconi and the French President join forces to say that now we need border controls again because of the situation that we ourselves have brought about."
"What does the Commission then do?"
"It tables a communication, instead of saying: 'People, that is absolutely the wrong road to go down."
"That is what I would have expected of you."
"(Applause)"
"We are losing the European spirit."
"How can it in fact be the case that in this Union - in which one of our greatest achievements as regards fundamental freedoms is the freedom of movement of our citizens - suddenly two heads of government can simply arbitrarily render ineffective one of our really great achievements - that was an excellent phrase you used in your speech - because of a marginal problem that can easily be managed?"
"How can that be possible?"
"All that is needed for these people to win is for us not to fight sufficiently against it."
"I would therefore have liked to see you fight it."
"(The President interrupted the speaker)"
"I would just like to say one thing to you: I live on a border, in my case the German-Dutch-Belgian border between Aachen, Maastricht and Lüttich."
"If you can explain to me, Mrs Malmström, how the migration problem in the Mediterranean is going to be managed by my having to show my passport the next time I travel from Aachen to Maastricht - if you can explain that to me, please - then I would be very grateful."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, let us be very open and blunt about this: what we have seen in recent weeks on this issue has been shameful - Italy issuing temporary residence permits to refugees from Tunisia, then France reacting by reintroducing internal border checks, as if the European Union had suddenly ceased to exist."
"Let us be very open and call this by its name: it was a ping-pong game by two governments, and by Berlusconi and Sarkozy, on the back of refugees who are, in fact, in trouble."
"That is what has been happening and, in my opinion, it has been disastrous not only for Schengen but also for the European Union and its image because the reintroduction of internal border checks contradicts the whole essence of the Union and the basic principles of the Treaty."
"That point has been made several times here and Mr Barroso has also made it."
"Moreover, what occurred was absolutely out of proportion."
"I would not go so far as to echo Mr Schulz in calling this a marginal problem - 27 000 Tunisians do not constitute a marginal problem - but he is right to say that, by comparison with, for example, the 350 000 people who fled from Kosovo during the Kosovo war, we are clearly not talking about a migration tsunami."
"And so we come to the problem: the communication from the Commission."
"In my opinion, it was not very clear."
"The communication states that, as a last resort in truly critical situations, a mechanism may need to be introduced - and, as I read it, that means a new mechanism - allowing for a coordinated and temporary reintroduction of controls."
"That is the problem with the whole communication because, if this means that the Commission is proposing an additional possibility for the reintroduction of border controls, not provided for in the existing Schengen acquis, I can tell you that our Group will fight such a proposal with all available means, and I hope the entire Parliament will do likewise."
"If, on the contrary, the sentence in question means that the Commission wants to restrict the current provision, then that has been foreseen: national security and public order are the two elements covered by the existing Schengen acquis."
"If the intended meaning is that the Commission wants to restrict the current provision allowing Member States to reintroduce border controls, then, Mr Barroso, you can have 100% support from our Group."
"So, what I am asking of Ms Malmström and Mr Barroso is a rewriting of the communication and specifically of the sentence which states that a new mechanism shall be introduced for the reintroduction of border checks."
"All they need to do is to state that they will strengthen the existing provision in the Schengen acquis."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, my Group and I welcome this opportunity to debate the issues and problems which Europe faces in the area of migration and the Schengen system."
"The debate is long overdue."
"Now is the time to focus not only on providing free movement, but also on better guarding the borders of Member States and the EU itself."
"Rather than pushing for more legislation in the area of immigration and migration, we should be making the legislation that we already have work better and harder for all the citizens of the Union."
"However, current concerns from Member States are not reactionary, but instead the inevitable consequence of over 20 years of ever-changing circumstances in Europe and around the world."
"There is no doubt that Schengen has been a success in many ways, but Europe is facing challenges which simply did not exist to the current extent when the system was first created."
"Large-scale unemployment, migration from North Africa, terrorism, organised crime and people-trafficking have provided us with problems far more complex than those envisaged in the policies for free movement of European citizens."
"It is not an unfair assessment to say that the current system is now shown to be flawed and ill-equipped for the new circumstances we find ourselves in."
"We need to create an effective tool representative of the modern needs of Europe's Member States and able to improve the situation for all."
"This needs to be complemented by renewed strength in making sure the other agencies of the EU, like Frontex, are there to support states in securing their own EU external borders, and that the problems are not exacerbated by further countries which may join the EU and therefore the Schengen area that are both ill-prepared to face the challenges and also to assume the burdens that accompany the obvious benefits."
"This is a problem best solved through communication and cooperation, but Europe's immigration and Schengen policies urgently require review, reflection and then sensible reform."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, there is something I do not understand."
"We are told that 25 000 Tunisians are arriving in Europe and people are talking about a lack of security."
"What lack of security?"
"Let us not forget that extraordinary events have been taking place in Tunisia and Egypt, and that a war is going on in Libya."
"May I remind you that during the war in Bosnia temporary residency permits were issued while the war lasted."
"Germany took in several hundreds of thousands of people."
"This happened and Germany is still standing."
"It has not gone under as yet."
"All this talk of a sinking ship is just propaganda."
"Added to this, we are now hearing talk of criminals and mafia."
"As if criminals and mafia were landing in Lampedusa!"
"Criminals do not need to come through Lampedusa."
"They come in the usual way."
"We do not see them, but they are here in our countries."
"So stop making such a fuss."
"The problem is quite straightforward: people are fleeing from North Africa."
"So let us share out the support for them in Europe."
"Surely you are not going to tell me that 25 000 people among 400 million is a big problem?"
"Let me tell you something."
"This is close to me, because how many Jews did we turn away?"
"The English did it, the Americans did, all the countries did it when the Jews were leaving, because people said there were too many Jews."
"This was in 1939-1940."
"It was Europe that was like this."
"England was like this: it turned Jews away."
"The United States turned them away."
"The ship was called the Saint Louis."
"It sickens me that every time people are in difficulty, it is seen that they are the problem."
"They are not the problem: it is us and our inability to show solidarity and our inability to be open."
"(Applause)"
"Commissioners, President-in-Office of the Council, are you aware of what happened in Paris?"
"In Paris, some young Tunisians who had an Italian residency permit heard the French police say to them: 'This is what we are going to do with your permits', before tearing them up in front of them."
"This is European law today: a national police force that tells people who have a residency permit issued by Italy: 'Mr Sarkozy has decided they do not count'."
"If this is the state of the law in Europe, I say something has gone wrong, and that is why I am asking you now to stop telling us that the problems in North Africa represent a security problem."
"The problem in North Africa and the problem of the war in Libya are causing a problem of insecurity for the people living there."
"So let us distribute the refugees between us."
"Let us empower them by giving them temporary permits until things have calmed down, and let these permits be Europe-wide."
"I think that by accepting this debate on Schengen today and by accepting populist pressure and racism, any border controls will be based on people's faces."
"Mr Schulz, did anyone stop you?"
"No."
"Mr Verhofstadt, did anyone stop you?"
"No."
"They did not stop me either."
"But anyone who is brown-skinned, anyone who is different will be stopped and checked."
"We will create an à la carte Europe."
"Whites are allowed in, brown-skinned people are not!"
"That is the kind of Europe we want to fight against."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (PT) Mr President, exactly one year ago, we voted in this Parliament on our part of the codecision on resettling refugees, and in that codecision we had an emergency mechanism to be used in the case of any refugees who found themselves under armed attack or were the victims of natural disasters."
"One year on, this codecision has not been concluded by the Council and my work as rapporteur on the resettlement of refugees has now become the job of finding support for this co-decision."
"We had 600 votes in favour, only for it to become a task that was at first frustrating and depressing, and is now desperate."
"My job as rapporteur on the resettlement of refugees cannot be to report, like last month, that have 150 people died off the coat of Lampedusa and now to learn of 600 who have disappeared and more than 60 who died in view of ships from the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) ships and European navies."
"That cannot be what my job is about."
"The Council has to conclude this codecision, because there is a great deal to do to resettle refugees."
"Right now, we can call on Baroness Ashton to say that we need to open a humanitarian corridor to bring out 8 000 who are still in Tripoli."
"There are 8 000 who have United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) identity cards; not very many."
"NATO ships need to be told to apply the 1973 Resolution, which says to protect civilians."
"That means the same in Benghazi, Misrata and the Mediterranean: it means saving those who are shipwrecked."
"In relation to Schengen, I want to say one thing."
"The response to ad hoc, unilateral suspensions of Schengen can never be a systemic suspension of Schengen by the Union."
"This is not a case of completely killing off the idea."
"It is a case of sticking to the idea and applying it universally."
"It cannot be."
"For a start, it has to be a case of applying resources to resettling refugees."
"Do you know how much money the Member States of the European Union made, just from the sale of arms to Libya in 2009?"
"EUR 343 million. Do you know how much we have in the European Refugee Fund (ERF)?"
"EUR 100 million. We would be delighted if the ERF contained as much as we earned in just one year from the sale of arms."
"Hungary, which was the first country in the world to be the subject of a coordinated action to resettle its refugees in 1956, has very particular responsibilities - historical responsibilities - to act on this refugee crisis as well."
"We cannot complain of a lack of funds in this area."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr President, yesterday indeed was Europe Day and in the courtyard here we had armed soldiers, we had the Luftwaffe band and imperial eagles, we had the flag being paraded, being raised, the European anthem; it was the display of militarism and EU nationalism."
"I thought and hoped it was all just a bad dream, but today we have got you, Mr Barroso."
"You begin of course by reiterating the fact that the free movement of peoples is the embodiment of the European project."
"You then go on to say that it is the duty of Member States to share the burdens of migratory flows into Europe."
"You advocate a common EU immigration policy, but of course you know that you are losing because the row that has blown up between Italy and France shows that when there is a crisis, between the theory of European integration and the practicality of nation state, it is the nation state that wins."
"So you are worried that you are losing and, in your defence of your position, in your defence of your beloved acquis communautaire, your body of law, you resort to intolerance, you resort to nationalism, you make me realise that what I saw yesterday was actually for real."
"You attack those who want to control their own border policies."
"You attack them today as xenophobes."
"You attack them as extremists, but worst of all, oh worst of all, you attack them three times for being populists."
"Is that not a dreadful thing?"
"The power of the ballot box."
"When people dare to vote no in referendums, they are populists; when they want to control their own borders, they are populists."
"I put it to you that populists are actually democrats and you abuse those who want to fly the flag of populism."
"Well, here it is, Mr Barroso."
"Here it is."
"(Mr Farage, Mr Agnew and Mr Bloom held up small Union Jacks)"
"That flag has represented liberal democracy far more than any other Member State of this European Union and it will go on long after your star-spangled banner has disappeared."
"(NL) Mr President, although Schengen stipulates that checks on the EU's internal borders must be removed, it also stipulates that we have to monitor our external borders."
"The problem is that this Treaty is not being complied with, because our external borders are not being effectively monitored."
"Therefore, 16 years after the introduction of Schengen, we should have the courage to recognise that the Treaty has not worked."
"We should also have the courage to admit that the EU has not provided a solution and that, instead, it has itself become part of the problem."
"Member States must therefore once again be given the possibility of protecting their borders without EU interference."
"We urgently need more measures."
"Frontex, for example, should send back ships carrying bogus refugees to their countries of origin instead of playing the role of a sort of benevolent welcome committee."
"We must crack down on human trafficking networks."
"Member States should stop rewarding illegal foreigners with residence permits."
"Active steps should be taken to repatriate illegal refugees and political refugees whose applications have been rejected."
"If none of that happens, I guarantee you that that will be the end of Schengen, which would, actually, not be such a bad thing."
"Mr President, I would also like to protest against the language being used here, against terms of abuse such as 'populists', 'extremists' and the like, for people who simply want to protect the borders of their country."
"We need to put a stop to that."
"It is not right."
"We must also admit that the rules need to be applied; is it not strange that, while we are refusing to discuss the application of the rules, we are allowing some people to call others names?"
"Mr President, the Schengen zone is indeed a very important and visible achievement for European citizens and the message is coming out clearly from this Chamber today that we need to fight together not just to preserve it, but to strengthen it further."
"We rely on the European Commission to achieve that and the European Parliament will be behind the Commission in strengthening Schengen, but if there are two lessons that we have learnt in respect of what happened in recent weeks they are these."
"First of all, the internal borders within Schengen depend on a common strategy, a common concern about our external borders."
"If our external borders are weak then we will have problems on our internal borders and we need to look at that."
"Italy felt under pressure with 25 000 people; it gave them a temporary permit, they moved to France."
"France felt under pressure and it re-erected national borders."
"So the pressure went onto the internal borders and therefore the external borders are a common concern."
"Secondly, Schengen needs solidarity and solidarity is also about sharing the responsibility - burden-sharing - and sharing responsibility is also relative to the size of the Member State."
"On the current system, people who arrive in one country remain in the country where they arrive because our laws, including the Dublin Regulation, ensure that they have to remain in the first country of arrival."
"This clearly needs to change because it is no longer tenable."
"One thousand people arriving in the smallest Member State, my country Malta, are equivalent, population-wise, to over one million people arriving in the entire European Union."
"So yes, 25 000 people are nothing, they are a drop in the ocean for the entire Union but 1000 people arriving in the southernmost Member State are a lot."
"We need therefore to link Schengen with solidarity;"
"Schengen needs solidarity."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))"
"Mr President, the speaker talked of strengthening Schengen."
"Does that include strengthening Schengen's borders and, in particular, the borders between Greece and Turkey?"
"Mr President, I thank the Member for his question."
"One of the conditions for joining the Schengen zone is, indeed, strengthening external borders."
"Precisely because they are a common concern, it is the responsibility of all the Member States to ensure that the external borders are strong."
"Once you fulfil those conditions, then you can join Schengen."
"This is precisely what countries such as Bulgaria and Romania have done, and it is precisely why we have helped Greece, by means of a Frontex mission there on the Turkish-Greek border."
"So, yes, this goes to show that strengthening external borders is also a common concern."
"(ES) Mr President, it is true that yesterday, 9 May, we commemorated the moment that the European Union was founded, which showed us that Europe would be built with small steps and not once and for all, or for evermore: in other words, that Europe is not built definitively or irreversibly, and that our day-to-day work must be to preserve each of its achievements."
"Schengen is an area of free movement of people, but it is also a symbol of the best that Europe has done in the last 20 years and, therefore, of the best Europe."
"Presenting the 25 000 immigrants who have arrived on this side of the Mediterranean as an unbearable burden sends the wrong sort of message: Germany has demonstrated that they are not; the Canary Islands and Spain have demonstrated that 30 000 arrivals per year from the African coasts were not an unbearable burden for the European Union."
"The response cannot, therefore, be to use this migration flow to question Schengen."
"Quite the contrary: instead it must be used to demonstrate that what still remains to be done is not correcting weaknesses caused by Schengen's excesses, but rather strengthening Schengen."
"Schengen can be strengthened by completing the solidarity clause provided for in the area of freedom, security and justice, pursuant to the Treaty of Lisbon; by completing the asylum package, whose processing still remains outstanding; and by permanently establishing the second-generation Schengen Information System (SIS II) and the verification mechanism, as stipulated in the conditions of entry to the area of free movement and as Parliament has voted in favour of Romania and Bulgaria doing."
"These countries have the right to become part of the area of free movement."
"However, what needs to be done above all is for the European Parliament to stake its claim to competence to decide on the issue alongside the Council."
"I would therefore remind you that the proposal that the procedure invoke the legal basis of Article 70, which excludes Parliament, is unacceptable: we demand Article 77."
"A final thought, Mr President: populism is being mentioned, because populism is not combated by imitating its half-hearted solutions but, quite the contrary, by confronting it with solutions for the future and not the past."
"Mr President, Mr Verhofstadt asked the Commission to rewrite the communication but I wonder if, before it is rewritten, we could get a clear answer today as to whether or not you are aiming to improve the current existing system, to temporarily close borders, or to add something to the existing system."
"That would be a good way of solving at least one of our questions."
"Having said this, it is fair to say that we concur with the Commission's aim of improving Schengen governance by reviewing the evaluation mechanism on the basis of a Community approach."
"Parliament shares this view and, in this context, I have to say that we are deeply disappointed by the Council's approach."
"In fact what the Council wants to do is simply to isolate the Parliament."
"I really wonder why the Council almost constantly seeks to undermine the great achievement that is the codecision role of the European Parliament."
"We represent European citizens, and we should all work to serve European citizens."
"Perhaps the Council should also understand its role as an EU institution rather than a mere gathering of 27 Member States."
"The truth is that the answer to this migration flow, whether or not it is due to what has happened in North Africa and the Southern Mediterranean, is to come up with legislation involving a common policy on asylum and migration, which Parliament has worked on and which is being blocked in the Council."
"(PL) Mr President, in spite of the fact that I live a relatively long way away, in Poland, I feel that I understand entirely the concerns provoked by uncontrolled immigration into France or Italy."
"Immigration from North Africa quite naturally exacerbates cultural and social tensions, and intensifies pressure on the social budgets of the Member States."
"We therefore have a lot to discuss, and we should not try to ignore the matter."
"French, Italian and Maltese citizens are today faced with the highest bills on account of the fact that controls along the European Union's external borders are simply not working."
"The European nations are also footing the bill for our failed efforts to halt immigration into Europe."
"I have only one request."
"I would like the changes to the Schengen Code not to be used as a pretext for limiting the freedom of movement of citizens of the European Union's Member States."
"Such proposals have been made for many years in respect of the Polish-German border, to the disadvantage of Polish citizens."
"It will be easier to reach an agreement if we have a full guarantee that changes to the Schengen Code will not affect the citizens of the Member States."
"(FR) Mr President, this debate beggars belief."
"We are being asked to review the freedom of movement of people in Europe and to reinstate national borders in order to cope with the influx of migrants that has supposedly been overwhelming Europe since the revolution in Tunisia."
"If the consequences of this posturing were not so drastic and far-removed from reality, they would be laughable."
"Since the beginning of 2011, over 1 150 people have died in the Mediterranean and 23 000 people have arrived in Italy."
"Meanwhile, more than 700 000 people have fled Libya and sought refuge in neighbouring countries and have found a different kind of welcome there than the kind they would have received in Europe."
"Mr Sarkozy and Mr Berlusconi are putting short-term electoral interests first, by fearmongering and making people believe there is an invasion going on."
"What nonsense!"
"When will Europe stop saying one thing and doing another?"
"What suggestions are people putting forward today, apart from just words, giving in to populist pressure, reinforcing Frontex yet again and turning Europe into a fortress?"
"Borders have never stopped anyone, either during the darker days of our history or today."
"Do we not have any other message to pass on to the emerging democracies on the other side of the Mediterranean?"
"The Union reached out to the dictators for years, in contempt of its own values."
"Is it not time that it opened its eyes?"
"I for one think it is."
"(Applause)"
"(NL) Mr President, I believe that Mr Borghezio, of the Europe of Freedom and Democracy Group, is next in line to speak."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this issue has the merit of having brought great hypocrisy to light."
"The only government within the European Union that has an interior minister from a party which you define as populist is the one that has had the courage to implement the most humanitarian measure: giving 25 000 Tunisian people permission to move freely."
"This is because we saw in the flesh that they were not 25 000 criminals, but people who had fled Tunisia."
"It was an emergency, we had to face it with common sense and we have tried to help."
"This shows a truth, namely that in many situations the real 'goodies' are us, the 'baddies'."
"We who affirm the need to control immigration and external borders, continue to beg Europe - as Mr Cohn-Bendit has rightly done - to spread what might become 50 000 or 100 000 refugees across its territory, because the people who flee Libya are not criminals."
"These are the clear words of a movement which defends territory and identity, which is against immigration because it does not want people to be uprooted, and which condemns racism and xenophobia but also hypocrisy."
"(NL) Mr President, we have a single European asylum and migration policy, one and the same awful policy for the whole of the EU."
"The recent disastrous stream of migrants from North Africa and the trouble we have been having with the failing Schengen Treaty indicate that asylum and migration policy should be handed back to Member States."
"One Member State is not the same as another, it is as simple as that."
"That is why a single, common European policy will not work."
"Mr President, Commissioner Malmström's proposal concerning Schengen is a downright pathetic move."
"It is bonkers of her to decide that Member States should not be allowed to make up their own minds on whether or not to introduce border checks and, if necessary, close their borders."
"Member States are having trouble with tens of thousands of underprivileged migrants from North Africa, but Commissioner Malmström is preventing them from doing anything about it."
"We still have boatloads of fortune-seeking migrants reaching Lampedusa."
"The evil of migration continues its insidious spread."
"But no, if you ask Commissioner Malmström, she will tell you that Member States are not allowed to fight back."
"Instead, she gives us some claptrap about solidarity."
"Mr President, Member States are unfortunately no longer the masters in their own homes."
"Europe is the master."
"Member States want those powers back."
"Member States must, once again, be able to set their own asylum and immigration policies."
"What is the Commission going to do about this?"
"(PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by telling Commissioner Malmström that I agree with the deserved praise given to her by President Barroso for the work that she is doing in this area."
"The fact that we are experiencing a difficult period with regard to migration pressures cannot be an excuse for weakening one of the major achievements of European integration: namely, the Schengen area."
"Schengen is synonymous with freedom of movement, and this reality cannot and must not be reversed, but must be protected, strengthened and developed."
"I also agree that proper control of external borders is essential."
"If this does not happen, the security of the Schengen area is weakened, the credibility of the European Union is undermined and mutual trust is destroyed."
"Therefore, I welcome the recognition made by the European Commission, in its communication of last week, of the importance of the Schengen area, and of the challenge of strengthening and developing it."
"I also agree with President Barroso that there is a need for greater solidarity and sharing of responsibilities between the Member States."
"The problem does not lie in the Schengen rules, but in the way in which the Member States apply the rules without responsibility or solidarity."
"Therefore, we require a real mechanism for evaluating Schengen."
"This Parliament is prepared to work in good faith to create this mechanism: a mechanism that does not apply double standards; in other words, that is not more demanding of candidate countries than of those that are already members of the club."
"However, I am concerned, Commissioner."
"I am concerned about the silence of the Presidency of the Council at the start of this debate concerning this mechanism, and I am also concerned about the Council's year-long silence concerning the mechanism for resettling refugees, as already mentioned by Mr Tavares."
"Of the three institutions, the one that is not making good progress in this area is the Council, and it should get back on track as quickly as possible."
"a blue-card question for Mr van der Stoep. - (NL) Mr President, I would like to ask Mr van der Stoep the following question: if border checks were to be reintroduced, what would Mr van der Stoep say to the Dutch holidaymakers returning from a fortnight's holiday in France who want to cross the border between Antwerp and Hazeldonk and who, on their way home, end up in a mile-long tailback, the same tailback as the lorry drivers on their way to the Port of Rotterdam to unload their cargo?"
"(NL) Mr President, Mrs Sargentini knows very well that we are absolutely against new customs gates being set up; from 1992, when our borders were opened, to last year's common asylum and migration policy, everything worked absolutely fine."
"However, at a certain moment, we crossed a line ourselves and what you seem to have overlooked is the fact that there are now 25,000 economic refugees in Italy who are going to be given visas."
"These are economic refugees and they should be sent back to their countries as soon as possible."
"They should not even have been permitted to apply for a visa."
"The Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV) has always been clear on this: we do not want those gates back, but what we do want is merely the possibility of determining our own asylum and migration policy ourselves, and you are well aware of that."
"Madam President, the position of the S&D Group is very clear."
"We have heard all the background as to why Schengen is being breached and we have waited since 1999 for any kind of common migration or asylum policy."
"So we are very clear in our messages."
"First to the Commission: on Schengen, you want a Community mechanism for collective decision-making, you want to move away from intergovernmentalism, you want a lock on the political opportunism that we have seen from Italy and from France."
"So please do not make the message ambiguous in the statement."
"Make it clear that you will have a lock and you will prevent that type of opportunism which will in the end break Schengen."
"To the Council: you have waited since 1999 for a common European asylum system, you have created a situation where solidarity and burden-sharing are often spoken of in this place, but we are nowhere near the formal mechanism for burden-sharing in the European Community."
"You are blocking much of the work we are doing here in Parliament."
"Unblock it."
"Work with us and the Commission to ensure that solidarity means solidarity, burden-sharing means burden-sharing."
"And finally, the Commission is looking ahead to a migration policy."
"Work with us."
"Do not be timid, be courageous and ensure that when we fix Schengen, we also fix our common migration policy and we have something to be proud of."
"Madam President, like others I think that Commissioner Malmström is doing a very good job, but I also feel, in view of President Barroso's robust defence of Schengen free movement today, that I do not really understand how the notion could possibly have taken hold that the Commission's proposed EU-level mechanism is going to make it easier to reintroduce internal border controls."
"Yet that notion has taken hold."
"It could not possibly be, could it, that different messages are being sent to different audiences, one to MEPs, maybe one to Paris and Rome?"
"The EU's migration and asylum pressures ought to be capable of effective management by competent governments."
"Unfortunately we have too many governments now which are playing to the extremist right-wing gallery."
"The European Commission must indeed defend EU internal free movement and not throw gestures to the likes of President Sarkozy and Prime Minister Berlusconi for electioneering purposes."
"It should highlight the failure of Member States to implement EU migration rules."
"Lastly, the Commission must investigate allegations about 61 migrants being left to die, despite their making contact with Italian coastguards, a NATO warship and a military helicopter."
"Any authorities that breached international maritime and humanitarian law must be brought to book."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I think we need to get to the point here."
"We do not need a new rule on the temporary or any other reintroduction of border controls, either now or in the future."
"We need to grasp that freedom of movement - and that is, after all, the message of the European Union - is something that you cannot simply displace or circumvent at will."
"It is a citizens' right that you cannot simply relativise."
"Do you want to know what honestly annoys me?"
"We hear a lot said about solidarity."
"Who is talking about solidarity with the countries of Africa who are currently having to accommodate hundreds of thousands of refugees and will continue to do so - without great debate?"
"Is anyone talking about solidarity with the people who are fleeing war and coming here to Europe?"
"We need to show these people a bit of respect."
"To be frank, I do not want to discuss any changes to Schengen or any rules whatsoever;"
"I simply want us to deal sensibly with migration once and for all."
"We will not achieve this by using Frontex as a means of deporting people; we will achieve it by having a democratic and humanitarian asylum law."
"That is what we should be talking about in Europe and it must apply throughout Europe."
"That is what we should fight for."
"That is our real task."
"(FR) Madam President, my speech is addressed to the Commission and to my fellow Members, and I would also like to welcome the Council."
"The issue we are facing today stems from the management of the Schengen area in 2011."
"That area is no longer restricted to five Member States, as it was in the 1980s."
"Rather, it is an area which has continually expanded over the last few years and which today comprises 25 countries, three of which are not members of the European Union."
"Therefore, like all European policies, cooperation in the Schengen area should reflect the real situation to which it applies today, which is different from that of 10 years ago."
"This is the context in which the Italian and French Governments' proposals, and the pragmatic and necessary steps outlined by the Commission today in its communication on immigration, should be understood."
"Mutual trust between the Member States party to the Schengen area is indeed the cornerstone of Schengen cooperation."
"However, this trust is based on reciprocal obligations."
"If one of the parties fails to respect its obligations and generates an influx, the whole system breaks down."
"The other Member States must therefore be allowed to respond to this breakdown by restoring temporary and strictly regulated border controls."
"Such action would be a clear request to the Member States that are responsible for the breakdown to control their external borders better."
"Furthermore, the Commission's proposed measures would be very much in the spirit of Schengen, since controls would be reinstated as a last resort and the decision would be taken at European level rather than at intergovernmental level."
"These measures will be intrinsically linked to all of the other proposed long-term measures, in preparation for a common migration policy."
"Strengthening Frontex and showing greater solidarity are particularly crucial - and I will conclude on this point - in order to support the Member States situated at our external borders."
"The situation in the Mediterranean in recent years only serves to highlight shortcomings in the Schengen acquis."
"In the space of a few weeks, migrants from neighbouring Mediterranean countries have come to account for a significant percentage of France's annual immigration."
"This acquis is not static, but must instead be developed."
"I hope that this proposal will be adopted quickly in order to guarantee better management of our Schengen area as soon as possible, and thus to ensure the security of our common external borders."
"(RO) Madam President, the exceptional migration flows, such as those from the southern Mediterranean, must not pose a threat to the Schengen area."
"The European Commission must not promote the ideas of certain Member States which cast doubt over it."
"The role of the Commission is to protect the Schengen area by promoting European solutions mentioned in the Schengen acquis."
"Member States must demonstrate solidarity in managing the Schengen area."
"The Council must also help strengthen the Schengen area by giving its immediate approval allowing Romania and Bulgaria to access this area."
"The so-called problems with the Schengen area are bogus and have nothing to do with the freedom of movement inside the Union, but with the inability or bad faith on the part of some states to face up to immigration-related problems outside the European Union."
"The solution for the future lies in improving Europe's migration management system, completing the process of setting up the European Common Asylum System, the legal framework for illegal and legal migration, and enhancing the role of Frontex."
"(IT) Madam President, in recent weeks massive migration flows have provoked anxiety and reactions among European citizens."
"Some Member States have set out positions that mean that the question of migration flows should be held in high estimation."
"Schengen is now an established asset of European civilization and as such should be protected and preserved."
"This does not mean that the temporary reintroduction of border controls, under certain conditions, is not an option."
"We therefore welcome compensation mechanisms based on an EU approach, to ensure, in each case, the application of the Schengen area in compliance with the expectations of the people concerned."
"The Commission's valuable proposal of 4 May 2011, by which the Schengen area is made more flexible and concerted in order to allow a more regular management of internal migration flows, heads in this direction."
"The proposal aims at stronger governance, which must certainly be held in due consideration during moments of particular crisis."
"I listened with particular interest to Mr Barroso both here in Brussels and in Palermo on the regional policies for the protection of Sicily and Lampedusa, which continues to see the arrival of boats which would otherwise be at the mercy of raging seas where more lives would be lost."
"Madam President, we must continue to take this into account."
"(FR) Madam President, in these important debates on migration issues, we must avoid at all costs falling into the trap of Mr Sarkozy's and Mr Berlusconi's opportunistic statements on the Schengen Agreements."
"Using Europe and migration flows as punchbags while citing the populist arguments of the extreme right is a very convenient way for some European governments to conceal their national economic and social failings."
"To challenge free movement, a tangible achievement of European integration, today, is manipulative and dangerous."
"On the one hand commentators are saying that the Commission has sided with France and Italy, while on the other President Barroso is today telling us that he does not intend to side with populist Member States."
"Which of these is it?"
"The Communication of 4 May not only mentions the reinstatement of internal border controls, it also addresses many other topics, such as the fight against human trafficking, legal immigration, resettlement of refugees, asylum and so on. Those are the real issues!"
"The problem is that this communication only goes halfway."
"Commissioner Malmström, it seems that you want to reintroduce a Community approach, which is vital."
"Go on then, I dare you!"
"We need more Europe and more integration where Member States are tempted to protect only their individual interests."
"(Applause)"
"(EL) Madam President, on 2 July 1990, just a few days after the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement was signed, Time Magazine published an article which started as follows: 'The dream of a border-free Europe took a step toward reality' and ended as follows: 'to combat a possible increase in illicit drug trafficking, terrorist activities and illegal immigration, controls on the external borders of Schengenland will be tightened'."
"That was written 21 years ago and, as the President of the Commission said, that is precisely what we are being called on to do today: to keep the dream alive and to tighten controls on the Italian, Greek and southern European borders as a whole, because the southern borders of united Europe are the borders of the other states - of Germany, France and Belgium, for example."
"In keeping with the principles of solidarity and reciprocity that keep this Europe alive, we need to review everything which does not appear to be paying off, to review the Dublin II agreement, as already debated in Parliament, and to share the burdens which each Member State must bear fairly, so that we can all help to keep the dream alive."
"(IT) Madam President, to question Schengen is, in our view, to question Europe."
"If Europe is going to be even weaker, as right-wing governments desire, it will be increasingly tempting to ask ourselves whether remaining in Europe still makes sense, as the Italian Interior Minister, Mr Maroni, has done."
"The answer, however, is greater involvement of EU mechanisms."
"In essence, we need more Europe, not less Europe, and the Commission needs to say so more forcefully."
"The best of Europe was shown on Sunday night when, in an extraordinary chain of human solidarity, the people of Lampedusa saved 500 shipwrecked people who were heading towards certain death."
"The worst of Europe, if the news carried by The Guardian is confirmed, would be NATO military forces who do not intervene to save men, women and children adrift."
"If we are sure about which of these we prefer, Mrs Malmström, then during the European Council in June the Commission will have to convince Member States to formulate a European policy on immigration, because Europe à la carte would be tantamount to the collapse of the European dream."
"(NL) Madam President, in June 2009 I was elected to the European Parliament by European citizens."
"I was not elected to a parliament of institutions, nor was I elected to a parliament of individual Member States."
"I am pointing that out because European citizens have many questions about Schengen."
"This is nothing to do with populism, nor is it to do with fear."
"This is to do with the questions which are worrying European citizens: how are we dealing with Schengen?"
"Many questions are being asked about this at the moment, and I therefore call your attention to this."
"Obviously, if the President of the Commission says that we have to uphold the principle of free movement of persons, then I will support that."
"25,000 Tunisians cannot be allowed to take 502 million Europeans hostage, but these questions will not go away and public support for Schengen in Europe will be jeopardised."
"That is why I can also agree to temporary border check arrangements, as my fellow member Mr Iacolino suggested."
"I am very well aware that we cannot get burden-sharing up and running at the first attempt."
"Finally, Madam President, one more question: what is the state of play when it comes to the launch of the European Asylum Support Office in Malta?"
"I have heard that there is still a possibility of it getting off the ground."
"Perhaps, the Commissioner could explain once again when the Office will actually be up and running."
"(ES) Madam President, Mrs Malmström, the problem with the communication tabled by the Commission is that it is a communication that is not credible at the present time, in relation to the long-term problems that the issue raised here involves, or even to the emergency solutions that the European Union should have implemented at this time."
"Unfortunately, what the Commission has shown is that it is very weak, because you cannot keep everyone happy."
"It is not possible to keep Mr Sarkozy and Mr Berlusconi happy, on the one hand, and have a common asylum and immigration policy for the long term, on the other."
"It is impossible to introduce ambiguities that go nowhere into a communication like this, and what they demonstrate is that this is a policy that does not resolutely face up to the situation we are experiencing."
"Mr Barroso is not doing you much of a favour when he says that you have done the best you could to find a balance, because this is not about finding a balance."
"This is about dealing with an emergency situation like the one before us."
"It is about having financing and reaching a proper agreement between the Member States on a common asylum policy, on the European Asylum Office and on all the challenges we are facing."
"There is none of that here."
"How can you talk about regional cooperation programmes with third countries when the democrats of Tunisia and Libya are seeing us closing our countries' borders?"
"Is it possible to talk about that?"
"We cannot say ambiguous things."
"We are dealing with issues serious enough that you should take this seriously too, Mrs Malmström."
"(DE) Madam President, I consider the debate on the reintroduction of border controls and the modification of the Schengen mechanism to be absolutely excessive and superfluous."
"Moreover, we are only having this debate because Mr Berlusconi and Mr Sarkozy were thinking only of their national interests and acting in a populist way when they threatened to reintroduce controls at the borders between individual Member States on account of the migrants from North Africa."
"I was also astounded - I must make that clear - at how quickly Mr Barroso, the President of the Commission, took up the debate rather than taking a corrective European approach."
"Schengen is a huge achievement."
"Schengen is a European symbol and is the perfect combination of freedom to travel, open borders and security."
"Schengen must never be brought into question."
"In special cases we already have the possibility of reintroducing controls for a limited period and in a limited region where there is a serious threat to internal security."
"What we do not need, then, is a debate on Schengen."
"What we instead need is a debate on measures to enhance Frontex so as to provide maximum security at the external borders of the European Union - thereby ensuring freedom of movement - and a debate on speedy asylum proceedings and managed migration, on cooperation to deal with the causes of migration and on readmission agreements."
"I am happy to go along with Commissioner Malmström's proposals on this - her proposals are very broad - and I invite the Commission to follow Parliament's lead, rather than the lead set by certain representatives of the Council."
"(EL) Madam President, Commissioner, at a time when, politically, the fundamental principles of cohesion and solidarity in the EU are under attack on all sides, especially from neo-nationalist movements, and we all know who they are, the Commission should, in my opinion, make it its daily task to crush anyone who attacks the symbols of European political unification."
"Yet, we are here today, precisely because it has not done so."
"It has allowed a debate to be instigated under pressure from certain Member States on the cornerstone of the European identity: Schengen."
"However, legally also, the Commission's proposal conflicts with Articles 78 and 80 of the Convention."
"Where a Member State is under severe pressure from immigration, the Convention expressly states that Europe must provide support and solidarity."
"Restoring internal border controls is not solidarity, it is punishment."
"It does not fairly distribute the burden of the pressure on the external borders, for example, by strengthening Frontex; it puts an even greater burden on the Member State."
"In other words, Commission, this is not 'burden sharing'; it is a blatant form of 'burden dumping'."
"You, the Commission, have allowed this debate to happen and you must stop it, right here, right now."
"(HU) Madam President, Mr Barroso, Commissioner, Minister of State Győri, the Schengen system is one of the most tangible acquis of the European Union."
"If European citizens were asked, they would mention free movement without border controls as something important for them in the European Union."
"That is why it is important to preserve this system and to do everything to preserve the free movement of our citizens and a Europe without borders."
"This must remain our primary goal."
"The values, our acquis have to be protected especially when they are challenged."
"This challenge today is the surge of migration and refugees."
"However, in order to address these challenges we need concrete proposals and solutions."
"This begins with separation and clarification of the issue, which means that we separate the refugee issue from illegal immigration, we use our existing principles that we can build on, such as solidarity and cooperation, and we use our existing institutions such as FRONTEX, or our existing rules."
"I welcome the Hungarian position and the position of Minister of State Győri, and also the words of Mr Barroso, who said that the aim is to reinforce the Schengen acquis and operate it well, not to depart from it."
"(LT) Madam President, first of all I would like to stress that the solution to the migration problems that have come about should remain within the scope of the Schengen Agreement."
"The Schengen acquis currently provides for possibilities to temporarily restore the protection of internal borders when there is a threat to public order and security and these provisions really are wholly sufficient."
"Therefore, perhaps the Commission might elaborate on the additional cases provided for in its Communication on migration, enabling border protection to be extended temporarily, which the Communication describes in very abstract terms, and whose subject area is too poorly defined?"
"Does this mean that the European Commission is pandering to the leaders of the two largest European Union Member States and aims to destroy one of the greatest EU values - the area of freedom and free movement?"
"I would also like to comment on the Communication's content, because it seems as if the Communication was written purely with this case in mind, where there are increased migration flows from the countries of North Africa."
"Doesn't the Commission feel that a document called a Communication on migration should be much broader in terms of its content and substance?"
"(DE) Madam President, the borders have been removed for the first time in Germany and Austria and we finally have free movement for workers from the countries of Eastern Europe."
"On the one hand, borders are being torn down, while on the other you are trying to build barriers yet again."
"I find it impossible to accept that two Member States and two gentlemen looking to make a name for themselves have managed to bring the issue of the reintroduction of border controls back to the debating chamber."
"There is no going back on this matter and we cannot allow ourselves to be put under pressure by this single-issue discussion."
"The refugee problem cannot be automatically resolved by returning to a regime of border controls."
"Pardon me."
"These people have risked their lives in making their way to Europe and they will also succeed in bypassing border crossings."
"The only ones who stand to gain from the reintroduction of border controls would be the human traffickers because the refugees would have to find new ways to cross the borders, providing the human traffickers with a new source of income."
"I cannot accept the fact that we are seriously contemplating this matter and I would call on the Commission not to compromise here."
"(DE) Madam President, I am pleased that all sides of the House, including the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), which includes Mr Sarkozy and Mr Berlusconi, have made it clear that new rules are not required and that it is not necessary to alter the Schengen Agreement, but that something else is needed, namely a common asylum and migration policy that is worthy of the name."
"Furthermore, Mrs Malmström, I am calling on you to take action and to make it clear that the Dublin II Agreement must be changed in order to facilitate genuine European solidarity in relation to asylum issues and to show that this continent is a cohesive entity and that countries with external borders cannot be left to fend for themselves."
"However, caution is advised."
"Italy itself can certainly assume responsibility for this and must do so."
"An interior minister like Mr Maroni, who himself belongs to Lega Nord party, must make it clear that these people are refugees whose rights must be respected and that the correct course of action must be taken here."
"We in Europe need to protect not just money and banks, but also refugees, which is why we do not need a new Schengen regulation, but rather a policy on asylum and migration that truly respects human dignity."
"Madam President, in the past couple of months, the Commission has moved rather fast in publishing two important communications aimed at addressing the challenges at hand since the outbreak of the Jasmine Revolution in Tunisia."
"A number of policy options have been put forward and Parliament has already expressed itself on them in order to guide the Commission in drafting concrete legislative proposals."
"In the communication on migration, the Commission addresses the issues of external border controls, Schengen governance and organised mobility."
"Why is there nothing more explicit here on burden-sharing?"
"The communication mentions the pilot project for the resettlement of refugees in Malta, but it does not introduce the notion of a pilot project concerning relocation of unauthorised migrants or asylum seekers - and this despite the repeated calls for such a burden-sharing system from various Member States and Members of Parliament."
"Why is the Commission not coming up with a concrete proposal on this?"
"We are talking about a European area of freedom of movement; we are talking about a common European asylum system."
"When are you going to back up the notion of European solidarity with deeds?"
"(DA) Madam President, I would like to address the proposal that the Commission has tabled concerning the strengthening of external border control."
"Unfortunately, it is not very satisfactory because, at a time when we are witnessing several Member States pursuing a rash immigration policy that grants large numbers of foreigners lawful residence in the EU, and when the lack of border control allows people to move freely across borders, there is a need for stronger border control between the EU's Member States on a permanent basis."
"With regard to the constant talk of solidarity, I would also like to express my surprise at the fact that Member States like Denmark, for example, that have been good at tightening up their immigration policy, are supposed to show a large degree of solidarity with countries that have not managed to do the same."
"It would make sense to allow countries expressing their national sovereignty by determining their own immigration policy to also reap the fruits of their labours."
"(DE) Madam President, apparently only about 3 000 of the Tunisian refugees apprehended in Lampedusa are genuine asylum-seekers, while 20 000 or more are economic migrants."
"As long as the European Union refuses to admit that it cannot accommodate all economic migrants from every conceivable quarter, hundreds of thousands more will make their way here."
"If steps are taken such as mass amnesties for illegal immigrants or if the Schengen Agreement is violated through the use of tourist visas, as was recently the case, then this will inevitably result in many thousands more refugees."
"This puts the entire Schengen system at risk."
"Greece, Italy and Malta are obviously not in a position to secure their external borders and newcomers to the Schengen Group often relax their efforts after accession."
"The EU's external borders are riddled with more holes than a Swiss cheese and are also being undermined internally."
"Temporary controls are not enough."
"The EU must develop Frontex into a genuine border protection agency."
"If none of these measures produce results, then inevitably one or other country will come up with the idea of withdrawing from the Schengen Agreement."
"(BG) Madam President, today we need to answer the question about how to preserve and strike a balance between our basic values: freedom, solidarity, justice and, on the other hand, security."
"The point was mentioned on numerous occasions that external borders are a joint responsibility for all Member States."
"Let us refrain from creating unnecessary obstacles between us."
"Let us also prevent the current situation from going down in the history books as a bad example of European integration."
"I naturally welcome the greater role given to Frontex and the additional human and material resources for the agency, along with the reinforcement of the Schengen evaluation mechanism, but not the new requirements imposed on Bulgaria and Romania and the obstruction of their membership."
"Mrs Győri, after Bulgaria and Romania met all the technical criteria for membership, which was assessed by the Council's experts, please tell us what the Council's position is on the timeframe for admitting Bulgaria and Romania, and whether such a discussion is going on in the Council."
"If new rules apply, they must be valid for everyone and not be used to achieve political objectives, but to build on the current system for protecting our borders."
"From a foreign policy perspective, I think that our good neighbourhood policy must be linked to the relevant governments fulfilling readmission commitments to their citizens."
"(DE) Madam President, open borders are an important symbol for Europe."
"I would like to draw your attention to another problem."
"I come from Northern Germany, which is why the German-Danish border is of particular importance for me."
"The right-wing populist Danish People's Party is trying to force the Danish Government to reintroduce border controls."
"What is the reason for this?"
"It is a fear of people from Romania and Bulgaria."
"This is scandalous."
"The right-wing populists are rapidly growing in numbers and represent a real danger for Europe."
"Of course we must have protections against untrammelled criminality and our security authorities have already found effective alternatives to passport controls."
"It makes me very sad that one of our major European achievements is to be put at risk."
"The EU success in promoting peace and freedom is without historical parallel but is now under high-level attack."
"I would call on the Danish Government not to allow itself to be dictated to by the right-wing populists."
"Madam President, freedom of movement is a cornerstone of European integration."
"Let us not open a Pandora's Box by revising Schengen."
"Let us not go back on our principles."
"The possibility of introducing border controls already exists."
"It should be temporary, exceptional and a last resort."
"What is needed is a common approach, a long-term vision as called for by the Commission, to respond to citizens' concerns on security."
"We need to move forward to a common asylum policy by 2012, to have a common migration policy and to facilitate legal immigration for work while combating irregular immigration."
"Short-term procedures that hinder resettlement have to be removed."
"Yes, we have to express solidarity with the Member States that are most exposed to an influx of people, but first of all our solidarity should be with the people who are fleeing tragedy."
"The dignity of immigrants, of people fleeing the country, has to be put back at the centre of the European debate."
"(FR) Madam President, I wonder if the demagogues of Rome and Paris and their cohorts here in the European Parliament realise what their request to reinstate internal border controls actually implies."
"More than one million European citizens work in countries other than their own."
"One hundred and fifty thousand people cross the border every day into Luxembourg."
"Do you want to subject them to border checks?"
"Tens of millions of Europeans will travel this summer."
"Do Mr Berlusconi and Mr Sarkozy want to subject them to border checks?"
"President Barroso said it himself: every year there are over 1.25 billion movements of persons within the Schengen area."
"Do you want to subject them to border checks?"
"Commissioner Malmström, leave Schengen as it is."
"Re-read the Treaties, re-read Articles 67 and 78."
"Everything is there."
"There is no need to devise something new; let us stick with Schengen and the free movement of citizens, otherwise we will have a citizens' revolt on our hands."
"(DE) Madam President, Mr Schulz has left us, but I am pleased that he and Mrs Rodust have made it clear that it was not Social Democrat policy that border controls should be reintroduced."
"However, two years ago, during the election campaign for the European Parliament, the key demand of the Danish Social Democrats was that the borders should be closed again."
"I am not talking about the right-wing populists."
"Mr Jørgensen and party leader Mrs Thorning-Schmidt both argued for this."
"You are absolutely right, this is populism."
"An important question for the Commission is therefore as follows: Can a country reintroduce border controls and still remain in the Schengen Union with access to the information system, etc., or is this an either-or situation?"
"The question is important for the Danish debate, which is why I ask that a clear answer be given."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I note that, in order to save Schengen, many would like to offer as a solution the expulsion from Europe of Mr Berlusconi and Mr Sarkozy."
"More simply, I think it would be enough to strengthen Frontex, which means tightening security along the EU external borders."
"I would like to remind everyone that right now many governments shun their duty of solidarity by not taking part in Frontex."
"Besides that, I feel compelled to make another crucial point: behind the humanitarian emergency and the immigration problem lurks a political problem."
"Indeed, while Europe has a strong humanitarian presence on immigration, I agree with Mrs Malmström that it is absent, at a political level, with regard to the tragedy behind it."
"More Mrs Malmström and less Baroness Ashton is what we need, and we will see that somehow we can improve the difficult conditions in which we find ourselves and will be able to ensure that the future is given a chance."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, this has been a very interesting and good debate on a very important subject."
"There was talk earlier about a ping-pong game going on."
"That ping-pong game is probably between the European Parliament and two Member States, so please do not use the Commission as a ball."
"We are trying to have a coordinated, responsible and coherent response to everything relating to migration and borders because it all goes together."
"We cannot have a visa policy if we do not have border control."
"We cannot have credible protection of people who ask for asylum if we do not have a common asylum policy in the European Union."
"We cannot have legal migration that works if we do not also work with integration and we cannot fight irregular migration if we do not have a proper and decent return and readmission policy."
"So, in order to have all this together, we need a clear framework and we need a European framework."
"The Commission has therefore presented this communication."
"With all respect to the hard-working people in the Commission, I will reveal a secret to you."
"We cannot produce a communication like this in two days."
"It is not possible."
"It has been planned for a long time."
"This is not a response to one or two Presidents or Prime Ministers - this is something that we have been planning for a long time, and it is all there."
"Those with whom we have been working together on a daily basis will know that since day one I have been working with them and the Council to achieve a joint common European asylum system."
"It is hard work, it is difficult and we are working very slowly, but we are making some progress."
"We are working together on legal migration, we are trying to reinforce Frontex, and I have been promising you a paper on integration since my hearing last February and, already last year, we proposed better governance of Schengen."
"This is not a response to one or two Prime Ministers calling for something."
"It is something well thought out and it is something that will lead to further legislation and proposals in the light of the European Council meeting in June, which will have as a theme - also planned for a long time - migration issues."
"Of course, the situation in Northern Africa and in the Mediterranean accelerates the need for us in Europe to have our house in order."
"Is that a reason to reinstall internal border control?"
"No, of course not."
"Is there a reason for European action?"
"Yes, there is."
"We have about 25 000 Tunisians coming to Europe."
"We have discussed this on many occasions here in the plenary."
"Of course, every individual comes for a reason, namely that he - because it is very often a he - has no work in Tunisia."
"I feel very strongly about every individual's fate here, but not all of them can come to Europe."
"It is much better - and that is why we are working with the Tunisian authorities and Italy in order to see how we can support Italy to create jobs and growth - for these people to find a future in Tunisia, because they are not refugees."
"However, there are refugees coming, and increasingly more so now."
"This week a lot of people have come from Libya - third country nationals, even Libyans - and that might increase."
"These people are clearly a reason for European action and solidarity."
"The Commission has invited all Member States to a conference on 12 May in order to discuss relocation and a prolongation of the Malta project in order to assist Malta with the thousands of people who have been going there."
"But we will also have the UNHCR there, so we will try to ask Member States to take increased responsibility for the refugees running away from the increasing violence in Libya who are stranded in Tunisia and at the border."
"Turning to Schengen, I agree with you - or most of you - who have said that Schengen is a fantastic achievement."
"The fact that we can travel from Finland to Malta, from Portugal to Estonia, without ever showing a passport is a wonderful symbol of European integration."
"I want to protect this and further promote it."
"I am happy that I can count on your support in this."
"However, the system is not perfect."
"We knew long before all this started that there were some weaknesses in the systems."
"Evaluation has not worked, because Member States are evaluating each other and that is not a good thing."
"We need a European mechanism with the involvement of the European Parliament."
"I presented this in November last year and I remember that I got quite a lot of support from this plenary to do this."
"We need to have tools to help the Member States perform better in protecting EU external borders."
"We need to strengthen monitoring and we need more - not less - Europe."
"So, in order to assess this situation and to decide on the necessary means, we really need a European approach."
"The events of last week have confirmed this."
"The shortcomings should never automatically lead to the reintroduction of border control."
"There has to be an assessment of the shortcomings in all other ways possible, such as providing financial and operational support."
"Member States can also help each other."
"We are also working together with you on strengthening Frontex."
"The point of departure is strengthening current legislation."
"I am convinced that the current rules can cater for most situations."
"Where there are differences in interpretation, the Commission should consult with Member States in order to clarify the rules."
"This can be done by issuing guidelines or recommendations."
"There are particular circumstances where there might be a need to reintroduce border controls."
"That is already provided for today and it has been the case in a few situations - for example a major event such as a terrorist threat."
"There could be a major event where Member States, under very clear circumstances, need to do this."
"But we need to strengthen the European dimension of this and to prevent Member States from unilaterally taking action."
"That is what we are talking about."
"We live in turbulent times."
"Many of the things that are happening are a reason for joy - in Egypt and Tunisia - but there are also a lot of concerns."
"We need to be calm in this situation."
"We need to try to handle it in the short term, but also in the long term."
"We need to strengthen our rules, not to undermine them."
"We need to strengthen the rules based on European law, on our values and on international commitments."
"We need a European leadership to stand up against simplistic solutions - and I have heard some of them here today - and populism."
"We need more Europe, not less."
"(Applause)"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - Madam President, I would also like to thank you very much for this debate and the contributions I had from the honourable Members of this House."
"First let me start with our clarification concerning the asylum package, as I received very concrete questions on that."
"As to the specific proposals on the table, the Council welcomes the start of the trilogues between the Parliament and the Council concerning the Qualification Directive."
"As to the Dublin Regulation and the Eurodac Regulation, important progress has been made at technical level."
"Two main issues, however, remain outstanding which are inextricably linked to the political discussions."
"The first is the suspension of transfers under the Dublin Regulation and the second is access for law enforcement under the Eurodac Regulation."
"Many delegations in Council are of the opinion that suspending Dublin transfers to Member States that are subject to practical pressures would create a poor precedent and would undermine the Dublin Regulation."
"A large number of delegations have also expressed a strong wish to give law enforcement agencies access to the Eurodac database."
"Given these views in Council and considering our shared commitment to establishing a common European asylum system, a constructive debate is needed between all the institutions involved: the Council, Parliament and the Commission."
"Finally, the Council awaits with interest the revised proposals of the Commission concerning the procedural directives and the Reception Conditions Directive, which are expected, if I am not mistaken, in early June."
"So, Ms Weber, since you suggested, with reference to the work of the Council, that we are questioning and undermining codecision and are trying to isolate Parliament, I hope that my clarification was enough for you."
"Of course we are very pleased to share all the information with you and we are very committed to making progress on these dossiers, which are, I think, of vital importance for all of us."
"Let me continue in my mother tongue for some horizontal general concluding remarks."
"(HU) As emphasised in my introduction, the great debate in the Council is yet to come."
"The proposal of the Commission was published six days ago."
"We convened a special meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Council for 12 May, where we will be able to have an orientation debate."
"We hope that this work and the working group debate can make the situation easier for the heads of states and heads of governments, and they will be able to take the most important political decisions in the European Council in June."
"So at this moment I can share with you the opinion of the Hungarian Presidency."
"And let me reiterate, not for the first time in this House, that our basic philosophy is a strong Europe; a strong Europe that places people at the centre of its thinking."
"This is our basic principle; it determines every policy we make and each step we take."
"It is on this basis that I can tell you what our starting point will be in this politically highly sensitive issue."
"We will not be partners with anyone attempting to dismantle the Schengen system and free movement."
"The overwhelming majority of the comments made in this House have argued for the preservation of this common acquis."
"Let me quote the honourable Italian Member Mr Iacolino, who called it 'patrimonia della civilta europea,' 'our common European heritage', or Mrs Kinga Gál, who said that free movement is the most tangible result of the unity of the EU."
"The Hungarian Presidency will withstand every effort to the contrary."
"But this does not mean, and here I agree with Commissioner Malmström, that the system should not be perfected."
"For months, for years we have been aware that the system should be adjusted to the challenges of 2011, and this can indeed be done."
"Nobody wants the system that we have established together, with many years of work, to fall into pieces."
"So, as regards restoring internal borders, we think that it can be done only in an exceptional situation, in case of an extraordinary challenge, for a defined period and by the decision of the Community."
"I have said this in my introduction, Mrs Malmström and Mr Barroso have said this as well."
"I repeat once again that this is our starting point."
"What are the issues in which we can still be partners, and which are the ones in which we cannot be partners?"
"We would like to distinguish refugees who are genuine asylum seekers under international law."
"We must help them so that we can be loyal to ourselves and to our common values."
"At the same time we also have to combat illegal migration."
"I do not need to mention that the protection of the common borders, our external borders, is a common issue."
"FRONTEX has to be strengthened, and the means necessary for this must be provided."
"This is what we are working on with your cooperation, hoping that we can make a decision as soon as possible."
"The issue of Schengen does not only mean what the Commission communication now contains; the expansion of the Schengen zone is on the agenda."
"The Hungarian Presidency clearly separates these two issues."
"Nobody should want to ignore the two countries which have put enormous work, energy and money into preparing properly and meeting the rigorous requirements that accession to the Schengen zone involves, and destroy it by saying that the atmosphere is not right at the moment."
"We already acknowledged in February during the Hungarian Presidency that as far as the technical standards were concerned, Romania was ready, while Bulgaria still had some homework to do."
"I am happy to announce that Sch-eval, the Schengen Evaluation Group has now found that Bulgaria has done that work."
"I hope that we can state in the Council before the Hungarian Presidency comes to an end that technical preparation has been completed."
"The two countries fulfil the technical criteria of Schengen."
"The political decision will have to be made when the Member States are ready for it."
"We have had ongoing consultations with all parties concerned, and are trying to find a solution that is acceptable for all stakeholders, Romania, Bulgaria, and the Member States concerned about the Schengen mechanism."
"And finally, a comment: I think it was Mr Weber of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) who said that we had to be very careful about the policy we implement concerning migrants, European problems and labour supply."
"I deeply agree with that."
"We should not forget that we have our own unemployed, but we should equally remember that we are an aging society in Europe and we will have labour supply problems as well."
"That is why the Hungarian Presidency has been committed to put demographic issues on the agenda, to help each other see which Member States have been very successful in the field of demographic policy, in the field of family policy."
"We would like to improve the situation of families in the European Union."
"We would like more children to be born in Europe, because every Member State promotes this with their own means, and this is the solution for the problem of an aging society, and it would be good if we did not have to solve it through migration."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Together with the euro, free movement of persons in the EU is one of the fundamental pillars of the European project."
"There is no reason whatsoever why we should now question this."
"The reaction to the thousands of refugees who are literally being washed ashore in the south of Europe cannot possibly be considered a valid reason for us to start closing our internal borders, even temporarily."
"The only sensible way to react to this is to do something, in the short term, about a common European asylum and migration policy."
"We cannot and should not sit back and allow the arrival of 30 000 refugees on the shores of Italy or Greece to undermine the pillars of the EU."
"Obviously, Italy is right to have requested European solidarity in tackling this problem."
"Solidarity is the solution."
"Shutting our borders, even temporarily, is a panic reaction, unbefitting of EU leaders."
", in writing. - The Commission's response to any perceived challenge to the EU is to reach for more centralised powers."
"In the same way the financial crisis played perfectly into their hands and they leapt at the chance to justify economic governance rather than admit the euro's failure, concerns about the sudden influx of migrants and the stresses it puts on countries is being used to call for the reinforcement of Schengen with increased centralised governance."
"MEPs are elected by the people, as the voice of the people."
"They represent the countries they are from."
"Yet when they reflect national interests here, it's labelled 'Populist'."
"Mr Barroso said it's becoming fashionable to be Populist and wave the flag of xenophobia."
"Does he believe the very essence of being a country - having a domestic government, an independent economy and national borders - is inherently wrong?"
"Why not have the guts to just scrap Parliament and take over Europe by force?"
"Name calling, scaremongering and creeping bureaucracy is calculated and megalomaniac."
"But don't think we are unaware."
"If we were, the so called 'fashion' for populism would not be developing."
"People are waking up to your intentions and the time will come that you are exposed."
"The migration problem that we are facing in Italy and throughout Europe absolutely cannot be reduced to just the humanitarian emergency, even though that is the most urgent situation to deal with."
"We MEPs - who are known to be responsible for expressing the political will of our citizens, and for implementing and assessing the long-term sustainability of their requests - must have an overall vision, and we must know how to defend it against the other institutions."
"In the case of immigration policy, the overall vision starts with the analysis of a European population which is aging, although this is happening rather unevenly among the States of the Union."
"A serious imbalance is being created between birth rates and death rates and our growth is also linked to the distribution of the workforce to ensure that the market has the necessary resources to continuously produce everything that is needed."
"This is why Parliament should advocate a holistic management of the immigration problem to the other institutions, including the governments of Member States, with people at the centre of a recovery strategy - by which I do not mean solely an economic recovery - which needs plumbers, engineers and builders, as well as banking."
"Italy's decision to issue temporary residence permits to thousands of Tunisian immigrants arriving on its soil, followed by France's request to temporarily restore border controls, has brought the Schengen area, one of the most tangible aspects of European integration, into question."
"The proposals outlined in the Commission Communication of 4 May, including, in particular, a planned extension of the 'exceptional circumstances' under which internal border controls may be restored, leave me somewhat perplexed."
"Surely we are not going to allow the will of two Heads of State to jeopardise one of Europe's greatest achievements."
"Immigration is a challenge requiring a Europe-wide response, and therefore I call for a common migration policy."
"It is time to tackle this issue head-on."
"I hope that the atmosphere of the European Summit in June, at which this topic will be addressed, will not be contaminated by populist sentiments."
"I would like to voice my disappointment over the fact that the Commission is narrowing down the entire issue of migration to the problems in the Mediterranean and the Schengen area."
"The situation is critical."
"An ambitious strategy has long been expected from the Commission."
"Not an anti-European plan for restoring national boundaries."
"Commissioner Malmström correctly emphasises the fact that the free movement of people across European borders is an enormous success and we must not lose it."
"From this perspective, the Commission proposal for managed immigration flows seems incomprehensible."
"Particularly the part allowing the introduction of border controls in the EU, even if they are only emergency ones and on a temporary basis."
"The fact that a state cannot decide on such a measure, but only the Union, is a plus."
"Despite this, I consider the clause to be backward and needlessly submissive to the populist pressure of the French and Italian premiers."
"We are not talking about something insignificant, but about one of the fundamental principles of the EU; freedom of movement."
"I am not convinced that we should sacrifice this to the current problems with controlling migration pressures from Africa."
"In my opinion, the role of the Union should be to plan the sharing out of migration pressures from the Mediterranean between the Member States, and to manage the integration of immigrants effectively."
"The Commission is recommending the adoption of many documents relating to migration in May and June."
"I would like to express the hope that, in formulating these documents, the Commission will maintain a measure of detachment and a cool head."
"The current political crisis in North Africa and the resulting migration confirm the need for a strong European approach to immigration and asylum."
"Immigration is a European challenge that requires not only a rapid and effective solution but also a shared long-term strategy."
"Perhaps we are forgetting that according to the latest United Nations estimates, 12 360 migrants have left Libya and arrived in Italy and Malta since last March, but already 700 000 people have fled Libya and Tunisia with the aim of crossing the Mediterranean."
"Without a joint plan for immigrant reception and border control we risk uncontrollable, chaotic immigration with serious consequences for the whole of Europe."
"In this regard, it is important to strengthen Frontex, establish greater solidarity among the Member States, set up agreements for increased border control and also to repatriate illegal immigrants."
"Finally, as regards any changes in the Schengen system, such a decision should be taken at a European level and not left in the hands of any single country."
"We should not allow the states most exposed to migratory pressure to run the risk of finding themselves even more isolated."
", in writing. - (HU) One of the most important challenges for Europe today is how to react to the revolutions developed on its southern borders."
"The democratisation of this region is an essential interest for the EU; the EU must find a solution for the flow of refugees coming from this region which complies with humanitarian principles and human rights."
"Solidarity is necessary between Member States, but especially with the refugees coming to Europe."
"We Hungarians can really understand the importance of this, since hundreds of thousands of our compatriots were taken in by many countries of the world after the 1956 uprising."
"The answer to the pressure of migration is not the reintroduction of internal border control, but the acceleration of the ongoing negotiations for the purpose of adopting the refugee package, the common European migration policy and the Schengen evaluation system as soon as possible."
"Reintroduction of border controls, albeit temporarily, would undermine one of the symbolic acquis of the EU, hindering the free movement of citizens."
"This is an acquis which European citizens much appreciate, and which is also a guarantee for the implementation and success of the common economic area."
"We must find solutions to the emerging problems together, we should not give grounds to populist and individual voices merely offering pseudo-solutions."
"During our debates on strengthening and improving management of the Schengen area, we must at the same time consider the European Union's new migration policy, not only in the context of the situation in North Africa, but also with regard to possible events in the countries neighbouring us to the east."
"It is hard to predict what might happen in the post-Soviet states in future."
"We must also bear in mind the challenges facing Europe."
"The EU is an ageing society, and therefore the influx of migrants should not be regarded only as a threat to European labour markets."
"Migrants often contribute to the economic growth of their country of destination."
"This was the case after the new Member States were accepted into the EU."
"Germany, which feared an influx of migrants, applied transitional periods and is only now opening up its borders to workers from Poland."
"The UK decided to open up its labour market straight away, and is now enjoying the benefits of having employed around two million young, efficient and energetic Poles."
"It is also frequently said that we should accept political migrants, but close Europe's doors to economic migrants."
"In my opinion, this division does not make much sense, since it is often difficult to distinguish between these two types of migration."
"How should we classify the middle-class protests in the Arab countries?"
"The underlying causes are both political and economic."
"Let us not therefore fall prey to imagined fears, but let us think about the opportunities for our development."
", in writing. - The aggressive positions taken by the French and Italian political leaders with regard to the Ventimiglia incident have nothing to do with the Schengen agreement, but are rather an exercise to impress their own citizens."
"The 20 000 or so migrants were, in the main, economic migrants seeking jobs and better economic opportunities."
"Rather than suffer a brain-drain as its best and brightest people seek economic migration, what Tunisia requires is EU financial assistance for economic development programmes promoting work for the young and the unemployed."
"However, this should not distract us from dealing with the real problem of how best to cope with the migration of genuine asylum seekers from North Africa, who are or will be fleeing from war-torn countries."
"For this we do not need the return of national border controls."
"The principles of the EU include freedom of movement and solidarity between Member States, and we should not take retrograde steps in that regard."
"We have provision in the treaties for establishing a single EU asylum system and proper burden-sharing between Member States."
"Instead of stoking up right-wing populism, we should be working as Europeans to put the necessary legislation in place."
"The arrival of streams of immigrants to Lampedusa in recent days shows that the immigration crisis is an ongoing issue that requires immediate action."
"We clearly need improved governance within the Schengen area, as established by the Commission Communication of 4 May."
"To this end, the solidarity mechanims must be strengthened in terms of redistribution of asylum seekers, organised mobility and new partnerships with third countries."
"Revising the mechanisms for applying the Schengen acquis must not be seen as an excuse to limit at will the right to free movement, but rather as a stimulus for new opportunities."
"I hope that concrete proposals will be made very soon to combat prejudice and discrimination, to combat lawlessness and to promote human rights, human dignity and peace."
"Governing immigration effectively and encouraging peaceful coexistence must be the daily commitment of a good policy that aims to promote development and security."
"Returning the massive flows of people to their countries of origin does not help maintain the distance between Europeans and immigrants."
"If anything, it risks increasing illegality, insecurity and economic costs."
"The mass migration of people from North Africa was foreseeable some months ago, and France and Italy should have reacted immediately, together with the Commission."
"Their statements and actions today, with the police of one state refusing to accept the documents of another state, are provoking more than just astonishment."
"The demands for the protection of interests on internal borders on account of 25 000 refugees are unprecedented and populistic, and are against everything Schengen stands for."
"On 22 December 2007, I helped to chop down the border gate on the Slovak-Hungarian border."
"Compared to people's enthusiasm at that time, today's strengthening of internal borders looks like a complete negation of the Schengen ideal."
"Freedom, the free movement of people and goods, and solidarity with everyone who is in need of solidarity, must remain priorities of the EU."
"I am opposed to internal borders, and I therefore expect a strengthening of the Schengen control mechanisms, so as to prevent the populist tendencies of some states, to prevent radicalisation and intolerance, and to consolidate the Schengen system, which is one of the greatest achievements of today's Europe."
"The events that are devastating the island of Lampedusa, as the result of the popular revolutions in North Africa, have created a humanitarian crisis, with more than 20 000 Tunisian immigrants arriving between January and April."
"The Italian Government has not been successfully responding to the innumerable requests for asylum and the sudden arrival of thousands of illegal immigrants."
"The Schengen Agreement, concluded in 1985, and incorporated in the Treaty on European Union, is regarded as one of the greatest expressions of European integration."
"Therefore, it is important not to forget its basic principles, which, if corrupted, will compromise the effectiveness of the Schengen area."
"It is becoming imperative to properly apply the Schengen agreements through the spirit of solidarity, reciprocal information and coordination."
"The humanitarian crisis we are experiencing today must be resolved, but through the legal means established by the Schengen rules."
"The differentiation between people who are entitled to international protection, such as refugees, and economic migrants is extremely important, in order to protect those who really need to be protected."
"On the other hand, unilateral violation of the agreement must be prevented at all costs, since this threatens the construction of a European area without borders, which started in 1985."
"The proposals which the Commission announced on Wednesday to tighten the asylum and migration policy contain one piece of poppycock and some good initiatives."
"The reference to border checks on our internal borders is evidence more of political expediency than of leadership and insight."
"But, all right, this concession to France and Italy is fortunately merely symbolic."
"I am also pleased that, in its proposals, the Commission has shown that it, too, is aware that it does not have to look for solid solutions to a more efficient asylum and migration policy under church towers, and that this requires another, more European, form of cooperation."
"There are enormous differences between Member States in terms of how they deal with asylum applications and the outcome of these procedures."
"A single European asylum system is therefore necessary, so that asylum seekers can see that Europe can provide help where it is necessary, but that it does not give free tickets to adventurers."
"We need to link this to the development of meaningful partnerships between Europe and its neighbouring countries, so that we can support growth and development."
"I hope that the Commission will no longer allow itself to be used as a plaything by some politicians who want to score points at home."
"What we need are solid European solutions to a European problem."
"These proposals are a good starting point, but I need a few more things on top of that."
"With the severe impact from the economic and financial crisis and from the repercussions of the Arab Spring with its far-reaching implications in terms of the requirements for controlling the flows of emigrants and access to oil resources, the EU is looking increasingly divided and likely to abandon one of its most valuable achievements - free movement in the Schengen area."
"Limiting European citizens' freedom of movement by introducing some new restrictions, albeit temporary, and imposing on Romania and Bulgaria additional criteria to those in the Schengen Agreement will result in undermining European unity."
"I believe in a powerful Europe that shows solidarity and I am one of the supporters of the vision promoted by the EU Hungarian Presidency, expressed by the slogan 'Strong Europe'."
"However, looking at the recent developments concerning the future of the Schengen area, I must say that we are on the wrong track."
"During critical moments, like those we are going through, the EU leadership should demonstrate greater vision and solidarity and be concerned about blocking the resurgence of crass populism and internal protectionism in Europe."
"These problems will have dramatic consequences, which are easy to predict."
"It is certainly not restrictions and bans that will help strengthen the Schengen area and establish stability in it."
"in writing. - (SK) It also emerged from the debate in the plenary of the European Parliament that the freedom of movement made possible by the Schengen Agreement is one of the key pillars of European cooperation, and we must do everything to preserve it."
"At the same time, however, we see that Europe was not ready for the growing number of immigrants from Tunisia and Libya."
"The fact that Italy has given these immigrants travel documents allows them free movement within the Schengen area."
"It has thus also forced other states, particularly France and Germany, to begin searching intensively for a solution."
"Schengen allows states to introduce random border controls over travellers in exceptional circumstances, and Denmark, for example, has already made use of this option."
"In my opinion, a single European migration and asylum policy is not the solution, as this matter is within the competence of Member States."
"At this moment, the boundary states of the Schengen area should accept their responsibility for protecting the common boundary, and take measures for the rapid return of economic migrants to their country of origin."
"Interinstitutional agreement on a common Transparency Register - Amendment of the Rules following the establishment of a common Transparency Register"
"The next item is the joint debate on"
"the report by Carlo Casini, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on conclusion of an interinstitutional agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission on a common Transparency Register, and"
"the report by Carlo Casini, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the amendment of Parliament's Rules of Procedure following the establishment by the European Parliament and the Commission of a joint transparency register."
"rapporteur. - (IT) Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I will make a single statement covering both matters, which are on the same subject."
"With this debate and the vote which will follow, we will conclude a task and a period of negotiations in the working group chaired by Mrs Wallis and composed of fellow Members from all political groups, as well as a Commission delegation led by Mr Šefčovič, which has resulted in the drafting of an agreement for the establishment of a common Transparency Register."
"The Committee on Constitutional Affairs (AFCO) has prepared this report in a few months and has also finalised a report on the amendment of Parliament's Rules of Procedure."
"Personally, I was very surprised at the amount of public attention that this transparency agreement has garnered."
"I fear that people think the results will have a greater effect than was actually pursued."
"Transparency is the defence of right political action, but it is not the right instrument for getting to the heart of corruption."
"The recent cases of journalists trying to corrupt a few MEPs could also happen outside parliamentary premises."
"Furthermore, would-be corruptors know how to avoid being identified and the registers are not, therefore, a silver bullet."
"The right tool for the job is criminal law."
"Yet if the criminal law of the Member States is not sufficient, we will need to reread Articles 82 to 86 of the Treaty of Lisbon, reflect on whether we can consider the corruption of MEPs to be cross-border crime or an act otherwise detrimental to the Union's financial interests and determine whether or not to create a European Public Prosecutor, which would, moreover, be a significant step along the path to unity."
"The Transparency Register has a more modest task."
"In some countries the term lobbyist has a negative meaning, while in others lobbying is seen as an almost an act of public service because it informs decision-makers on issues they might not otherwise know about."
"This is especially important for the European Parliament, because often the issues faced by MEPs are very complex and technical and we almost always need to find a balance between businesses and countries with divergent interests."
"This is where lobbyists become very useful."
"So we shall no longer call them lobbyists but stakeholders."
"Of course, interests can be conflicting, and rightly so."
"I used to be a judge and I can say that cross-examination of opposing sides is considered a condition for uncovering the truth and obtaining justice."
"So, having lobbyists or stakeholders with conflicting interests is a good thing: what is important is that the judge - and therefore also the MEP - maintains his freedom of thought, independence, and his honest search for the common good."
"Hence, we have established the Transparency Register, in mutual agreement between Parliament and the Commission with the hope that the Council will soon join the agreement."
"Those who wish to represent their interests are free to have access to our premises but they must be listed in the Register, where all information needed to identify their legal and financial status will be recorded."
"The Register is public."
"There are also organisations that do not pursue selfish interests but try to collaborate in European policies in the name of general values, such as churches, political parties and regions."
"They do not need to be added to this Register: but, if they have separate offices exclusively tasked with maintaining contact with European institutions, they must be included in their Register, though subject to a different legal regime to stakeholders."
"As already stated, the new Register also contains an amendment to the Rules of Procedure."
"There are therefore two reports, but in any case this is just a first step towards more complete transparency."
"Some hypotheses are already being researched and could be turned into rules after further reflection hence point 9 of the document adopting the agreement indicates the possibility for the reports to carry the details of the stakeholders who met with MEPs during the preparation of the report in question."
"This broad provision for possible amendments leads me to express a negative opinion on amendments which would put limits on such future deliberations."
"I hope, however, that Council will join this agreement in short order and that there is also immediate and broad consensus in this House, a strong signal of the duty of transparency and also a call to action."
"I hope that the vote is nearly unanimous."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (HU) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, transparency is a particularly important principle of democratic institutions."
"This is especially true for the European institutions, because - as it is commonly known - they are often accused of exclusion and of non-transparent operation."
"The Council is committed to making efforts to ensure the highest level of transparency between the institutions and bodies of the European Union."
"The Council is also aware that citizens expect those who they have put in charge of the management of their affairs to observe the highest possible standards; therefore the Council welcomes the initiative of the European Parliament and Council to establish a transparency register."
"I especially welcome the reports by Mr Carlo Casini."
"If the House accepts them, it will be possible to create the transparency register in the coming months, based on the reports."
"By this we can show once again that the EU is committed to transparency not only in words, but also in deeds."
"I take this opportunity to emphasise that I am aware that the Council has been invited to participate in the transparency register."
"The Council has so far had no intention to fully participate in the process because unlike Parliament and the Commission, the Council by its nature is not affected by the activity of interest representatives."
"Generally they do not contact the Council as an institution, but target their activity at the Member States."
"Nevertheless, I have already explained that the Council is prepared to participate in the register and to follow its activity."
"We are also ready to discuss aspects of the possible role of the Council with Parliament and the Commission, of course without delaying the entry into force of the agreement between these two institutions."
"Ladies and gentlemen, based on the Council's recent decision, we are now considering the possibility of making a political declaration for launching the register in June."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, transparency is an issue of interest and concern for citizens and is essential to increase the democratic legitimacy of the European Union."
"I am very happy to inform you that already today we have more than 3800 registrants in the Commission register."
"Therefore, I am absolutely convinced that the adoption of a common transparency register will represent a major further step forward in enhancing transparency in the EU decision-making process and providing a direct response to citizens' concerns."
"I would like to praise the very constructive work which we have developed in our joint working group."
"Here, I would like to pay tribute to Ms Wallis, our President for today, Mr Casini, our rapporteur, and also to Mr Leinen and Ms Durant."
"It was an excellent group and it was a real pleasure to work with together."
"The result of our work is a very balanced and pragmatic draft of an interinstitutional agreement, which we are presenting to the House for consideration and debate today."
"A positive vote tomorrow will allow the joint launching of the register by our two institutions to take place in June."
"This will undoubtedly send a strong political signal confirming our determination to enforce transparent and ethical practices on the European stage."
"The register aims to give citizens more transparency as regards organisations and self-employed individuals engaged in EU policy-making or trying to influence the EU decision-making process."
"I understand that there have been some concerns about regional public bodies, so I had better clarify."
"The question was whether they should register."
"I think that if we read the text carefully it is quite true that it would not reflect their true identity and not reflect the fact that they ensure direct representation of their citizens as established by their own constitutional systems."
"A careful reading of the content of the agreement should give full reassurances in this regard."
"Indeed, the text explicitly mentions that local, regional and municipal authorities are not expected to register."
"This approach is even reinforced by Annex I, which indicates that public authorities themselves are not expected to register."
"Services forming an integral part of the administration staffed by local, regional and municipal officials and engaged in activities corresponding to institutional or constitutional attributions will also not be expected to register."
"I hope this will help to clarify the concerns which I have registered over the last days."
"A final word on the interinstitutional dimension."
"I think we all share the view that the achievement of common cooperation with the Commission and Parliament would be further consolidated with the involvement of the Council."
"Therefore, I am very obliged to, and wholeheartedly thank, the Hungarian Presidency for changing the attitude in the Council and for getting the Council into a positive mood and positive mindset in looking for ways in which we can best arrange the relationship between the Council, Commission and Parliament in managing the register, because the political signal that three institutions are taking this issue so seriously, and that three institutions are going to tackle the issue of transparency together, will be a powerful one."
"I am sure that, with such political support from all three institutions, the threshold of 4000 registrants will very soon be reached."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, transparency is a cornerstone of democracy, ensuring that people know who exerts influence and how decisions are made."
"Since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Parliament has significantly more power."
"That is why it is right that our modus operandi should always be open to debate and that we should question ourselves."
"The negotiations between the European Parliament and the Commission in relation to the transparency register are a success and we have now produced an excellent result."
"I would like to underline once again that it is good that we have found clear regulations for the local and regional authorities, and even for churches, that reflect their interests."
"I would also like to say that we do not regard lobbyism as something bad per se."
"We need expert opinions and we need to be able to call on experts for our work."
"In the end it is important that we, as parliamentarians, should be able to consider issues freely and make decisions independently."
"I would now like to state that we parliamentarians have a lot to be proud of."
"If we conduct a national comparison, we will see that there are only a few Member States of the European Union who have already established a transparency register at this level."
"In my country's capital, Berlin, where I also happen to live, there is no such transparency register, which is why we should all be aware that this is a truly significant step forward."
"To the Council I would say: if this issue is not a problem for the Council because lobbyists have very little influence there, then it should be easier for it to sign up to the transparency register."
"Accordingly, the Council may be able to conquer its internal resistance."
"Finally, Madam President, I would point out that if we in Parliament want to escape the influence of lobbyists to a greater extent in future, then we will need greater supports and more staff, enabling us to achieve more for the citizens of the European Union."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur and all those involved in this process because tomorrow, after the vote, a long period of hard work will finally come to a conclusion."
"This is a good day for Europe, for the European Parliament as an institution, and for the Commission because we have succeeded in getting a common transparency register off the ground."
"This an important step along the way, but more work needs to be done."
"I would like to address two points."
"The first is that the register is not really mandatory."
"This needs to be stated openly at this point."
"I have a question for the Commissioner in this regard: the Commission has always claimed that the appropriate legal framework for this does not exist."
"Is the Commission ready to establish such a legal framework, so that we will have a mandatory register after the revision?"
"I was very pleased by the statement from the Council indicating that it does not foresee any difficulty in joining our register, as Mr Weber has just pointed out."
"I am hopeful that the Council will follow through on this, because the register will really only be complete if all three institutions of the European Union have a common register and if this register is also mandatory."
"As a group, we favour the amendment brought forward by another group requiring that the money spent on lobbying should also be listed in the transparency register; we intend supporting this amendment."
"As far as the various national lobby groups are concerned, it has been clearly stated that these will not be included in the register."
"I would like to thank all my fellow Members for their willingness to compromise on this matter."
"It really would have been a black mark for such an agreement if national lobby groups were treated in the same way as industry lobbyists or other professional associations."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, recent scandals have certainly exposed the power that lobbyists can have upon Parliament, so the Liberal Group strongly welcomes the streamlining of the lobbyists' register, which creates effectively a straightforward mandatory system which ought to bring greater transparency and improved consultative processes."
"I commend especially paragraph 9 of the report, which invites the Bureau to set up a system of legislative footprints whereby rapporteurs can record those that have lobbied in the course of progressing a draft law."
"This is a sensitive question, but I think that it would be a further step forward in improving the popular legitimacy of Parliament and the quality of our law-making."
"The system can only be complete once the Council - which is the second chamber of our legislature - joins in, but I welcome the tentative steps forward which are being made and I thank the Presidency for its statement this afternoon."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(DE) Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Duff for bringing up the issue of the legislative footprint."
"Do you believe that a legislative footprint, the extent of which still has to be defined, might also restrict the work of the European Parliament?"
"Also: how far-reaching do you expect the impact of the legislative footprint to be?"
"Madam President, I think this would be an experiment."
"Like all experiments, if it were to be successful, the practice would spread."
"However, I think that it ought to be limited to rapporteurs who are responsible for drafting a law on behalf of Parliament."
"They should publish the names of people with whom they have had official meetings in the course of their work."
"I think it would encourage intelligent and informed lobbying in Parliament."
"We all know that we rely on the specialism and expertise of professionals outside this House to produce top class drafting."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Madam President, may I start by thanking Mr Casini for his work in delivering this interinstitutional agreement."
"Members of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the Commission have worked well to develop a meaningful and practical report which will deliver more transparency in the legislative process."
"Madam President, it is good that you are in the chair today; I thank you for your work in the negotiations between Parliament and the Commission."
"This report is proportional in its approach; it is useful and I believe it will do good."
"It recognises the important role that regional and local governments play in shaping European legislation, and therefore clearly differentiates between lobbyists and local and regional government officials."
"Although the report is a step in the right direction, there is still more that needs to be done."
"I hope that this register - if it proves to be a success - will develop into a mandatory register of lobbyists."
"I agree with Mr Duff's proposal that rapporteurs should name the lobbyists that they have had contact with when drafting a law."
"There is no doubt that we in this Chamber are regarded with a fair amount of suspicion by our constituents."
"The more transparency and the more openness there is the better."
"With that in mind, could I just say that the one problem with this agreement is that it is one institution short."
"It is disappointing that the Council has not signed up."
"As co-legislator, the Member States should come together and sign up to the register so that we can deliver a truly transparent legislative process."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, politics is built on trust."
"The Members of this House have been elected in a free and secret ballot by the citizens of our Member States, who rightly expect us to respect their interests, in other words the common good, in all of our speeches and decisions, rather than pursuing our own interests or the interests of third parties, whether businesses or other interest groups."
"However, we are also aware that in Brussels, for example, we are surrounded by more than 10 000 professional lobbyists, who do exactly what their job description suggests, namely attempting to exert influence on Members of Parliament and the Commission."
"You cannot stop this because it is perfectly normal - we live in a free and open society - however we need to make our voice heard within this structure and maintain our independence."
"We have not always succeeded in this and there have been Members who have broken these rules, which is one of the main reasons why we want to improve our rules."
"Transparency is one of the most important preconditions for trust and this is precisely what we are working on at present."
"After extremely protracted negotiations, we have succeeded in agreeing on this transparency register with the Commission."
"Admittedly, I would have preferred it if the Council had also been on board."
"The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance have long campaigned for this."
"We are pleased that this has been achieved and also quite proud of the result, however I must say that we are not happy with all aspects."
"We would have preferred the register to be mandatory, not just for those who work within the Commission and Parliament buildings, but also for those who ply their trade elsewhere, for example over a glass of wine in one of Brussels' many bars."
"We want the register not just to apply to Parliament and the Commission, but also to the Council."
"We want the financial details made available to be more precise and meaningful."
"We believe that the sums of money involved should be measured in the same way, rather than the situation proposed now in which smaller operations are measured in increments of EUR 50 000, while larger ones are measured in larger increments, making it difficult to know exactly how much money is involved."
"We also favour regular checks by a common secretariat."
"Nonetheless, this is a good day for Europe because it brings us more transparency."
"I would like to thank all those involved for what has been achieved."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DA) Madam President, this report is a step in the direction of greater openness and a mandatory lobbyist register for anyone who attempts to influence the EU."
"However, there is still a long way to go before we achieve our objective."
"Moreover, as corrupt MEPs have revealed, we also need to put our own house in order."
"We must make it clear that it is not acceptable for MEPs to have any form of paid job on the side that might put a question mark against our integrity."
"Furthermore, we must have effective means of control and rules to determine the consequences of breaking the rules."
"We must also establish clear rules for the protection of whistle-blowers, so as to prevent the messenger from being shot."
"We look forward to the report from the special committee and, in this regard, we anticipate a speedy revision of the agreement that we are debating here today and of Parliament's Rules of Procedure."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8) of the Rules of Procedure)"
"(DE) Madam President, Mr Søndergaard, I wanted to ask what you think of the approach of the legislative footprint and what it means from your point of view that the transparency register will continue to be non-compulsory, in other words that enormous loopholes will continue to exist."
"(DA) Thank you for your question."
"It gives me the opportunity to emphasise the point that I have already made, namely that there is still a long way to go before we achieve our objective."
"We do not believe that we have already achieved it."
"We believe that there is still something lacking."
"It is clear that the question of the mandatory nature of the register is absolutely crucial."
"We believe that the idea of a digital footprint in legislative texts is a good one and that this is something that we should apply, but of course we also believe that it has to be mandatory in order for it to work."
"However, as I said, this is a step in the right direction, and we hope that, when we receive the report from the special committee and this text is to be revised - because it has to be revised within two years - we will have the opportunity to fully achieve our objective, as we must fully achieve our objective in this area."
"Madam President, so we are to have a transparency register!"
"Unsurprisingly, this has only come about because enterprising British journalists were able to demonstrate the ease with which some MEPs succumbed to the lure of money."
"At that point, the European Parliament, not unlike the police chief in the film Casablanca, professed itself to be shocked - shocked! - to discover that corrupt lobbying had been taking place under its very nose."
"This register bears all the hallmarks of the stable door being shut long after the horse has gone."
"The register will change little; the lobbyists will always get through."
"A voluntary system of registration was introduced; it was quite ineffectual."
"Now some light will shine on what is going on, but most of this will be thrust back into the murky depths of the stagnant pond; it will be business as usual."
"As usual, the law-abiding will bear the brunt of the red tape, and wrongdoers will just find a way of carrying on."
"While taxpayers' money sloshes around Brussels in the quantities that it does, there will always be unscrupulous lobbyists, just as where there is carrion, there are always vultures."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(DE) Mr President, Mr Agnew, while I am all in favour of a well-managed exchange during debates, I am less pleased when matters are presented in a false way."
"For that reason, I would ask you to please correct your last statement."
"You have just claimed that Parliament is simply debating the question of a transparency register because a number of British newspapers recently brought a particular story to public attention."
"I would therefore ask you to explain to Parliament and to the public at large that we began discussing this issue some time ago and that this transparency register had already been agreed upon before the story you are referring to even happened."
"Mr President, this appears to be the catalyst which started the whole thing off."
"I do not want any British MEPs to be here anyway."
"I do not see why we should have to put up with foreign institutions like this running our affairs."
"The further we go to the south and east, the worse the culture of corruption becomes."
"I do not like it, and I do not want my country to have any part in it."
"(DE) Mr President, we are all aware that not just the European Parliament, but also the European Union as a whole is suffering from a huge credibility problem."
"I am sure this is something Mr Häfner will not want to hear, however, although Parliament has finally reached agreement on this transparency register, no doubt bowing to pressure because of the recent lobbying scandal, in my opinion, this register will lack teeth."
"I believe that a voluntary register is simply a sham and will not offer greater transparency or bring us to a point where the Council of Ministers will be prepared to get involved, so we do not even have all the key legislative bodies on board. Even if the Council were to come on board, a whole host of loopholes would still exist."
"Apparently there are hundreds of expert groups who work on the official papers published by the Commission, however the identity of the members of these advisory bodies that meet behind closed doors remains a closely-guarded secret."
"In my opinion, we need a record not only of all work undertaken for business or for international concerns, but also all paid lobbying for interest groups such as professional organisations and trade unions."
"Our citizens have a right to expect genuine transparency here, too."
"(EL) Mr President, congratulations to Mr Casini on his report, which is absolutely right."
"Of course, the question of transparency touches on the dignity of parliamentarians, of that there can be no doubt."
"However, the more such measures we take, the better we promote transparency and functional relations between the institutions of the Union and our social partners and interest groups."
"The new register, as proposed, safeguards transparency across the broad spectrum of institutional contacts and concentrates representatives of special interests, representatives of civil society and representatives of the public authorities in separate chapters, thereby distinguishing between the different roles of interest groups and official institutional spokesmen."
"The invitation to register safeguards the very identity of interest groups and lobbyists, by recognising them independently and positioning them so that they can speak directly and immediately with the EU institutions."
"Following the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon, the powers of the European Parliament have been enhanced and this is attracting increasing numbers of representatives asking for intervention."
"To close, the Transparency Register mainly serves transparency and democratic, pluralistic interaction between the social partners, the citizens who gave parliamentarians a mandate and the EU institutions."
"It goes without saying that all EU institutions and senior officers must have a place in any such Transparency Register."
"(ES) Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Casini for the reports on this transparency register."
"We are living through a crisis on an extraordinary scale, which has been with us for a long time and threatens to stay even longer."
"A crisis like this worsens the public's living conditions and lowers their expectations for the future."
"When economic crises prevent us from legitimising politics with the positive results we offer the public, we must contribute to this legitimisation with our scrupulous respect for the political values that we advocate: austerity, honesty, closeness to the public, and transparency."
"This register is a step toward transparency, but just a step."
"I am with my fellow Members who have stressed the need for this register to be obligatory, for it to incorporate the Council, and for it to include harsher penalties when irregular behaviour is detected."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it will be an important step in the right direction when we vote on the transparency register tomorrow, but no doubt this will not be the last word on the matter."
"Firstly, I am pleased that we have chosen a new name for the lobby register of the European Parliament, which dates back to 1996 and which is now to be known as the transparency register."
"I find it regrettable to see who will be required to register in order to obtain a one-year building pass - the list includes public institutions and bodies."
"As I have stated before, I can understand why it is necessary for a law society to register, but I find it harder to understand why public bodies which have never been active on a party-political level, and never will be, are also required to register."
"In the final analysis, irrespective of all the transparency achieved, it all comes down to the moral compass of each Member of this House, as this dictates what he thinks is right, whom he meets and whom he decides not to meet, whom he listens to and whom he decides not to listen to."
"After all, people also contact us using many other different communication channels."
"(DE) Mr President, obeying your moral compass can be a tricky business."
"I think it is all a matter of the independence of the Members of this House."
"Of course lobbying becomes a problem if someone tries to change your convictions, using whatever arguments they can, particularly if these arguments are dishonest."
"The fact is that even now the lobby register only covers 2 800 of the 20 000 lobbyists in Brussels."
"The fact is also that here in this House we have far too few opportunities to develop sufficiently qualified expertise; this could be changed quickly by redirecting funding and this is something I would very much support."
"This transparency register may be just a small victory, however it can be seen as a move in the same direction as Washington D.C., where the Lobbying Act on Disclosure has existed for some time."
"This works better than anything we have here."
"For my part, I believe that we should not only introduce the concept of a legislative footprint as soon as possible, but also a legislative fingerprint, in other words we should go public on all lobbyists with whom we come in contact and what our business is with them."
"I would invite you to take a look at my website, where I have set up a lobby ticker that registers every lobbyist contact, irrespective of whether or not I am currently working on a legislative initiative."
"(GA) Mr President, this report is important as it goes to the heart of the work we are doing in Parliament: preparing and implementing rules and laws."
"As Mr Cassini said, the term 'lobbyist' is somewhat unfortunate because it creates the impression of privilege or corruption or both, whereas in reality these are experts in their field who help to inform us of the intricacies and the nuances of the various pieces of legislation that we are proposing."
"I myself am at this point involved in an opinion on data protection and the number of groups that have come to me with their views amazes me."
"I would like, if I were compelled to have a register, to record those who came to me as well, because in that way, we could have true transparency."
"A register of lobbyists officially, but also a record of those who lobbied us."
"That would create true transparency, greater credibility and ultimately greater trust."
"Mr President, it has often been said that our citizens are unaware of the greater powers that this Parliament has had since Lisbon."
"This may be true, and it is very unfortunate, because, rest assured, lobbyists - or those pretending to be lobbyists, as proven recently - are very much aware of the powers of this Parliament."
"We co-decide on almost all major legislation in the EU, and that is a good thing, because we represent the people of the EU."
"We are the only body directly elected by them."
"Now, although this is, and will remain, one of the most transparent institutions in the Union, I still believe that with greater power comes greater responsibility, and this is precisely what we must strive to achieve in the months to come."
"The agreement today with the Commission is not bad, but lobbyists must be obliged to put their names and their real interests in a register."
"And this is what this Parliament is already demanding of lobbyists coming here to us."
"I hope that the other institutions will follow suit."
"I close by saying the following."
"As you mentioned, I am a co-chair of this working group that we have in place."
"I cannot say much about what we are discussing in detail."
"I can assure you, however, that we will ensure that the rules of conduct for this Parliament will be some of the most transparent and will be rules which can make our citizens and ourselves proud of being members of this extraordinary institution."
"- (SK) Mr President, I would like to start by applauding the fact that the submitted agreement will improve the situation in the area of EU transparency, but to be honest, it is still far from ideal."
"However, it is good that lobbyists now have a greater incentive to join the register, as otherwise they will not get into the European Parliament."
"There is also improved access to information concerning lobbyists, including their names, and we should also applaud the fact that lobbyists who fail to comply with the rules will face various penalties, for example they may be excluded from the register, which will mean they are blacklisted."
"The question is whether these measures are enough."
"For example, I cannot agree that registration is de facto mandatory when only registered lobbyists have access to Parliament."
"In the interests of greater transparency it is essential for registration in fact to be de jure mandatory, and I hope we will achieve this in the current parliamentary term."
"We also need to improve the rules on the submission of reports by firms of lobbyists regarding their outlays on lobbying activities."
"The current setup allows lobbyists to report far less than they have really spent."
"It is equally important to have transparency over the financial sources from which lobbyists and consultancy firms draw their revenue."
"I would like to end by adding that I would very much appreciate it if Members would not confuse the topic of the 'transparency register' with that of the 'code of conduct', as it is a completely different issue."
"Members who have fallen victim in some way - even if through their own fault - to fictional lobbying agencies, should not be motivated in such a way when establishing the rules of the 'transparency register'."
"(SV) Mr President, a great deal has already been said, but it is worth repeating."
"It is good that we have now finally agreed on a lobbyists register."
"Many of us have been fighting for this for a long time."
"However, it is still a very cautious proposal."
"I nevertheless choose to see it as a first step that can be developed into a broad principle of public access in all of the EU's institutions."
"The comments from the Council and from Commissioner Šefčovič today are very positive."
"The principle of disclosure and transparency is one of the few truly effective instruments for minimising the risks of infringements and fraud."
"It is also an important way of increasing confidence in those of us operating in this political system and in politics in general."
"The next steps should be for all institutions to be included, for the register to be made mandatory and, like the approach taken in some Scandinavian countries, for this to be supplemented by a form of informant protection for whistleblowers, who are also extremely important for openness and transparency. Thank you."
"- (SK) Mr President, I welcome and fully support the establishment of a transparency register and a list of lobbyists intended both for organisations and for the independent lobbyists who participate in the creation and implementation of EU policy, because a tightening up of standards aimed at securing the stability and integrity of EU public administration and strengthening institutional regulations is a guarantee of the democratic functioning of the EU."
"On the other hand, the register must not, of course, prevent Members from fulfilling their duties arising from their mandate and meeting their constituents or representatives of public bodies on behalf of Member States at the European Parliament."
"There must, however, be clear rules applying to representatives of special interest groups, in order to ensure open, transparent and proper dialogue with those who seek to participate in some way in the creation of EU law and to influence that process."
"Mr President, I speak as the rapporteur on the public Access to Documents Regulation No 1049/2001 and, in the spirit of the openness and transparency enshrined within that regulation, I welcome this agreement."
"It is another step in the right direction because openness and transparency are at the heart of the democratic decision-making process and we should be made aware of all of those who influence and sometimes have an undue influence on policy, procedures and outcomes."
"However, we need to do more work, we need to ensure that the transparency and integrity of the work of lobbyists at the EU level is of the highest."
"Furthermore, we need to make the new register operational as quickly as possible and, as soon as the register is operational, all persons and organisations falling into its scope should provide correct, up-to-date information so we can see who is influencing what."
"Finally, let me quote Jana Mittermaier of Transparency International: 'The new register will be a test of the commitment of all parties involved in lobbying to greater openness.'"
"You could not say it more succinctly."
"(ES) Mr President, I should like to say that the 21st century is the century of the Web, the century of WikiLeaks and the century of institutional openness."
"That means transparency and public participation, and we must be partly responsible for constructing our decisions."
"We must decide together."
"Our work must therefore be proactive in nature."
"We cannot simply wait for lobbies and interest groups to pressure us: we must make the effort to get close to the public; to listen to them."
"I therefore believe that the transparency register and fingerprinting algorithms will be effective, and, far from limiting and causing fear, they are an opportunity to improve our reports and gauge our results."
"I believe that this is the only way we can move toward becoming a modern parliament."
"I have been in charge of one report and in the explanatory statement I listed all the agents with whom I worked, because it is a way of working and an attitude that we should clearly separate from all the irresponsible acts we have seen in the past."
"(FR) Mr President, I too would like to express my satisfaction at this text, which I will be pleased to vote for tomorrow."
"I would simply like to point out that the recent scandals we have witnessed are attempts at bribery, and nothing else."
"While this is a serious matter, these are recent developments."
"We began our work long before these recent, serious developments, which are covered in another piece of work."
"They are isolated cases, and a good job too."
"Nevertheless, we can see that a number of groups are employing considerable resources and are doing all they can to influence decision making as much as possible."
"This register is therefore a step in the right direction."
"I contributed to its development and I am also extremely satisfied with the work that has been done."
"However, further steps must be taken."
"This register must become a dynamic instrument and one which is assessed on an annual basis."
"It should be anything but rigid."
"In fact, I think that developments in technology and in the means employed by lobbyists will force us to continually review the instrument in order to ensure its effectiveness and to identify, through a directive, who is performing lobbying activities, for how much money and in what way."
"I am also entirely in favour of ecological footprints - I mean legislative footprints - which publishing the number of lobbyists and the names of the people they met in the reports could provide, and I am in favour of being able to find out exactly who said what and who influenced whom."
"Finally, publishing the register is one thing, explaining how it works is quite another."
"Citizens also need to be given the means to consult these registers so that they can make meaningful use of the information when trying to understand how we make decisions."
"That is why our group will vote unreservedly in favour of this text."
"(DE) Mr President, lobbying is a central instrument for the involvement of citizens in political life, which is why it is important to prevent its misuse."
"That is why there is an urgent need for a transparency register for all institutions, not just Parliament and the Commission, but also for the Council, after all that is where the real decisions are made."
"To restate the point, registration must be mandatory, not just for access to Parliament, after all lobbyists certainly do not just seek out their contacts in the Parliament building itself, but also, more often than not in restaurants, at cocktail receptions or in the gym."
"I would also like to say a word about transparency in relation to the political parties."
"Even if these are one-man parties and act as a one-man operation, seeking to portray themselves as whiter than white, these parties and persons must demonstrate the requisite level of transparency."
"They must ensure transparency in relation to their assets, their claims on the public purse and the reimbursement of campaign costs, in other words in relation to the actual moneys they have received from public bodies in their own countries during their election campaigns."
"These costs should be documented in a transparent manner."
"(PL) Mr President, thank you very much for the opportunity to take the floor."
"In common with the majority of those in this Chamber, I agree that a register will represent progress in terms of the transparency of the legislative procedure, but in my opinion this is only a first step."
"We should give serious consideration to other steps and solutions."
"As I see it, what is most important is the question of what MEPs are allowed to do."
"Are MEPs only allowed to work in a professional capacity here in Parliament, or are they also allowed to undertake other activities in addition to their work in Parliament?"
"I personally believe that these other activities should be very narrowly defined, and should be limited to scientific work and publications."
"Any other activities on various boards will always provoke questions and doubts."
"(SV) Mr President, the Treaty of Lisbon has granted increased powers to the European Parliament and with this also comes an increase in responsibility."
"Transparency in our work is therefore extremely important in view of the fact that our work involves legislation for 500 million people and often very large sums of money."
"The register for lobbyists that has now been decided on in the compromise is, of course, very worthwhile, and I hope that we can go further by providing informant protection for whistleblowers."
"I also hope that we can go further and ensure that the information in the register for financial contingent liabilities or ownership becomes mandatory rather than voluntary, as it is at the moment."
"I hope, too, that we will have a debate on what subsidiary activities are appropriate from an ethical point of view when we have a job to do as Members of the European Parliament."
"I welcome the compromise and see it as a way forward, but there are many more steps to take on this road to transparency, openness and greater democratic trust. Thank you."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, I think Mr Weber rightly said that the transparency register being jointly managed is something to be proud of because, with the exception of the United States or Canada, I do not know of any other place outside the European Union where such a lobbies' register with such parameters as we are going to establish is functioning."
"Here I am also referring to Member State capitals."
"The question that was raised by several speakers, the first being Mr Groote and then Mr Häfner, concerned the mandatory register."
"We, in the working group, are discussing this issue at great length."
"The problem is that currently we do not see the legal basis that allows us to oblige companies, citizens or interest representatives to register in order to exercise their profession."
"We, as an EU administration, cannot refuse to deal with such an entity or entities on this basis."
"Therefore we have been looking for ways in which we can turn to the positive motivation of companies, organisations and lobbies to register."
"I think we achieved a lot because, with the agreement of Parliament, we are actually turning this system into a mandatory one."
"With our joint actions, together with the Council, we will increase the reputation and pressure so much that we will see in the next two years how this is to work and it will give us additional experience to have a high-quality review and we will see how we can improve the working of the system further."
"The calls for appropriate verification as regards financing the activities of those who register: here I can assure you that the Commission is already performing random checks on all the registrants that are already in the register and I am sure that these activities will even increase once we manage the register jointly."
"All those who are in the register should be sure that if there is something inappropriate we will find it, we will criticise it, try to correct it and we will not be afraid to shame those responsible."
"I was very glad - I am coming back to this because several speakers referred to the importance it - that all three institutions are progressing in this work."
"I am sure that after this very important opening by the Hungarian Presidency, we will not waste a minute and we will try to start the interinstitutional talks with the Council as soon as possible so we can find, I am sure, a very accommodating manner in which to manage the register together, the three institutions working on this issue with the same goal of increased transparency of European Union legislation."
"The last point that was raised by several speakers and described by Mr Casini: the transparency register is definitely not a silver bullet or a magical solution to fight corruption."
"We know very well that high moral standards, ethics, dignity and clear rules are key."
"But it would certainly serve as a very good instrument and good indicator that those who register are prepared to respect the rules and be transparent, that they have nothing to hide and - this should be the key indicator for all of us - that they should be real partners to work with us and exchange information with us and that they have trust in our future communication."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (HU) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, please allow me to welcome, as a representative of a Member State which has had an act providing for lobbying since 2006, today's debate and the fact that Parliament and the Commission are able to agree in the issue of the transparency register."
"Transparency has always been a very important issue for the Council."
"I am very happy to see that while we did not manage to achieve progress in 2008 and 2009, we now made a breakthrough during the Hungarian Presidency in that the Council is prepared to monitor processes, and inasmuch as it is able, will participate in this activity - we will see to what extent, negotiations are still to follow."
"So we are ready for negotiations concerning our contribution and, as I indicated in my introductory speech, we think that we would affirm this intention in a political declaration to be issued in June."
"So this does not mean that we would accede to the interinstitutional agreement."
"The reason why Member States can accept this formula at the moment - which, I must emphasise once again, is a significant progress compared to the previous years - is that lobby organisations do not approach the Council as a European institution, there have been very sporadic examples for that."
"The targets of lobbying activities are rather the Member States, the governments of Member States, and governmental agencies."
"So the Council is not exposed to lobbying to the extent the Commission or the European Parliament is."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I hope cooperation will be efficient, and we will be able to make this political declaration after these negotiations."
"rapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to clarify a few things."
"I too would like to strongly emphasise that this agreement was concluded long before the outbreak of the episode with the British journalists."
"Unfortunately, this is one way in which false information is spread through the media."
"For example, a major Italian newspaper, the Corriere della Sera, has today poked fun at Europe by saying that we acted too late and only after these events with journalists."
"This is not true."
"It unjustly encourages distrust of Europe."
"The agreement had been reached long beforehand."
"If anything, this discussion has arisen with some delay because, once the scandal had exploded, we wondered if we could attempt to further strenthen the agreement."
"The text has, however, remained the unchanged."
"That is the first clarification."
"The second concerns the question of obligation."
"The register is already mandatory."
"Those who want to lobby must enrol themselves in the register."
"I cannot understand what 'obligatory' means: it cannot mean that all companies, all enterprises or all citizens must be entered in this register."
"That is not possible."
"If anything, it is up to individual MEPs, who, when approached by someone who wants to exert pressure on them, must invite them to register before making contact."
"The third point refers to possible future amendments."
"There is a working group for this purpose, which I think needs to have as much room for manoeuvre as possible."
"I agree that we should identify the lobbyists encountered during the course of the negotiations but I do not know if this task belongs only to the rapporteur or whether it should be extended to the President."
"We grant the working group the freedom to submit any necessary recommendations."
"Finally, I too wish to thank both Mr Šefčovič, who has made a huge contribution to the implementation of this agreement, and the representative of the Hungarian Government, for, among other things, the assurance given about the Council joining the agreement in short order, which without doubt has its own uncertainties seeing as the Council certainly represents the second chamber in this case."
"If the Council is also equipped with the register, this would therefore underline more effectively that the structure of Europe is made up of a government - the Commission - and a legislative body, consisting both of representatives of citizens and of states."
"Howver, I realise that there are still questions to be answered, since the Council of Ministers represents the states."
"I am, however, confident that we will come to a positive conclusion."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday, 11 May 2011."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
", in writing. - We always pride ourselves on being the most open among the European institutions."
"However, the recent past has demonstrated that, no matter the advantages this provides, the system has its drawbacks, too."
"We all know how European citizens have lost and keep losing their confidence in Europe and, let us be honest, in us MEPs."
"An important way of regaining this trust is being open about what we do and what influences shape our work."
"The joint transparency register that we are to adopt today by voting yes to the two reports on the table is a great first step in this direction."
"It is a 'first step' as this will not solve all our problems."
"Even if it would be difficult to do it now, in the future we shall move towards mandatory registration for lobbyists."
"I would also like to underline that such a register does not replace our individual efforts for transparency and the need for rethinking our work in this regard."
"I welcome the common transparency register of the Commission and the European Parliament, at least in this form."
"However, it should be just one of a series of essential steps towards greater transparency in the legislative process, which should apply to all three European institutions."
"The European Parliament is clearly willing to hold a serious debate on lobbying and the rules for lobbying."
"This will also set an example to those Member States that have yet to take such a step."
"I believe that the transparency register will also contribute towards the greater credibility of the political environment."
"Its actual impact, however, will depend mainly on the willingness of everyone involved to respect the more stringent rules."
", in writing. - (NL) I can only applaud the fact that the Commission and Parliament are pulling together to create a common 'transparency register' for lobbyists, think tanks and other interest organisations."
"After all, for every dossier on our agenda, we need to be able to make enquiries of various interest groups and to do so completely openly."
"There is nothing wrong, by the way, with organisations defending their own interests, as long as this takes place in an open and balanced fashion."
"The principle of 'legislative footprint', whereby rapporteurs have to state with whom they have been in contact in the process of drafting their proposals, is a good policy."
"I have actually already addressed this in my report on toy safety."
"Clear arrangements to make this principle generally applicable will enhance transparency."
"This is also a suitable instrument to bust the myths about lobbying which are circulating amongst the general public, whose common interest we, as members of the European Parliament, are promoting."
"The fact that the Council, also, eventually expressed its willingness to join this register means that we are going to have a unique register for all EU lobbyists, which is something that we, together with the European Parliament, have been working towards for years."
"I therefore support this approach."
"Nuclear safety 25 years after the Chernobyl disaster (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on nuclear safety 25 years after the Chernobyl disaster by Bogusław Sonik, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety - B7-0312/2011)."
"Mr President, I would like to say how happy I am that this sitting of the European Parliament is commemorating the victims and all those injured by the Chernobyl disaster, which was the greatest nuclear disaster in history."
"Particularly in the light of recent events in Japan, this anniversary has become a tragic reason for assessments and considerations regarding nuclear safety."
"The Chernobyl tragedy also revealed the powerlessness and thoughtlessness of the then Communist authorities in Ukraine, which tried to conceal from the world the disaster and its scale."
"Let us remind ourselves of just a few facts, which give some indication of the scale, extent and dimensions of the tragedy."
"The explosion of the reactor at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant resulted in the contamination of around 100 000 km2 of land, of which 70% was in Belarus."
"Radioactive substances also reached Scandinavia and Central Europe, including Poland, as well as Greece and Italy in Southern Europe."
"Around 115 000 people were evacuated from the areas in the vicinity of the reactor, and around 220 000 people were relocated from Belarus, the Russian Federation and Ukraine after 1986."
"It is very hard to assess the ravages wreaked by the disaster, both in terms of health and the environment."
"Specialists are still unable to determine the number of deaths caused by the disaster."
"According to the World Health Organisation, the number of those killed by cancers caused by contamination following the explosion in the nuclear power plant may be as many as 9000."
"Other sources estimate that around 200 000 people have already died from radiation-related diseases, and that a further 100 000 people may die from cancers caused by the Chernobyl disaster in future."
"According to the latest research, the residents of at least two Ukrainian districts are still eating contaminated food."
"Let us not forget that the European Union, which set up the Chernobyl Shelter Fund, has contributed most in financial terms in the fight to mitigate the effects of the Chernobyl disaster."
"On the 25th anniversary of the disaster, the European Commission announced that EUR 110 million would be allocated to stabilising the situation and protecting the environment around the Chernobyl nuclear power plant."
"In this context, we cannot forget that the question of how to approach nuclear safety is relevant across all borders around the world, and should therefore be considered in a spirit of solidarity and cross-border responsibility."
"Therefore I would both ask and call upon the European Commission to conduct long-term and comprehensive research into the health-related consequences of the Chernobyl disaster."
"Is the Commission prepared to undertake and support long-term research, over a human lifespan, into the effects of the Chernobyl disaster for the health of Europeans in all areas which suffered from nuclear fallout?"
"Does the European Commission have any data regarding environmental contamination in the areas most affected by the explosion?"
"On the anniversary of the disaster, is the Commission going to encourage governments to commit publicly to providing new funding for the fight to mitigate the effects of this nuclear disaster?"
"In view of the number of nuclear power stations on the territory of the European Union and the current level of coordination within the European Union, what possible scenarios is the Commission aware of regarding the effects of a serious nuclear accident in a power station for the populations resident in the individual Member States?"
"Does the European Commission have any plans to coordinate the national positions in the event of a nuclear disaster?"
"Nuclear disasters always come as a surprise, and always have international and global consequences."
"It is therefore better to have prepared a set of necessary responses in advance, which will make it possible to minimise the risk and avoid further disasters."
"Member of the Commission. - (DE) Mr President, honourable Members, in the 25 years since the nuclear accident in Chernobyl, the Commission has played a significant role in worldwide efforts to alleviate the consequences of the tragedy."
"The size of the task meant that a united effort was required."
"That is why the Commission cooperated with partners in the Member States, the G7 and Ukraine itself to ensure that the area can be stabilised in an orderly manner and secured in an environmentally appropriate way."
"The EU took an active approach in mobilising more resources from the international community to enable outstanding work at the Chernobyl site to be completed and we are continuing our efforts in this direction with our own contribution."
"The Commission is the biggest contributor to the Chernobyl Shelter Fund and we promised a further EUR 110 million from our budget at the donor conference held in Kiev last April, which brought together pledges of a further EUR 550 million."
"We have been busy on the diplomatic front and have also persuaded 32 countries, including 13 new donors, to commit to the fund."
"We intend continuing our activities among other donors, including the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, so as to secure the financial resources still required to complete all projects by 2015."
"We are also working with the government in Ukraine to ensure that the plan to shelter the Chernobyl reactor core can be completed."
"This involves encasing the damaged reactor block IV with new protective cladding and the necessary steps to close down the other reactor blocks."
"All work should be completed by 2015."
"Next we turn to the research projects under the aegis of the Euratom framework programme relating to the consequences of the accident and how these are to be overcome."
"At present, research into low doses of radiation is the subject of a large-scale initiative as part of a joint programme planned by the European MELODI platform."
"As part of the mechanism for cooperation in the area of nuclear safety, we are considering a project aimed at helping the most significantly affected population groups around the Chernobyl exclusion zone."
"It is our intention to deal with the links between health and nutrition in greater depth."
"If it proves useful to carry out targeted activities in evaluating the consequences for human health in all areas affected by the fallout from Chernobyl, the Commission is ready to take action and to transfer responsibility for the coordination of the appropriate measures to the EU's Health Security Committee."
"Another of the Commission's responsibilities is the combating of environmental contamination."
"After the accident, we contributed to joint research projects with the Commonwealth of Independent States in supporting the gathering of extensive data and the designing of strategies for disaster management in the nuclear sector and in the relevant areas in Belarus, Russia and Ukraine."
"We gathered data on the release of radioactive caesium throughout the EU following the accident."
"This was published in the form of an atlas in 1998, produced in cooperation with Ukraine, Russia and Belarus."
"At present, under the aegis of the 7th Euratom framework programme, we are supporting a network of excellence in radio ecology in order to finance integration, networking and scientific excellence in the interests of radiation protection for human beings and the environment."
"When it comes to civil protection, for the last nine years we have been fostering cooperation between the Member States in the area of civil protection exercises."
"These exercises also involve participants from third countries."
"Three exercises co-financed with funds from our financial instrument for civil protection had a radiological component, namely TORCH, which dealt with an accident resulting in mass fatalities and its simulation, CREMEX, which involved a mass contamination in the form of a dirty bomb, and SISMICAEX, implemented one year ago, which dealt with a nuclear accident caused by an earthquake."
"In the coming years we shall continue to provide aid in a spirit of European solidarity, doing all we can to reduce the damage and to avoid further damage from Chernobyl."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Mr Oettinger, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that it is always good to take stock of activities, which is why I am grateful to the Commission for having explained so clearly everything that Europe has done since the disaster, both immediately, in the medium to long term, and right up to the present."
"Irrespective of how we view the problem, it is worthwhile pointing out that these damage limitation measures could never have taken place on this scale without the involvement of the European Union."
"I also find it very helpful to know that the Commission did not just provide immediate direct aid, but on behalf of Europe as a whole has also dealt intensively with the question of what conclusions are to be drawn from the disaster in terms of civil protection measures, information exchange systems, as well as research and related studies."
"I am not entirely convinced that it is absolutely necessary to come up with new studies."
"It may be that we need to evaluate the material already available to us to see whether it is sufficient for our needs."
"I believe that this will become clear during the course of a differentiated debate."
"Sometimes having access to a huge amount of information is no guarantee that meaningful progress will be made."
"I would like to express my thanks and to say that the Commission and Europe as a whole can be pleased with what they have achieved in this case."
"They have demonstrated that these institutions are not just a talking shop, but also a source of practical aid."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - (DE) Mr President, Mr Oettinger, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Sonik for triggering this debate and for preparing the oral question."
"I agree that we should never forget the Chernobyl disaster."
"We are well aware that the long-term consequences of the catastrophe are still being experienced a full quarter century later."
"There is still a large uninhabitable area, so that people can no longer return to their homes."
"Then there is the long-term impact on health."
"Television has shown us that women still suffer miscarriages 25 years after the disaster."
"Europe shares some of the responsibility because the issue of nuclear safety is not a matter of national sovereignty, but rather one of European responsibility."
"On this densely populated continent, every nuclear power plant has consequences for neighbouring countries."
"It is for this reason, Mr Oettinger, that you have particular responsibility for ensuring that we get to grips with this topic, especially in the light of what has happened in Fukushima."
"Later on we are going to talk with you about the stress tests, in other words the safety analyses for the 143 nuclear power plants."
"I would encourage you to stick to your principles."
"We want the highest possible safety standard in Europe, not just investigations into natural disasters."
"Accordingly we must also investigate other risks, such as plane crashes, terrorist attacks, computer attacks, in other words this combination of attacks on nuclear power plants; what is more, you must guarantee that this does not become simply a token gesture."
"There is still a great deal to be done in Chernobyl."
"The sarcophagus is not yet safe, which is why new financial resources are required to put this in order."
"I have not yet heard any plans for what to do with the nuclear waste lying about the site; the disposal of this material is not yet assured."
"Accordingly I believe, Mr Reul, that research studies are necessary because we do not have enough experience with the long-term effects of radiation."
"I would encourage the Commission to put such studies in motion."
"In the final analysis, the safest option is the nuclear exit strategy."
"As we continue to cooperate with the affected countries, my greatest wish is that we should establish workshops for future technology there, and provide advice on how to save energy and develop alternative energy sources."
"This is precisely what is needed 25 years after Chernobyl."
"(The speaker agrees to take a question in accordance with Rule 149(8) of the Rules of Procedure.)"
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Leinen."
"He referred to stress tests."
"What I would like to know is: the stress tests must have a consequence."
"Do you think it would be possible to establish a permanent European regulator for this area who would be responsible for dealing with these issues and who would have the power to remove dangerous nuclear power stations from the grid?"
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Rübig for his question."
"The aim must be to establish a European competence for monitoring nuclear power stations."
"If an issue has an impact that goes beyond national borders, then this involves a European dimension, which also requires a European competence."
"Mr Oettinger, we do not yet have this competence, however you must do all you can to ensure that we are given the basis to monitor nuclear plants independently and objectively from a European perspective, enabling us to draw our own conclusions when weaknesses are pinpointed."
"If the stress test shows that a power plant is unsafe, then it must be shut down or, if possible, upgraded."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, while the question of pursuing our energy strategy, with or without nuclear power, is now being debated in the Member States concerned, we should keep in mind that, whichever decision is taken, nuclear safety will remain a long-standing issue for several generations."
"We should obviously develop and enforce common standards on nuclear safety at international level since radioactive contamination knows no borders, as the Chernobyl disaster revealed and as is confirmed by what is still happening in Fukushima."
"Twenty-five years after events in Chernobyl, we still need further assessment and research on past and current impacts of contamination of human health and the environment."
"We have to think about nuclear safety, not as a protection measure but as a long-term and encompassing strategy."
"We should also address the issue of nuclear waste."
"What has remained from Chernobyl is waste and this is a serious and threatening issue in the region."
"It is also becoming a European challenge for the future of nuclear energy."
"We need more research in this field and we need to guarantee the long-term safety of storage or disposal of these materials."
"Whatever decision we take now, reversibility and retrievability are therefore required."
"I would welcome a clear position from the Commission on this matter."
"Mr President, Chernobyl has been a point of reference for European policy for the 25 years since the tragic disaster."
"Sometimes this is entirely apposite, but sometimes it is devoid of any sense."
"Unlike the Soviet Union of 30 years ago, in the European Union we have very good legal instruments to enforce our safety standards."
"They are among the highest standards in the world, and so it is an abuse of history to exploit Chernobyl today for the purposes of anti-nuclear propaganda based on sheer prejudice."
"There is another aspect to the reining in of the European nuclear sector, namely that it helps maintains our dependency on imports of fossil fuels from third countries."
"There are also useful conclusions that can be drawn from Chernobyl."
"A whole series of Russian nuclear power stations, which are intended to export electricity to European Union Member States, are being planned along our eastern border."
"They are being constructed without any regard for EU safety standards."
"It would be worth the Commission taking steps to ensure that its standards are enforced not only in the EU itself, but also outside its borders, since the plants in the Kaliningrad Oblast and in Belarus are aimed at the European market."
"The only question is whether the Commission will have the power and the imagination to succeed in taking action in this field."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Mr Oettinger, it is true that the European Union has already done a lot in relation to Chernobyl and its aftermath."
"Nonetheless, the question remains whether we have done enough, whether we can ever do enough and whether we always do the right thing."
"In my opinion, there are still some major gaps that need to be filled in the area of the health issues arising from the fallout."
"The dispute relating to the continuously falsified figures from the International Atomic Energy Agency needs to be teased out."
"I believe that the European Union, whose territory is affected by roughly half of the fallout from the disaster - I use the present tense 'is' advisedly - must look to its own interests here."
"This is very important."
"The international consequences that we, as an international community, must suffer are by no means limited to the territory of the former Soviet Union, Belarus, Ukraine and Russia, because more than half of the fallout following the fire and explosion fell on the territory of the European continent."
"So, I would encourage you to examine the need for a new evaluation of the incident's impact on health."
"Many former employees of the World Health Organisation would be pleased to find their work assessed in a different light."
"My next concern is the local clear-up operation."
"The large new shelter is currently the subject of much debate."
"Why is it that we still do not have a risk analysis for Sarcophagus I?"
"Why is it that we are unable to understand the problem that exists there?"
"How can it be that a project of this magnitude is being managed without a transparent risk analysis?"
"I also wonder how it is that we still have no explanation for why it has not been possible to remove and store the spent fuel rods from Chernobyl Reactors II and III, which were shut down correctly?"
"I regard that as a huge problem."
"My third point is that we in the European Union have been on the threshold of nuclear meltdown several times since Chernobyl and long before Fukushima."
"Forsmark is a good example of this, Paks is another, as is the Brunsbüttel nuclear power plant in Germany."
"The stress tests now proposed are incapable of describing the risk that faces us in the existing European nuclear power plants."
"For this reason I would ask you, Mr Oettinger, not to try to pull the wool over our eyes."
"You promised tough safety tests."
"What has been placed on the table so far cannot be taken seriously."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, following the disaster of Chernobyl 25 years ago, new investigations by the Society for Radiation Protection show that to date 1.4 million people have died from the long-term consequences of the nuclear meltdown."
"Even in Germany we feared for the safety of our children, as they were exposed to radioactive rain clouds and contaminated foodstuffs."
"The EU must now take the right steps in responding to the Chernobyl and Fukushima disasters."
"The fears that the promised stress tests for all nuclear power plants would simply provide an excuse for the continued operation of reactors have unfortunately proven to be well-founded in the light of the stress criteria announced."
"Other nuclear facilities will not be examined."
"Any threats that could cost the nuclear industry too dearly, such as human error or plane crashes, are simply ignored, despite the fact that these are key when assessing the safety of the population."
"We are calling for extensive, binding stress tests carried out by independent experts."
"However this can only be the first step on the way to a Europe-wide nuclear exit scenario."
"Mr President, the explosion at Chernobyl was a disaster, but let us keep it in perspective: 64 people were killed by Chernobyl radiation over 23 years, and it caused an unknown proportion of 6000 cases of thyroid cancer."
"These are tragic figures but they pale into insignificance compared to the death toll on our roads."
"Yet, while no one is using road traffic accidents to campaign to ban the motor car, a small army of leftists is using Chernobyl to push for an end to nuclear power."
"I do not doubt that they mean well but the road to hell is paved with good intentions."
"The same people meant well when they helped to create the biofuels rush, pushing the price of food beyond the reach of the world's poor."
"Tonight millions of children will go to bed slowly dying of hunger because people on that side of the House meant well: that is what the fuzzy ideals of the Utopian left do in the real world."
"The impact of a nuclear ban would be even worse because the alternative to nuclear power is not wind farms and solar panels."
"In our energy-scarce, post-peak oil world, the alternative to reactors is mass starvation."
"(LT) Mr President, the causes of the Chernobyl disaster include mistakes in project design and the failure to test the reactor in extreme conditions."
"The tragedy that took place in Japan a quarter of a century later has forced us to check the safety of existing nuclear facilities through stress tests."
"I have no doubt that nuclear power plants within the European Union will pass these tests or will at least carry them out."
"However, when there are accidents in such facilities, damage to the environment and human health does not stop at the border."
"The whole of Europe learnt that lesson well 25 years ago."
"Therefore stress tests must be carried out, and not only at nuclear power plants within the European Union."
"Currently two power plants are planned close to the European Union's borders - in Belarus and the Kaliningrad region."
"Unfortunately, in these cases it seems too early to talk about any stress tests."
"There has not been a proper environmental impact assessment of these cases, not all questions have been answered and a system for rectifying environmental damage has yet to be established."
"Moreover, the Belarusian power plant is to be built on a site that experienced a seven-point earthquake, the biggest in Belarusian history."
"Therefore the entire European Union, both the Commission and the Member States should act in solidarity to ensure that nuclear power plants planned in the European Union's neighbourhood are subject to the same stress tests as European Union power plants."
"They must also ensure that the project developers provide the international mediating organisations, the IAEA and the Espoo Convention secretariat, with clear and substantiated responses as regards the choice of construction sites, environmental impact, reparations and evacuation plans."
"Only then can we be sure that we will not have to evacuate 100 000 people, this time within the territory of the European Union."
"(LT) Mr President, this discussion is very important, but long overdue, in my opinion."
"The nuclear accident in Chernobyl is still having disastrous effects on the populations of both Ukraine and neighbouring countries."
"The people of Lithuania are to this day paying for this accident with their health; its consequences will also be felt by future generations."
"Unfortunately, the accident in Fukushima has shown that, because of the material benefits, in 25 years the world has made absolutely no attempt to evaluate the nuclear threat objectively."
"For many years we were told that nuclear is the cleanest and safest form of energy, but as we can see, when there is an accident its consequences are disastrous, they will echo through the generations and the cost of these consequences is immeasurable."
"The issue of nuclear safety must be fundamentally reviewed."
"I welcome the fact that the Commission has initiated the implementation of stress tests at European Union nuclear power plants, but such checks must become systematic and continuous, not random, in order to reduce the chance of accidents as much as possible."
"From our experience of the banking crisis we have learnt that not one institution or sector can guarantee effective self-regulation or self-control."
"Commissioner, I therefore feel you will agree that it is necessary to set up a nuclear safety policy as a matter of urgency and to supervise its implementation."
"We must have a European Union position as regards third countries which intend to build nuclear power plants right next to the European Union's external borders."
"We must know what actions will be taken if the nuclear power plants fail to comply with stress test requirements and many other issues."
"(SV) Mr President, people and rescue workers in and around Chernobyl suffered very badly as a result of the disaster, but the effects also reached areas much further away."
"Today, 25 years after the Chernobyl disaster, animals kept in open pasture in certain areas of Sweden still have to be tested and given alternative feed before they are slaughtered."
"This has affected the Sami people in particular."
"After the disaster in Fukushima, many people in Europe are now concerned about nuclear power once again."
"It is therefore extremely important that the checking and assessment of the European reactors does not become a paper tiger, but that it really is a proper assessment."
"Transparency is of the utmost importance, and I am therefore very concerned to hear that the United Kingdom does not want to report the results of stress tests and that France is not interested in ambitious stress tests."
"Commissioner, as well as technology and geography, you must also ensure that the safety culture and the structure of safety policies are included in the stress test when the proposal is put forward. Thank you."
"(PL) Mr President, twenty-five years after the nuclear accident in Chernobyl, we are becoming ever more aware of the tragic consequences of disasters in nuclear power stations, for human health and even life and for the environment as a whole."
"We have also become more aware of this following recent events in Fukushima."
"We know for certain that one of the main causes of the Chernobyl accident was the flawed design of the reactor."
"This begs the question of whether the European Union is monitoring what is happening with the other reactors from the Soviet era; what steps is it taking to ensure that they are safe?"
"At present over 140 nuclear power stations are operating on the territory of the European Union, with over 190 on the European continent."
"I therefore support the decision to conduct stress tests of nuclear power stations on EU territory."
"These tests will not be mandatory, however, and there will be no consequences for those who fail to participate in them."
"What will be the outcome of these tests for nuclear power stations which do not pass them or which do not participate in them?"
"There can be no doubt that we need to set high standards for nuclear power stations in order to ensure that they can gain greater public acceptance than to date, since they are unquestionably an important source of energy for Europe."
"We should also develop other possible sources of energy, such as shale gas for example, which provides many opportunities to obtain energy without expanding the nuclear energy sector unnecessarily."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I shall begin by commending the initiative taken by my colleague and friend, Bogusław Sonik, in tabling this oral question on nuclear safety 25 years after the Chernobyl disaster."
"Chernobyl remains the worst civil nuclear disaster in history."
"It is crucial that we learn lessons from the successive disasters involving nuclear power."
"Allow me to present four to you."
"Firstly, we must guarantee maximum levels of safety and security to citizens."
"The European Union must have the highest standards in the world and must exert an influence on international authorities so that, within the framework of global governance which has begun to emerge, people throughout the planet can be certain that the strictest possible safety criteria are being applied as scientific knowledge develops."
"All commercialisation of low-cost nuclear power plants must also be stopped."
"Secondly, the public domain, and more specifically the European Union and its Member States, as well as nuclear industry operators, must adopt a behavioural ethic of total transparency in relation to nuclear activities."
"Citizens accept scientific risk to some extent, but only if it can be measured."
"Only a transparency ethic, attracting heavy penalties if breached, can dispel this concern."
"Thirdly, all safety-related costs should be included in the energy production cost, and if we have to set money aside to cover all the costs, that is, if we have to make it compulsory to set this money aside, then we must introduce legislation establishing mandatory levels of capital."
"Fourthly, we must monitor the training of nuclear engineers and speed up scientific research programmes, and on that note I would like to express my satisfaction that the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) has been extended into 2012 and 2013."
"(RO) Mr President, I am from Romania, a country which produces nuclear energy, whose population even now has fears and questions that remain unanswered about the long-term impact of the Chernobyl accident."
"I welcome this important discussion with the European Commission."
"I think that it is our duty to show our concern, particularly about the issue of measuring the impact of nuclear accidents on human health."
"A group of experts funded by the European Commission recommended an international study should be conducted, which would investigate all the effects that the Chernobyl disaster has had on human health."
"The World Health Organisation would usually be the most suitable candidate to carry out this study."
"However, there is, in actual fact, a conflict between the World Health Organisation and the International Atomic Energy Agency, with the interests of the nuclear industry seeming to take priority over human health."
"An agreement signed between these organisations well over 50 years ago implies that the Agency can prevent the WHO from having access to information regarded as confidential, even if this information may be crucially important for monitoring and understanding the effects of nuclear accidents on human health."
"In other words, an organisation concerned with promoting nuclear technology bans the WHO from accessing information about the impact of this technology on human health."
"(PL) Mr President, two weeks ago, we marked the passing of a quarter of a century since the explosion in Chernobyl, the effects of which were tragic."
"I remember very clearly the days immediately following the tragedy, when the Communist regime in my country, Poland, concealed the truth about the disaster itself, and then about its scale, and thousands of people were forced to participate in the May Day marches with no regard for their health, only five days after the explosion, when a radioactive cloud covered a large part of Europe, including the north-east region of Poland, which is the electoral district I have the honour of representing in the European Parliament."
"Appropriate safeguarding of the explosion site is still an unresolved issue."
"Work on a new shell was halted due to lack of funds, and EU aid is therefore essential in order to make it possible for the work to be completed."
"Yet let us not run away from atomic energy, which is an ideal tool for establishing energy independence in Europe."
"Further expansion in this respect is therefore unavoidable, as proven by the plans to construct further plants in Poland, Lithuania and Slovakia, and I therefore support the introduction of stress tests and safety assessments for nuclear power stations."
"The tests should be mandatory and carried out periodically."
"We should also actively support international cooperation on improving nuclear safety, and therefore similar stress tests should be carried out in nuclear power stations in Ukraine, on Russian territory and in the former Soviet states."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr Oettinger, like Fukushima, Chernobyl showed that, despite all the rules we may set down, the residual risk from human error needs to be measured and that, in this context, we must identify more clearly where the limits of nuclear energy lie, because obviously even the strictest regulations cannot eliminate this residual risk as a result of human error."
"My second point relates to the lack of available information because of the Soviet system that existed at the time."
"This socialist system lies behind the misinformation and lack of information at the time, as well as the paucity of data available to us today."
"The Soviet centralist model is largely responsible for this misinformation."
"This energy source and the associated residual risk are only acceptable - even on a temporary basis - if they are associated with the necessary degree of openness."
"Thirdly, we must recognise that many people - including some from my own constituency - are still helping to alleviate the consequences of the disaster by inviting children into their homes, as well as many other initiatives."
"The consequences of this catastrophe can still be seen in a generation that had not even been conceived at the time."
"Accordingly, we can only take this residual risk into account to a limited extent and should understand that nuclear energy can only be a stop-gap technology."
"Finally, Commissioner, I wish to encourage you in relation to the stress tests."
"We need European criteria and inspection standards that are not solely open to the arbitrary will of individual states."
"These stress tests must establish a situation whereby no data can be provided that cannot be verified subsequently."
"That is why I would urge you not to allow yourself to be manipulated by members of the Council of Ministers, but rather to set down clear, common, verifiable standards, so that these stress tests fulfil their purpose."
"(LV) Mr President, Commissioner, if someone lives on a road that is too loud, there is always the possibility of moving somewhere further away, perhaps just a couple of blocks distant."
"Unfortunately, as the Chernobyl incident 25 years ago and the Fukushima incident a few weeks ago remind us, when it comes to nuclear power plant accidents, this possibility of simply moving a few blocks further away does not exist."
"Nuclear safety is not a local issue."
"It is, in fact, a global issue."
"Next door to Europe lie Russia and Belarus, which do not currently have the same high safety standards that we have in the European Union."
"However, we in Europe have nowhere where we can move to away from our neighbours."
"We have to ensure that our safety standards apply not only to Europe but also to Europe's neighbours, and, in fact, to the whole world."
"I therefore call upon you, Commissioner, not only to carry out these stress tests in Europe (and they must be carried out, and carried out strictly), but also to work to ensure that European standards and European stress tests apply also to our neighbours and to the whole world."
"In this connection, Europe has the chance to exercise influence on our direct neighbours and link energy purchases with the nuclear safety issue. Thank you for your attention."
"(DE) Mr President,"
"(Mr Mann begins to speak without a microphone.)"
"...."
"1986 and the nuclear meltdown of an outdated nuclear power plant."
"Fearing the danger from radiation, we stayed at home as much as possible for weeks on end, only venturing outside when absolutely necessary."
"A nuclear emergency was declared on 11 March of this year in the Fukushima nuclear power plant."
"Even in a high-tech country like Japan, the promised safety levels could not be even remotely achieved."
"The responsible politicians need to distance themselves from over-hasty solutions."
"Sustainability involves compulsory stringent stress tests that examine the impact on nuclear power plants of natural disasters, as well as accidents, terrorist attacks and human error."
"My country stands accused of 'typical German angst' - quite unfairly in this case."
"We need to take the fears of our citizens seriously."
"Everything needs to be on the table, from different timetables and decommissioning scenarios to qualified moratoriums - without false time pressures, polemics or ideologies."
"The work of the German Ethics Commission should be a shining model for Europe."
"Workers in nuclear power plants need special protection."
"The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs wants to expand the legal basis for the directive on disposal to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
"This would also include those workers who deal with radioactive waste and spent fuel rods."
"Stringent criteria must apply in the areas of training and occupational safety and thorough investigations are required."
"On a final note, Mr President: we must never compromise on safety issues."
"This is true for the EU and for our neighbours, who must be persuaded of the importance of joint decision-making."
"(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, while we commemorate the victims of the Chernobyl disaster today, our thoughts are also with the victims of Fukushima, and we are also considering the safety of our citizens in Europe."
"This is the subject of our debate."
"Public fears regarding nuclear energy have recently intensified greatly in Europe, something which emerges from all the opinion polls carried out in all the EU Member States, including my own country, Poland, where support for the construction of nuclear power stations has fallen by 10-15%."
"It is therefore extremely important that the criteria of the six-point tests announced in Budapest should be met, since this will ensure that people feel safer."
"Commissioner, you must not yield to the will of the Member States which are calling for the criteria to be relaxed."
"This is currently a subject of disagreement, and we would insist most emphatically that half-measures and relaxed criteria should not be agreed to, in view of either crises or normal human error."
"This is all the more true since the results of the tests should form a basis for the drafting of guidelines for the Member States which are only just starting to develop their nuclear programme."
"We have discussed countries neighbouring Europe which have nuclear programmes."
"I think that these issues should be included in the Commission communication on the external dimension of the EU energy policy."
"We are talking about energy which is supplied to Europe, and which should be covered by EU policy, in the same way as gas or other sources of energy."
"At the same time, we must also work on the Europeanisation of energy policy."
"- (SK) Mr President, we all still remember clearly the terrible disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear plant 25 years ago."
"Hundreds of thousands of people lost their lives, and many bear the consequences of the radiation to this day in the form of disease and death through cancer."
"I am delighted that the European Parliament is addressing the question of nuclear safety today and that this is a key point, but another key point is that without nuclear energy we cannot, unfortunately, get by at all."
"This applies in Europe, in the United States and in China, but in China, the United States and India there are projects for new nuclear plants, as you will surely be aware, and I think it is an over-reaction to exclude nuclear power in Europe in the future."
"Another key point, of course, is public health and safety, and I am pleased that the planned stress tests, both in the EU and, as has been said here, also in Belarus, and in the future Ukraine and Russia, should be such as to make people in the EU safe."
"Mr President, I would like to speak about one issue only."
"Twenty-five years after Chernobyl, there is a need to rebuild the sarcophagus, but we see how difficult it is to gather the financial resources: how difficult it is to get the financial resources from those European Member States that are, at the same time, worrying very much about nuclear safety."
"We have to make sure that the long-term commitment is there for as long as the long-term risk of the nuclear facility in Chernobyl remains."
"The public commitment needs to be not merely verbal, but also financial; and human resources are necessary too, to provide the skills required for the long term - for as long as Chernobyl remains unresolved."
"We may not realise at this stage what is required in terms of Member States' financial resources, but until we understand the problem we will continue, for the most part, to pay mere lip service to tackling it."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr Oettinger, ladies and gentlemen, even 25 years down the road, Chernobyl continues to be a cause for concern."
"Fukushima will also be a source of anxiety for years to come."
"The debate surrounding these major accidents is a sign that nuclear technology has inherent risks that it may not be possible to control."
"This is leading to a rethink in energy policy."
"However, it is also evident that unilateral action by individual countries is a mistake."
"We need international strategies, or at least EU-wide strategies when it comes to safety."
"That is why I fully support the Commissioner for Energy, who has made a number of important proposals in this direction."
"I would call on everyone here to work together to produce common principles so that the existing nuclear reactors really are safe, so that power failures are not allowed to happen and so that earthquake safety and other risks can be better estimated."
"We should then take a pro-active approach in bringing these principles to the attention of the international bodies."
"(FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it has been 25 years since the Chernobyl disaster, but we do not have any comprehensive, systematic research into the catastrophe's effect on health."
"There are just separate, uncoordinated studies: for example, regarding the increased incidence of thyroid cancer in Ukraine and Belarus."
"This absence of comprehensive, followup studies is a disgrace, and I would ask the Commission to commit clearly to measures to carry out a comprehensive, international study of this kind."
"The claim has been made in this debate that Chernobyl might only have led to the deaths of a few dozen people."
"The estimates for deaths at the other end of the scale are in the millions."
"This sort of confusion is possible precisely because there is no comprehensive research."
"Research of this kind would also improve the knowledge that mankind has about the effects of radiation on health."
"- (CS) Mr President, in connection with the 25th anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster, I believe that gratitude should be expressed to two countries which the European Parliament is none too fond of."
"First Belarus, which suffered the same consequences of this disaster as did Ukraine, and which has been funding recovery from the aftermath of the disaster patiently and without any posturing."
"Much has been done, without the EU authorities paying much attention."
"Secondly, thanks are due to the government and people of the Republic of Cuba, which has taken many children whose parents died in the Chernobyl disaster for treatment in Cuba."
"They were given the best possible treatment and the best possible care at a time when the Republic of Cuba was in a very difficult economic situation."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are all well aware of the direct impact of Chernobyl."
"I have a question because, after all, our citizens expect us to learn lessons from such events."
"There is little doubt that the Commission is aware of the consequences of Chernobyl and now Fukushima for the population of Europe, whether in terms of health risks or the financial consequences."
"What steps are being taken to protect the people of Europe in the event of a new accident?"
"After all, undeniable risks exist here in Europe too - for example in connection with the Isar I power plant, which is the same type as Fukushima and which is in the flight path of Munich airport, or Krško, which is located in an area prone to earthquakes."
"Mr President, in my half-minute I would say two or three things: firstly, the victims of Chernobyl are thankfully not forgotten."
"In my own country, a great lady by the name of Adi Roche and her organisation have given tremendous support and will do so long into the future, because the effects of Chernobyl will still be felt."
"Secondly, the role of the Commission, as highlighted by the Commissioner, is praiseworthy; and, thirdly, the point made by Paul Rübig that a new regulator should oversee the stress tests and any future power plants that are built would be very sensible."
"- (SK) Mr President, the Chernobyl disaster showed us the importance of having a highly-developed information system."
"We know that the Soviet leadership concealed the effects of the damage to the nuclear reactor for a very long time, and this had grave consequences for the inhabitants of nearby countries."
"We should also be prepared for the eventuality that, just as in Chernobyl, the operator of the plant in Fukushima has made an attempt to conceal the damage and has tried to water down the information relating to these issues."
"From the perspective of providing protection in the event of a nuclear disaster, it is therefore very important to ensure that information is provided very quickly and efficiently, both to the public and to the experts, and that it is accurate."
"In Chernobyl the cause was human error, while in Fukushima it was the natural elements."
"We know how to prevent human error, we know how to train workers and we know how to provide good automatic protection, and we must strive to ensure that we provide such mechanisms in the future."
"Member of the Commission. - (DE) Mr President, honourable Members, with regard to Chernobyl, I am happy to promise that your proposals and demands in relation to the issue of research, as well as other areas, will be examined by us and incorporated in the next steps."
"Likewise, we shall do all we can to finance the necessary technical measures in full within the international community with the involvement of the European Union."
"I would like to express my general thanks for a very constructive discussion, including the question of what is to follow in the wake of Fukushima."
"Following this sitting we are scheduled to meet with the coordinators of the responsible parliamentary committees, where I will explain how things now stand."
"Firstly let me point out that the stress test is uncharted territory for us."
"You are well aware of this."
"There has never been an inspection process for nuclear power plants at European level."
"I believe that this is already a significant fact that points to the way ahead."
"My second point is that if one reads the Treaty of Lisbon, a document on which you all worked, then it is evident that the decision on the energy mix was and remains a matter for the Member States, in other words the countries where you live."
"For this reason, the decision in favour of coal, nuclear energy, gas or renewable energies is largely a matter for the Member States themselves."
"The 20% renewable energy requirement is the first time that we have had a European process that impacts on the decision in relation to the energy mix otherwise decided solely by the Member States themselves."
"We have 14 Member States that operate nuclear power plants and 13 Member States that do not."
"Poland, a very European country, is on the point of deciding on two nuclear power plants."
"In Italy, the search for suitable sites has been suspended."
"You have suggested that I should put a European regulator in place."
"If that is what you want, then give me the legal competence to do so and approve the relevant jobs."
"I will accept everything you have to offer."
"However, I am bound by law and legislation."
"As yet we do not have a European nuclear watchdog."
"There is no provision for such a body either in the Treaty of Lisbon, the Euratom Treaty or in the establishment plan for the Commission."
"You know this as well as I do."
"I think that the stress test is important."
"It has been commissioned by the European Council and is intended to set the highest standards for safety as its benchmark."
"The key meeting between the European regulators, ENSREG and the Commission is to take place on Thursday."
"As yet there are no test criteria, even though judgments have already been made - judgments that the stress tests are too soft, disappointing or inadequate."
"There have not been any stress tests yet."
"The test criteria will be drawn up on Thursday."
"What we do have is a proposal from a body of which the Commission is not a member."
"In April, the Western European Nuclear Regulators Association published its preparatory work, which it was fully entitled to do."
"It is up to us to decide what to do with this."
"Without any involvement on the part of the Commission, WENRA applied its expertise and, following a circulation procedure, came up with a resolution that human error and human causes should not be included. I do not think this is adequate."
"That is why I will present my position on behalf of the Commission tomorrow evening to all 27 nuclear watchdog bodies, based on thorough groundwork, telling them that we need to take all risks into consideration, regardless of their origin."
"This applies equally to natural causes, such as earthquakes, flooding or extreme temperatures, and human causes, such as error, accident, intent or criminality."
"As far as I am concerned this also includes terrorist threats, cyber attacks and plane crashes."
"I believe that this is in the interests of the people of Europe."
"Today's debate showed me that there is a broad interest among all parties in the European Parliament in this test and in the test criteria, which must include the human factor."
"I am grateful for this tailwind."
"By the way, it is not always easy to make a clear distinction: was Fukushima caused by nature or by human beings?"
"I would claim it was originally a natural disaster - earthquake and flooding - however, human strengths and weaknesses came into play when it came to taking control of the risk and in reducing and avoiding damage."
"Human weaknesses have continued to play a role in Japan right up to the present."
"After Thursday I will be more than happy to report back to you on what is to happen next."
"However, you must know that I need the approval of the European Commission - which I already have - and the national regulators - which I intend to obtain."
"I need to get approval for the test criteria of the stress tests from each national regulator, including our very competent and esteemed colleagues in Paris, London, Madrid and Brussels, where opinion is still inconclusive, although there is a feeling that there is little to be gained by taking matters to a European level."
"I promise you transparency in this matter."
"We must learn the lesson of complete transparency from Chernobyl."
"I promise you transparency in relation to how negotiations proceed in Brussels on Wednesday evening and Thursday and what the result is."
"I will also tell you if we fail to reach an agreement between the Commission and ENSREG, at which point we may return the mandate to the European Council."
"You will not find my signature on an abbreviated version of the stress test."
"(Applause)"
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"(GA) The effect of Chernobyl on the world and the current events in Fukushima are clear evidence of the devastation which nuclear mishaps inflict on local communities."
"Since there is a significant number of nuclear stations in Europe, and since these stations are often close to borders, a cross-border approach must be adopted to nuclear safety, coordinated at the EU level."
"Member States must share information on safety issues, potential threats and civil protection coordination with their neighbours and with nuclear facilities on a prompt and ongoing basis."
"There is a significant nuclear risk to Ireland because of the nuclear plants on the west coast of Britain;"
"Sellafield is the most famous."
"Five men were arrested under the Terrorism Act outside the Sellafield nuclear plant on 2 May, and the Irish Government has not yet stated whether the British Government shared all the security information about the incident with it."
"The Irish people must be convinced that their government is fully informed of any neighbouring threat and of what is being done to combat those security threats."
"The situation in Japan and at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant after the earthquake and tsunami of 11 March 2011 remains a cause for concern."
"This, coupled with the 25th anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, which struck Ukraine on 26 April 1986, is a reminder to European leaders of their responsibility regarding nuclear safety in Europe."
"That is why Member States must take all the measures necessary to ensure and maintain a maximum level of security in European power plants and a maximum level of protection for citizens."
"Nevertheless, it is important to keep a cool head when addressing present and future energy challenges."
"Therefore, nuclear energy, as a low CO2 emission technology, cannot be overlooked."
"The challenge lies in achieving a balance between the development of nuclear energy and the development of tools for preventing the risks associated with its production and for combating the effects of nuclear accidents."
"This year is the 25th anniversary of the nuclear disaster in the Ukrainian town of Chernobyl."
"On 26 April 1986, a sudden power surge in the reactor during a system test damaged the reactor vessel, which gave rise to a series of explosions."
"According to UN data, areas within a radius of 500 km from the power plant were contaminated."
"Around 115 000 people were evacuated from the areas in the vicinity of the reactor, and since 1986 around 220 000 people have been relocated from Belarus, the Russian Federation and Ukraine."
"Nuclear accidents occur without warning and unexpectedly."
"The accident in Chernobyl occurred 25 years ago, but as recently as March of this year there was an accident in Fukushima."
"It should be noted that the cause of the disaster was the breakdown of the cooling system due to a power outage, and interruptions to power supply are a frequent phenomenon in the Member States."
"There can be no doubt that we should draw conclusions from history, but we should not become hysterical in response to the disaster in Japan."
"This accident has given rise to serious doubts regarding the safety of nuclear energy around the world."
"Everything points to the fact that nuclear energy will become a significant source of energy in the near future, and therefore it is absolutely crucial to ensure that the highest feasible level of safety is achieved in the energy sector."
"Question Time (Commission)"
"The next item is Question Time (B7-0303/2011)."
"Colleagues, please note that we are starting 40 minutes late."
"The following questions are addressed to the Commission."
"Mr President, I know I am pushing an open door with you in raising this, but would say again that it really is not acceptable that Question Time be conducted in this way."
"There is no Parliament in the world in which Question Time is not sacrosanct."
"I would ask you again to raise this matter with the Bureau."
"Mr Mitchell, it is not the Bureau, it is a matter for the Conference of Presidents, but no doubt the Swoboda reforms will make proposals on how to deal with this."
"I agree with you."
"It is totally unsatisfactory, but I took the chair at just 19.40 so I am not really responsible for the delay."
"Subject: Provision in the new draft budget for combating youth unemployment"
"The flagship initiative 'An agenda for new skills and jobs' underlines the fact that because of the crisis employment has fallen below 69%, while the figure for unemployment has risen to 10%; assuming that the job market will stabilise in 2010-2011, attainment of an employment rate of 75% by 2020 will require an average increase in employment of slightly more than 1% per year."
"At the same time, unemployment of young people under 25 is approaching 20%, while the persisting financial crisis is leading to a reduction in the employment rate, rather than the target of an annual 1% rise."
"How, and with what provision in the draft budget will the Commission attempt to achieve by next year the objective of an average 1% increase in employment in the EU?"
"Does the Commission think that the proposed cuts in next year's budget will have a negative impact on the amounts allocated to education, training and boosting employment in the EU in general?"
"Member of the Commission. - As you all know, the EU headline targets under Europe 2020 include increasing the employment rate to 75%, lifting at least 20 million people out of poverty and social exclusion, reducing the proportion of early school-leavers to under 10%, and ensuring that at least 40% of the younger generation will have completed a tertiary degree by 2020."
"The Commission helps Member States to achieve these targets through financial support, in particular the European Social Fund, policy coordination and policy guidance at EU level under the European semester."
"The 2011 Joint Employment Report, which is based on the Commission's assessment of the Member States' draft national reform programmes, calls on them to improve the functioning of the labour market by introducing more employment-friendly tax systems and by making work pay, ensuring that wages reflect developments in productivity, introducing flexible working arrangements to facilitate the further integration of women into the labour market, ensuring that pension reforms include a more direct link between later retirement and increased pension entitlements, removing incentives for people to retire early and linking unemployment benefits with the business cycle."
"This means that safety nets should be reinforced at times when most needed as we have seen in the past couple of years, while money would be saved in good times."
"When exactly we enter good times is a country-by-country assessment."
"Hopefully, in a couple of years' time we will all get there."
"But under the current very difficult circumstances, it is also important that public employment services provide better job search assistance."
"We also need to reduce labour market segmentation."
"Indeed, evidence shows that particular groups, and notably those under temporary or precarious contracts, have taken a much bigger hit as a result of the crisis."
"This is the reason why the Commission has invited Member States to introduce open-ended contracts with a gradual increase of protection rights."
"Although small in comparison with national public budgets, the European Social Fund has been helping the Member States weather the recent economic crisis."
"In line with the Commission communication on the budget review and the conclusions of the fifth report on social cohesion, the Europe 2020 Strategy provides both a clear set of common priorities and the framework for identification of funding priorities post-2013 in line with the objectives of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, including human capital development."
"The Commission will present its proposals for the next multiannual financial framework at the end of June."
"As regards the 2012 budget, I would like to point out that the draft budget that was adopted by the Commission on 20 April is in line with the European Council conclusions of 24 and 25 March, which state that fiscal consolidation efforts must be complemented by growth-enhancing structural reforms."
"To that end, Member States will implement measures in order to invest in education and training."
"The Commission has applied a restrictive policy as regards administrative expenditure, with a nominal freeze for Commission administrative expenditure."
"However, the Commission has proposed to increase its commitment and payment appropriations, by 3.7% and 4.9% respectively, with a focus on expenditure related to the Europe 2020 strategy including the ESF, the lifelong learning programme, the Youth in Action programme, the seventh framework research programme and the competitiveness and innovation programmes."
"(EL) Thank you, Commissioner, for your reply."
"I would, of course, remind you that unemployment, especially among young people in Europe, is currently close to 20.5% and, in some instances, is now out of control."
"According to the data available to me, it is 43.5% in Spain and in Greece it is close - I repeat among young people - to 36%."
"Bearing in mind that this critical state of affairs is a one-off occurrence which we could not have forecast 2 or 3 years ago, may we expect a new intervention by the Commission in this particular situation, in addition to what you have told us?"
"Commissioner, would you consider an area-based response to youth employment problems?"
"You will find that it is people with the lowest level of education, perhaps living in local authority complexes, lacking access to education and on social welfare who have the highest levels of unemployment."
"There are models of local development which have started to address this issue on an area-specific basis."
"Would the Commission consider doing anything in partnership with Member States to try and tackle the areas with highest unemployment?"
"(EL) Mr President, as we have already heard, there is massive unemployment among young people in both Greece and Europe."
"At the same time, young people, women and immigrants are the most vulnerable groups of society when it comes to the arbitrary action being taken by employers, by which I mean action against labour rights and disregard for collective bargaining."
"I should therefore like to ask you, Commissioner, what measures you intend to take to protect young workers from precarious jobs and arbitrary action by employers."
"Mr President, honourable Members, the future common agricultural policy must rise to the challenges facing agriculture, and here I am referring to food security, the stabilisation of agricultural incomes and the production of high quality and extremely safe food products."
"At the same time, however, the common agricultural policy must meet the environmental and territorial challenges and objectives of the Europe 2020 Strategy while also supporting the competitiveness and sustainability of agricultural industries and rural areas."
"The Commission intends to propose an ambitious and comprehensive reform of the common agricultural policy which will require farmers to make a significant contribution towards achieving the objectives of the Europe 2020 Strategy."
"The cumulative impact of a 'greening' of direct payments and better targeted rural development measures will mean that the CAP offers a more robust and comprehensive response to the provision of environmental public goods."
"A strong and ambitious common agricultural policy also requires an appropriate European Union budget."
"To that end, the Commission is due to present its legislative proposals for the next multiannual financial framework at the end of June 2011."
"Following this, the Commission will present its proposals on the reform of the common agricultural policy in the second half of 2011, in order to ensure that we can coordinate the submission of legislative proposals at budget level while taking into account our ambitions for the future common agricultural policy."
"Just a brief follow-up."
"In the communication on the CAP towards 2020 it says that achieving all the objectives in the future CAP 'will require that public support to the agricultural sector and rural areas be maintained'."
"You mentioned this yourself, Commissioner."
"How do you propose to ensure that this support for the CAP is maintained in the new EU multiannual financial framework?"
"Commissioner, as you know, the delivery of public goods and security of food supply comes at a very significant cost."
"Farmers need to know that they will get a fair return for their efforts."
"They also need to be in a position to plan ahead."
"In this regard, and in terms of moving the negotiations on the CAP forward, when does the Commission expect to be in a position to reveal the detailed proposals of the next multi-financial framework and the allocation of the CAP budget?"
"I think it is imperative that we know that as quickly as possible because, as Members, we are working somewhat in the dark, not knowing what finances are going to be available to us."
"(PL) Commissioner, from what you have said it appears that very far-reaching changes will be made to the common agricultural policy."
"My question in connection with this is as follows: will these merely be qualitative changes, or are there plans for them also to include changes to the way funding is allocated to individual countries, for example?"
"Today the funds earmarked for agriculture are divided up very differently between the individual countries."
