"So to say that this is the first time we have looked at this is quite wrong."
"Mr Kreissl-Dörfler has produced an objective account and one which seeks to be fair in its allocation of blame and responsibility."
"I am sorry that some of the amendments that have been tabled run counter to that intention."
"We should not be attempting 20:20 hindsight."
"We should not be using shock logic to invent legal rules that were allegedly broken."
"When I hear Mrs Lucas speaking I am reminded of a Russian historian who once said to me that the wonderful thing about the past is that things are always changing there."
"You never know what is going to happen."
"The past is being rewritten here."
"That is not right."
"Some of the allegations in Mrs Lucas's speech were factually incorrect and should not be in this report at all."
"I prefer to look ahead."
"I would like to think that we can salute others who have not been mentioned so far in this debate, in the blame culture in which it has been shrouded."
"Firstly, the foreign vets, more than 2 000 of whom came to the UK and tried to help us solve the problems with the outbreak."
"Also the farmers, the officials, the police who struggled through those terrible days in March and April before we knew where and how we could bring this under control."
"Let us look ahead now: at inspections, movements of animals dead or alive, a fresh look at different kinds of agriculture, based on accountability, lessons learned - yes, including the lesson in objectivity which Mr Kreissl-Dörfler and the Chairwoman tried to bring to our committee and which persuaded most, though perhaps not all of us."
"Finally, I would like to thank the Commissioner."
"It is right that it should be this Commissioner with his concerns and priorities who is replying in this debate."
"Essentially, it is a matter, not just of animal health, but of human health and welfare as well."
"Mr President, as a representative for Cumbria - the area most affected by this disease in Europe - to think back 20 months is to remember the distress of farmers who, in many cases, saw their animals being slaughtered - although there was no evidence that they were infected - and, in particular, the distress of those who made their living from tourism in the Lake District."
"All too often the cries of those people whose economy depended on tourists and whose contribution to the economy was worth six times that of the farmers went totally unheeded."
"We saw the pictures on our television sets: visitors were turned away because of the mass culling; animal welfare concerns were being disregarded; the fires were making a nonsense of the policies adopted by this European Union in its attempts to address the concerns about dioxins spreading in our atmosphere."
"People were really upset by the illogicality of the situation: mountains, hills and footpaths were closed for no reason."
"At the same time, you could walk along a country road and the sheep and lambs would stick their heads out through the fences."
"People felt a sense of anger and despair."
"This must never happen again."
"I am glad that this report makes clear that the UK Government's policy was wrong, and that we should be thinking about emergency vaccination if this situation occurs again."
"I also believe that, in order to take account of the wider considerations and in view of the relatively small role which farming has in our economy these days, we also need to look at preventive vaccination as a long-term solution to difficulties of this kind."
"Mr President, Commissioner Byrne, I recall how we discussed foot and mouth disease at the Brussels conference all of a year ago, when I was still Chairman and followed what you had to say on the monitor."
"I must say that our positions have now grown closer together, whereas at that time they were still rather more divergent."
"I explained the position of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which was that a policy of culling and keeping countries free of the disease would not enable us to solve this problem."
"At that time, the Commission still took another view."
"I concede that the international organisations took yet another line on the question of when inoculation should take place."
"Now we have moved on a bit, and I call that progress."
"I believe that targeted vaccination will enable us to limit the damage, in material but also in cultural terms."
"The scandals associated with foot and mouth disease and the burning pyres gave the world an image of Europe that we must not allow to be repeated."
"Let me just say something on the subject of prophylaxis."
"I am not in favour of constant prophylactic vaccination, but we must also make it clear that control vaccination always amounts to prophylactic vaccination."
"The right time for this has to be identified, and this is where the Commission has to watch out."
"We also have to give the Member States leeway to enable us to have ring-vaccination and control vaccination at an early stage."
"That does not, however, necessarily include ongoing prophylactic vaccination, to which I wish to express my opposition."
"Mr President, this committee and its report have been an extremely good exercise."
"I would like to congratulate all my colleagues, particularly Mr Sturdy for initiating it, the Chairman Mrs Redondo Jiménez and the rapporteur Mr Kreissl-Dörfler."
"A lot has already been said about 'to vaccinate or not to vaccinate', be it prophylactic vaccination, ring vaccination, emergency vaccination or contingency vaccination."
"The one thing we have agreed upon is that we are not going back down the route of prophylactic vaccination."
"At least that is what this report is saying, and I think that makes sense."
"After all, when we are talking about vaccination, we talk about cattle only, but it was the transport of sheep in the UK, Ireland, France and elsewhere that actually spread the disease the last time, and we must not lose sight of that."
"I would like to concentrate on one point that concerns me greatly and that is the future availability of veterinary resources, particularly in remote regions of the European Union."
"There is sure to be another outbreak of an exotic disease - if not foot and mouth - with the movement of people and animals and modern travel today."
"How we handle it and how it is detected is absolutely critical."
"If we do not have the vets on the ground, particularly in remote areas where it is not viable to have veterinary practices, we have no detection system for the future."
"I urge the Commission to take particular interest and to evaluate the availability of veterinary resources for future disease management within the EU generally."
"Identification of animals, issues of transport, insurance and many other matters came up apart from the vaccination issue."
"I urge sensible handling of transport and the individual identification of animals."
"I congratulate Joe Walsh and Brid Rogers for their great cooperation, which resulted in the worst of this outbreak being avoided in Ireland."
"But, if we go down the route of identifying and tagging each individual sheep, apart altogether from a flock identification tag, and then removing it when the lamb goes to the fattener, we could be left with sheep with three or four tags, or you would be removing tags and adding others: something we are trying unsuccessfully to sort out in Ireland at the moment."
"Finally, I would like to thank the Chairman for accepting our point on the protocol for the movement of non-susceptible animals and, in particular, the promise of a review of the movement of equines during future outbreaks, as horses are not susceptible in this case."
"Mr President, we are dealing with an excellent parliamentary report which is flexible, courageous, balanced and positive, in a very difficult field."
"I therefore congratulate the rapporteur, Wolfgang Kreissl-Dörfler, on this magnificent piece of work, and I would like to highlight the following points I agree with:"
"Firstly, it brings up to date areas which were not covered, such as the vulnerability of sectors like tourism."
"Secondly, it introduces flexible innovations in relation to emergency vaccination, rejecting the obsolete elements of the current regulations."
"Thirdly, it criticises the shortcomings, but in a positive manner."
"Fourthly, it points out the insufficiencies of information policies."
"Commissioner, in view of paragraphs 20 and 21 and of what I experienced myself during the dioxin crisis, mad cow disease and now the Prestige, I believe the Commission should take its ability to directly provide Europeans with information very seriously."
"Fifthly, I very much agree with paragraphs 81 and 82 on compensation."
"And, finally, Mr President, although it does not fall within the competences of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, nor of this parliamentary report, I would like to draw attention to the annual report of the Court of Auditors for 2001, because it makes some criticisms in relation to corruption and, for the sake of combating corruption in relation to CAP subsidies, very good account must be taken of this."
"Mr President, firstly I would like to add my congratulations to the rapporteur and to all involved in bringing about this report."
"It is a balanced report and has been a good initiative."
"It has been good for this Parliament because it has proved that it could produce a report that the national parliament was afraid to."
"I would like to comment on one of the Commissioner's remarks."
"He said that the effect was the same as other diseases or previous outbreaks of foot and mouth and we need to act, but the question is how do we act?"
"That is what has to be addressed."
"This report and investigation brought home the wider effects."
"Coming, as it did, on the back of BSE in the United Kingdom, this disease wrecked the rural economy and destroyed many farmers in the UK."
"I come from Northern Ireland, and Mrs Doyle has referred to the fact that she comes from the Republic of Ireland."
"The reality is that we were very lucky."
"Let us not underestimate this."
"We were not all that good, but we were very lucky. A load of sheep left Longtown market, went all the way across the Irish Sea, were dropped off at Larne in the middle of the island of Ireland and it took a long time to detect them."
"Let me be clear: we need better controls there as well."
"What will remain with us is the sight on our TV screens of the burning pyres."
"It brought home to us how horrific the situation was."
"There has to be a better way of controlling it."
"Ring vaccination has to be the way in which we look at trying to control it. We should put in place more resources and more finance for research and development to achieve a traceable vaccine, so we know that animals have been vaccinated."
"I will finish by re-echoing what has already been said on border controls: border controls are totally inefficient."
"Meat is being brought into the European Community, into the United Kingdom and other countries, and it is not being caught."
"We are going to have to deal with this as other countries have done."
"They have been more effective than we have been."
"We must ensure that our ports and airports are properly controlled in every way."
"The truth is that this disease can strike anywhere and at any time."
"I hope it does not, but we must be ready if it does."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, nowadays, an outbreak of foot and mouth disease even in one small part of one Member State has very rapid and grave effects on the Community as a whole."
"The loss of considerable numbers of animals as a result of the slaughter of whole herds and the profound disquiet and insecurity felt in society as a whole in the countries affected and also throughout the other parts of Europe, meant great financial loss in the affected areas, not only for farming, but also for the economy as a whole and tourism in particular."
"The control of disease can today be understood no longer as merely a means of preserving the stock of farm animals or of defending specific commercial interests, but must also take into account the population's changed lifestyle, their mobility, and their changed attitudes towards the environment and the protection of animals."
"With these things in mind, the Temporary Committee on Foot and Mouth Disease engaged intensively with the whole range of problems associated with epidemics, including their effect on the public and the economy."
"Whilst we do not need to reinvent the wheel, there is much that we can do better when it comes to limiting risks and minimising damage to the economy, while at the same time taking account of the welfare of animals and the sentiments of the public."
"This is not just about a few cows and sheep."
"We are all affected; this is relevant to all of us, and it helps not a bit to make sweeping assertions about who is guilty and who is not."
"I would also like to unambiguously refute the accusations - and there have been some - levelled at farmers, be it in Great Britain or any other country."
"What is important is that all imports should be controlled, that plans for emergencies should be kept up to date, and that the Commission should actively involve itself in them without delay."
"Mass slaughter cannot be a solution, and I wish to put the case for emergency vaccination as being the very least we can do, and, apparently, the best means of getting a speedy grip on the disease and sparing the animals' lives."
"We all know that meat from vaccinated animals is completely safe and therefore capable of being marketed."
"I would like to express my gratitude to our rapporteur, Mr Kreissl-Dörfler."
"I would like to thank Mrs Redondo Jiménez, who chaired our committee, and also the Commission, and those of its members who were of assistance to us."
"I trust that you will all now go and enjoy a nice juicy steak!"
"Mr President, in this Chamber we are very frequently engaged in debating what we consider to be the great political issues."
"But I seem to remember that when we were elected in 1999 our greatest concern was how we made our debates relevant to our electors."
"I want to tell you that the area that I represent here in Parliament - the constituency of Wales - is a country that was markedly affected by the foot and mouth outbreak."
"This debate is very relevant to people in my constituency who suffered from what has been described as a community tragedy."
"There was an impact on a really human scale."
"We sometimes do not recognise the sense of isolation that was felt by many farmers and by other people living in rural areas because of the devastating economic and other impacts of this outbreak."
"I therefore want to begin by thanking the committee for visiting Welshpool, Builth Wells and Sennybridge and meeting people within my constituency who said to Mr Kreissl-Dörfler that the European Parliament was the only official body that came to listen to their views."
"That addresses, in my view, the issue of the relevance of the European Parliament."
"Setting up the committee has been a worthwhile exercise."
"Secondly, I am sorry we had such difficulty in establishing the committee."
"I am sorry it was such a struggle."
"I am sorry that the British Government was so anxious about its own position - that there might be any criticism of its position - that we struggled for some six months to get the committee up and running."
"We all recognise that it was just one group that was opposed to setting up the committee."
"Mr Kreissl-Dörfler, though coming from that group, has been a paragon in approaching this issue in a non-political way."
"His report is first-rate."
"His report has endeavoured to address the real core issues that are of concern."
"Contrary to the views of the people who said that this exercise was going to be irrelevant, Commissioner, we are looking forward to your statement tomorrow, and to having a statement that addresses the concerns outlined by the committee that have emerged in the course of the last year."
"Others have touched upon the details."
"I do not want to do that."
"All I want to say is this: this is a report that had almost universal support in committee."
"I am sorry that some additional amendments have been tabled because we should cling to the consensus that is within the report."
"It is the best example, in my view, of the European Parliament addressing the concerns of voters in a practical way."
"It is a huge example for the future relevance of the European Parliament."
"It is a tragedy that at the last minute there are some people who still feel it is appropriate, rather churlishly, to protect the reputation of the UK Government."
"We are engaged in much more important things than that."
"I ask you to look at the report as it came out of the committee and to respond accordingly, Commissioner."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Temporary Committee on Foot and Mouth Disease has had some important observations to make on the handling of last year's crisis."
"It has defined necessary strategies for the future, which also incorporate important suggestions for the legislative work on which we are about to embark."
"Taken as a whole, this is a good result for cooperation across group lines, for which I wish especially to express warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Kreissl-Dörfler, and to the committee chairman, Mrs Redondo Jiménez."
"There is no doubt that the primary and principal requirement in animal husbandry, to be adhered to in the areas of breeding, veterinary health, hygiene and prophylaxis, is that keeping a system of animal husbandry as self-contained as possible can make an important contribution to the protection of animals and also to their health and to that of human beings."
"I do believe, though, that public debate must also pay closer attention to the need for a distinction to be drawn between epizootics that endanger human health, and epidemics in which we are exclusively concerned with the health of animals and with their welfare and with the protection of valuable stocks."
"Despite last year's crisis, let us not forget that it was in the control of epizootics hazardous to human health that past decades saw great successes achieved by dint of massive economic efforts on the part of all concerned."
"In fact, it was and still is absurd that the practice of vaccination against foot and mouth disease was stigmatised in the public eye at the same time as prophylactic measures, including treatment and vaccination of animals, are in daily use as part of the necessary repertoire of modern and responsible husbandry of many animal species."
"What are we supposed to do if the worst comes to the worst?"
"Are we supposed to use protective emergency vaccination at the right moment?"
"I would add flexibility in ring-vaccination."
"Vaccination and testing should, in principle, be the primary option and should become standard practice. The trade restriction should be reduced to three months at most, as advised by the Scientific Committee as long ago as 1999."
"I will add one very important point, quite without reference to the forthcoming legislative work."
"If all the participants in the market could agree among themselves that infected farms that wanted, and were obliged, to avail themselves of these new tools, would not be left high and dry and would not end up enduring the scorn of the market if they used this strategy for the future, then we could save ourselves all this bother."
"I believe that what is needed is to achieve social consensus on the part of everyone involved."
"If that is done successfully, we will have been able to develop a strategy for the future capable of encompassing the protection and health of animals and enjoying acceptance on the part of society."
"Mr President, as some colleagues may know, I live in Cumbria at the heart of last year's foot and mouth outbreak."
"I and many of my friends, neighbours and constituents lost our animals."
"For us the pyres were not on the television screen, they were over the garden fence."
"I would like to make one thing absolutely clear: the vast majority of those affected were good farmers whose husbandry bears no relationship to that of the few described by Mr Adam."
"Because of my own involvement I have, quite rightly, not played any direct part in the inquiry's proceedings, but it seems clear to me that its findings make a valuable contribution to drawing the right lessons from the 2001 outbreak."
"I would merely like to make four comments."
"Firstly, what occurred in Cumbria, in the United Kingdom - and I have said exactly the same in debates in the UK Parliament and House of Lords - was exacerbated by mistakes made by the United Kingdom Government's handling of the outbreak."
"Secondly, while those whose physical assets were destroyed received compensation, those whose livelihoods were damaged to a similar extent by administrative measures introduced to fight the disease received nothing."
"This loss, which flowed directly from what the government was doing and was entirely foreseeable, was equally real."
"Their contribution to the fight against the disease was equally valid."
"In my view, an injustice has been done to them."
"Thirdly, the evidence now emerging in Cumbria suggests that the public health consequences of the outbreak are much wider-ranging and much longer-lasting than was supposed at the time."
"I would like to end with an appeal beyond this House to the Commission and the governments of the Member States: learn the lessons of 2001."
"Do not let other people go through what we did last year."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too wish to start by thanking our rapporteur, Mr Kreissl-Dörfler, for his collegial cooperation in the temporary committee."
"I am equally grateful to Mrs Redondo, who guided the committee very constructively and with great diplomacy and calmness."
"I would also like to thank all my colleagues."
"Our discussions with officials, experts and victims, as well as our visits to affected sites, helped us to engage in depth with the crisis caused by the outbreak of foot and mouth disease and, in general, with diseases and the means whereby they are dealt with and controlled, as well as with their prevention and with vaccination policy in Europe."
"I am also most grateful to the Commission for always having been there with us and for doing its bit."
"What makes foot and mouth disease especially problematic is that it is highly infectious and is therefore easily passed from one animal to another."
"It is therefore absolutely vital for appropriate measures to be taken to combat the disease as soon as there is an outbreak, so that we never again have to see the sort of images that quite rightly prompted society's displeasure."
"At this point, I would like to say, on a rather critical note, that the report could have made it clearer that a crisis of this sort could have been prevented if appropriate control measures had been taken and if the existing EU regulations had been adhered to or, in certain cases, transposed in the first place."
"The important point here is that outbreaks of diseases such as this one can only be avoided if there are sufficient numbers of well-trained inspectors and if everyone concerned observes minimum standards and safety measures."
"Furthermore, I would like to point out that it is the Member States that are responsible for extending the inspections carried out under their veterinary systems and for relevant research."
"We should stress this again and again."
"I therefore see it as self-evident that bureaucratic procedures and an inadequate information policy must no longer be allowed to be the causes of the spread of a disease."
"Nevertheless, it must be clear to all of us that unfortunately epizootics can break out again in future, whatever is done to prevent them."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the message from this morning's debate was that 'prevention is better than cure'."
"No to prophylactic vaccination; yes to ring-vaccination."
"The recurrent refrain was that, in future, all-round improvements to systems will be required as a matter of necessity."
"In terms of the number of animals culled, the course taken by foot and mouth disease in the European Union in 2001 made it, no doubt, the most serious outbreak ever."
"The Temporary Committee on Foot and Mouth Disease worked hard, and very efficiently, over the course of several months, and those involved were complimented and thanked this morning."
"It is important that any future changes in policy should take as their starting point an analysis of how the disease has been handled up to now."
"European producers and consumers attach equal importance to the transposition of Community legislation, Community finance and, in particular, to the drafting of proposals for the prevention and control of diseases in agriculture."
"What I will now say, I say as one who comes from the region bordering on the Netherlands, with a very high number of granivores."
"We must, yet again, draw attention to the need for better networking when cooperating on an acute case of the disease."
"Political requirements are important, Commissioner, but real work on the ground, on farms, done by veterinary surgeons and the inspection authorities, using the necessary crisis plans and an emergency room, is an absolute necessity if decisions are to be taken quickly and efficiently."
"Perhaps I may conclude by giving the example of my constituency, where many institutions have caused a great stir among farmers by participating in a large-scale test of how they would manage a foot and mouth crisis."
"You have to think of it as a practice exercise for firefighters, a call-out without a fire."
"What was called for was the most rapid reaction in case X, and this cross-border cooperation between the Netherlands and Germany achieved a really most impressive result."
"Let us all hope that this exercise never has to be done for real."
"We are backing the Commission's proposals."
"We look forward with eager anticipation, hoping that we will, in future, have a policy on epidemics that will gain greater acceptance among farmers and consumers than has been the case in the past."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I hope that, at this juncture, over and above the measures which need to be adopted immediately, two things will be discovered which are more important than the race to adopt emergency measures, namely how the epidemic started and why it spread so quickly."
"Mr Kreissl-Dörfler's report - although acceptable in every other way - does not give us a definitive answer on these points, whereas what does emerge, once again, is the disturbing weakness, the shortcomings of the European Commission's veterinary control systems, a weakness which has been admitted by the Commissioner himself with great intellectual honesty, which is tantamount to saying that the lessons of the BSE crisis during the previous legislative term have not served much purpose in this respect."
"It is, however, reassuring to know that the Commission unanimously intends to give due importance to the recommendations which emerged from the mid-term review of the common agricultural policy, of Agenda 2000, as regards animal health, transport and feed, in terms of precautionary and preventive measures to avoid epidemics and, most importantly, in terms of future controls on imports."
"We agree as regards vaccinations: mandatory vaccinations are not yet feasible; preventive, emergency vaccinations are more appropriate but there must be well-coordinated emergency plans: not plans generated by emotion on the spur of the moment at the height of a crisis but plans which take into account the situation throughout Europe and the historical development of the disease, so that such disasters can be understood and prevented - prevent being a word which needs to be stressed once again in this House."
"Mr Sturdy said just now that, even today, there are people who do not understand how all this could have happened or where the epidemic came from."
"At this juncture, at the end of the work of our committee of inquiry and at the end of this debate, it would, in any case, be reassuring to be able to say that we know, most importantly, what to do to prevent a similar scourge occurring in the future."
"Mr President, I also wish to thank the Chairman and rapporteur of the committee, Mrs Redondo Jiménez and Mr Kreissl-Dörfler, who have been excellent in the way they have handled this committee."
"In particular, I thank them for allowing the committee to visit Northumberland, in my region, where the disease originated."
"I do not have time to cover all the issues now but I want to point out in particular that it is very likely that the disease was caused by illegal imports of meat."
"One of my great concerns is that, although this is well known, we still do not have proper controls in place at our ports and airports to prevent further illegal meat imports."
"There is much anecdotal evidence in the UK that large amounts of illegal meat are still entering the country."
"I would ask the Commissioner to address that in his response tomorrow, because it is a time bomb waiting to go off."
"The disease could easily happen again anywhere in Europe."
"People were particularly grateful to have the opportunity to submit their comments to the committee members in person."
"Never again must we see the enormous funeral pyres all over the landscape of the north-east of England, which had such a devastating effect on the tourist industry and all related industries, not just agriculture."
"Above all, despite the efforts of some Members of this Parliament, I hope that we will learn the lessons from the outbreak of this disease and ensure that it never happens again."
"Mr President, I am very pleased to have the opportunity to respond to this valuable and important debate on this report."
"A number of issues have been raised by many speakers which I ought to address - even if only briefly at this stage."
"Firstly, on the question of control of imports, many - if not all - of you have addressed this important issue."
"It is of critical importance to ensure that not only is there legislation in place to deal with this kind of issue but also that the controls are in place to ensure that the legislation is properly implemented."
"It is the job of the Commission to bring forward legislation on the control of imports."
"It is, however, for the control authorities in the Member States to ensure that legislation is fully and properly implemented and not, as Mr Santini suggested, a function of the Commission to ensure that controls are in place."
"We must ensure that we identify who is responsible for what, so that we can clearly indicate to those who have the responsibility that they must exercise those functions properly."
"With regard to legislation, since 1972 we have legislation in place at EU level in respect of imports of commercial products."
"It is illegal to import goods in contravention of that legislation."
"More recently, we have put in place legislation on personal imports, which will be operational from 1 January 2003."
"I, like you, call on Member States to ensure that their control authorities make sure that these pieces of legislation are properly and fully implemented."
"This issue is also addressed in the hygiene regulations before Parliament at the moment."
"Therefore, cooperation of all parties in this is of critical importance in trying to ensure that another outbreak does not happen in the future."
"The second issue that was raised with some passion is vaccination."
"I noted what Mr Whitehead said about the past constantly changing."
"However, in this instance there is one point that I have had to address on many occasions."
"It was again raised by Mrs Corbey and Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf. It is the function of the Commission in the application of vaccinations."
"Two Member States out of the four that had the outbreak of foot and mouth disease sought permission from the Commission to administer emergency vaccination."
"That permission was granted - there is no doubt about that."
"One of those two Member States did not apply it all, the other did, but then decided that the animals that were vaccinated should be killed."
"They had permission from the Commission to vaccinate and keep the animals alive."
"However, for reasons associated with trade considerations - they are not irrelevant and I do not criticise them - that Member State decided to vaccinate and then cull those animals."
"Any of the Member States involved could have applied vaccinations of their own volition, based on their own legislation, without any need for permission from the Commission."
"At this stage, I should like to clarify that issue, rather than to leave in the minds of some people that there may have been some fault on the part of the Commission in failing or in refusing to allow Member States to respond to this outbreak by using vaccination and leaving animals alive."
"That did not happen, although it could have been done because the Commission authorised this in very clear terms."
"I repeat that one of the Member States involved decided not to use vaccination at all and the other decided to use vaccination but nonetheless - for trade considerations - went ahead and culled the cattle involved, even in circumstances where it could have allowed those animals to remain alive."
"I am very happy that a number of speakers praised the work of the Commission."
"I am sure that the people who work with me, my collaborators who are here, take pleasure in that also. They have worked very hard on this."
"I am very pleased that the two institutions have worked so well together in this instance, as Mr Jonathan Evans said."
"We have tried to ensure that what we do here at European Union level - whether in Parliament or in the Commission - has relevance for people."
"In this instance, the debate and the report have been of relevance to citizens of the European Union."
"I also hope that the legislation that will be published tomorrow will respond not just to the needs and desires of Parliament, but also the needs, desires and the wishes of ordinary citizens of the European Union."
"You will see many of the issues you have raised in your report echoed in our legislation which will be published tomorrow, because we have worked closely together on your report and in the drafting of the legislation."
"One further piece of legislation to be published tomorrow governs the individual identification and traceability of sheep."
"That will also contribute to providing some kind of security against an outbreak of this type in the future."
"Finally, I congratulate Mrs Redondo Jiménez for chairing this committee and Mr Kreissl-Dörfler for the excellent work he has undertaken and for the cooperation that he and his people offered not only to myself but also my officials."
"This is a clear example of the two institutions working very well and effectively together for the benefit of the citizens of the European Union."
"Am I right in thinking that Mrs Thors wishes to speak on this matter?"
"In accordance with our Rules of Procedure, you are perfectly entitled to take the floor in your capacity as rapporteur, but you can only do this just before the vote on your report."
"I therefore suggest that you wait and I shall let you know when you may take your two minutes' speaking time."
"We received a request from Mr Hughes, who suggested that we take the vote on the Damião report today."
"Is there a Member who wishes to speak against Mr Hughes' request to take the vote on the Damião report today?"
"Since no one wishes to speak against this request and since this means a change to our agenda, I suggest that we first vote on this proposal for a change."
"(Parliament agreed to the change to the agenda)"
"The vote will therefore take place after the vote on the Langenhagen report."
"WRITTEN STATEMENT (RULE 120)"
"Thank you very much for this clarification."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Mr President, I wonder if it is possible to get a set of headphones."
"I do not appear to have a set at my desk and I must apologise to Mrs Thors, my Finnish is not that great."
"Mr President, Amendment No 14 was tabled by the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party."
"As rapporteur, I am not qualified - as I have not been mandated to this end by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs - to give an opinion in its favour, but I shall simply reiterate that this amendment is fully in line with the traditional positions of the European Parliament, and particularly with the report by Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen."
"That is why, personally speaking, I approve this amendment."
"I suggest that all the versions are reviewed in the light of your comment, Mr Corbett, so that we are all clear on this point."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"President."
"Given the time, I suggest we suspend voting and resume immediately after the formal sitting for the presentation of the Sakharov Prize."
". (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, before we move to the final vote, I would just like to say a few words."
"Never before, in eight years, have I taken the floor after a report, but I think it appropriate that I do so today."
"There is no doubt that some of the amendments on which we voted today are perfectly in order."
"Whilst I do not want to revisit the subject of Great Britain, which we talked about for long enough this morning, some of those that did not get through had to do with the removal of duplications, for example in connection with the OIE's three-month probation period, which causes us concern."
"We were also concerned to give the report a coherent form."
"We did not succeed in that, but it does not matter."
"What I would like to say is that I am very glad that the Greens' Amendment No 25 was rejected."
"I also want to tell you why."
"The fact is that it would make the internal market fundamentally null and void, and, when your farmers vaccinate, you would have to explain to them that they were enabling British farmers to eat their own sheep and Dutch farmers to drink their own milk, since these products would no longer find their way onto the EU market or the markets of third countries outside the European Union."
"You simply have to bear that in mind."
"It may be all very fine as far as protecting animals is concerned, but there is no political mileage in it at all."
"That is why I am very glad that the amendment was rejected."
"Quite apart from that, I am very happy that we worked together extremely well in the committee, without regard to group allegiances, and that this report is supported by a large majority today."
"May I remind you, Mr Kreissl-Dörfler, that it was by concession from the Chair that you were able to take the floor, as I do not want to launch another debate at this stage of the vote."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE"
"This European Parliament and Council directive, which aims to bring together in a single text all the regulations on the organisation of working time drawn up by the EU over a number of years, is an even clearer illustration of the desire to allow bosses to organise working time as they see fit."
"That is why we are taking this opportunity to reiterate, in particular, our outright opposition to night working where this is not socially indispensable, as it is then merely another way to increase profits at the expense of workers' health."
"As for the length of working time, the considerable number of pages devoted to exemptions authorised for a transitional period of five years, beginning on 1 August 2004, certainly illustrates the extent to which this is less of a question of organising employees' working time than of allowing bosses a free reign so that they can exploit workers as they wish."
"This is what one of these many scandalous exemptions stipulates: 'The Member States shall ensure that the number of weekly working hours does not, under any circumstances, exceed an average of 58 hours during the first three years of the transitional period, an average of 56 hours during the following two years, and an average of 52 hours for any additional period.'"
"We are obviously unable to endorse a directive of this nature."
"We voted against this report, and against those on Bulgaria and Romania, as they incite, or even oblige, the governments of these countries to 'restructure' their steel production."
"On the pretext of 'streamlining', the text calls for a reduction of the productive capacities of these countries."
"We condemn this absolutely stupid and inhumane 'streamlining', which will mean some of the existing businesses will close, that their workers will be made redundant and unemployment will get worse, and the only purpose of this streamlining is so that surviving factories make a profit for their owners."
"Whilst we support the enlargement of the European Union to the countries of Eastern Europe, we are opposed to the fact that enlargement is being used as a pretext for making the living conditions of the working classes in these countries worse."
"If the European Parliament wishes to punish war crimes, it should start by putting its own house in order."
"France, Great Britain, Belgium, Portugal and Spain, virtually all the States in other words, whose representatives are sitting in this Chamber, have in the past waged shameful colonial wars leaving a trail of crimes against humanity."
"It is out of the question to prosecute the generals or colonels who tortured Algerians, just as it is out of the question to try the political leaders who covered up for them and justified their actions."
"How many other conflicts have occurred, even after decolonisation, in Rwanda, Sierra Leone or in Liberia for example, where European States have been responsible for or accomplices to crimes against humanity, should we not condemn these too?"
"Who will judge the crimes being committed, even as we speak, against civilians in Côte d'Ivoire, by rebel soldiers, yes, but also by soldiers of the regime, under the direct protection of the French army?"
"It is not the population that the French army is protecting there, but French money."
"Get the French army out of Côte d'Ivoire!"
"As for the report, it reeks of hypocrisy, and that is why we voted against it."
"- (NL) For centuries, no prosecutions were brought for crimes committed during wars."
"Cruel intimidation and the murder of civilians were an accepted tool used for engaging in territorial expansion and securing economic spheres of interest."
"The military was above the law."
"Not until 1945, after the defeat of Germany and Japan in the Second World War, were war criminals from those countries convicted by the victors."
"Were they the only war criminals?"
"Or is the designation of war criminal equally applicable to those responsible for the destruction of Dresden, Hiroshima and Nagasaki?"
"Evidently one needs to be the loser in a war to be tried and sentenced after that war."
"Partial losers, who have not lost control over their home base, get off scot-free, witness the colonial wars of the Netherlands in Indonesia, France in Algeria and Portugal in Angola and Mozambique."
"Despite that selective approach, it is good that crimes should be punished, even if an attempt is made to justify them in terms of the exigencies of war."
"In this way we can discourage repetition in future."
"Unfortunately the Kirkhope report offers mainly a policy of harassing refugees accused by their political opponents of having dirty hands."
"It will scarcely help us to prevent future crimes of rulers against their people."
"I have voted for this report because I believe that it deals very well with a complex but urgent issue - that of bringing war criminals to justice within the European Union."
"Mr Kirkhope as a former Home Office Minister in the UK has a good understanding of the complexity of the issue and has shown in his reports the benefits of action at a European level."
"The Council text has been amended so that some articles which may have breached rules of subsidiarity (those that are concerned with the regulation of investigations and prosecutions rather than with the exchange of information), in fact are now, in my view, in line with this principle."
". (PT) I believe that this Danish initiative, which seeks to promote closer cooperation in the investigation and prosecution of inter alia war crimes and crimes against humanity, makes an effective and practical contribution to the important objective being proposed for the EU, through the action plan adopted by the Council on 20 March 2000, under the title 'The prevention and control of organised crime: a European Union strategy for the beginning of the new millennium'."
"I also considered some amendments tabled by the rapporteur and adopted by the specialist parliamentary committee to be appropriate and justified, concerning the protection of personal data, concerning this Council decision not interfering in the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court and concerning the clarification that the authorities responsible for prosecuting these crimes are the national authorities responsible for ensuring that national legislation is complied with, not those responsible for immigration, particularly those established at European level."
"I have therefore voted in favour of the report."
". (PT) I wish to congratulate Mr Sousa Pinto on the quality and the boldness of his report."
"I agree with his criticism of the Danish proposal's lack of ambition and scant substance."
"No progress has been made on the mutual recognition of judgments and we are still a long way off from implementing the principle of the mutual recognition of sentencing."
"The proposal that has been made only proposes the establishment of a system of exchanging information between Member States on disqualifications imposed in the courts, but does not provide for any type of mutual recognition of sentencing for the purposes of its implementation, which means that an individual who is sentenced to disqualification or to the loss of rights in one Member State can still exercise these rights freely in another State of the Union."
"We must fulfil the desire expressed in Tampere and Laeken to make the principle of the mutual recognition of judgments in criminal matters effective."
"The issue of the recognition of judgments in criminal matters is highly sensitive, and raises delicate issues."
"There are differences in the various Member States and we must avoid the possibility of 'havens for criminals', and prevent freedom of movement from benefiting those acting outside the law."
"We must provide a clear response to the citizens' demands for the EU effectively to confront the problem of the increasing threats crime poses for their freedom and rights by means of a solid and common policy for preventing and combating crime."
"Rejecting the Danish proposal would therefore send an important political signal to the Council and to the Member States: the European Parliament wants consistent and coherent progress under the third pillar and does not want unambitious initiatives that appear to focus all their energy on winning media approval."
"British Conservative MEPs do not believe that mutual recognition is necessary in this field."
"Disqualifications should remain a matter for intergovernmental cooperation."
"As such the British Conservative Delegation supports the rejection of this Council proposal."
". (PT) The creation of a genuine European area of security and justice covering the entire territory of the Union can only be achieved through better coordination between the national authorities of the Member States, pursuing a dual approach: on the one hand, promoting a coherent and coordinated policy on combating organised crime - that has been very skilful in exploiting the completion and deepening of the internal market and, on the other, providing a clever answer to what is, as the rapporteur has stated, the third out of Europe's citizens nine greatest concerns - combating organised crime, coming immediately after peace and security and unemployment."
"Although this Danish initiative seeks to establish a system of information-sharing between the Member States on disqualifications issued against an individual in a criminal judgment, it does not, however, provide for any type of mutual recognition of sentencing for the purposes of its implementation."
"I have therefore supported this report and agreed with rejecting the Danish initiative as the rapporteur proposed and as the specialist parliamentary committee accepted."
"In fact, this initiative only concerns the creation of an information-sharing system between Member States, and this instrument lacks genuine operability in the fight against organised crime because the initiative does not seek to create, at the same time, any mutual recognition of sentencing with a view to its implementation, which is a prerequisite for the disqualifications it is seeking to achieve."
". (PT) The Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has submitted a proposal to Parliament rejecting an initiative from the Kingdom of Denmark under the third pillar."
"The Commission and your rapporteur believe that this position must be adopted to ensure that Parliament clearly states its deep dissatisfaction with the situation of paralysis afflicting the third pillar, for which the Member States are responsible."
"Important Commission proposals both before and after 11 September 2001, primarily the package of measures to combat terrorism, remain blocked in the Council or are still awaiting transposal or ratification by the Member States."
"Unable to achieve the consensus necessary in the Council, or to honour their commitments in national legislation, the Member States are using and abusing their right of initiative."
"We have received a plethora of outlandish proposals, by which I mean proposals that do not form part of any plan and did not feature in the Commission's 'scoreboard'."
"These are arbitrary, insignificant, incoherent proposals, sometimes dictated by the national political agenda, and transform the third pillar into an ever-expanding universe, containing chaos in all directions; a bureaucratic ball of thread without ends."
"It is the European Parliament's duty to condemn this smokescreen, which consists of apparent legislative hyperactivity, which contributes to disguising the Union's lethargy in a crucial area, especially after 11 September 2001 - and the political inability of the Council and the Member States to bring a single significant measure coming from the Commission and laid out in the scoreboard into force."
"The gulf between the words of political leaders, not least government representatives, and their translation into concrete actions is taking on scandalous proportions in the field of combating transnational crime."
"We must put an end to this situation."
"This is the message that the European Parliament wishes to send to the Council and to the Member States."
"One of the problems that is fundamental but all too often neglected by scientific research in Europe is that of the flagrant under-representation of women."
"This is not only a problem of equality and justice - it is also a problem relating to the effectiveness of European research, which therefore demonstrates that the EU is still far from able to harness its potential in human resources."
"That is why, in the light of the objective that the Union set itself in Lisbon to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, it is particularly important to vote in favour of this report, which gives the issue of women in research the attention that it deserves."
"It is basically a question of supporting the efforts made within the framework of the European research policy, such as the prominence given to 'Women and Science' as part of the specific programme entitled 'Structuring the European Research Area'."
"We also note that there is a great deal of work still to be done, such as integrating a gender perspective into all levels of future framework programmes and continuing to compile and disseminate statistics on the participation of men and women."
"More generally speaking, the report also raises the issue of how to achieve better reconciliation between one's career and family life, to the benefit of children as well as working men and women, through the establishment in each Member State of crèche and nursery facilities, for example."
". (PT) This report is based on the misguided principle that aid granted by the EDF falls within the sphere of Community competence."
"It has been clearly proven that the nature of relations between the various Member States and the countries receiving development aid is quite different."
"This is partly a result of historical factors and old ties which, in many cases, such as Portugal, lead to relationships involving very close cooperation."
"These relationships are expressed in frameworks that can only be identified and given due consideration in the context of consultation with the Council itself."
"I disagree with communitarisation and have therefore voted against the report."
"Mr President, cooperation in the field of education in Europe has brought many students together from different parts of the European Union, as well as students from the accession countries."
"The students taking part in these activities are not just increasing their own knowledge and abilities to deal with the ever-changing nature and shape of the world in which we live, they also represent the future building-blocks for a new society and a new understanding and tolerance of the cultural diversity within the European Union."
"The number of people who have taken part in the Erasmus programme since its inception will exceed one million during the academic year 2002 to 2003."
"A total of 30 countries presently take part."
"I welcome the fact that the European Union is now putting in place a charter for Erasmus students which will be available to all students in 2003."
"This charter spells out responsibilities and entitlements, such as full recognition by the home university of academic achievements, as well as credits to be obtained by students during their term on Erasmus."
"It is the goal of the European Commission and Parliament to reach two million participating students by 2007."
"We must also ensure that, while they are abroad, students continue to receive education grants from their home Member States and that the Erasmus programme is not exclusive to those who can afford it."
"The Youth for Europe programme has been very successful in encouraging more exchanges between students."
"We should encourage further development of this area, in particular for those who are disadvantaged."
"It should also be pointed out that the Socrates programme has already been extended to cover the period 2000 to 2006 and EUR 1 850 million has been allocated for this programme."
"Finally, as a result of the Court of Auditors' decisions, we must ensure that our accounting and delivery practices are better, to ensure that all students can benefit not only from a tremendous academic achievement but also from a cultural experience."
"This motion concerns the Court of Auditors' report on the application of the Socrates and Youth programmes (1995-1999)."
"The Court of Auditors highlights design weaknesses (Socrates is excessively complex, resulting in different interpretations and problems between the Technical Assistance Office and the national agencies) and shortcomings in implementation (delays, management shortcomings, suspicions of fraud, seven cases referred to OLAF) and evaluation."
"Evaluation reports were delayed and there were so many irregularities that the Court of Auditors found it hard to come to a judgment as to whether or not the programmes' objectives had been realised, while the mid-term report on the Youth programme was produced by a company owned by a former director of the TAO."
"The motion contains worthwhile comments and proposals."
"It calls on the Commission to act on the Court of Auditors' recommendations, including its recommendation to replace the TAOs by Community public-law agencies."
"It also calls for any 'framework' contracts with external bodies to be phased out and for monitoring and evaluation to be awarded to public bodies."
"There also appears to be some doubt as to the efficacy of the programmes themselves."
"These positive comments, however, are simply ways of improving programmes which, as we have stressed time and again, have been designed for purposes which bear no relation to their lofty titles."
"These programmes aggressively impose the Euro-unifying education model in the field of education and youth and are designed to familiarise young people with so-called European ideals."
"Having taken all these factors into account, the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece abstained from voting."
". (PT) I have voted in favour of this report, because I believe that maintaining Community funds for promoting exchanges between European students, specifically under these two Community action programmes, Socrates and Youth for Europe, is extremely important."
"Despite the shortcomings highlighted by the rapporteur and by the specialist parliamentary committee, not least the inadequacies of the programmes' development and administration, for which some suggestions have in fact been made, it must be acknowledged that a take-up rate of around 90% enables us to see the great importance and consequently, the considerable success that this type of programme has had, is having and will have in enriching and developing both future generations of Europeans and in contributing to lifelong learning, which is becoming increasingly necessary."
"I therefore agree with maintaining these programmes and the budgetary approach that is proposed, because it is of crucial importance that we continue to promote the creation of a European educational area through informal educational experiences amongst young people, including physical mobility in particular, to promote lifelong learning, foreign language learning, greater use of new technologies in education and to promote cooperation at European level between the various Education providers concerned."
"Mr President, in the context of the fight against terrorism, the Coelho report proposes, inter alia, the establishment by Council decision in each State of an office known as 'SIRENE'."
"In Italian, the word sirene [mermaids] is used to describe beautiful women with fishes' tails, naked from the waist up, who live in the sea."
"I therefore feel - and I had to vote for the report - that, with this system, the terrorists will be vanquished. How will the terrorists be able to resist the mermaids?"
"If I may, I would therefore recommend that the mermaids should have the features of Claudia Schiffer, Kim Basinger, Sabrina Ferilli and - why not - more recent stars such as Britney Spears, Shakira, Christina Aguilera and various others, that each person can add as they wish."
"(PT) This initiative forms part of an approach of introducing proposals little by little in the aim of increasing discretionary powers, on the pretext of the fight against terrorism, in this case, through the completely unjustified creation of SIS-II."
"This initiative must be rejected, because, in particular:"
"it allows bodies, particularly from third countries, to have easy access to information of a personal nature, without any sort of control;"
"it provides no guarantees that every proposal for the SIS's functioning will be approved by the Schengen Joint Supervisory Authority;"
"the argument and the concern about terrorism cannot be used as a pretext for creating files on citizens, for purely political reasons, which could lead to the SIS becoming a political information service, serving a future European police policy, with unforeseeable consequences for safeguarding citizens' freedoms and rights."
"The Schengen Information System is an electronic system for recording, identifying and monitoring suspects and is used purely for policing and repressive purposes."
"It is applied with a great deal of enthusiasm in order to suppress the burgeoning grass-roots movement opposed to European Union policy and to ensure that Fortress Europe keeps out immigrants."
"Even though a great many complaints have been made, including by advocates of the SIS, about its lack of transparency and threat to human rights, the European Parliament assented last year to a new, second-generation system, on the pretext of fighting terrorism."
"We would remind the House that the Schengen Information System started up in 1995, well before 11 September 2001."
"The Spanish initiative, which the Coelho report endorses despite its rhetoric on protection of civil rights, proposes that all the repressive agencies of the ?U (Europol, Eurojust etc.) should have access to the system and that it should extend to new data categories."
"The proposal to collect and exchange information on foreigners applying for residence permits, using the fight against terrorism as an excuse, is in keeping with the racist and xenophobic attitude of the rulers of the ?U."
"This is an anti-democratic initiative and the grass-roots movement is fighting to reject both it and the Schengen Information System itself."
"- (NL) The proposal before us implies a tacit shift in the function of the Schengen Information System from a monitoring tool in the context of the free movement of individuals to a detection tool in the context of the war against crime and terrorism."
"Despite the fact that there is insufficient clarity about modalities, particularly supervision and data protection."
"The rights of citizens are therefore insufficiently guaranteed in this proposal."
"Mr President, if I may, I wanted to highlight the exceptional nature of Mr Bourlanges' report, which comes at just the right time, given the development of the Convention."
"The Convention has been bled almost dry by a virtual IGC with the arrival of numerous Foreign Affairs ministers."
"Thanks to Mr Bourlanges' report, it is the European Parliament that is restoring to the Convention its strength with the absolutely essential elements of clarity and a sense of perspective."
"Clear legislation, because if we are all meant to be aware of the law, the legal categories must be perfectly clear, and a sense of perspective, because it is always important clearly to distinguish between constitutional data and actual policies."
"Mr Bourlanges' report will contribute significantly to this."
"In fact, we get the feeling that this is less a report than the framework for a Bourlanges Constitution."
"One of the Convention's core tasks is to make proposals for simplifying and clarifying legal instruments and rules of procedure used by the EU, as well as to clarify which powers the Member States have delegated to the EU."
"The Convention's efforts to bring about a uniform decision-making structure based on codecision and the Community model within a combined 'constitutional treaty' amount to important changes with a view to democratising the EU's decision-making process and making it easier to grasp."
"The report contains sound proposals for new terminology aimed at clarifying the ways in which the EU's legal instruments work and at making the decision-making process more easily accessible."
"The report makes it clear that the EU can only act in areas delegated by the Member States."
"Those areas that the Member States choose to delegate are characterised by the clear added value entailed in cooperation as distinct from the Member States' acting individually, especially with regard to the internal market and the joint combating of serious cross-border crime."
"The report is unclear regarding whether treaty changes should only be based on the outcome of the Convention and whether future conventions need to approve possible changes by intergovernmental conferences to the conventions' recommendations."
"An obligation on the part of future intergovernmental conferences to comply with the Convention would fundamentally alter the relationship between the EU and the Member States."
"The requirement of unanimity in the case of treaty changes must be maintained."
"The ratification processes must be respected and continue to operate as they do at present."
"What is also unclear is whether it will be possible for the proposed laws supplementary to the constitution, based on decision-making by qualified majority, to determine how the EU is funded in future."
"The funding of the EU must be decided upon unanimously."
"The Moderates are opposed to proposals that may lead to the EU's being funded by EU taxes."
". (FR) In the minority opinion annexed to the Bourlanges report, I criticised, in particular, the proposal in paragraph 5 to allow the Treaties to be revised by majority vote, albeit an extremely qualified majority vote, instead of unanimously."
"Taking Europe further along its current path, this method would distance the Member States from the European decision-making process."
"One of our Luxemburgish fellow Members, Mr Poos, former Foreign Affairs Minister for his country, and former President-in-Office of the Council of the European Union, has written to Mr Bourlanges to tell him this."
"Stating 'that no Member State will agree to a change to fundamental law being imposed on them against their will', he adds: 'the citizens of States thus made a minority will reject a Europe with vague authoritarian ideas."
"As many successive constitutional changes are made, an increasing number of Member States could be reduced to the status of vassal states."
"We can imagine the result in terms of adhesion to the Community project'."
"In the end, the adopted resolution contained a more vague passage on this point, but the intent remains."
"In any case, the spirit of this proposal is more widely present in the idea of the report (and the Convention) to make codecision with a qualified majority in the Council the rule, without counterbalancing it with any national veto system."
"We almost feel sorry for the rapporteur, who tries to introduce a little order into what he himself terms 'chaos', in other words the jumble of contradictory or inapplicable rules, regulations and directives resulting from the horse-trading that has taken place between Member States throughout what we incorrectly call European integration."
"The chaos he criticises is not just in the texts, however, but also in reality."
"There is total conflict between the process underway, which is developing according to the varying degrees of pressure from rival private interests defended by the Member States, and genuine unification creating a borderless Europe with a rationally-organised economy at European level."
"In wanting to reconcile European unification with competing capitalist interests, the report is reduced to squaring the circle."
"This report falls in line with the prospect of the federalist integration of the European Union, and points towards establishing a constitution, striving to increase the supranational powers of the European Parliament by extending codecision. It consequently advocates extending the use of qualified majority voting in the Council with the communitarisation of a greater number of policies."
"The resolution also strives to change the method of amending the Treaties and advocates the institutionalisation of the 'convention' method with increased powers, laying down different amending processes - making a distinction between what is known as the 'constitutional' part and the 'policy' part - and opening up the possibility of the national parliaments no longer being able to play their full role in ratifying the Treaties."
"Although we welcome the withdrawal of this resolution, as proposed by my group, from the point where it recommends the end of decision-making by unanimity in the Council for any revision of the Treaties (when what is at stake are issues as crucial as the decision to transfer national competences to the EU), the resolution envisages an EU legal system that takes precedence over those of the Member States, thereby increasing the powers of its supranational institutions. It even proposes creating a new institution, by institutionalising the 'convention', laying the foundations for creating a future 'European State' and undermining national sovereignty and independence, not least of Portugal."
"Hence our vote against the report."
"- (NL) The rules presently applying in the EU form an incoherent patchwork."
"They have emerged over the course of fifty years via treaties, ordinances and directives, with the Court of Justice having to act as arbiter."
"It is unclear to the citizens of Europe who is responsible for those rules, how far-reaching they are and how they can be changed."
"In the EU, ordinance is the name for direct legislation at the most centralised level, while the same term is used in the Netherlands for rules established by municipalities and provinces within the scope allowed by national legislation."
"The word 'directive' creates the impression that these are non-binding recommendations, hence well-meaning advice."
"In reality national parliaments are forced to establish corresponding legislation within two years, so that the essence of the decision to be taken there has already been established before public discussion of its desirability can get under way."
"Anyone wanting a European superstate with lots of centralised legislation will be given an excellent overview by the rapporteur, Mr Bourlanges of the relation between constitution, ordinary legislation, programme legislation, framework legislation, organic legislation and financial legislation."
"I do not support his intentions, but I do support his clarity."
"He quite rightly wants executive measures of the European Commission to be submitted for the approval of this Parliament if we register an objection within three months."
"Given the talent that Mr Bourlanges normally demonstrates, we could have expected more from him than this report of no great value, which, in particular, is certainly not distinguished by originality."
"The hierarchy of legislation he proposes (constitutional bloc, organic laws, ordinary laws) is nothing more than an exact copy of that laid down by the French Constitution of the Fifth Republic."
"Furthermore, insofar as the hierarchy of legislation necessarily implies a hierarchy of functions and bodies, the rapporteur does nothing less than set out a new Community architecture that reproduces the Member State's constitutional model at European level."
"As with any exercise of this kind, institutional mimicry does, however, have its limits."
"Is it really appropriate to attempt to transpose to Community level the constitutional model that is common to the Member States?"
"The answer is clearly 'No'."
"What the rapporteur is forgetting when he substitutes European law for current legislation, obviously requiring the extension of the codecision procedure in doing so, or when he mentions a reform of the procedure for revising the Treaties, is that the Union, even equipped with an identical political system to that of the Member States, will always lack the essential factor: democratic legitimacy."
". (PT) I broadly share the legal assessment this report makes of the Community legal system."
"One could hardly agree more with the rapporteur's observation that we are facing real legislative, procedural and linguistic chaos; and even more so when he says that the inconsistency between the various categories of legal acts of which this system comprises is making it unintelligible to members of the public, even the most well informed about legal issues."
"The current framework ignores any principle for designating legal acts and is based on terms that are frequently obscure and sometimes misleading."
"Nevertheless, I could not support the report when, in political terms, it seeks to take advantage of this need to establish a coherent typology of Community laws and a logical hierarchy of acts - a legislative necessity - in order to move forwards in the 'long march' of the highly debatable federalist and constitutional doctrine, presuming that a 'de facto' sovereign European State with constituent power already exists and goes so far as to omit any reference whatsoever to national parliaments or actually proposing to end the procedure based on the Treaties themselves."
"The fact is that giving the Community legal system coherence and clarity by no means requires imposing a federal legislative framework and this is something we all know."
"I have, therefore, voted against the report, whilst regretting that the rapporteur - who has produced a technically superb piece of work - should have blundered into what I consider to be federalist opportunism."
". (PT) The final report is to be welcomed because it upholds the current restrictive list of products."
"It is also to be welcomed that it insists on the immediate removal of all products falsely labelled 'Not Irradiated' when this claim has been disproved by the appropriate tests."
"It should be remembered that the precautionary principle must always be observed."
"The issue is that any technology needs to prove the benefits of its use and take account of the potential risks to health and to the environment, given that food-irradiation technology is highly problematic."
"In fact, on the basis of a civilian use of nuclear energy, this appears to have no other use apart from replacing the normal hygiene and safety rules that processed foods should already follow."
"There also appear to be no benefits to consumers because, apart from the risks of improper use, with the possibility of poisoning, irradiation makes it more difficult for the consumer to discern the true state of the product."
"Consequently, the overriding aim of this technology appears to be something else - speeding up the liberalisation of international trade and increasing the centralisation/concentration of the mass production and distribution of foods throughout the world, with consequences for the delocalisation of agri-food production and for the decline of small-scale local farmers, thereby calling sustainable development into question."
"Mr President, British Labour Members voted against the report because our amendments to remove errors of fact were not carried."
"These errors remain in paragraphs 15, 22, 25, 26, 30, 31, 32 and 33."
"In addition, the following paragraphs contain statements which are not supported by the evidence and findings of the lessons to be learned and Royal Society reports: paragraphs 6, 16 and 25."
"The following paragraphs contain statements not in line with the balance of evidence presented to the committee or contain errors of fact of lesser importance than those to which amendments were tabled: paragraphs 3, 7, 9, 11, 20, 21, 34 and 57."
"Mr President, I voted against this report, not because I do not support the recommendations on the way forward in the event of another unfortunate outbreak of foot and mouth disease, but because of the basic inaccuracies in the preamble."
"I prefer to vote for fact and not fiction and, because certain people wish to obscure the truth with political fiction, I have voted against."
"It has been claimed that over 10 million animals were slaughtered during the foot and mouth outbreak but owners have only claimed compensation for 6.5 million."
"Farmers, I know, are not slow in coming forward."
"There is no evidence of breaches in animal welfare legislation."
"If there was, surely there would have been prosecutions, since animal rights groups within the UK are amongst the most active in the world."
"Finally, the report hints at breaches in environmental legislation due to such events as the burning of dead carcasses."
"The Environmental Agency within the UK carried out an investigation of the procedure used in the foot and mouth outbreak and concluded that there had been no breaches."
"The report is, therefore, unfortunately basically flawed."
"Mr President, on behalf of the European Parliamentary Labour Party, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for the fair, open-minded and assiduous way in which he has carried out his task."
"This report, when he looks ahead, is an excellent report and provides useful guidelines for future action."
"Unfortunately, the committee and the plenary have chosen to amend the text in relation to what happened in the past, in such a way that my delegation found it impossible to support it and indeed voted against it."
"We strongly reject the questions about the legality of the culls because the courts in the United Kingdom upheld their legality."
"We strongly reject the idea of breaches of animal welfare legislation because there have been no prosecutions as a result of investigations of those claims."
"We strongly reject the claims concerning breaches of environmental legislation because the Environmental Agency has conducted its assessment and come to the conclusion that there was no environmental harm."
"We reject the claim of biosecurity lapses because there was no evidence of the spread of infection from carcasses being moved or by official personnel."
"We reject the figure of 10 million animals slaughtered because farmers have only claimed for 6.5 million and this is a fantasy figure being used for political gain."
". I want to congratulate the rapporteur and the members of the Temporary Committee on Foot and Mouth Disease on the excellent work they have done together."
"This is an important report because it endorses some firm points of reference in the problematic area of the prevention of this terrible disease."
"First and foremost in that it calls for emergency vaccinations to be made a priority to control any future spread of the disease, in addition, of course, to calling for a ban on imports from third countries in which foot and mouth disease is endemic and for much more decisive measures to combat illegal meat imports, which we believe are the most likely cause of the entry of the disease into the European Union."
"Secondly in that the report urges the European Union to change its current policy of vaccination being a last resort."
"In the event of any future outbreak of the disease, vaccination with a view to keeping the animals alive must be considered right from the outset, along with the immediate need to slaughter the animals in the infected farms and avoid contacts which are widely known to be dangerous."
"The Community should be able to play a fundamental role in defining the strategy for controlling foot and mouth disease."
"Indeed, we support the call for a shift of emphasis in European Union policy away from purely commercial considerations."
"(Text abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)"
"The foot and mouth epidemic that affected Europe in 2001 was a great disaster, and not only for the United Kingdom, where mass slaughter of livestock was necessary."
"Quite apart from the tragic consequences for farmers, the effects of this catastrophe and the urgent sanitary measures implemented have reached far beyond the agriculture sector."
"The report highlights a number of factors that exacerbated the situation: livestock farming and the agri-food sector were subject to the demands of importers and exporters and the race for world market domination;"
"European sanitary directives were not transposed into national legislation; veterinary border controls were sometimes insufficient, despite the tremendously high value of the interests at risk; and there has been a continuous reduction in the number of veterinary surgeons."
"However, although it highlights the aggravating factors and 'failures' on the part of the authorities (which some amendments attempt to conceal), this report fails to challenge the general financial principle of 'commercial breeding', the principle of the pursuit of capitalist profit."
"This is precisely why, in order to avoid losing their position in the world marketplace, the authorities decided to prohibit prophylactic vaccination at European level, even if it meant resorting to mass slaughter in the event of an epidemic."
"We therefore abstained from voting on this report, although we do support some of its recommendations."
"Whilst the report of the committee set up by the European Parliament makes some important recommendations on how to improve the handling of any future outbreaks of foot and mouth disease, some MEPs are using the 'wisdom of hindsight' to launch wholly unjustified attacks on the UK Government."
"There is no doubt that the committee's report underlines the scale of what was the world's worst ever foot and mouth outbreak."
"It has to be remembered that on the day the alarm was first raised the disease had already taken hold in over 50 farms in 16 different counties."
"I understand the havoc it wreaked for so many individuals and communities in North Yorkshire and elsewhere."
"I know they need help to recover and reassurance that, at both UK and European level, we will do everything we can to ensure that such a devastating outbreak never occurs again."
"I hope that we will concentrate on the sensible and practical proposals put forward by the committee and other studies conducted into the outbreak - including the need to prevent infected meat and meat products entering the European Union."
". I have joined with my British Labour colleagues in the PSE Group in voting against this report."
"As President of the European Parliament's All Party Intergroup on the Welfare and Conservation of Animals, I naturally have a special interest in the Kreissl-Dörfler report."
"I support measures to prevent a similar outbreak of foot and mouth disease, as proposed in the report."
"I reject claims regarding the legality of the cull."
"Whilst very regrettable, the cull was perceived at the time as the most effective measure to end the outbreak."
"It is very easy to be wise in hindsight."
"The approach of the UK Government with respect to the culls was approved by the European Commission."
"Any report such as this requires accurate information."
"As, for example, the statistics quoted appear to be contrary to official UK figures, it brings into question the wider points of the report."
"For this reason, and with reservations as above, I have voted against the report."
"Overall, I am happy with the text adopted."
"It groups together all the players (public authorities, agriculture sector, citizens) and involves them early on in the debate, in particular with regard to the establishing of early warning systems."
"These early warning systems, once set up by the Commission, should benefit visibly from monitoring and increased control of their operation."
"Information on the risks and appropriate measures must be distributed and included."
"All the Member States must also, as we are requesting, carry out regular farm inspections in order to ensure that the general rules on sanitary control and biosecurity are effectively understood and applied."
"Failure to do so will incur penalties which are in proportion with the breaches observed."
"Although farmers are given substantial responsibility in the measure, all too often increases in the amount of livestock for income are perceived as an essential factor in the risk of an epidemic."
"International trade, however, is also a factor that should be taken into account."
"I am also pleased that my fellow Members reacted favourably to my proposal seeking to prohibit the introduction of products destined for tax-free warehouses or the provisioning of ships from countries not authorised to export to the EU."
"Today, this meat that could carry a risk of foot and mouth disease can be taken to these warehouses within the Union itself."
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)"
"Foot and mouth disease inflicted a heavy toll in my own East of England constituency, and I had hoped that this European Parliament report would do justice to the losses suffered by farmers, the tourist industry and our whole community."
"Indeed the way the committee of inquiry conducted its work gave me such hope, that we could genuinely add to the lessons learnt, to combat and hopefully prevent any future outbreak."
"However, as other Members have indicated, the final report has been subject to amendments put forward by political groups in the Parliament, which suggest breaches of law which did not take place, even deliberately misreporting the numbers of animals killed."
"I had hoped this issue would be treated as more important than one subject to cheap political point-scoring."
"Not so."
"In these circumstances, I am recording my opposition to the final vote."
"My support remains for the original recommendations which will guide our future legislation, and ensure Europe plays a constructive role in tackling foot and mouth disease for the future."
"My constituents expect no less."
"As a Member of the European Parliamentary Labour Party (EPLP) I will vote against this report."
"Though the report contains some useful suggestions for the avoidance of future outbreaks of FMD, it is seriously flawed in a number of important respects."
"It is factually incorrect in relation to its references to the legality of the culls, suggested breaches of animal welfare legislation, suggested breaches of environmental legislation and lapses in bio-security."
"It also, for example, states that 10 million animals were killed when farmers claimed for only 6.5 million."
"The report is so flawed that it cannot be supported."
"I very much support those measures outlined in the report which would help prevent any further outbreak of FMD which devastated farming communities across the country and in my own region of Yorkshire and the Humber."
"However, there are some aspects in the report which need clarifying."
"Firstly, the culls were carried out in accordance with legal provisions and in full consultation with the European Commission."
"Secondly, the number of animals slaughtered should reflect farmers' claims for 6.5 million - not 10 million."
"Thirdly, there have been no prosecutions for breaches of animal welfare legislation nor was any environmental harm identified by the Environmental Agency."
"Fourthly, there was no evidence of a spread of infection from carcasses during transport or by personnel."
"Given that these points were not sufficiently clarified in the vote, whilst welcoming those provisions seeking to combat any future outbreak of FMD, I decided to vote against the final vote on the report."
"I very much support the measures outlined in this report to prevent a future outbreak of foot and mouth disease on the scale experienced in the United Kingdom, and the West Midlands region I represent."
"Mr Kreissl-Dörfler's report provides important guidelines should future legislation be required to tackle a new outbreak, were it to occur anywhere across the European Union."
"I do, however, reject a number of the report's observations and conclusions which are incorrect, in particular those relating to the legality of culls, suggested breaches of animal welfare legislation, suggested breaches of environmental legislation and suggested bio-security lapses."
"Given that farmers have claimed for 6.5 million animals, I also reject the claim that 10 million were killed during the outbreak."
"Despite the many positive aspects of the report, I will vote against in the light of the above comments."
"The south east of England was one of the regions first hit by the foot and mouth outbreak in the UK."
"As such, this report outlines many of the measures necessary to prevent such an outbreak occurring on the same scale in the future."
"However, there were many discrepancies introduced by politically motivated amendments which distorted the report;"
"In particular: suggestions of breaches of animal welfare legislation."
"No prosecutions of any complaints occurred."
"Lapses in bio-security."
"Investigations proved no such lapses occurred."
"The culls were pronounced illegal."
"The courts found in favour of government action with regard to the contiguous cull."
"It was deemed a measure that was necessary to stem the spread of the disease."
"The European Commission was informed at all times."
"Breaches of environmental legislation."
"The Environment Agency looked into matter and found no environmental harm,"
"In the south east of England, Labour MEPs felt that statistical error and political misinformation have combined to produce an inaccurate picture of the outbreak and the UK Government's fight to deal with it."
". (FR) I am glad that the Kreissl-Dörfler report has been adopted by a large majority, including the important section devoted to the need to greatly increase controls on imported animals and animal products from vulnerable countries and their neighbours, which led to the disease that struck Europe in 2001."
"No control on imported products, however, could ever be as comprehensive, precise and rigorous as those applied by Member States and professional bodies themselves."
"Controls on imports will never provide the same safety guarantees as regular controls and traceability applied to national production and localised production in Europe."
"This should further encourage us to apply Community preference effectively and keep as much of our agricultural production as possible within the European Union."
"Community preference, which is laid down at the heart of our Treaties, must, in future, be our favoured means of satisfying new consumer requirements in Europe in the area of food safety."
"This is yet another reason to defend it vehemently to the WTO and ensure that our right to make imported products bear the cost of the controls we need to carry out on them is respected."
"The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, item 11 of yesterday's Minutes refers to a speech I made under Rule 121(a) of the Rules of Procedure."
"Apart from the fact that I would like to ask the Secretariat why there is no written summary of what I said, I would like to remind the House that I asked the Presidency to make firm representations to Belgian Railways on behalf of Parliament, calling upon them to reverse their worrying unilateral decision to withdraw night train No 299, that legendary train that used to connect the European Parliament's three places of work - Brussels, Luxembourg and Strasbourg - before, crossing Switzerland and arriving in Milan."
"This train has been withdrawn by a unilateral decision."
"Apart from the serious inconvenience this represents for the employees of the European Parliament, this makes things very difficult for the thousands of others travellers who often do that journey, particularly now with the approach of the end-of-year festivities."
"Since the Presidency of Parliament, responding to a similar speech by Mrs Ghilardotti at the start of the sitting of 5 September, said that they would make representations to Belgian Railways, I would like to know what was done, following both my and my fellow Member's requests, to obtain the response of Belgian Railways."
"Is there a follow-up to this type of request?"
"I would also like to know what happened to the speech I made yesterday, for I would like a written summary to be included in tomorrow's publication."
"Mr Santini, I would point out that your comments do not count as comments on the Minutes, because comments on the Minutes deal with what has been said during the sitting."
"You are repeating a request, and there is another procedure in our Rules of Procedure for obtaining this information."
"However, I myself can tell you - although I am stretching the Rules of Procedure - that Mrs Ghilardotti's request was duly communicated to the Office of the President, who will communicate it to the competent Belgian authorities."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Mr President, the annual budgetary procedure has passed off unusually smoothly."
"It is the first time in many years that it has not, for example, been necessary for us to hold a meeting of the Committee on Budgets during this last part-session in Strasbourg in order to deal with a whole lot of sticking points."
"The reason, of course, is that all the parties, no doubt partly because they all know how important it is for us to be able to demonstrate agreement prior to enlargement, have contributed to a businesslike and constructive process."
"I want to extend my thanks for the fact that this has happened, especially to the Danish Presidency and the Finance Minister, Mr Pedersen, whom I hope we shall get to see in this House on Thursday."
"He has helped guide the members of the Council to a very constructive settlement."
"I also wish to extend my thanks to the Commission and Mrs Schreyer, to my co-rapporteurs, Mr Stenmarck and Mr Colom I Naval, and to the budget rapporteurs from the other committees who have contributed very constructively to this process."
"Last but not least, I wish to thank my colleagues in the Committee on Budgets, the committee's splendid secretariat and, especially, its splendid chairman, Mr Wynn, who has supported the work throughout."
"When this process began just over a year ago, one of my objectives was to develop Parliament's own procedures, and I think we have made some progress."
"We have established a dialogue concerning objectives and guidelines at an early stage."
"We have worked closely with the other specialised committees in order to get them actively involved in the budgetary process."
"We have developed the new budgetary debate in September, something which it will certainly be possible to develop further next year."
"These are things that have worked well."
"Unfortunately, I also have to sound a critical note, not about our work on the budget but about the EU's budgetary system."
"In my opinion, the problem is the long-term budget plan and the interinstitutional agreement that set sector-by-sector budget ceilings for seven years in a row."
"That is an entirely unreasonable model."
"Such long-term and detailed planning is not possible in a modern budgetary system."
"It is reminiscent, rather, of the Soviet Union."
"Certainly, I accept budgetary discipline."
"I am a keen adherent of budget ceilings, but that model is far too rigid."
"As long as we are governed by it, we shall all constantly be looking for ways of escaping from the straitjacket of the financial perspective."
"Since the advent of the budget plan in 1999, we have used the flexibility mechanism each year to a greater or lesser extent."
"We have also developed new, ever more creative methods of achieving flexibility."
"We have an emergency reserve of which we make ever more extensive use."
"We have added the new solidarity fund, which is also a flexibility instrument."
"This year, we ourselves have introduced the systematic use of what is termed frontloading, whereby we try to find unutilised resources in the current year's budget in order to bring forward expenditure for next year and in that way give ourselves room for manoeuvre."
"This creativity has been of great help, but it is not especially open or transparent."
"There is no sound long-term budgetary methodology."
"I would therefore call upon our colleagues in the Convention really to give some thought as to how, in future treaties, we can increase Parliament's influence over the budget as a whole and, at the same time, create in the long term a less rigid model for budget ceilings which is less hostile to development."
"I am also critical of the way in which the budget has been implemented, even though we can see improvements here and there, for example when it comes to aid policy."
"It is of course unreasonable that, in 2001, we should have received back 15% of the Member States' contributions to the EU because we were unable to implement what we had decided in the budget."
"If the pace of implementation continues to be slow, there will be a risk in future years of a situation arising in which regions that have received promises of aid and candidate countries that have been given generous promises of pre-accession aid will, quite justifiably, protest when the promises are not fulfilled."
"If, however, the pace of implementation is improved and if, at a time when enlargement is making major new claims upon our resources, we are to honour the huge amount of payments that have been accumulating ahead of us, we shall instead be in danger, in future years, of encountering major problems in keeping to the budget."
"In spite of these deficiencies, I think we have a lot to be satisfied with."
"Allow me to mention just a few of the most important areas including, of course, enlargement."
"By means of the developed frontloading model, we have been able to supply the Commission with those resources it needs, for example for the 500 new jobs required for enlargement."
"I am certain that my fellow MEP, Mr Stenmarck, will talk more about this as it relates to the budgets for Parliament and the other institutions. Enlargement has, however, also made its mark on other areas."
"The major new resources in terms of information will have bearing upon enlargement."
"A range of different bodies receiving aid from the EU are now investing those resources in integrating the new countries."
"We are concerned here with the social dialogue, youth cooperation, the combined fight against crime etc."
"We have also launched a new pilot project for cooperation between small companies and involving both the candidate countries and the countries along the EU's new external border - Russia, the Balkan countries, North Africa etc. I believe that, of all that we have achieved, this is the most important."
"Allow me also to mention the EU's efforts in the fight against poverty and disease in the developing countries."
"Even if I personally am disappointed that we have not brought about clearer changes in agricultural policy, that being probably the most important thing we could have done in the fight against poverty, I am nonetheless pleased that we can make other sound contributions."
"I know that there is some criticism of the fact that we have reduced the appropriations to food aid and humanitarian aid."
"We have, however, done this partly in order to be able to bring forward aid to the famine-hit Horn of Africa, and partly in order to be able to free up resources for Afghanistan next year."
"That has been done only on condition that we and the Council promise to supply the extra resources that may be required for these purposes next year."
"We have also been criticised for the way in which we deal with the EU's contribution to the Global Health Fund."
"It is criticism that I consider to be unfair."
"We have prevailed upon the Council to more than double the amount it proposed in its first reading, from EUR 20 million to EUR 42 million."
"We have also got the Council to promise to try to produce a corresponding sum from the European Development Fund."
"We have, finally, a joint promise in any case to contribute those resources that are required if the EU is to be able to retain its place in the management of the fund."
"More than that I do not in actual fact think it is reasonable to demand."
"Finally, we have also achieved a very constructive settlement concerning Parliament's future role in foreign and security policy, and that is something I believe we are all satisfied with."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this budget will not be an historic one because of any dramatic conflicts or major new revolutionary budget initiatives."
"It will, however, be historic because it is the last budget with the old budgetary terminology."
"Next year, we shall all be forced to teach ourselves activity-based budgeting."
"It will also be historic because it is the last budget relating to an EU with 15 Member States."
"I am, above all, very pleased that we have, with such broad political agreement, in actual fact come up with those solutions required in order to prepare for enlargement."
"That, I believe, is the greatest success of this year."
"Mr President, we are now at the end of a comprehensive process of producing a budget for future budgetary years, and I should like to thank everyone who has contributed to this work."
"That applies, of course, to the Committee on Budgets and, especially, to its chairman, Mr Wynn, and to my Swedish co-rapporteur, Mr Färm, but it applies above all to the Committee on Budgets' very competent secretariat."
"I also wish to extend a big thank you to both the Commission and the Council for their constructive cooperation, with special thanks also going to the Danish Presidency for having actively helped the EU's two budgetary authorities jointly to arrive at the framework for category 5 at a conciliation on 19 July of this year, something I believe to have been very important."
"Throughout the current year, the EU's administrative budget, otherwise known as category 5, has been one of those areas that has posed genuine problems for the budget."
"We began the year with significant anticipated deficits for the 2003 budget."
"By various stages, these were subsequently reduced, giving us a manageable surplus and what I deem to be a wholly acceptable margin for the next budgetary year."
"Within this budget, we have also managed to implement those priorities we set as early as when the guidelines were drawn up at the beginning of the year."
"The obvious top priority of all at that time was enlargement."
"Through the decisions subsequently made, we know that the Member States, notably through the positive decision taken at the Copenhagen Summit, are complying with their commitments regarding ten new Member States."
"If the agreement is signed in March, we shall be able to have 147 observers from all these countries in place by no later than April."
"The necessary decisions will have been taken and implemented by then."
"What we have also been concerned with is giving each institution the opportunity to complete its preparations for enlargement."
"This issue acquires further significance when we now consider the fortunate decision from Copenhagen."
"Allow me to extend my thanks to all the institutions for having actively participated in this work and, especially, for the great loyalty they have all shown towards enlargement and the European project within the framework of the frontloading operation we have conducted together."
"The second priority was to implement necessary reforms."
"These were necessary with or without enlargement, especially for the European Parliament."
"The main concern was with those key areas on which every parliament, be it national or European, must stand firm."
"For the European Parliament, it was a question of strengthening the budgetary structure, meaning, in the main, not the Committee on Budgets but, rather, the other committees in the extraordinarily important budgetary work they do."
"Parliament's legislative function must also be strengthened."
"In a very short time, Parliament has been given significant legislative power, meaning that the basic conditions under which Parliament operates within this area must also be strengthened."
"These are key areas for the European Parliament, and it is precisely in these areas that we must stand especially firm."
"The third priority is to tackle all this successfully."
"It is a question of coping both with the preparations prior to enlargement and with the commitment to the necessary reforms and of doing these things within the stated budgetary framework."
"We have succeeded in doing this."
"It means that we are now entering a new budget year with a fairly broad margin which will hopefully amount to slightly more than EUR 20 million."
"That applies on condition that Parliament approve the oral amendment which I know my fellow MEP, Mr Färm will table and to which I would in this way like to give my support."
"Allow me to point out that I am conscious of the fact that the Council wishes to see a still greater margin."
"I fully understand why that is so, and I promised at a conciliation to see what I could do to bring about a still greater margin."
"I subsequently went through the whole budget again, and we have now got this far but, unfortunately, no farther."
"Allow me to conclude by observing that this is the last budget the European Parliament will adopt before enlargement to include ten new Member States."
"It has been important to implement all this in a way that means that the preparations for enlargement can be made in all the institutions."
"In my judgment, this is possible."
"It has also been important to make a number of decisions during the year to cope with long-term problems in category 5."
"It is my judgment that we have done this, moreover, but it is important for this work to be followed up."
"Further decisions along these lines will be necessary during the forthcoming budget year."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the EU's budget for 2003 is indeed a presentable one."
"It is a shining example of how a budget can be successfully drawn up in such a way as to make the greatest possible savings whilst at the same time allocating sufficient funds to priority areas and to new tasks."
"This frugal and forward-looking budget has resulted from good cooperation such as one can only dream of - with Parliament, and with the rapporteurs."
"I can do no other than express my utmost appreciation to Mr Färm and Mr Stenmarck."
"My warm thanks, on behalf of the Commission, for this terrific cooperation go also to Mr Colom i Naval and of course to Mr Wynn, the committee's chairman, as well as to the Committee on Budgets as a whole."
"I am, naturally, also grateful to the Council."
"In saying this, I want to highlight the purposeful way in which negotiations were handled, preventing us from being bogged down in any single area, or even in what might have been matters of merely secondary importance, so that, on the contrary, we always proceeded with negotiations with their ultimate purpose in mind."
"The appropriations for commitments in the 2003 Budget amount to EUR 99.69 billion, which can be used in entering into new commitments on the EU's behalf."
"That adds up to an increase of only 0.26% over against this year."
"I would like to see anyone else do the same!"
"EUR 97.5 billion have been allocated to payments for the coming year, representing an increase of 1.9% over the current year, and thus below the rate of inflation."
"Expressed as a percentage of the EU's gross domestic product, only 1.02% is being spent on the EU Budget for 2003 - the lowest it has been for ten years."
"The financial planning voted in 1999 provided EUR 103 billion for 2003, that being EUR 5 billion more than the 2003 Budget has now actually required."
"It is now a matter of certainty, ladies and gentlemen, that the 2003 Budget will be the last EU Budget for an EU of 15 Member States."
"I would like to congratulate the Danish Presidency of the Council on the result achieved at Copenhagen, but I must also take this opportunity to thank Mr Böge, Parliament's rapporteur on the financing of enlargement, for his support over the past year and a half."
"The financial package did indeed take a long time to prepare, and, as Commissioner for the Budget, I am proud and, of course, glad that what was concluded at Copenhagen is so close to what the Commission proposed in January."
"Copenhagen really has now sent out the message that it is time for all the EU's institutions to roll their sleeves up."
"Now is the time to reach all the interinstitutional agreements, so that our institutions can make these changes effectively."
"Of the new posts, 236 will be allocated to the Council for the purpose of this preparation, whilst 500 will be allocated to the Commission."
"On the Commission's behalf, I want to thank the budgetary authority for this decision."
"As regards where the Commission will be allocating these posts, 59 of them will be in the area of competition, 53 in agriculture, 56 in the Structural Funds, 10 in OLAF, 69 in the languages service and 60 in the Publications Office."
"All of these are areas in which it is clear that the acquis must be applied from day one, and preparations must be made for this."
"It has also finally been decided how much by way of funds will be allocated to the new States in the years from 2004 to 2006; these will amount to EUR 10 billion for agricultural policy and EUR 21 billion for structural aid."
"These are large sums of money, and their implementation must of course be well prepared."
"Parliament and the Council have welcomed the further policy priorities for the 2003 Budget, which are 'stability and security' and 'sustainable and inclusive economic development'."
"These priorities are reflected in the 2003 Budget, in that the budget for DG Environment increases by 14%, and resources are allocated specifically to enhancing the competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises in border regions."
"The budget for DG Research and the Joint Research Centre totals EUR 3 billion for 2003, which underlines the importance of sustainable and inclusive economic development."
"The 'stability and security' priority has to do with measures in the area of justice and home affairs - my fellow-Commissioner Mr Vitorino's budget is increasing by 11% - and in the area of foreign policy."
"The EU Budget will, in the coming year, bear the joint costs of the Police Mission in Bosnia."
"This is an important step towards a common foreign and security policy."
"We are continuing to stand by our promises and by the policy commitments we have made in the Balkan region."
"I believe it has to be emphasised that a large budget has been proposed, standing at over EUR 680 million in 2003, and this is for the fourth time running."
"Afghanistan can count on a high level of support from the EU, and the Global Health Fund will again receive substantial resources for its fight against Aids, tuberculosis and malaria."
"In these areas, Europe is indeed the largest donor."
"This year, ladies and gentlemen, we have set up the new Solidarity Fund for aid in cases of major natural catastrophes in the Member States and in the candidate countries."
"In future, it will be funded to the tune of EUR 1 billion every year, and that includes 2003."
"As a whole, the balance sheet for work on budget policy in 2002 is an extremely favourable one."
"A completely new Financial Regulation covers the EU's Budget, as also the European Development Fund and the other facilities."
"Today, the Commission adopted in its entirety the rules for implementing this Financial Regulation."
"This means that the reform of financial management exists not only on paper; it governs the activities of all those who work with European resources, so that the 2003 Budget will be the first to be implemented according to the new rules of the new Financial Regulation."
"As I have already emphasised, the 2003 Budget is the last for an EU of 15 Member States."
"We now have to adapt the Financial Perspective to the Copenhagen conclusions, in order to draw up the 2004 Budget for an EU of 25 Member States."
"As early as February, we will be holding a trialogue to discuss the ongoing adaptations, and by then, it is to be hoped that there will be greater clarity about the future of Northern Cyprus."
"Pre-accession aid for Bulgaria and Romania is then to be replenished, and the budget for pre-accession aid is then to include Turkey."
"That is what the Copenhagen Council decided."
"So it is that the budget reflects the dynamics of European development."
"I look forward to cooperating on these issues for the future, being sure that we will find good solutions to them, as we found the right solutions for the budget for 2003."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, compared with those we had to handle in previous years, the budget procedure for 2003 was indeed a very pleasant one, for which I would like to express warm thanks to both the rapporteurs, Mr Färm and Mr Stenmarck."
"It has thus become established practice for us to favour Scandinavian earnestness in the budget procedure, and the fact that we additionally had the Danes presiding over the Council, meant that we could find our way around many cliffs at an early stage and make the procedure very harmonious, especially at second reading stage."
"I believe that to be deserving of particular mention."
"In the PPE-DE Group, we are very proud of the way we were able to join with our colleagues from the other groups in putting across a multitude of our concerns, and it goes without saying that we are asking you, Commissioner, to support us accordingly."
"I will say, very clearly, here and now, that there is little point in this Parliament, with the Council, laboriously drawing up a budget, only for many things of particular importance to both parts of the budgetary authority not to be reflected in daily life when the budget ends up being passed into law."
"If you are talking about the budget figures for 2003, with the minimal increase that we all greatly welcome and support, then honesty requires of us that we add that it took a large number of measures on our part in order for these slight growth rates to be made possible, as the 2002 Budget was not passed in the form in which it was drawn up."
"Here I am thinking of what our technical jargon so splendidly terms frontloading measures, that is, the use of funds from 2002 to discharge commitments which will be incumbent on us only in the coming year, hence the transfer of resources allocated by way of the Solidarity Fund, from the 2002 Budget to 2003."
"Add all that together, plus the expected supplementary budget, and it all amounts to a tidy few billions."
"Honesty demands that we say that."
"What helps to finance next year's low level of increase is the fact that we are transferring funds from the 2002 Budget that were used either wrongly or irregularly."
"We in the PPE-DE Group would like to expressly call upon the Commission not to let up in the area of its own reform."
"We look forward with eager anticipation to the reports we have been promised by Commissioner Neil Kinnock, who is responsible for these matters, which we will examine in very great depth in order, of course, to consider what further measures we can derive from them."
"One thing I consider to have been a great success - something that the PPE-DE played a part in initiating, and which, thankfully, was taken up by other Members of this House - is the marked improvement on the question of cooperation between the Council and Parliament in defining foreign policy measures."
"I think that the procedure we came up with here is suited to overcoming the democratic deficit that we find in the Council's intergovernmental relations due to the national parliaments no longer being responsible and the European Parliament not yet being involved."
"The dialogue procedure that we have agreed on with the Council builds a bridge leading to greater democracy in the definition of Europe's foreign policy objectives."
"I consider it a great success on our part to have succeeded in securing the promises of aid for Afghanistan for 2003 as well, but I do think - and this has been discussed here on many occasions - that it is not acceptable for Europe's foreign ministers to keep on coming up with new things to focus on, so that the old priorities suddenly become redundant, and we have the laborious task of setting it all out in figures."
"We have had a quite respectable success in combining new challenges and old commitments in a good compromise for 2003, for which a heartfelt thank-you to all who helped to make that possible!"
"I do think that this is, as a whole, a respectable Budget, and I again ask the Commission to see to it that what was decided by the Council and Parliament is also implemented in 2003."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is these speeches that remind us how close together we have been this year when dealing with specialised issues, as I believe that we are almost always discussing the same topics in this House, the very same ones that we are outlining now."
"I cannot, of course, stay out of this either, but I want to say something now, something to which the European public might perhaps be more determined to pay attention than it has been on repeated occasions over the past few years."
"Commissioner Schreyer referred to the rate of increase in the budget's commitments, which stands at 0.26%."
"Our budget does not show the rates of increase - let alone the rates of inflation - that were provided for in Berlin."
"We are well below them."
"In Berlin, the precaution was taken of creating a margin in order to make enlargement possible and easier."
"With a 0.26% increase, our present budgetary conduct brings us another step closer to that."
"Take a look at payments, and the figure of 1.9% does not, at first sight, appear to be very much."
"It is substantially less than what would be needed to reduce the debts that are still outstanding."
"Despite that, 1.9% is more than what is currently available to many national Finance Ministers to draw up their own budgets."
"Nonetheless, we stick with this 1.9%, because it is important."
"We have to consider this budget, and what it covers, as a whole."
"We have a budget of less than EUR 100 billion!"
"That is 25% less than what the fifteen States of the European Union spend on defence."
"What we get for 25% less - in other words, for EUR 100 billion - is cooperation across Europe on environmental matters, in the field of research and development, and on cohesion, so that we do not leave the more vulnerable in the lurch."
"Agriculture is wholly europeanised, and preparations are being made for youth exchange activities."
"We are preparing for enlargement, we have a common foreign and security policy, and we collaborate on justice and home affairs."
"I believe that it has to be said loud and clear that we spend substantially less on all of these things, so as to give Europe a viable and peaceful future, than is spent at national level in the area of defence policy alone."
"Even though we have this tight budget and even though we have to take on new things with every passing year - as has already been said, there are new tasks in category IV almost every year - we nevertheless manage to set priorities that advance the economic development of the continent of Europe."
"Not only do we maintain and sustain a continent full of large corporations, but also the small and medium-sized enterprises on this European continent can make use of the opportunities offered by a shared internal market."
"They do not have their own departments to deal with tax or legal matters; what they need, in order to make the best use of this European internal market, with all its advantages, is help, and that is what we give."
"We respond to the ageing of society in the European Union."
"Our own financial planning still needs to take this more into account."
"I have already made repeated reference to pensions, but we want in future to respond to the ageing of European society as a whole."
"One very major priority has been and still is category IV."
"I read a newspaper report today, which stated that the European Parliament did not regard the fight against Aids as important."
"Let me point out now that Parliament has quadrupled the sum of money originally proposed to be allocated for this purpose."
"Anyone who claims that we do not attach enough importance to this has no idea what he is talking about."
"I would like again to emphatically underline the great progress that this year's budget procedure has enabled us to make."
"I can follow on seamlessly from where Mr Ferber left off."
"There are parliamentary gaps that we need to close in this area, gaps that have to do with the monitoring of policies that are being moved from the national to the European level, and we are finding out where they are."
"We have managed to achieve a joint declaration with the Council, which makes considerable progress precisely in the area of security and defence policy, making it clear to the public that the European Parliament has no room for manoeuvre on European policies at European level."
"These are matters that will have to be resolved in the Convention, that really need to be organised elsewhere."
"Even so, we have already tackled them."
"Mrs Schreyer, you have already acted as if all of this were already in the bag."
"We will of course scrutinise the Copenhagen conclusions, but what is in any case clear is that this is not just an issue to be resolved in Copenhagen by the Council, but one that we should be discussing among ourselves in this House."
"Although our attitude is very positive, your dogmatic 'and so it was decided' is something I cannot leave unchallenged."
"That can only be said when discussions have gone well and been concluded."
"I wish to thank all of my fellow Members of this House, especially the two rapporteurs and the President, who has been patient enough to allow me an extra thirty seconds."
"Mr President, Commissioner, firstly, I should like to congratulate the rapporteurs for the budget, Göran Färm and Per Stenmarck, for their excellent work, as well as Terence Wynn, Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, for his leadership on that committee."
"I also want to thank Denmark's chairmen in the Council for their cooperation, which was excellent, and Commissioner Michaele Schreyer for her excellent input."
"Next year's European Union budget is a disciplined budget."
"The increase in expenditure is below inflation, at just 1.9%."
"This represents an outstanding gesture of support by the European Parliament to help Member States balance their national budgets."
"It also demonstrates responsibility on the part of the EU, while Member States try to meet the requirements of its Stability and Growth Pact."
"The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party supports this aim, although it partly undermines the EU's long-term attempt to balance its economy, as the EU's biggest budget worry this time is outstanding commitments."
"At present these stand at EUR 103 billion, which is to say, more than the entire budget for one year."
"There has been an increase in arrears of EUR 17 billion since the start of the year, with no limit to this in sight."
"The situation is at its most wretched in the area of structural operations, where outstanding commitments have grown over the year by EUR 13 billion."
"The most difficult situation, relatively speaking, however, is in the area of pre-accession aid, where EUR 8.5 billion in outstanding commitments has accrued in three years, with just under EUR 2 billion being paid out in actual aid."
"What is most vexing is that there would have been funds available for payment in respect of these commitments, but they were not used."
"Consequently, the situation betrays administrative inefficiency, with the Commission and the Member States as the guilty parties."
"That is why Commission reform is extremely important."
"At the moment the Commission is very conservative and shirks its responsibilities."
"We should also simplify legal instruments and procedures, as was agreed in conciliation with the Council in the summer."
"Enlargement is the hallmark of next year's budget."
"This budget is the last to be drafted for an EU consisting of 15 Member States."
"Parliament safeguarded the posts needed in the Commission for enlargement by amassing resources partly out of this year's budget."
"In this way we were able to meet next year's expenditure in advance and fit administrative expenditure into the tight framework in place for heading 5."
"My group supports this."
"Otherwise, we could say of the budget's content that the EU's functions are adequately financed."
"Agricultural expenditure is under control, so there is no need for significant reforms for budgetary reasons."
"External actions were able to be partly financed in advance out of this year's budget, and there was no need to look again at Parliament's priorities."
"In addition to other actions, we were able to improve the financing of the Northern Dimension a little, which has to be considered a good thing."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start, if I may, by congratulating this year's two rapporteurs, Mr Färm and Mr Stenmarck, on their excellent work."
"The 2003 budget has not been a simple budget, nor has it been easy in political terms."
"Indeed, it is a budget in which there is tension between demands which absolutely have to be met now, such as the financing of the administrative expenditure to prepare for enlargement, and political priorities such as support for Afghanistan."
"There is tension between commitments which must be made good, such as the funding of the restructuring of the Portuguese and Spanish fleets - on which, at last, we appear to have reached agreement - and new urgent measures, such as the need to fund the European Union's participation in the Global Health Fund."
"It is a budget which, in my view, suffers throughout from the failure to revise the Financial Perspective established in 1999 at Berlin: a Financial Perspective which I believe is now inadequate and can only become politically more unacceptable in the coming years."
"Nor can the - albeit significant - results achieved in conciliation in November lead to any lasting change in the situation."
"For example, the joint declaration whereby the Council undertakes to consult Parliament before taking any decision which might involve financial commitments in the field of common foreign and security policy is, over and above any possible objections, an important milestone, a further step towards the full involvement of the European Parliament in a strategic sector, towards the development of a more powerful, more secure Union."
"That, however, does not change the fact that the Heading 4 ceiling is still too low, not to say stiflingly low."
"What will we do when the Council asks us to authorise it to make a financial commitment because of new international political developments?"
"Will we refuse to give it the authorisation on the grounds that there are not enough funds or will we accept the challenge and undertake to find the money, somehow, somewhere?"
"Now, for example, we have to find funds for the problems in Galicia."
"What would we have done, for example, in the case of Afghanistan?"
"What would we have done in the case of the Balkans?"
"Not to mention Heading 3. Indeed, the European Union's commitments increase every year in the field of internal policy too."
"With every passing year, there are new, costly multiannual programmes of huge political import which, as such, must be processed and adhered to."
"What, however, will we do when there is no longer a margin for any political initiative that Parliament might want to set in motion?"
"What will we do when the distinction between compulsory expenditure and non-compulsory expenditure is reduced to a distinction between expenditure on which Parliament does not have the ultimate say and expenditure which Parliament cannot alter for fear that the European institutions will lose face?"
"And that is just to mention two headings."
"I therefore call upon all the Members to make representations to their delegations and to their governments to ensure that the situation is avoided where, subsequently, when all is said and done, everything we have planned for in this budget, in this conciliation, is frustrated because of lack of resources, and to ensure that it becomes the joint objective of each one of us, irrespective of our political affiliation."
"Mr President, I too, like Mr van Dam, would like to focus on a specific budget line, not least because, as a member of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, I have been able to follow the matter closely."
"The line in question is line B7-6310: 'North-South cooperation schemes in the campaign against drug abuse'."
"First the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, then the Committee on Budgets and, finally, the plenary, by a unanimous vote, decided to block the new appropriations and place the payment appropriations in the reserve because, in Parliament's opinion, this budget line did not have a legal basis."
"It did not have a legal basis because the Commission should have presented to Parliament an evaluation of the measures financed by the Community under this line as far back as October 2000 and proposed a new regulation."
"Instead, for at least two financial years, this line has been financed with no legal basis."
"Immediately after the vote in plenary, the Commission told the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets that, in effect, this line did not have a legal basis, which was the opposite of what the Commissioner had repeatedly stated in response to Parliamentary questions, to the effect that it was a line financed according to a quite precise legal basis and that the fact that the evaluation had not taken place did not mean that it could not continue to be financed."
"We were then told that there had actually been an evaluation."
"This evaluation, which ought to have concerned the Regulation of 21 October 1997 and would have been submitted to Parliament in July 2002, certainly never reached the Secretariat of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights."
"I succeeded, with some difficulty, in unearthing it."
"It is a final report of 9 May 2002, which, if we had had the time, the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights could indeed have assessed, possibly avoiding this situation, avoiding what is happening now with the new budget, which has led the Commission, Parliament and the Council jointly to release the appropriations in reserve now that there does appear to be an evaluation."
"Apart from the cover and the title, this is an evaluation which focuses principally on the 1990s and concerns North-South cooperation in the fight against drugs and drug abuse, which is only partly related to the Regulation published on 21 October 1997."
"What is more, the evaluation concentrates on all the measures undertaken in the previous years while still failing to state clearly what happened with this Regulation during those three years."
"The evaluation clearly reveals that, in the past three years, the majority of the measures have been undertaken together with and through the United Nations agency, under the direction of Mr Arlacchi."
"We have been calling for years for this Commission to investigate the actions which the United Nations itself had recognised as not transparent and, furthermore, as running counter to the financial regulation."
"President Prodi himself had taken upon himself the responsibility of ascertaining what the United Nations recognised."
"None of this happened, and now we are blithely refinancing this budget line when we have financed it every year for years, without a legal basis, for dubious operations of which, even now, the Commission is unable or unwilling to provide a proper evaluation."
"Mr President, like other speakers this afternoon, I welcome the successful conclusion of this budget process."
"It is certainly one of the most peaceful that I have known and my congratulations on the excellent work done by our two rapporteurs."
"There are in any budget process successes and failures."
"We in our political group, as Mr Ferber has indicated, feel we have had more successes than failures in this budget process."
"Three issues stand out, and I would like to mention them."
"The first refers to the improvement of the quality of budget execution."
"We insisted from the beginning that we should pick up on the Commission, Council and Parliament declaration of December 2000, specifically looking to reduce outstanding commitments to a normal level by December 2003."
"To that effect, we suggested the appropriations for staff should be put in the reserve."
"As a result, we are now promised a document for the PDB 2004 setting out how we are going to eliminate abnormal outstanding commitments by the end of 2003."
"I think that we have some way to go, but this is a step in the right direction."
"Secondly, so far as appropriate involvement of Parliament in CFSP measures is concerned, what concerned us most was to how to get Parliament fully involved in consultation and information on how the monies will be spent by the Council."
"For that purpose, we withheld money in the reserve at first reading, so that we could have a proper negotiation with the Council on second reading."
"And now we have a joint declaration in accordance with the Interinstitutional Agreement, setting up for the first time a way in which Parliament will be fully involved in consultation and information, including in political dialogue on the CFSP."
"We also have put funds into the budget so that the Commission can come forward with a study establishing CFSP priorities over the next five years."
"I very much hope that this study will be completed."
"Last and not least is the question of successful implementation of the Commission reforms."
"For my group, this is an essential point."
"We therefore suggested that we should have some overall view of this and, for that purpose, on first reading, we put 500 staff into the reserve - the additional posts requested."
"Lo and behold, as a result of this, we now have a comprehensive report which I was just discussing with my colleagues - including Commissioner Kinnock this morning - observing that progress has indeed been made."
"But we would like it more widely known that progress has been made, but there are other methods under discussion in the Council at the moment and decisions to be taken before we face the electorate again in June 2004."
"Therefore, I think that on these three items, the 2003 budget has been a success."
"We had a strategy and we had some muscle enabling us to achieve that, by withholding monies or posts so that action could be taken."
"We must be vigilant over the next few months and ensure that progress continues to be made on these three items because none of them has been fully resolved in this 2003 budget."
"But it is thanks to Parliament's powers and the determination of our political group to use them that we have made progress on those three items so far."
"I end with a word of warning: current proposals in the European Convention seem to be aiming to restrict Parliament's power in the budgetary procedure - we should make sure that this does not happen."
"Mr President, since we are congratulating ourselves - everyone has made very complimentary speeches about the role of the Committee on Budgets - I am reminded of a story once told to me by Vice-President Schmid."
"A former chairman of the Committee on Budgets and a former general rapporteur went on a skiing holiday."
"Whilst they were out skiing they had an accident: they fell down a deep ravine."
"They were stuck and could not get out."
"Twenty-four hours later, people realised they were missing and they sent out a search party."
"When the search party reached the ravine, it looked down and saw these two figures."
"They shouted down: 'Are you from the Budgets Committee?'"
"They replied: 'Yes, we are!'"
"They shouted back: 'We are from the Red Cross.'"
"The reply came: 'We have no money'."
"That is the image that most people have of the Committee on Budgets."
"However, with this budget we have been extremely kind to virtually everybody who has come along."
"Anyone who has been involved in this procedure knows about the faxes, e-mails, telephone calls and the knocks on the door as attempts are made to lobby for anything that can be gained from this budget."
"However, on this occasion the rapporteurs have worked extremely well to ensure that the priorities of the committees, the different political groups and those with outside interests who have lobbied effectively are taken on board."
"We have a budget which reflects considerable good will on the part of this Parliament."
"In fact, there is so much good will that, as I said in committee, we have too much money in the budget, especially in some areas in category 4 where the money will not be spent."
"However, it is there, and it has been achieved through the good work of the rapporteurs and the committee and through our joint efforts with the Council and the Commission."
"It must be said that there have been a good deal of firsts in this budgetary process, not least because of the attitude of the Danish Presidency."
"We have all congratulated them, and they have worked exceptionally hard to ensure that we finally have a budget of which we can all be proud."
"There is normally considerable lobbying at this final stage, but not on this occasion."
"The very few instances of lobbying we have encountered concern one or two lines relating to category 4."
"Our negotiations in the conciliation with the Council and the Commission have actually proved fruitful."
"In category 4, every single amendment requested by the committees has been delivered, except on those lines concerned with ECHO - we are convinced that the money can be found - and the Global Health Fund."
"We do not have the EUR 80 million that was requested, but we have EUR 42 million from the general budget and a guarantee that the European Union will have a seat on the board of the Global Health Fund."
"From that point of view, it is quite good."
"However, the one message that needs to be conveyed, amidst all these congratulations, is how the money will be utilised throughout next year, because our weakness in this Parliament is that we do not monitor how the money is being spent."
"Mr Ferber urged the Commission and the Council to ensure that the money is well spent."
"It is our job as well, and the committees in this Parliament have to ensure that they are monitoring month in and month out."
"The last thing we want is a 15% return to the Member States at the end of the day, which is what happened this year when we gave back EUR 15 billion."
"The Member States are happy about that, but it is not good budgetary practice."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, I too want to join in the delight that has been expressed today in many quarters concerning the constructive way in which the budgetary negotiations have proceeded."
"To outsiders, the effusive way in which we are praising each other may appear odd, but the mutual trust, openness and integrity that has characterised the budgetary negotiations this year inspires confidence that shortening and simplifying the budgetary process along the lines being worked on in the Convention is something that can be done easily and that we can continue the work on ensuring that the budget appears as a political document with clear political priorities."
"This process will in any case be clearer by next year when we change over to activity-based budgeting and so hopefully remove something of the mystique surrounding the language used in the budget."
"It will be easier for all of us to see the economic and political priorities in the budget."
"Good results were achieved in this year's budget, and I want firstly to point out that, for 2003, we found the money to prepare for enlargement to include ten countries in 2004."
"Without exceeding the agreed financial framework, EU legislation must be translated into the languages of the new Member States, and staff from the new countries must be appointed."
"I think that Parliament has made its contribution to that process."
"Secondly, we found the money for rebuilding Afghanistan and, thirdly, we were given clear pledges by the Council of better cooperation and scrutiny when it came to the funding of the common foreign and security policy."
"It is important, indeed it is in everyone's interest, that there should be no recesses of the budget outside parliamentary control."
"Mr President, as I have already had occasion to point out, the exercises in financial engineering that the current budgetary process has required have once again demonstrated the precariousness of the Community financial framework and, consequently, the need for it to be revised and adapted."
"It is well known that the financial framework decided on in Berlin is clearly inadequate for dealing with the costs of enlargement, the increased requirements of economic and social cohesion and, at the same time, for responding to the new priorities arising in the meantime, particularly for internal and external policies."
"Revising the financial perspectives would therefore be the most appropriate course of action."
"Or, in the absence of such a revision, the legitimate and full use of all the budgetary prerogatives granted to the European Parliament under the Treaties could have constituted a lesser evil, thereby avoiding the games involving redistribution and cuts to which we have become accustomed, often at the expense of previously set priorities and objectives."
"I am thinking, in particular, about one area that has suffered more than most: cooperation and development policy."
"In fact, under the current framework and in light of the new priorities that have arisen in the meantime - Kosovo, Afghanistan, as well as Palestine and the pre-accession funds for Turkey or even the Global Health Fund - compressing appropriations intended for the poorest countries has become an inevitability."
"This compression of funds is now being extended to food aid, to cooperation with Latin America, the Balkans and to the MEDA Programme."
"Nevertheless, as a result of all the advances, transfers, reserves and non-execution, not even the budgetary decisions adopted have been implemented. This is the case now of the EUR 55 million intended specifically for Afghanistan."
"We are also seeing an attempt to include the funding of the Global Health Fund within the European Development Fund without even consulting the target countries of the EDF and to their detriment."
"All of this is happening because the principle of sufficiency of means, according to which new priorities should be given new financial means, is not being observed."
"A revision of the upper ceiling for the financial perspectives was clearly needed under category 4, which concerns external policies."
"The issue becomes even more clear and urgent, however, if we consider the fact that the volume of payment expenditure being proposed for adoption represents an increase in 2003 of only 1.9%, in other words, lower than the expected level of inflation, which will lead to a real reduction in the payments budget."
"As a matter of fact, this budget for 2003 will become, in relative terms, and in terms of the criteria of the Stability Pact, the lowest in the last decade, representing only 1.02% or less of Community GDP."
"It makes no sense to seek to achieve more and more Europe and at the same time, wish to adopt an increasingly low budget."
"Having said this, I should like to add a positive note, with regard to East Timor."
"I welcome the results that have been achieved, both by maintaining a specific budget line, something for which I have always fought, and by increasing this line by EUR 6 million more than the Council proposal."
"This sends a positive political sign to a country and a population that gained independence only recently and which are still experiencing considerable difficulties and this brings together, as a matter of fact, the various decisions that we have adopted on this matter."
"I wish lastly, to say a couple of words about Palestine: given the tragic situation currently facing that country, we must respond to the situation next year by establishing a line and sufficient appropriations, specifically to recuperate the investments that the European Union has made there."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we are not satisfied with the budget as it concerns agriculture."
"Our proposals were not taken on board, although the Council made us a few small concessions, but our essential demand for a new institutional agreement in order to be able to transfer surplus funds from the first pillar to the second, has not been met, the belief being that things simply cannot be done that way."
"We now note with astonishment that the exact opposite happened in Copenhagen, in that funds were, with a stroke of the pen, transferred from rural development in the second pillar in order to make room for funds to be disbursed as direct payments."
"I have to say that I find this scandalous."
"We in Parliament drafted a resolution expressing our opposition to direct payments and to their being transferred to the new Member States of the EU, and also stating that we take it as read that payments as a whole will not be affected, but that this is being done by way of support for rural development, that is, in the second pillar."
"That has not been complied with."
"The Brussels conclusions imposed a financial cap that does not exhaust the possibilities offered by Berlin."
"No cap was imposed on the financing of the second development, and we had hoped that this would mean that reform could include Parliament within the second pillar, enabling it to participate in these areas and enabling progress to be made with the second pillar."
"But if a Council decision takes the funds, agreement to which had been reached in this House by a great deal of effort, and transfers them back to a development that we do not want, that, Commissioner, is not in accordance with Parliament's intentions."
"I therefore take the view that this cannot be approved in this way, that we will have to deal with it in the negotiations on the next Budget, and that we very definitely expect the European Convention to make codecision applicable in matters of agricultural policy both as regards its substance and also what are termed the mandatory funds."
"Rather than, in the long term, putting up with the Council shifting things hither and thither as it pleases, we want to be able to vote on the budget and decide these matters for ourselves."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs for their work on the EU budget for 2003 which now stands at almost EUR 100 billion."
"Nearly EUR 44.8 billion is due to be allocated to the common agricultural policy next year and I very much welcome the support that the European Union is giving to agriculture in general."
"It is recognition by all the key EU institutions of the political importance of assisting farmers, their families and the rural communities in which they live."
"We must continue to invest in ensuring that we have an economically viable European agricultural system."
"That is why I am particularly satisfied that in the context of broader EU budgetary policies, the EU leaders are making provision to safeguard the viability of the common agricultural policy now and into the future."
"I am also encouraged by the spin on regional funds in Europe which will amount to EUR 33.98 billion and I am particularly pleased that this is going to be spent in areas like my own region, Connacht/Ulster in Ireland."
"These funds will alleviate the obvious infrastructural deficit that occurs in regions like mine and indeed in other regions that are lagging behind in Europe."
"Mr President, representatives of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Wynn's joke would have been much better if instead of members of the Committee on Budgets we had been Finance Ministers."
"Apart from that, you have made us all laugh just the same."
"We are pleased today because the Färm and Stenmarck reports have brought consensus to this House."
"They have also brought consensus to our relations with the Council and have responded as far as possible to the Commission's fair demands."
"In summary, we believe that the Nordic dimension has been very beneficial to the interests of the European Union and therefore today we are debating the draft budget for 2003 in a situation which those of us with long budgetary experience could describe as exceptionally calm."
"The almost EUR 100 000 million we are going to approve is of little quantitative significance in terms of the Union's economy, but its relative importance is very great because, let us not forget, what both politicians and citizens understand by Europe is there, in those scant EUR 100 000 million."
"The final consensus, however, for which we have so much to thank the Danish Presidency, which was so willing to hold discussions, does not hide the fact that there are still thorns in the sides of Parliament."
"I will comment on a couple of them: firstly - and other speakers have said this - the real budgetary power of this House is diminishing all the time."
"When we are not talking about obligatory expenditure, we are talking about multi-annual programmes or privileged expenditure or amending budgets."
"The percentage of the Community budget not subject to the direct control and decisions of this Parliament increases every year."
"Within the proposals my group is making to the Convention, those dealing with changing this situation stand out."
"A representative Parliament must decide on all expenditure."
"Codecision must be generalised, without thereby jeopardising agricultural and structural spending which must be guaranteed."
"Above all, I believe it is a political mistake to translate the way in which budgetary austerity is carried out in the Member States to the Union's budget, and there are two reasons for this: firstly, because budgetary restrictions are being applied to a Community budget which by its very nature does not have the capacity for indebtedness."
"It is understandable that a national government which wants to, or which must, comply with the Stability Pact has to act on its public deficit and, if possible, achieve zero deficit, but to apply these annual rates of budgetary growth of less than 2% per annum to the Union's budget leads to an increasing insufficiency in Community resources."
"It is expected that the Union will do increasing numbers of things with fewer resources."
"And not only is this miracle not eternal, but furthermore it is not sustainable."
"Secondly, how would the Council explain these increasing budget balances being returned to the Member States with a rate of use of own resources now practically of 1% rather than the theoretical 1.27%?"
"The answer remains in the air."
"There are Member States which use, as a variable for their national budgetary adjustments, structural funds which they do not commit and do not implement."
"I ask myself whether this is the right way to administrate the European Union, whether this Parliament should agree with this way of acting."
"Let us hope that the Convention helps us to resolve this problem which we are all facing."
"Mr President, I too would like to congratulate both rapporteurs, who have attained good results."
"I would particularly like to thank Mr Stenmarck for his cooperation in working with me on the other institutions' budgets and, crucially, the implementation of the front-loading exercise."
"This means that those budgets which at the outset were EUR 66 million over the ceiling, are now within an acceptable margin."
"This should help us in the 2004 budget as well."
"The start of 2003 was a difficult budgetary year."
"Not only did we have major preparations in the institutions for the forthcoming enlargement, but the strains of working within a rigid framework agreed in Berlin were all too apparent, especially in category 4."
"I agree with what Mr Färm said earlier about the straightjacket system within which we have to work."
"It has been a real juggling act for both rapporteurs, especially on our main budget."
"I have observed over the last three years a year-on-year crisis situation."
"Whilst the EU's obligations and global needs are growing, the finances are not."
"One of the fundamental problems for Parliament is the lack of influence on the whole of the EU's budget, particularly category 1."
"While we, as parliamentarians, are committed to budgetary rigour, our inability to influence 50% of the EU budget is frustrating because we cannot fully translate political priorities into budgetary ones."
"Therefore, I would like to congratulate both Mr Stenmarck and Mr Färm, particularly Mr Färm, for achieving what he has done in delivering on most of Parliament's priorities."
"The reality of enlargement is upon us."
"However, until we have the outcome of the Convention and the full extent of the new role of the institution is established, it will be difficult to put direct plans into place."
"Although we have begun preparations in this budget and some minor adaptations have already taken place in this House, the reality of enlargement has not fully sunk in within the institutions."
"We have not properly begun to address the full implications of enlargement."
"Let us just look at the three places of work."
"Concerning Strasbourg, there are likely to be something like 100 new MEPs plus their assistants as well as their Council counterparts and additional Commission staff from the new members of the European Union."
"In practical terms, that means that there are likely to be 2 000 to 3 000 more people around once a month in this city."
"Even now the hotels are struggling to cope."
"I know we are known as a travelling circus but, come May 2004, we may literally have to camp out in our tents because there will not be enough hotel rooms as a result of the enlarged Parliament."
"Combined with this the transport links - especially the air links - are far from satisfactory for current Members."
"Therefore it is absolutely essential that the Convention grasps the nettle and looks seriously at the three places of work."
"How can these be reduced?"
"It is important that the Council and the Convention recognise that they have to take this political decision."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, it gives me great pleasure to say that the budget for 2003 has gone wonderfully well."
"It was a privilege to be in on the mid-term and end-of-year conciliation meetings where there was constructive and sensible debate and deals were done."
"I would like to praise Commissioner Kinnock for his reforms at the Commission, although there has been one blind spot."
"I am delighted to see Mrs Schreyer here today, who hopefully is going to talk about accounting control."
"During the passage of this budget we in the Conservatives and the European People's Party tried to indicate that we needed better and tighter accounting control."
"If we did not get that, we would not release certain amounts of money and allow certain staffing levels."
"This is absolutely vital."
"It is a great pity that the Committee on Budgets takes one forward look at the budget, but then encounters budgetary control implications, and there is a bit of a gap between the two."
"There needs to be a seamless thread, and I am delighted that Mrs Schreyer is here to address that issue today."
"Looking ahead, it is vital that we have the common agricultural policy reform carried out to programme and not delayed, because this is so vital to enlargement and the sensible payment of reasonable subsidies - I say reasonable and stress that word - to the accession countries."
"I praise the fact that we get good value from the European Union budget."
"We have brought down the percentage of gross domestic product spent on the budget successfully, so that it is now just over 1% at 1.02%."
"I praise everyone involved, particularly the rapporteurs, on a very successful budget outcome."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to thank the general rapporteurs, Mr Färm and Mr Stenmarck, for their astute handling of the matter and achievement of a compromise which has allowed us to reach our goal with a result which Parliament finds satisfactory, on the whole."
"As many of you are aware, I have expressed some concern at a number of decisions, particularly the cut in payment appropriations for category 2 of the Structural Funds."
"However, although I do not view the compromise reached with enthusiasm, I do understand how it has come about, given the enormous pressure from the Member States to reduce the amount of payments which, I regret to say, are increasing at a slower rate than inflation."
"I do not want to focus on the content of the budget but to talk about something else."
"This is a transitional budget: as Mr Walter said, it shows us the tough reality of figures which are, once again, a reflection of the miserly rigidity of the States."
"One would have to be blind not to see that we have entered a new phase in European history. Copenhagen is a historic milestone."
"Those who have believed in enlargement have had to have genuine visionary powers, the visionary powers of Spinelli, Monnet and Schumann before us."
"Is it really impossible to be visionaries once again when it comes to the budget too?"
"We cannot build a European power with miserly States."
"Will there come a day when the Financial Perspective will be established on the basis of a burst of generosity, from the Netherlands for example, with the Solidarity Fund entirely financed by Luxembourg for instance, with the Committee on Budgetary Control urging us to spend more rather than less, with the Member States calculating not what comes in and what goes out of their pockets but what Europe genuinely needs to meet the needs of its citizens?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, alongside enlargement and foreign policy, agriculture and structural policy are the essential priorities for the budget."
"That is only right and proper, as the European Budget was originally agricultural in character."
"That has to be borne in mind when considering large areas of the Council's policy."
"There is something dubious about constantly burdening the European Budget with new Community tasks without stating where the money for these tasks is to come from."
"As I understand these things, it certainly is not going to be from the agriculture budget!"
"I do not see that it has to be our function to keep national budgets sound by dividing up the work in this way."
"To that extent, it follows that the amendments taken up by the Council from Parliament's first reading are double-edged."
"On the one hand, I am glad that the Council has withdrawn 25% of the across-the-board cuts in the lines under heading 1A."
"On the other, this means, when compared with the draft budget, that we are giving out EUR 200 million, even though the estimated upper limit has a margin of EUR 2.6 billion."
"This money is not being used where it is needed - as aid that actually generates income."
"Money has been taken away even from the strengthening of the second pillar that has been called for on all sides."
"I am on record as favouring the support and development of rural areas, if it gives the people there a long-term home and the money is not wasted on local status symbols or allowed to drain away into national projects with ideological trimmings."
"As regards the Commission's letter of amendment, I welcome the fact that the Commission has adopted some of Parliament's proposals from the first reading and, in particular that it is not making further cuts to export refunds."
"It is important for me to again emphasise, in conclusion, that the agriculture budget faces attack on two fronts."
"On one, the Council is attempting to use the agriculture sector to finance ever more new expenditure, and on the other, redeployment of funds to a second pillar yet to be defined means that farmers are losing out on payments from the first pillar that generate income."
"Both of these things I regard as unfair and would like to take this opportunity to make this abundantly clear."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, even though the foreign policy of nation states is, by tradition, a matter for the executive, money for certain foreign-policy activities has to be authorised by their parliaments."
"The right of control over the budget is the traditional means whereby a national parliament exercises parliamentary control over foreign policy, and so we are very glad that this budget enables us to take a further step on the road towards parliamentary control of the common foreign and security policy."
"An agreement is in place with the Council, which has given an assurance that, prior to future decisions - in particular on joint actions - Parliament, the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Budgets will be notified at a point in time at which they can still exert some influence on the measure as a whole."
"We now appeal to the Convention to enshrine this accordingly in the nascent European constitution and to beef it up."
"Nobody wants to put a question mark against the Member States' right to reach autonomous decisions on foreign policy matters, but if Parliament is expected to make funds available, then it has to be given advance notice."
"We have seen many examples over the past few years of foreign policy undertakings being given and our budget procedure having to be used to find the money for them by cuts being made somewhere in the budget."
"As our colleague Mr Bourlanges once put it: 'The reconstruction of the former Yugoslavia, and of the Balkans, was paid for by Africa, as that is where we had to make cuts to make it possible.'"
"This agreement with the Council is an important step towards this no longer being the case in future, and towards foreign policy competence bearing some relation to the budget procedure, and we encourage the Convention to take this into account in the work it is doing."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur for the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I see a need for discussion of four areas that are of great importance to us."
"The first is external trade."
"The next round of WTO talks is imminent."
"I believe that the trend towards moving from the promotion of products to the promotion of quality is one that is especially important and will be of very great significance for Europe."
"Secondly, the WTO is in urgent need of a parliamentary assembly to accompany it."
"We can observe how pressure on the part of NGOs is constantly increasing, and how a political debate on globalisation issues is becoming ever more important."
"Thirdly, we in this House must ourselves step up our efforts in order to meet the challenges involved in preparing the WTO to face the future."
"At the end of the day, this issue will decisively affect some 20% of jobs in the European Union."
"On the subject of industry, I want to record the fact that support for border regions has been very successful, especially that given to small and medium-sized enterprises."
"The B5-510 budget line would also be very well suited to increasing the budget for the 'Arge 28' working community of chambers of commerce."
"I think it very sensible that discussions have touched on this."
"A further factor is that consideration is given, in the fourth multiannual programme, to the various modes of financing Basle II."
"I believe these programmes to be of great importance for the future."
"In particular, we want to start up a preparatory operation for next year, in order to give particular help in this area to small and medium-sized enterprises in meeting the requirements of Basle II."
"Turning to research and development, the earmarking for SMEs is especially laudable, and I believe that the EUR 3 billion to be spent in the coming year can also give an impetus to improved economic development."
"My fourth and final point has to do with intelligent energy."
"Here too, I believe, we have taken a step in the right direction as regards the supply, safety and efficiency of energy, with especial consideration for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want just to deal briefly with a number of the questions that have been raised, starting, of course, with the management of the budget."
"I would like to mention here that we have again come to a very good arrangement in this budget procedure on the very issue of pilot projects and preparatory measures, namely that a vote can be held beforehand on approaches to implementation, so that what the budgetary authority has decided in the budget procedure is also speedily implemented by the Commission."
"Mrs Buitenweg asked about the complement of posts for the environmental area, with reference to, among other things, the tasks that enlargement makes necessary, as environmental legislation must - quite rightly - also be implemented from day one, unless transitional arrangements are in place, but transitional arrangements, too, have to be observed."
"After you have finished voting on the 2003 Budget on Thursday, the enlargement DG will be given an additional 18 posts for preparation for enlargement, and more when the budget is implemented, with the result that, in the course of 2003, the environment DG will have 33 additional posts at its disposal."
"I would like to pick up on what Mr Walter said in his intervention with reference to the adjustment of the Financial Perspective in the course of enlargement."
"I really can unreservedly assure you, Mr Walter, that the Commission has been quite specific in emphasising that the adjustment of the Financial Perspective is not something that has been, so to speak, decided in advance; rather, it is to be decided jointly by Parliament and the Council on the basis of the Commission's proposal."
"I take the same view as you here: the maximum amounts were decided on in Copenhagen, but decisions on what we might call precise adjustments will have to be a joint effort."
"I would be very glad if we could succeed in laying down the timetable in the way the Greek Presidency is contemplating, so that we can indeed have the essential discussions on these matters as part of the first trialogue."
"Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, who is no longer in the Chamber, raised the subject of Parliament's decisions on expenditure in the area of agricultural policy."
"The Commission entirely shares the view that, in future, this distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure should be removed and the consequent differences in Parliament's rights eliminated, so that the European Parliament becomes fully competent in budget matters."
"It is my belief that this particular budget procedure has again shown that the European Budget cannot but stand to gain by this."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken on Thursday, at 11.30 a.m."
"(The sitting was suspended at 4.55 p.m. and resumed at 5 p.m.)"
"The next item is the Commission communications on the future of pension systems and the modernisation of accounting."
"Mr President, today, the Commission has adopted a comprehensive analysis of the Member States' strategies for ensuring adequate and sustainable pensions."
"This report is the fruit of a new form of cooperation between the Member States, given the consensus that pension systems should remain a responsibility of the Member States, and so the role of the European Union will be limited to supporting the Member States in their reform efforts."
"This is, of course, without prejudice to the Community policies in a number of areas which have an impact on national policy-makers, including internal market policy and the sustainability of public finances, which is examined in the framework of the broad economic policy guidelines."
"Moreover, the financial sustainability of pensions depends very much on the success of the European employment strategy."
"I am very pleased that the European Parliament supports this approach, even though we have yet to find a satisfactory way of involving Parliament more in the open method of coordination."
"The agreement on applying the open method of coordination to the issue of pensions was reached at the Laeken European Council one year ago."
"On that occasion, 11 common objectives were set covering the adequacy of pensions, their financial sustainability and the modernisation of pension systems to adapt them to changes on the labour market and in society, notably to ensure that they cater well for the needs of women."
"An important concept of the whole report is that there are three different dimensions: sustainability, modernisation and adequacy of pensions."
"It is not just the one dimension that we had until now in our European policies, which was within the framework of public finances."
"It was also agreed that the Member States would submit national strategy reports in which they explain how they achieve those common objectives."
"The national reports were submitted in September, and the document that has been adopted by the Commission today is an analysis of the national strategies, objective by objective."
"The Commission's aim was not to establish a ranking of Member States or to lecture them."
"The open method of coordination on pensions is not a beauty contest."
"Member States have to decide for themselves what type of pension systems they want."
"But our report tried to highlight certain and concrete strengths and weaknesses of national systems and policies."
"The common objectives can be achieved through a wide range of pension systems."
"Member States have either flat-rate public pension schemes covering all residents, or earnings-related schemes where benefits are based on employment."
"They rely to varying degrees on private-funded provision to complement these public schemes."
"The social partners play a more or less important role in national pension systems."
"The fact that, in spite of this diversity of systems, we could agree on a set of common objectives proves that it makes sense to speak of a European social model."
"The diversity of pension systems does not prevent us from having shared goals in this important policy area."
"In general, the national strategy reports described the current state of play rather than presenting new policy initiatives."
"The Member States involved not just different government departments in their preparation, but also social partners and other interested parties and, in some cases, there has been approval by the national parliaments."
"One important conclusion that we can draw from this exercise is that Member States can cope with ageing societies and avoid a financial or social disaster in their pension systems."
"The report tries to be neither unduly alarmist, nor too complacent about the situation of pension systems."
"Indeed, there are a lot of positive developments highlighted in the report, but there are also considerable weaknesses."
"In many countries, the sound financing of future pension benefits has not been secured."
"One very effective way of achieving this would be to raise the effective retirement age."
"In fact, achieving the Barcelona target of raising the labour market withdrawal age by five years would almost solve our financing problems as identified in the public pension expenditure projections by the Economic Policy Committee."
"However, we will only get there if Member States make much more determined efforts not only to encourage older people to stay longer in the labour market but also to enable them to do so."
"The European Parliament rightly insisted on the importance of health and safety in this regard and on the need to adapt the working environment to the special needs of older workers."
"Many Member States also have to do more to improve access to occupational pension schemes, particularly for atypical workers, among whom women tend to be over-represented."
"The portability of occupational pension rights also requires further improvements, and we will be discussing with the social partners at European level how this could be promoted."
"The European Parliament insisted particularly on the situation of older women."
"Women tend to live longer than men; so a majority of pensioners are women: some 60% of people over 65 and nearly two thirds of people over 75."
"The gender dimension therefore receives much attention in this report."
"We can expect individual pension rights for women to increase, thanks to increased labour force participation and smaller pay gaps between men and women."
"However, career breaks still tend to be taken more often by women than by men."
"So it will remain important to award pension rights for child-care periods and to maintain derived rights, without which many older women would be exposed to the risk of poverty."
"However, our priority should be to increase individual pension rights by offering better employment opportunities to women."
"What is going to happen next with this report?"
"The European Council requested a joint report by the Commission and the Council."
"So the next step will be to examine the Commission's text in the Council so as to finalise a report in time for the European Council meeting in March."
"There is no commitment to a second round of national strategy reports and their assessment at European level."
"However, we are committed to reviewing the common objectives and working methods before 2005 as a basis for deciding on the future of this cooperation."
"We intend to cooperate with the applicant countries and to carry out the same exercise for their systems."
"We are also working on common indicators which would allow us to measure the achievements of Member States."
"However, agreement on common indicators is quite a difficult issue and could not be arrived at in time for this report."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I greatly welcome this report from one point of view, because it highlights the fact that the problem of pensions systems is twofold: financial sustainability and adequacy."
"We - and I am thinking of countries such as Germany or, in particular, Italy - are laying the foundations for there to be generations of poor pensioners."
"We will ask for increasingly large contributions to balance our accounts but the size of the pensions they will lead to will steadily decrease. In addition, w e will ask for a superhuman effort to contribute to supplementary pension schemes."
"I believe that this report suffers from excessive optimism."
"I do not feel that we are being alarmist here. We need to see and state the facts as they are, and the fact is that, in Europe - and I am thinking, as I said before, of countries such as Italy and Germany in particular - we are laying the foundations for our pensioners to be poor, we are digging further holes in our budget."
"I fear that you have placed too much trust in Member States' forecasts."
"Mr President, the report is neither optimistic nor pessimistic."
"There are two objective factors here."
"The first is the problem of the ageing population and the second is the rise in the entitlement age."
"Bearing both these in mind, the Member States have introduced specific policies in which raising the age limit on the labour market appears to be the basic option - in fact most countries now consider it prerequisite - alongside policies to help older people stay in the labour market."
"I think that we can avoid smaller pensions if we keep to the philosophy I referred to earlier."
"I very much welcome your remarks, Commissioner."
"I would like to pick up on just one point, when you said 'Member States must make much more effort to enable employees to stay longer in employment'."
"I agree with that."
"My question really is: what is the Commission, rather than Member States, doing, and in particular what are the EU institutions doing, not just to allow people to stay longer but also to employ older people in the first place?"
"My specific question is: is it true that there are still some EU institutions that have age barriers so that if you are over a certain age, you cannot be employed by them?"
"Have those barriers come down yet?"
"If not, when will they come down?"
"Mr President, I would like to ask the Commissioner two questions, but first I would like to congratulate her because the debate is continuing and I like the music, although we will have to wait to see the lyrics."
"Firstly, Commissioner, we Members have not seen the communication, and I would like to know when we will see it and how Parliament will be involved before the spring Council, so that its opinion may be heard."
"Secondly, Commissioner, you have said that this is a process of support for the reforms of the Member States."
"My question is whether only those reforms which are in line with the Commission's communications and with the common doctrine we have supported in the European Parliament will be supported."
"Because not just any reform will be sufficient."
"If the reform is of a purely financial nature and does not take account of the social needs raised by the ageing of the population, I very much fear, Commissioner, that a large majority of this House will not be able to support it."
"Mr President, earlier retirement ages, growing life expectancy and the increasing call for early retirement pensions mean of course that many pensions systems have problems remaining financially viable, yet you say, Commissioner, that no special model is being singled out. Is not, however, attention being drawn to the Swedish model, also endorsed by Poland and Latvia, as a way of ensuring future sustainability?"
"Since they will greatly affect pensions sums, does the report go into the significance of the falls in share values that have taken place this summer and that have become still more marked this autumn?"
"This is not a factor we have seen taken into account, yet it means that great caution will need to be exercised where future investments are concerned, given how important falls in share values are to the sustainability of pensions."
"Have you taken this factor into account during your deliberations?"
"Mr President, in reply to the first question, it is true that certain countries had age limits in the past."
"May I remind you that we adopted an anti-discrimination directive two years ago, which all the Member States must adopt by July 2003, banning discrimination on the basis of age."
"So this will be the European framework from July 2003 onwards."
"As for the second question concerning the European Parliament, as I said in my speech, we need to find a clearer role for the European Parliament within the open coordination method and we have again discussed how we might strengthen Parliament's role in the open coordination method within the framework of the Convention with the relevant committee."
"As far as the report's orientation is concerned, I made it quite clear that pension reform policies are national policies."
"Of course there are European dimensions to these national policies and a country cannot exercise a pension reform policy without taking account of the stability pact, the laws of the internal market or the employment strategy."
"So this is national policy."
"Commissioner, I would like to ask you to make clear within the Commission that when we speak of pensions here we really mean provision for old age and not savings schemes as the directive now has it."
"Secondly, would you please give some thought to whether the term 'raising the retirement age' is really appropriate?"
"We ought rather to be creating programmes for people who have reached the age of 55, 65 or older that allow older workers to carry on working and retrain so that older unemployed people can be reintegrated into working life."
"Mr President, I congratulate Mrs Diamantopoulou and I fully support her last statement to the effect that the purpose of the report is not just to balance accounts but to ensure that the elderly are able to lead dignified lives, which is the most important thing."
"In this general climate of satisfaction, I would like to ask the Commissioner whether she feels that it would not be appropriate, as regards the funds which each Member State has freely decided to use to pay pensions, to go and assess the fairness with which the different individual situations are handled."
"We could give more to those who need to improve their standard of living and less to those who have too much, while still spending the same amount."
"In Italy, for example, there are widows with four children ?"
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, does the consultation process which was used by Member States reflect the public's confidence that they will have a decent pension at the end of their working lives, given the current state of the finances and markets of the Member States?"
"Have any of the Member States examined, in particular, the issue of how pension funds themselves operate, given that they are, as Ms Jensen said, big financial players on the market?"
"How much are they investing in the issue of corporate social responsibility themselves?"
"How much are they looking at ethical investment which might then deal with issues such as quality of work, keeping older people in the workforce, training and a whole raft of measures at the same time as dealing with the pensions question itself?"
"Mr President, in reply to the first question, I agree."
"As I pointed out in my introduction, the problem is not just one of raising the retirement age; we also need flanking policies to help older people stay in or, in many cases, enter the labour market, which is why I referred to both the stability pact and the employment strategies."
"May I remind you that one of the basic objectives of the employment strategy is to integrate older people."
"We can achieve this through specific training proposals and measures and special incentives. May I also remind you that Commissioner Monti and I recently decided that support for older people during the first stage of their integration into the labour market does not qualify as state aid."
"This therefore is our approach."
"We cannot raise the age limit unless we introduce policies at the same time to support the integration of older people."
"In reply to Mr Fatuzzo's question about the internal redistribution of pensions, we must remember that this is a purely national model and that it is in fact up to each government to decide what type of pension it is going to grant and where, depending on the model and principles it has decided on."
"However, to come back to one of the basic lines of approach of the strategy, the adequacy of pensions, again specific action is being taken to define present policies and future indicators for sections of the population which are at risk of exclusion or have particular problems, such as single-parent families, which I mentioned, or the question of women."
"The Member States must therefore say what they have done under each of these lines of approach in the reports they submit."
"So if there are specific sectors which guarantee adequacy, each Member State must highlight and state what measures it has taken in its reforms."
"In reply to Mr Pronk's question on the age of 60 or 65, there is no directive which sets the retirement age in the Member States."
"Each Member State sets it on the basis of its economic analysis and capabilities."
"At present, all the Member States have a lower limit of 65."
"France is an exception, but sets other requirements, and the Scandinavian countries are trying out a new approach and tending to abolish the age limit, which might go up to 67 or down to 60, with pensions being adjusted in line with the retirement age."
"Finally, as far as the question of the management of financial organisations and funds is concerned, I am not sure if I fully understood the question, but what I would say is that public pension funds are obviously subject to the general financial stability framework of each country, as far as private pension funds are concerned."
"I would remind you that a recent Commission directive introduced important safety valves for the safe management of these funds."
"We now move on to the Commission communication on the modernisation of accounting from Mrs Schreyer."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today the Commission has adopted a financial reform package that marks a crucial stage in this Commission's reform efforts."
"Firstly, the legislative framework for the new Financial Regulation is completed; the Commission has adopted the Financial Regulation's implementing regulation, along with procedural rules for the collection of receivables."
"It has taken a great effort by all concerned, the European Parliament in particular, to reach the goal of the European Union having a new, modern budgetary law by 1 January 2003."
"This new budgetary law will provide better protection for the Community's financial interests - I might mention, for example, the securities to be lodged by the recipients of advance payments, the obligation on contractors to provide auditor's certificates or the Commission's ability to bar contractors from tendering procedures if irregularities have been found in the past."
"This new budgetary law will also make budget execution more transparent and more coherent."
"Secondly, the Commission has made an overall assessment of the preparedness of its services for the implementation of this new budgetary law."
"This shows that considerable progress has been made in bringing the old ex ante controls into the services' internal control procedures."
"Any remaining problems will receive continued attention and the concerted efforts of all concerned."
"Horizontal services will provide targeted support."
"This creates the conditions for ending central financial control at the end of this financial year and also for winding up the remaining parts of the Directorate-General for Financial Control by early 2003."
"Most of the staff released in that way will be made available to the services to complete the human resources for financial reform that they have built up in the last three years."
"The sections of the Commission managing funds will then be fully responsible for budget implementation including the necessary control measures."
"Finally, the Commission has today also adopted the communication on the modernisation of the Communities' accounting system."
"This communication is divided into three parts."
"First, reform of the bookkeeping rules; second, adaptation of the supporting information and technology system; and third, the architecture of project management."
"The Commission had promised the European Parliament and the Court of Auditors to present these measures and the timetable by the end of this year."
"In so doing, the Commission is taking another important step in the long-term strategy for the modernisation of its accounting system that was begun in the year 2000."
"In 2000, the Commission presented a study that led to the Commission proposing that the Financial Regulation should incorporate new bookkeeping rules using accrual accounting."
"This communication now sets out step by step the action that must be taken to make the modern system available by 2005."
"In future, bookkeeping will be done by the double entry system."
"The budget account will use traditional cash accounting for budget revenue and expenditure, which is what the budgetary authority requires for checking the execution and implementation of the Budget; this means that the actual expenditures and actual receipts will be compared with the estimated amounts decided in the budget."
"The accrual accounting, however, will also have to incorporate the capital account for the European Budget's cash flow statement, and new standards will be introduced for this part of the budget account corresponding to the international standards that were recently adopted;"
"I shall come back to that in a moment."
"For the purpose of introducing the new standards required by the Financial Regulation from 2005 the Commission's chief accountant will be working out the specific details of how these international standards are to be implemented for the various measures financed out of the European Union's budget."
"A new Accounting Standards Committee will be created for the purpose."
"Various experts from the services as well as from outside will be represented on this committee."
"Another important point is that the new system will apply not only to the Commission's bookkeeping and accounting, but also to all European institutions, that means also to Parliament and to the budgets of the Council, the Court of Auditors and the agencies."
"The standards in question are in fact very new."
"This international body adopted its first standard for the public sector in 2000, the last standard in October 2002."
"They are therefore quite new rules and we will be using them as a benchmark for our accounting system."
"When this project is introduced, the European budget will be in the vanguard of accountancy rules."
"For the new standards to be introduced, the technical support provided by the underlying computer system, that is the information technology, will also have to be modernised."
"The system currently used for accounting is Sincom 2."
"It was introduced in 1997 and extended to all fund-managing departments in 1999."
"The SAP system - which all the experts call A3 for short - is crucial for the Commission's bookkeeping, and the closure of the books and presentation of the annual statement depend entirely on this system."
"At the same time, the SI II system was developed for departments managing resources and data on all relevant measures, that is, all data relevant for accounting have to be input into it."
"Experience shows, however, that the future system must be a fully integrated system for bookkeeping purposes."
"So far as complete integration allows, however, account should also be taken of the services' different requirements and respective management tasks, which are also subject to different requirements for the various sections of the European budget."
"There are three options for modernising the IT system in question, namely continuing with the present system as before, introducing a completely new system or developing an integrated system from what is already in place."
"As you will have inferred from what I have said, the Commission rejects the first option."
"A feasibility study will be made of the second and third options, which will be ready in the first half of 2003."
"A decision will then be taken on the steps that can be taken to develop an integrated system."
"How will this project be organised, given that it is a large-scale project covering the Commission and all the European Institutions?"
"The project organisation puts the chief accountant at the centre of the project."
"The Commission has today decided to appoint Mr Brian Gray, the new deputy director-general of the Directorate-General for the Budget, as chief accountant to see through this ambitious reform."
"This means the Commission has decided to give this project the highest grade, A1, in order to make clear that the necessary authority is also necessary in the grade if we are to take all the institutions and all the services here with us."
"There will be a Project Oversight Board with representatives of the most important services and also of the European Court of Auditors to assist with the implementation of this ambitious and expensive project."
"With Mr Gray as chief accountant and Mr Oostens as director of the accountancy division, we shall have two qualified and experienced accountants and qualified managers at the head of this ambitious project which, if it is successful - and I am confident that it will be - will put the EU administration at the forefront of modern public administration in accountancy as it is in other areas."
"All in all, today's package of decisions that the Commission has now adopted underlines that the Commission and the administrative reform package have long since passed the planning stage and have entered implementation, and I am pleased to have been able today to present these steps forward in financial management to the European Parliament, which is supporting us with its constructive criticism."
"Mr President, I have a couple of questions for the Commissioner."
"I am obviously pleased that a report is now being produced, but I have to observe that there is a large discrepancy between the Commission's report and what the Court of Auditors says."
"It might be stimulating to hear a couple of remarks concerning this discrepancy."
"The report also observes that there are serious problems with the system, as we also know of course from the Court of Auditors and from a canny Mrs Andreasen."
"The fact that the system cannot talk to itself is also a very great weakness."
"I am pleased to see the idea rejected that fraud and irregularities can occur, but the Commission maintains that there are too few authorised users with access to the system, and that is something about which the Court of Auditors disagrees."
"I should like to hear why there is such considerable disagreement between the Commission and the Court of Auditors."
"These really are issues we should very much like to hear something about in the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"Mr President, I welcome the Commission statement and I am pleased to see we are becoming more avant garde, emerging from the dark age of accounting that the Commission presently inhabits."
"It is interesting to hear that you are going to check the receipts of Commission monies - who gets contracts, where tenders go."
"You are going to change your bookkeeping rules, your IT systems and your project management."
"But what do you preside over now?"
"What has the Commission been doing for the last few years?"
"Why has it taken so long for this reform to be introduced?"
"More importantly, having now confirmed that every allegation levelled by Mrs Marta Andreasen was correct, where was the part - maybe I missed it in your statement - where you apologised for the personal slurs on Mrs Andreasen's background and character, made on and off the record by your press service?"
"Could you now say that the disciplinary process against your former chief accountant will stop and she will be brought in to drive through these reforms that she told you you needed this time last year?"
"Finally, who ever signed off the Commission's accounts in 2001?"
"Mr President, I will now answer Mr Blak's question."
"Every year since 1994 and again, too, for the 2001 Budget, the European Court of Auditors has found that the books and financial statement are a true record of the European Union's revenue and expenditure and also accurately show the financial position at the end of the year."
"At the same time, the European Court of Auditors has repeatedly urged us, as regards the capital account, to go over to a new system that does not wait until a payment or receipt has been made before recording financial transactions, but records them when a claim is raised or a commitment entered into."
"That is an important step, which is now enacted in the Financial Regulation."
"In the past few years - and this brings me to Mr Heaton-Harris's question - we have already taken steps towards this capital account."
"Then, of course, a lot of information about our claims and commitments came from outside the bookkeeping system."
"For example, we asked ourselves what the Commission's future obligations were with regard to pensions for its officials."
"That was information that was obtained and processed by the Directorate-General for Administration and then fed into the accounting system."
"This information was not derived from the annual budget."
"Take another example, which also applies to the Parliament's budget."
"Take the fixed assets, this building for example."
"The budget account contained only the expenditure made in a given year."
"If you like, the assets were then no longer contained in the accounts, or they had to be brought into them again at an appropriate valuation."
"For the future we plan - and this is how it is being introduced - that the information will go from the annual budget directly into the capital budget."
"Then we will know what the European Union's assets are and we will not have to introduce them separately."
"I must point out that unfortunately we cannot simply draw on best practices in the Member States."
"Some Member States - and we discussed this repeatedly in the Committee on Budgetary Control - have taken steps in this direction, but at the same time the Member States also have different problems."
"Municipalities, for example, own infrastructure, and you might therefore say that they have different assets than we do and have to value them differently."
"If - and this is new - for example securities that contractors have to lodge when they take part in a tendering procedure or the tender has been accepted now have to be shown in books, then we have to take new decisions."
"The international standards are, if you like, principles, but they must, as it were, be tailored to the specific budget, to the specific tasks that we have in the budget, if they are to be made to work."
"That will also be decided by this Standards Committee."
"If that produces good results, I think that might in future be something that the Member States or third countries will be able to take over from us."
"Commissioner, you call your communication 'Modernisation of Accounting'."
"To put it politely, I call that a misrepresentation of the facts, as what has been revealed to us in the last few weeks has been total chaos."
"Your administration is about to blow up in spectacular fashion and if you had the courage of your convictions you would admit it."
"I only wonder why it is only now that you are admitting to this scandalous situation - I only mention the fact that nothing was obviously done to prevent multiple entries - even though the Court of Auditors has drawn attention to it repeatedly since 1994, why you apparently need a few more years, until 2005, to put a stop to them, why you dismissed a chief accountant who was the first to draw attention to these errors early this year and why you subjected her to disciplinary proceedings."
"I seriously wonder how you think you can sell us your new Financial Regulation as a great success when it is not based on an operational bookkeeping system."
"Mr President, Commissioner, please excuse me if I have to leave before you reply, but I have a group of visitors and it is my custom to be punctual."
"That is not usual everywhere in Europe, but I do it."
"I have a very precise question."
"You said you wanted to carry out a feasibility study about the IT system."
"Now we agree that we are under pressure of time so far as the modernisation of the accounting system is concerned."
"When I think about it, on the grounds of plausibility it seems to me that a feasibility study can only refer to option 2, namely modernising the existing system in such a way that it also satisfies future requirements."
"My question is, given that we are all under pressure of time and that the system must be modernised, would it not be more sensible to save time by not asking this question and going straight for a complete integrated replacement of this system?"
"Mr President, Mrs Schreyer, I congratulate you on this ambitious project and have the following questions."
"The new system must be operational from 2005."
"What do you propose doing in the meantime, since the Court of Auditors has been voicing strong criticism of the existing bookkeeping and accounting system since 1994?"
"You know that Parliament will very likely be dealing with these problems once they have been put before the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"How much longer will it take after 2005 before everything is really operational if the new chief accountant - probably supported by the committee you referred to - will then actually have to guarantee that it will work?"
"Mr President, to come back to Mr Heaton-Harris's question about responsibility for the 2001 accounts, it was of course the chief accountant at the time who was responsible for the accounts for the whole year, including the annual statement for 2001."
"Regarding Mr van Dam's question, I must again point out that it is not correct to say that the European Union's and the European Commission's accounts did not meet international standards."
"There are, however, different international standards, there are standards that are based solely on the cash accounting principle and there is a further development with a view to more managerial categories."
"In the past, the Financial Regulation, that is the law that applies to us and also to the other institutions, had only prescribed the cash accounting principle."
"This met the standard and it was followed."
"I have pointed out that the further development is a relatively recent development, even for the public sector."
"I repeat, the corresponding IPSA standards of the International Federation of Accountants are the first standards for the public sector and were adopted in the year 2000, the most recent one not until October 2002, that is, two months ago."
"These standards do not yet cover every issue; in other words, it is in fact an ongoing development, and in that respect we can truly say that we are in the vanguard if we decide to go in that direction - and that is what we have done with the Financial Regulation."
"Regarding Mrs Stauner's question, you have again assumed, Mrs Stauner, that the Court of Auditors would not give a statement of assurance for the accounts."
"That is not correct."
"I would stress once again that this year the Court of Auditors again found, for the year 2001, that the financial statement, the budget account gives a true picture of the revenue and expenditure."
"You were the rapporteur, the general rapporteur, Mrs Stauner, and you also confirmed this in your statement."
"I will explain once again that the financial statement is of course submitted not only to the European Court of Auditors but also to the Council and Parliament, in other words the books are open on the table."
"Regarding Mr Kuhne's question about the development of the necessary computer system, here too, I will say again that when I look at the situation in some Member States, where many different financial statements are produced because they do not yet have a uniform system, I can only say that the previous Commission took an important step here in 1999 when it required all entries in the books to be made using the same system."
"That was a tremendous step for the European Commission, too, since there were previously five or seven different financial statements - I do not remember the exact number - that then had to be integrated or could not be completely integrated."
"That was therefore essential, and we all know that software and computer systems, too, continue to develop."
"Regarding the SAP system, for example, on which our bookkeeping is based or which does our bookkeeping, SAP is running the software in question only until 2004; a new system is now being introduced all over the world and we are faced with the task of having to adopt it and introduce it over that period of time."
"I turn now to Mrs Theato's question."
"What will happen in the meantime?"
"Work is of course being done all the time."
"For example, work is now being done to create a central register of accounts and a central register for contracts, which will then be available to all services."
"We now have the SI-II System for sections managing funds."
"The data it produces are input into the SAP accounting system, after having been checked by financial control."
"The managers of resources cannot consult the accounting system direct."
"They have no access, that is correct, but they cannot consult it either."
"The aim is that the chief accountant will make the data available to everyone so that there will be no more inconsistencies but at the same time, of course, that safeguards are maintained, so that the person managing the funds cannot, as it were, get past the front-line security and through to the transaction."
"Mr President, on a point of order, I listened with great interest to the questions by Mrs Stauner and Mr Heaton-Harris who both asked the Commissioner to comment on the allegations made by Mrs Andreasen and on whether, in fact, she was not completely justified."
"I notice the Commissioner did not reply to those questions."
"Mr President, please invite the Commissioner to do so because, as two Members have asked the same question, they are entitled to a full response."
"Mr President, I will gladly answer the question."
"As I have explained, in the year 2000, the Commission commissioned a study that examined the accounting system."
"We then decided - it was in a Prodi Commission proposal for the Financial Regulation - to propose new bookkeeping rules."
"Then in June 2001 the services of the Commission prepared a first package of measures, a first action plan, of what must be done."
"That was the basis on which the chief accountant was appointed in January 2002 and that was the basis of the work that should have been done."
"I believe that Parliament itself would say that anyone working in the Commission is responsible for implementation."
"It is not sufficient to repeat certain criticisms, but it is then that person's duty to work on implementing the reform."
"This is the last point of order I shall allow, because if this requires further debate there will be another opportunity, but today we cannot stretch our time any further."
"The final point of order."
"Mr President, on a point of order, I appreciate your comments but this is one of the fundamental problems we have with the Commission at present."
"Mrs Sandbæk has written to you, Commissioner, asking to see a copy of the signature of your former, former chief accountant on the 2001 accounts."
"I asked who that person was."
"I was told in the past that they were signed whilst that person was in post."
"That person left the Commission's employment on 31 December 2001."
"They were either the quickest prepared set of accounts in history or something magical happened."
"I am not convinced by what you have said today and I very much doubt whether the people in the public gallery are convinced."
"I would just appreciate some frank exchanges and honesty between you and those of us who are interested, because Mrs Andreasen told you what was happening."
"She wrote to you and met you, and you chose to ignore here."
"What happened is a disgrace to you and your institution."
"Realistically, you have to bite the bullet and get on with reforming the accounting system properly, and you could do with Mrs Andreasen's help."
"Mr President, Mr Heaton-Harris, once again, the chief accountant who was responsible for the budget and capital accounts in 2001 was also responsible for the 2001 financial statement."
"It was sent to the Court of Auditors on time."
"The Commission presents the budget and capital account to the European Court of Auditors, which also checks the books on an ongoing basis."
"The European Court of Auditors again came to the conclusion for the 2001 books that the financial statement provides a correct and true picture of the revenue and expenditure and the financial situation at the end of the year."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I have no option but to move on to the next item on the agenda."
"If you need to continue this debate, it must be at another time."
"The next item is Questions to the Commission (B5-0510/2002)."
"In accordance with paragraph 2 of Annex II of the Rules of Procedure, Questions Nos 40, 42, 43 and 44 will not be replied to, since they relate to an issue which already appears on the agenda for the present part-session: the Council and Commission statements on the Prestige, tomorrow Wednesday."
"The authors of the questions have naturally been informed."
"Part I"
"Question No 37 by Manuel Medina Ortega (H-0727/02):"
"Subject: Border controls in north Africa"
"Can the Commission explain the scope of the agreements reached with Morocco and other north African countries with a view to helping these countries curb the illegal transit of emigrants to the European Union across their borders?"
"Can the Commission provide information on other projects in this field?"
"Mr President, the figure the Commissioner has given is EUR 40 million, apparently for the period 2002-2004."
"I would be grateful if you could clarify whether this is only for 2002 and whether it is an experimental programme because, given that, when we talk about the borders of Morocco, we are talking about thousands of kilometres of borders, I have the impression that this sum is entirely insufficient to help the Moroccan Government to carry out the control of those borders."
"I would like to know whether there is any possibility of this figure of EUR 40 million, if it is considered simply to be an initial figure, being increased so that we may have a sensible programme of cooperation with Morocco which would allow that country to control its borders."
"Question No 38 by Mary Elizabeth Banotti (H-0825/02):"
"Subject: Abuse of EU research legislation covering orphan drugs"
"In 1999 EU legislation was adopted with a view to encouraging research into the development of 'orphan' drugs for the treatment of rare diseases."
"It would now seem that unscrupulous drug companies are using the legislation to obtain exclusive rights to common medicines which are currently used in the treatment of rare disorders, therefore pushing up the cost of such drugs."
"Will the Commission undertake to inquire into the level of such abuse, and what measures will the Commission take to end such abuse and to ensure that the legislation is used for the purpose that it was intended, namely research for effective treatment of rare disorders?"
"Mr President, orphan medicinal products are so called because they are used in the treatment or diagnosis of conditions that occur so rarely."
"The cost of developing and marketing orphan medicinal products would not be recovered by their expected sales."
"For this reason, the pharmaceutical industry has been unwilling to develop such products under normal market conditions."
"The regulation on orphan medicinal products which entered into force in January 2000 provides a system of incentives for sponsors to develop and market designated orphan medicinal products."
"One of these incentives is market exclusivity for a period of 10 years."
"This is granted if a designated orphan medicinal product obtains a marketing authorisation in all Member States."
"To obtain this, the sponsor must conduct a series of tests and studies to demonstrate that the product meets the rigorous standards of quality, safety and efficacy required of all medicinal products marketed in the EU."
"Since 2000, 123 products have been designated as orphan medicinal products and placed on the Community register."
"In a very small number of cases this involves a commonly available chemical that has been supplied by the manufacturer to hospitals which have prepared the chemical for administration to patients."
"The great majority of these orphan medicinal products contain new innovative ingredients."
"In a few cases it has been common practice for some time to supply the raw ingredients to treat the patient."
"However, this chemical has not been tested for its purity and safety and the product is not authorised."
"Indeed the chemical is not of pharmaceutical quality and may contain unspecified and unquantified impurities."
"In this situation, it is not surprising that an authorised medicinal product developed to meet rigorous standards of quality, safety and efficacy costs more than the base chemical."
"The Commission has no powers with respect to either the price or reimbursement of medicines."
"However, the orphan regulation contains a provision to reduce the period of market exclusivity to six years, if after five years it can be shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify the maintenance of market exclusivity."
"Question No 39 by Bernd Posselt (H-0773/02):"
"Subject: Chechnya - Commissioner Nielson's visit"
"Has the Commission already decided when Commissioner Nielson will be travelling to Chechnya in order to form an impression, in person, of the humanitarian situation there and set about improving the distribution of EU aid?"
"Mr President, just two specific queries."
"Firstly, can you give some kind of guarantee - one can of course never give an absolute one - that the humanitarian aid is actually reaching the Chechen refugees, or are you relying completely on the Russian authorities for that?"
"My second question is this: as camps have now been set up in Ingushetia and masses of people deported, do you know where those people have gone?"
"One of the most important activities and one activity that we are very pleased to continue funding is the logistical work provided by the Danish Refugee Council - the only non-Russian operation that delivers food and all other items inside Chechnya."
"They use local drivers, but the whole organisation is provided by that NGO."
"This is also recognised by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and by the UN system in general."
"It is a very important achievement because it provides access for the humanitarian community."
"So the answer to the question of whether we are able to monitor the whole flow is that we are doing it as well as possible."
"On a number of occasions over the years I have informed Parliament that we are working on the basis of a so-called 'remote-control' concept, which means that we have to use local implementing partners."
"However, so far we have not run into problems relating to accountability."
"We are trying to track every activity as carefully as possible."
"I would say that, as long as we are able to keep the operation carried out by the Danish Refugee Council up and running, we have some security in terms of knowing what is going on."
"The input from the UN organisations is also crucial in this respect and our cooperation with them is quite well developed."
"The problem of the people who are more or less willing to go back - and we fear they are fewer in number - is that they go back into all kinds of different situations."
"This is why we are criticising the pressure that they are under."
"We are clearly worried."
"We will proceed to the second part of this Question Time, and we will begin with questions to Vice-President de Palacio."
"Part II"
"Questions to Commissioner de Palacio"
"Questions to 41 by José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil (H-0800/02):"
"Subject: Taxation of fuel supplied in Gibraltar"
"On 20 November, the newspaper 'El Pais' reported that most vessels passing through the Straits of Gibraltar take on fuel from tanker ships anchored in Gibraltarian waters, instead of doing so in the port of Algeciras, where there are better installations."
"The reasons are, inter alia, that fuel is cheaper in Gibraltar than in Spain, and that the Spanish authorities are stricter in their application of EU regulations on maritime safety and pollution prevention than the Gibraltar authorities."
"It is no secret that this particular form of taking on fuel presents considerable environmental risks in terms of spillage, which has indeed occurred fairly frequently."
"Furthermore, the fact that the amount of tax paid on fuel differs between Spain and Gibraltar constitutes fullblown fiscal discrimination, seriously distorting competition, as happens with all products subject to Community customs duties."
"What does the Commission intend to do, therefore, to put an end to these practices, which are both dangerous to the environment and harmful to the proper operation of the internal market?"
"Mr President, Gibraltar is, in fact, one of the main points for the supply of marine fuel in the Mediterranean and much of this activity is carried out by oil tankers."
"Although many ports have equipment for refuelling on the quayside, this type of refuelling is still the most common in ports, not only in small ports, but also in others such as Rotterdam, Barcelona or Hamburg."
"The Commission believes that this practice should be carefully supervised in order to prevent dumping and marine pollution."
"Therefore, many ports have adopted specific regulations and procedures which regulate such activities and the Commission, for its part, in accordance with the Treaty, monitors compliance with the Community legislation on environmental protection and therefore, on 24 January 2001, brought a case before the Court of Justice in relation to the non-application by the United Kingdom of a whole series of environmental rules in Gibraltar, including Directive 93/12/EEC on the sulphur content of certain liquid fuels."
"With regard to taxation, in accordance with Community tax rules, the hydrocarbons used as fuels for shipping and fishing in Community waters, with the exception of private recreational vessels, are exempt from the payment of special taxes, both at Community level and at national level."
"Commissioner, behind the tide of black oil being suffered today by Galicia and which on other occasions has been suffered by other European coasts, there is always a tide of black money which should be investigated."
"These black oil slicks and this black money always involve groups with structures much more like mafias than like businesses, made up of companies with ridiculous assets in order to evade responsibilities and covered by insurance which is also ridiculous."
"These groups are always protected by legislation which is lax from environmental, commercial and fiscal points of view, and Gibraltar is no exception."
"The port of Gibraltar supplies much more fuel than the port of Algeciras, amongst other things because less harbour duties are paid there and because - as the Commissioner has acknowledged - maritime safety and environmental rules are applied much less rigorously and, thirdly, because less tax is paid."
"I am not of course referring to special taxes, because any first-year law student knows that the fuel used in maritime transport is exempt from the value added tax on hydrocarbons."
"The problem is that direct taxes are not paid either, taxes on companies, which also have an impact on prices: 35% in Algeciras and nothing in Gibraltar, as Commissioner Monti knows very well."
"I would like to ask whether or not there are tax differences in Gibraltar when compared to Algeciras."
"Bearing in mind that there cannot be differences in relation to special taxes, there can be differences in relation to taxation as a whole, which has an impact on costs, as you will be aware, every time you go out to lunch or dinner and pay the bill."
"Mr President, my colleague, Mario Monti, has already initiated procedures on two occasions against the United Kingdom, precisely in order to ensure the correct operation of the internal market and the appropriate application of the competition rules in an equivalent manner throughout the Union."
"In any event, I am sure that Mr García Margallo, who has plenty of experience, is perfectly aware of these issues, and I am sure that my colleague, Mario Monti, will continue to work to ensure that there are no havens in any part of the European Union in relation to any issue, when it comes to the application of Community legislation."
"Question No 45 by Nuala Ahern (H-0721/02):"
"Subject: EU-wide nuclear regulation"
"On 12 September the Energy Commissioner briefed selected press on new plans for EU-wide nuclear regulation, revealing plans that include:"
"a 'framework directive' which will establish nuclear safety standards in the EU; a directive on the management and disposal of radioactive waste; a directive governing the financial mechanisms for securing long term disposal of radioactive waste and the decommissioning of nuclear facilities; a negotiation mandate to raise the levels of imported nuclear fuel into the EU."
"Can the Commission state what parts of the current Euratom Treaty powers on nuclear safety regulation are inadequate and require such changes; what consultation the Commission has had with Member States in respect of plans to increase the import of nuclear fuels into the EU; and whether the Commission envisages that these increased nuclear imports are intended for reprocessing at Sellafield and The Hague?"
"Mr President, in the 45 years of application of the Euratom Treaty, its capacity for adaptation and flexibility in order to respond to the needs and concerns of any particular moment has been demonstrated."
"In this regard, it has promoted and facilitated the development of Community research and legislation on control in the fields of both radiation protection and on the control of the use of nuclear materials."
"The measures proposed are concrete evidence of the appropriate nature of the Treaty, whose provisions provide them with a solid and sufficient legal basis."
"These Commission proposals strengthen, above all, the existing mechanism for guaranteeing the health protection of the population and of workers, as defined in Chapter 3 of Title II of the Euratom Treaty."
"In this way, health protection within the framework of radiation protection rules will be supplemented with nuclear safety provisions able to guarantee compliance with the radiation protection rules."
"With regard to the trade in nuclear materials with Russia, the Commission proposes to present a proposal for a negotiation mandate for the approval of the Council, in accordance with its right to initiative."
"Commissioner, we were very surprised to discover that you, a Commissioner with special responsibility for relations with Parliament, briefed the press in September before Parliament had even heard of these proposals."
"This was appalling of you."
"I cannot stress too firmly that you should have come to discuss them with Parliament before briefing the press."
"I am very surprised to hear that you have a sufficient legal base."
"I understand that the Council is discussing this at the moment and that your nuclear proposals are based on the wrong legal framework."
"You have actually got it wrong, Commissioner."
"Contrary to what the Commission has suggested, Articles 30, 31 and 32 of the Euratom Treaty are not applicable, as the Commission would be interfering with the safety of nuclear installations in respect of their technical operation."
"This is excluded under the Euratom Treaty."
"I should also like to inform you that in the Member States, particularly in the UK, questions are being raised concerning your support for reprocessing in some of your statements."
"I would like you to clarify that you are not supporting plutonium reprocessing of in these proposals."
"Mr President, Mr Ahern, forgive me, but I announced the intention to present this nuclear safety package to this Parliament before anybody else and I have repeated it on various occasions, and it was therefore nothing new."
"And I did not present the initiatives to the press before this Parliament."
"On the contrary, I came here to inform Parliament of the initiatives I had proposed in Brussels."
"With regard to the legal basis, I would refer to the press release issued by the Luxembourg Court on 10 December."
"The Court believes that Euratom has competences in the following areas: the establishment of a legislative and regulatory framework for organising the safety of nuclear installations; measures relating to the assessment and verification of safety; organisation in the event of emergencies; the choice of location of nuclear installations and, finally, the design, construction and operation of nuclear installations."
"I therefore believe that nobody is going to argue about the legal basis in the Euratom Treaty for all the proposals I have made to the Council and Parliament, because the Court has said it loud and clear."
"Finally, I do not support reprocessing in any way whatsoever."
"I do not know where the honourable Member has got these ideas from, I do not get into these types of issues."
"All I propose is that we must provide a framework for greatest possible degree of safety in all the countries of the Union."
"In all of them, in the ones that are going to join now and in the current ones, and there must be the highest possible level of safety in all of them, making obligatory, amongst other things, what are merely recommendations from the Safety Agency in Vienna."
"Question No 46 by Laura González Álvarez (H-0737/02):"
"Subject: Independence exercised by the Commission"
"In June 2002 a delegation of the European Parliament's Committee on Petitions travelled to Asturias at the invitation of the parliament of Asturias."
"One of the petitions handed to the committee chairman, Mr Gemelli, at a meeting with various groups of petitioners criticised the social and environmental impact of routing the 'autovía del Cantábrico' motorway through the west of the region."
"That petition was declared admissible by the Committee on Petitions."
"Surprisingly, however, before the petition could be discussed under the usual procedure, an MEP, accompanied by the secretary of his party in the region and three mayors, met with Commissioner Loyola de Palacio and two Commission officials."
"On their return to Asturias the mayors told the media that the petition had been filed."
"How can a case be closed before the committee responsible has either seen or discussed it?"
"How can Mrs Loyola de Palacio decide to file a petition which - as indicated in a reply sent by Mrs Wallström - does not fall within her department's remit?"
"Does the Commission not believe that its independence and the duty of confidentiality of the officials concerned have been affected?"
"In its view, does action of this kind not undermine the role of the Committee on Petitions and of Parliament itself and, worse still, show a lack of respect for the petitioners?"
"Mr President, I would like to say briefly to the honourable Member that I did in fact receive a visit - and I receive many visits - from a series of representatives who not only visited me but also the Directorate-General for the Environment, which is responsible for dealing with the issue which the honourable Member refers to."
"This type of visit to the Commission is normal."
"Furthermore, on certain occasions I have also met with the honourable Member and other people and these meetings furthermore seem to me to be extremely important in terms of becoming aware of what social groups and people are thinking."
"What we have to avoid when we are in the Commission, in Brussels, is losing contact with reality."
"Having said this, I cannot get into what the people who visit me say or the content of what they freely express."
"I cannot get into it, but I would like to say firstly that I am not responsible with regard to the initiation of any possible procedures or investigations relating to these issues, which fall within the competence of my colleague, Mrs Wallström; secondly, with regard to the Committee on Petitions, I do not have any responsibility here either, because it falls to this Parliament to deal with these issues."
"Mr President, rather than supplementing the question, because I consider the Commissioner's reply to be correct, what I will do is inform her that in that case they used her name and those of two officials from the Directorate-General for the Environment wrongly."
"As I said in the question, a number of petitioners spoke with Mr Gemelli, in Asturias - my region - and then there were a series of visits to the Commissioner."
"Now, what appears in the regional press is that the Commissioner and the officials say that this case is closed."
"It seems to me unfortunate to use the names of two officials from the Directorate-General for the Environment."
"The Asturian petitioners quite rightly asked me how it could be that a case was closed when it had not even been discussed in the Committee on Petitions."
"I therefore say to you that the appearance in the press of the names of these two officials and of the Commissioner greatly damages the credibility of the European institutions and of the Committee on Petitions."
"It grieves me that your name and those of these two officials should be linked to a political issue which should not have appeared in the press in this way."
"Mr President, I am surprised that such experienced Members of Parliament should confuse a complaint to the Commission with a petition to the European Parliament."
"Such an important public communications infrastructure project as the 'autovía de Occidente' motorway deserves all the support of all the Asturian political representatives."
"Therefore, certain Asturian Mayors, very concerned about some complaints made to the Commission by certain Asturian local organisations, came here to find out how the executive Commission was dealing with those complaints."
"They were received by Commissioner de Palacio and by certain officials, who informed them that that complaint presented to the European Commission had just that week been filed away and that the case had been completely closed."
"Of course, it is not the duty of the Commission to resolve the final outcome of the petitions to the European Parliament, but of the MEPs."
"But let us not confuse complaints with petitions."
"Commissioner de Palacio, I would like to ask you whether you have any news on whether in the corresponding services of the Commission there is any other complaint presented on the issue of the 'autovía de Occidente'."
"Mr President, there has perhaps been a degree of confusion, as the honourable Member has said."
"All I can do is repeat that I cannot comment on the content of statements by people who visit me."
"Secondly, one thing is a complaint and quite another is the Committee on Petitions which, I insist, the Commission plays no part in, since it falls within the competence of this Parliament."
"With regard to the issue of complaints, this falls to Mrs Wallström."
"I have no knowledge but, in any event, I will be very happy to look into it and I will inform the honourable Member."
"The Members are aware that this is a time for questions and supplementary questions to the Commission, not for explanations and descriptions by the honourable Members."
"I very much respect your enthusiasm for debating and explaining the facts, but this is a Question Time."
"As the author is not present, Question No 47, by Herman Vermeer, lapses."
"Question No 48 by Carlos Bautista Ojeda (H-0781/02):"
"Subject: Starting date for Third Road Safety Action Plan"
"In reply to question E-1265/02 of 26 April 2002 by the author of the present question, the Commission stated that it would issue a communication on the Third Road Safety Action Plan during the third quarter of 2002."
"However, from the remarks made by Commissioner de Palacio on Thursday, 12 September 2002 on the occasion of the first anniversary of the Red Cross road safety campaign it appears that the Third Plan will not be presented until 2003."
"Meanwhile, it has been stated in the European research programme FANTASIE that a situation of 'sustainable growth' or 'sustainable balance' in the European transport sector would entail a considerable increase in the use of two-wheeled vehicles."
"Can the Commission confirm the publication date of its communication on the Third Road Safety Action Plan?"
"Can it provide advance information on the specific road safety measures which this plan will contain for two-wheeled vehicles?"
"Mr President, the White Paper on European transport policy presents a range of measures which must be taken in order to improve road safety, as well as an action plan on road safety aimed at determining measures which will allow us to achieve by 2010 the global objective of reducing by half the number of fatalities resulting from road accidents in the European Union."
"This programme is being drawn up and it is scheduled to be adopted during the first quarter of 2003."
"Certain measures will refer specifically to two-wheeled vehicles and, in this regard, I would like once again to highlight the excellent work done by Mr Bautista Ojeda in this area."
"The general measures will also have significant positive consequences for the safety of drivers and passengers of two-wheeled vehicles."
"Mr President, thanks to the improvement in communication networks, particularly within cities, in population centres, pedestrianisation and the increase in the volume of four-wheeled traffic, the number of users of two-wheeled vehicles is increasing every day, as you have said."
"I would like to ask you, Commissioner, whether you are intending to implement any type of specific initiative to promote the use of two-wheeled vehicles, bearing in mind, furthermore, the current situation with regard to the cost of insurance, which is leading to a significant reduction in the numbers of these vehicles sold."
"Mr President, I can tell you that there will be specific initiatives."
"For example, in the programme on safety for cars, in the agreements with the car manufacturing industry, there is consideration of designs for cars which are less harmful in collisions with unprotected persons, that is, both pedestrians and users of two-wheeled vehicles (motorcycles, bicycles etc.)."
"Furthermore, it is necessary as always within the European Union to monitor true compliance with the existing traffic rules and codes, such as wearing helmets when riding a motorcycle, because we have detected that, on many occasions, what happens is that the legislation approved is unfortunately not applied or enforced strictly enough."
"Mr President, Commissioner, a lot of accidents involving two-wheeled vehicles occur mainly as a result of road works, barriers, divided carriageways, sections of road where the way is unclear."
"Is it also planned to develop a kind of best practice or a benchmark system for defusing accident black spots, which after all are known from past experience, so that in future road works will serve to make traffic safer and fewer accidents happen?"
"Lack of visibility affects two-wheeled vehicles and all vehicles in general."
"With regard to the design of barriers, I would like to say that Mr Bautista Ojeda has produced initiatives on several occasions."
"We in the Commission are studying whether it is true that, in the construction of barriers, there are shapes and designs which are less harmful and safer."
"We do not have any definitive conclusions about this yet but it is one of the issues we are analysing in order to increase security and prevent the terrible accidents which sometimes occur."
"Commissioner, my friend and colleague Carlos Bautista Ojeda has made a brief reference to this, but I would like to expand on one of the issues which he has raised: as you know, in the Spanish State users of two-wheeled vehicles have real difficulties finding companies who want to insure mopeds, motorcycles etc."
"Their only answer - in some cases - is to turn to the insurance compensation consortium. I do not know whether anything can be done in this regard, on the initiative of the Commission, because this is a great demand from the motorcycling sector: that there may really be insurance cover which is accessible and proportionate to the use, enjoyment and cost of motorcycles and two-wheeled vehicles in general."
"Mr President, all the issues relating to the internal market are more directly the responsibility of Commissioner Bolkestein, but in any event I take good note of what both you and Mr Bautista Ojeda have said to me and we will try to analyse it."
"This undoubtedly also relates to the problem of levels of danger and its physical and health consequences."
"Therefore, it is a question of taking action to improve safety in the moped, motorcycle and bicycle sectors, in other words, two-wheeled vehicles, but of course I will also study the issue of the problem of insurance."
"Question No 49 by Proinsias De Rossa (H-0786/02):"
"Subject: Protection of Ireland's rail freight infrastructure"
"Is the Commission aware of recent proposals from Ireland's government-owned rail freight operator, Iarnrod Eireann, to withdraw from certain rail freight operations?"
"This proposal would lead to an estimated additional 400 extra trucks involved in transporting freight by road each day."
"Ireland already has a serious traffic congestion problem due to inadequate road infrastructure, and any further shift from rail to road would greatly exacerbate this problem."
"Such a development would also run counter to the Commission's rail freight strategy."
"Will the Commission urgently raise this issue with the Irish Government and ensure its current strategic rail review leads to an internal freight policy consistent with the Transport White Paper? Will it seek a clear statement of the sums allocated to rail freight under the current and previous rounds of structural funds and of how it proposes to handle the evolution of a transport pricing policy, and a commitment that its future stewardship of the railway system will be consistent with the principles set out in the Transport White Paper?"
"Mr President, the transport White Paper clearly speaks of revitalising the railways throughout the European Union."
"In order to achieve this objective, the Community has taken various initiatives and has recently made proposals."
"The new European regulatory framework providing for the integration and interoperability of the market will allow rail companies to increase their competitiveness and orientate their business activities towards the growth of market sectors such as European goods services."
"The Union's financial aid for the construction or modernisation of rail infrastructures, as well as the elimination of bottle necks, creates the physical conditions necessary for the rail system to absorb a greater percentage of the expected future growth in transport volume."
"The Community has co-financed various projects for development of the trans-European rail network in Ireland."
"For example, in 2000, the projects received co-funding of approximately EUR 3 million from the trans-European networks budget and around EUR 16 million from the Cohesion Fund."
"Nevertheless, for reasons of subsidiarity, the Commission is prevented from going further than its own competences when it comes to designating or selecting the priority objectives for action of a particular government, at any particular moment, in a specific State of the Union."
"The Commissioner is probably aware that the Irish rail system is run by a state company in which the government is a shareholder."
"This state company has recently announced its intention to review its entire network, particularly the freight network, with the possibility that it may be closed entirely."
"Given that it is the objective of the Commission, and indeed of the European Union, that increases in traffic should be absorbed by the rail system, does the Commissioner not think that there is a conflict here between what we are seeking to achieve, in relation to the moving of goods in particular, and that he should at least talk to the Irish Government about establishing some coordination between the White Paper, the proposed national transport policy which the government claims it is working on, and the proposal to close the rail network in Ireland?"
"Mr President, Irish Rail has recently taken the decision to suspend any restructuring measures until a strategic study of the railways is published, and we expect this to be at the beginning of 2003."
"The Commission hopes that this study of the Irish rail system will take account, naturally, not only of general transport policy, but also of the investments made during recent years with Community funds in the Irish railway."
"Question 50 by Paul A.A.J.G. Lannoye (H-0793/02):"
"Subject: Air transport and noise"
"Following the adoption of Directive 2002/30/EC"
"Directive 2002/30/EC lays down objectives and methods for resolving the problems of noise pollution in areas close to Community airports."
"To this end, the directive describes measures which the States can apply in order to reduce noise and lays down a series of principles and rules on the methods for the evaluation of noise with a view to a reduction in levels of noise emissions."
"At the moment, the Commission considers it a priority to ensure the correct incorporation of this directive into national legislations of the States of the Union, which should take place by 28 September 2003 at the latest."
"This directive is one more measure in a series of measures intended to control exposure to noise around airports."
"With regard to the proposal for a directive on the establishment of a Community framework for the classification of noise emissions from subsonic civilian aircraft and for the calculation of noise charges, following the first reading by the European Parliament in September, it now falls to the Council to begin examining the proposed text."
"The Commission does not plan to create a single charter of rights for people living near airports."
"In accordance with the Rules of Procedure, Question No 51, by Mr Hatzidakis, will be replied to in writing."
"Questions to Mr Kinnock"
"Question No 52 by Gerard Collins, which has been taken over by Mr Hyland (H-0801/02):"
"Subject: New Berlaymont building"
"The main features of the contract on the purchase of the Commission's Berlaymont building were revealed on 23 October last."
"The Commission's total payment will be ?553 million and its share of the renovation cost is set at ?503 million which includes ?35.6 million for enlargement purposes."
"What provisions have been made for public access to the new Berlaymont building?"
"What savings does the Commission expect to make once the need for its present 'improvised arrangements' have gone and it has returned to its original headquarters and what innovative features have been introduced to ensure that the running costs of the Berlaymont are kept to the minimum and the building will act as a symbol for a dynamic European Union?"
"Question No 53 by Kathleen Van Brempt (H-0818/02):"
"Subject: Commission officials moving to private companies"
"The Commission encourages officials to move from the private to the public sector and vice versa."
"It even has arrangements allowing officials to work for a private company for a temporary period. That is a good thing in itself."
"However, the move by the head of the information policy division to Microsoft raises questions, as the official concerned was involved in the antitrust investigation into the company."
"The Commission's spokesman has stated that the official was consulted by the Competition Directorate-General in connection with the investigation. He said that this did not pose a problem, as the person concerned had given assurances in a letter that he would not deal, at Microsoft, with matters being investigated by the Commission."
"What guarantees does the Commission have that EU officials who go to work in the private sector will not pass on crucial information to their new employers?"
"Do written promises by those concerned provide sufficient guarantees?"
"Does the Commission agree that new rules on the secondment of EU officials are urgently needed?"
"If so, what precise steps does it intend to take?"
"As I also say in my question, I do not wish to dispute in any way that civil servants should be allowed to move on to new employment, including the private sector."
"But your reply does not entirely satisfy me, Commissioner."
"I want to believe in the good faith - I certainly do believe in your own good faith, let that be clear - of this civil servant."
"But an impression has been created."
"He was working on the anti-trust investigation into Microsoft and he leaves to join that company."
"I think it should be made explicit what case is involved here."
"I should certainly like to ask in future for a far clearer and more enforceable framework of agreements."
"Yes, a change of jobs must be possible, but not to companies or sectors on which you yourself have worked for the Commission because this will create the appearance of partiality that damages your Commission and by extension all European institutions."
"I should like once again to press the Commissioner on his future intentions."
"Is it feasible to create such a framework of agreements?"
"Mr President, yes it is possible to have such a framework which is why I referred to the proposals now before the Council made by the Commission."
"It is also why I referred to the further work that is being undertaken to clarify beyond any doubt for both potential employers and for Commission officials and former officials what the limits of activity are."
"Meanwhile, the official whose case is relevant to the specific question that the honourable Member asked was granted leave and permission to work for a company after he had signed a declaration that he was aware of his obligations under the Staff Regulations and would not disclose any confidential information to his employer."
"As she will understand and she was good enough to recognise both in her question and her supplementary question, in a free society, if we are trying to maintain the advantage of an interchange between the institutions and outside bodies, we must ultimately rely on the honour of civil servants as well as on the fact that they are advised and know that if they stray from the undertakings they have been required to give, they make themselves virtually automatically liable to disciplinary proceedings."
"It may be of interest to the honourable Member and the House to know that, at the moment, 566 officials of the Commission are on personal leave."
"Four hundred cases have so far been examined, all will be examined."
"About 10% - around about 40 people - are actually engaged in professional activities."
"The other 90% are on personal leave because of family or educational obligations or they are undertaking external courses."
"When we have the final figures in the first week or so of next year I will certainly ensure that the honourable Member receives those in detail."
"Thank you very much, Mr Kinnock."
"Questions to Mr Monti"
"Question No 55 by Astrid Thors (H-0828/02):"
"Subject: Investigation of possible infringements of EU competition law by Microsoft"
"Will the Commission confirm that any Commission decision resulting from its present investigation of possible infringements of EU competition law by Microsoft will be taken in view of the circumstances particular to European markets and to the interests of European consumers and will include remedies sufficient to end and prevent the recurrence of any business practices of Microsoft found to have been or continuing to be in breach of EU anti-trust rules?"
"Is the Commission aware that, in the United States, leading consumer voices do not in fact agree that the settlement recently agreed between Microsoft and the US Department of Justice is in the best interest of consumers, despite such assertions by the parties to that settlement?"
"On the question of at what point the Commission establishes that there is a dominant position, there is case-law made up of Commission decisions and judgments of the courts, on the basis of which further decisions are made."
"As to your question concerning the timing, our analysis of what is a very extensive file is well advanced."
"Once all the relevant information has been examined and assessed, we will be in a position to decide how best to proceed with the case."
"It would be realistic to expect a final conclusion in the first part of next year."
"Thank you very much, Mr Monti, for your reply."
"This brings an end to this Question Time."
"As the time allotted to questions to the Commission has elapsed, Questions Nos 56 to 102 will be replied to in writing."
"Mr Oswaldo Payá, allow me to express the emotion with which we welcome you today to award you the Sakharov Prize for freedom of thought."
"It has been difficult to obtain your leave and re-entry visa for coming to Strasbourg."
"I would like to thank all those who have worked to make it possible, including Members of the European Parliament who raised the matter with the Cuban authorities last week while there."
"I asked the President of the Government of Cuba, Mr Fidel Castro, to let you come to this ceremony as a signal from the Cuban authorities of their recognition of the human rights agenda."
"I am happy that this signal has been given to the European Parliament."
"My dear Mr Payá, you represent for many Cubans today what Andrei Sakharov represented in the 1980s for many Soviet citizens: you represent hope."
"Harassed, pursued, persecuted, prosecuted, condemned and imprisoned from your youth for your opinions, which were openly critical of the government's official policies, you nevertheless continue to work on constructing your movement, the Christian Liberation Movement for Peace."
"You advocate national dialogue to enable democratic change in Cuba."
"You are working tirelessly to create an alternative, non-violent democratic movement, based on a wide coalition."
"Using the existing legal and political framework, you want to introduce reforms in order to initiate a process of transition to pluralist democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms."
"Under your direction, the civil initiative 'the Varela project' was born."
"This initiative calls for a referendum on open elections, freedom of speech, freedom for political prisoners and free enterprise."
"To date, the project has attracted support from more than 100 organisations in Cuba and tens of thousands of individual signatures."
"Together with other opposition leaders, you drafted the manifesto 'Todos Unidos' and for the first time, thanks to your action, the opposition has united together on a single initiative: the Varela project."
"We recognise your endurance in the face of a barrage of obstacles."
"We recognise your personal courage."
"Your plan is not a theoretical construction; it does not promise heaven on earth but reminds people of basic principles for which so many have fought for so long: respect for human rights and fundamental democratic principles."
"Throughout the years, the European Parliament has taken the lead in keeping human rights high on the policy agenda."
"This is not, on our part, an abstract commitment; it was forged in the tragic experiences of Europe's barbaric twentieth century."
"It has been used over the last 50 years to construct a vision of Europe that has learned from, but not forgotten, its past."
"We are committed to the principles of democracy and respect for the universality and indivisibility of human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law."
"The Sakharov Prize celebrates that commitment annually."
"The Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought for 2002 is awarded to Oswaldo Payá, as a tribute to his commitment to freedom of thought, democracy and reconciliation of the Cuban people."
"We salute Oswaldo Payá's decision to use the pen and not the sword, to use signatures and not bullets, to use peace and not terror, as the pathway to democracy in Cuba."
"Mr Payá, to you, and through you to those who support the Varela project, we say today: 'We walk with you on your journey."
"You do not walk alone."
"You do not work in isolation.'"
"On your first ever visit anywhere outside Cuba, through you, Oswaldo Payá, the European Parliament honours all those who defend human rights, and their hard work and your hard work in building democracy from the grassroots level, step by step, person by person, day by day."
"I would like to thank the President, Pat Cox, and this Parliament, which represents many of the peoples of Europe."
"You have awarded the Sakharov Prize to the people of Cuba;"
"I say this because the Cuban people richly deserve such recognition."
"I say this without excluding any of my compatriots, whatever their political position, because rights do not have any particular political, racial or cultural allegiance."
"Nor do dictatorships have any particular political allegiance, they are neither of the right nor of the left, they are simply dictatorships."
"In my country there are thousands of men and women fighting for the rights of all Cubans in the midst of persecution."
"Hundreds of them are imprisoned simply for proclaiming and defending these rights, and I am therefore accepting this award on behalf of them."
"I say that this prize is for all Cubans because I believe that, by means of this prize, Europe wishes to say to them: 'You also have the right to rights'."
"We were all convinced of this, but there were times when it seemed that that truth was not so evident to many people in the world."
"I have not come here to ask for support for the opposition to the Cuban Government, nor to condemn those who persecute us."
"It is of no help to Cuba for some people in the world to take sides with the Cuban Government or with their opponents, on the basis of ideology."
"We want people to take sides with the Cuban people, with all Cubans."
"And this means supporting respect for all their rights, supporting openness, supporting the demand that our people be consulted through the ballot box on the changes we are demanding."
"We ask for solidarity so that our people may be given a voice through the ballot box, as the Varela Project proposes."
"Many people have related this prize to the Varela Project, and they are right, because the thousands of Cubans who, in the midst of repression, have signed this referendum petition, are making a decisive contribution to the changes Cuba needs."
"These changes would mean participation in economic and cultural life, they would mean political and civil rights and national reconciliation."
"This would represent the true exercise of self-determination for our people."
"We must put an end to the myth that we Cubans must live without rights in order to sustain the independence and sovereignty of our country."
"Father Félix Varela taught us that independence and national sovereignty are inseparable from the exercise of fundamental rights."
"The Cubans living in Cuba and those abroad, as one people, have the will and the ability to build a democratic, fair and free society, without hate or revenge, as José Martí dreamt: 'With everybody and for the good of everybody'."
"We have not chosen the peaceful route as a tactic, but because it is inseparable from the goal of our people."
"Experience shows us that violence creates more violence and that when political changes are carried out in this way, it leads to new forms of oppression and injustice."
"Our wish is that violence and force are never again used to overcome crises or unjust governments."
"This time we will carry out the changes by means of this civic movement which is already opening up a new stage in the history of Cuba, in which dialogue, democratic participation and solidarity will prevail."
"In that way we will build a true peace."
"The heroic Cuban civic fighters, the citizens who sign the Varela Project, are not carrying arms."
"We do not have a single weapon."
"We are holding out both arms, offering our hands to all Cubans, as brothers, and to all the peoples of the world."
"The first victory we can claim is that we do not have hate in our hearts."
"We therefore say to those who persecute and try to dominate us: you are my brother, I do not hate you, but you are no longer going to dominate me through fear, I do not want to impose my truth, and I do not want you to impose yours, let us seek the truth together."
"That is the liberation we are proclaiming."
"There are still some people who maintain the myth of the disjunction between civil and political rights, on the one hand, and the capacity of society to build social justice and achieve development, on the other."
"They are not exclusive."
"The lack of political and civil rights in Cuba has had serious consequences such as inequality, poverty for the majority, privileges for a minority, the deterioration of certain services, even when they are intended to be human and positive services."
"Therefore, although many Cubans have worked for years with love and good faith, today there is a serious situation in terms of civil and political rights, as well as increasing inequality and a deterioration of quality of life for the majority."
"Furthermore, the hands of the citizens are tied, neutralising the Cubans' enormous potential for creativity and hard work."
"That is the main cause of our poverty."
"This reality cannot be justified by claiming that the Cuban people freely chose this system."
"The honourable Members know that none of the peoples represented in this Parliament, nor any people in the world, would ever surrender the exercise of their fundamental rights."
"It is made ever clearer that social and economic well-being and progress are the fruit of the exercise of rights."
"In the same way, a democracy is not a true or complete one unless it is able to begin and sustain a process of increasing the quality of life of everyone. Because no peoples exercise their right to vote freely in order to chose poverty and inequality, which reduce the masses to a situation of disadvantage and marginalisation."
"Our Latin American peoples are calling for a real democracy, which is one within which justice can be built."
"It is scandalous that, in the name of efficiency, methods are applied which are intended to overcome crisis and end poverty, but which in practice threaten to annihilate the poor."
"It is not my intention to proclaim new positions or models, but our people have experienced and suffered various political and economic systems."
"We know today that any method or model which, in a supposed quest for justice, development or efficiency, places itself above human beings and cancels out any of their fundamental rights leads to some form of oppression, of exclusion and brings disaster to the people."
"We wish to express here our solidarity with all people suffering any kind of oppression or injustice, or who are silenced or marginalized throughout the world."
"The cause of human rights is a single one, just as we have one single humanity."
"While we talk today about globalisation, we declare that if we do not globalise solidarity we do not only endanger human rights, but also the right to continue as a human race."
"Without human solidarity neither will we conserve a clean world in which it remains possible for human beings to live."
"It is therefore my humble opinion that, rather than new models, either for societies or for relations between countries, what we need is a new spirit."
"This new spirit must be expressed through solidarity, cooperation and justice in relations between countries and will not hinder development. Because if policies and models are conditional upon the fulfilment of people, the construction of justice and democracy, if policies are humanised, then we will overcome the abyss which separates people and we will be a genuine human family."
"May our message from Cuba of Peace and Solidarity reach all peoples."
"All Cubans are accepting this prize with dignity and stating our hope that we can rebuild our society with the love of everybody, as brothers, as children of God."
"We Cubans are simple folk and we simply wish to live in peace and to move forward with our work, but we are not able and we do not wish to live without freedom."
"We place our hopes in the Lord, who was laid in a humble manger, and this is our homage to Him."
"Thank you and happy Christmas."
"(Standing ovation)"
"Madam President, I thank the Commissioner."
"His contribution was short and sweet but at this stage most of the talking has been done."
"I would like to thank my colleague in absentia, Mr Nisticò, for the enormous amount of work he has done on this particular directive."
"It has come back to us from conciliation quite satisfactorily."
"The final issue on which the debate rested was whether a doctor would be responsible for the assessment of the eligibility of donors, whereas the Council wanted a health professional and deemed that to be sufficient."
"The compromise is that both Parliament and the Council have agreed on a qualified health professional."
"In the spirit of conciliation that is quite satisfactory."
"Others might give it another name, but it gets us to where we want to be at this point."
"I thank all those who spent a lot of time and effort in getting to this position."
"The directive before us deals with the collection, testing, processing, storage and distribution of human blood."
"It is quite a contentious issue in many of our Member States, not least in our own."
"We have had a tribunal, known as the Lindsey tribunal, which was wound up recently, having sat for some time trying to resolve the very tragic cases of patients, many of whom have since died, who received infected blood."
"Other countries have had similar experiences."
"One of the most important aspects of this directive is that it will restore confidence in blood transfusion services generally and in the movement of blood and blood products throughout the European Union so we can all have confidence in other Member State systems in relation to it."
"This new directive, together with the existing Directive 89/381/EEC, will ensure that binding Community legislation will apply now to blood and blood products whatever the intended purpose."
"Apart from blood and blood products, it will also cover the whole area of patients donating their own blood prior to surgery in hospitals and cover regulation in that area specifically as well."
"There was quite a lot of contention at earlier readings on this directive as to whether all donations had to be voluntary or unremunerated."
"That should be the culture; that must be the ethos we foster."
"While we should never risk rare blood groups or rare blood products being unavailable to patients through our unwillingness to pay, that must be the exception."
"Payment can take many forms in terms of expenses or just compensating for lost hours at work, as distinct from profit in terms of payment."
"The views of the patient groups, which were very strong at first and second reading, were that we must not rule out remuneration, but it must not be the rule."
"We must continue with the voluntary ethos."
"I welcome the return of this report from conciliation and I hope it will not be too long before all our Member States transpose it and it becomes law."
"I should like to thank Mr Nisticò and Commissioner Byrne for the sterling work they have done on this matter."
"The outcome of the conciliation will mean our now having obtained high minimum levels of safety and quality where blood and blood components used for transfusion are concerned."
"Requirements are being set in terms of staff qualifications, the operation of blood banks, the testing of donated blood and also efficient supervision and monitoring."
"The most controversial issue has of course been that of whether blood should be given without the donors' actually being remunerated."
"I believe it is well documented that voluntary and unremunerated donation provides the best blood quality, especially if there is a permanent body of donors."
"The different rules in the Member States have meant, however, that we have not been able to decide that unremunerated donation should apply in all the Member States from day one."
"I am nonetheless very pleased that the directive now refers to the European Council's proper definition of unremunerated blood donation."
"I am also very pleased that the Member States are now to make arrangements for encouraging voluntary, unremunerated blood donation and that, every three years, they are to submit reports to the Commission concerning the arrangements they have made."
"Finally, I think it is important that the individual Member State be entitled to maintain or introduce the requirement for voluntary and unremunerated blood donation, a requirement that also includes a ban on the import of blood and blood components not donated in accordance with these principles of non-remuneration."
"I definitely think that the directive we have now arrived at will make an important contribution to the safety and the quality of blood donation in Europe."
"Madam President, Commissioner Byrne, on behalf of the Liberal Group, I in turn would like to thank our rapporteur, Mr Nisticò, for the quality and rigour of his work. It is a great pity he is not here this evening to reap the rewards, as it were."
"That said, I am glad that this joint text was adopted in the Conciliation Committee."
"It was vital to ensure the same high level of safety of blood donations and transfusions throughout the Union, just as all the improvements made to the legislative text throughout the procedure were vital."
"These improvements included, first of all, a great victory for blood donors and patients: the insertion of a specific chapter on blood monitoring which covers traceability and notification of incidents and serious unwanted reactions."
"The Liberal Group believed this to be particularly important, quite simply, I would say, because the need for this type of monitoring requires no further proof in Europe."
"Blood monitoring networks are a vital tool for making the transfusion chain as safe as possible."
"On the thorny issue of benevolent donations, my interpretation differs from that of Mr Lund."
"I am pleased to see that common sense has won the day, as of the second reading."
"I welcome the fact that the joint text, while strongly encouraging voluntary, benevolent donations - which is the aim of Article 20 - allows the Member States room for manoeuvre to use remunerated donors in a strictly-regulated environment."
"I need not remind you that the Union imports no less than 50% of plasma-derived therapeutic products, and that haemophiliacs, patients suffering from serious burns and other patients desperately need these products."
"In this regard, determined implementation of a policy to provide patients with recombinant factors is more necessary than ever in Europe."
"The Liberal Group also wanted the text to contain a reference to scientific and technical progress."
"This concern was addressed in Article 29, which, in particular, lays down clear guidelines for establishments performing blood transfusions."
"Lastly, the conciliation procedure has put the finishing touches to the excellent work carried out by the three institutions on this matter."
"The only point of contention, which I shall mention briefly, is the matter of medical examination prior to donation, which has already been raised."
"I am pleased, once again, that the Conciliation Committee considers it sufficient to require this examination to be carried out by a qualified health professional."
"I believe it is silly, as I have said since first reading, to go against certain national practices that give excellent results."
"I am thinking in particular, although not exclusively, of the awareness campaigns and donations in mobile units that could come to an end if we were to require the presence of a doctor."
"The European Union is not immune to accidents, of course, or even the appearance of a new virus."
"North America is currently experiencing a blood product safety alert caused by a virus from a western island."
"We must therefore increase monitoring, apply the early detection principle for any use of blood, and ensure traceability from donor to recipient."
"That is the price of establishing a blood chain that will renew the confidence of European citizens."
"Madam President, I am pleased to be able to speak this evening about this particularly important, even vital, matter, in the true meaning of the term. I am pleased on behalf of my group, the GUE/NGL Group, but also personally, as someone who has long been a staunch advocate of blood donation and a blood donor."
"Blood donations, as many will know, have an incomparable human dimension, which concerns us all."
"First of all, I shall state some telling figures."
"They only concern France, I am afraid, but I would imagine they could generally be applied to most of the Member States of the Union."
"In France, 8 000 donations are required every day to save 60 000 lives each year and carry out 800 000 transfusions."
"The victim of a road accident might need the participation of ten to thirty people to ensure their survival, and yet only 5% of people give blood."
"We are therefore entitled to ask why there are so few blood donors."
"I know the European Commission understood - and I thank it for that - a fundamental part of the problem when defining the objective of its proposal for December 2000."
"Its aim is to increase public confidence in the safety of blood and blood products and thus achieve self-sufficiency within the European Union."
"I shall not speak tonight about the contaminated blood scandals, which understandably shook this confidence and which, furthermore, brought down some political leaders who sinned through lack of vigilance, not to say incompetence."
"Without forgiving or forgetting anything, I would prefer to concentrate on three questions."
"What must we do now to restore this confidence?"
"How can we encourage people to give blood more frequently and persuade more people to give?"
"Thirdly, does the solution not lie in the remuneration of donors, as certain European States already practise this system?"
"In response to this last question, I would say straight away that the answer, for me, is 'no'."
"Definitely not."
"Blood and blood products are not goods."
"Incidentally, I would note that some people, here and there, and even in this Parliament, who vehemently defend ethical principles on matters relating to human genetics, have no problem defending the option of payment being given for blood, and therefore payment being given for the human body."
"I shall say no more for now, as I do not want to get angry."
"I must also, however, refer to the sickening trafficking that takes place in countries where people have no other means of survival but to sell blood or other organs."
"That is why we must stand firm on this matter, in order to avoid any deviation, scandal or attack on human dignity and the ethical principles we share and hold dear."
"Blood donations must therefore remain based on the principles of free consent, anonymity and benevolence."
"I feel this is something that should not even be up for discussion."
"Of course, we must distinguish between remuneration for blood as such and reimbursement of costs incurred in order to give blood: refreshments and snacks, reimbursement of transport costs, and time taken from work to give blood."
"The proposal put forward in this area is along the right lines."
"It has been strengthened and clarified to very positive effect by the European Parliament."
"I shall take this opportunity to congratulate Professor Nisticò warmly on the quality of his work."
"Lastly, it is important to emphasise certain essential points: blood quality and safety standards, more stringent specifications on the acceptability of blood and plasma donors, and testing of blood donations in the European Community."
"In conclusion, I would say that, in terms of the points that were the subject of contention, I can accept the results obtained through the conciliation procedure with regard to the guarantee of traceability and the quality of the staff directly involved in collection, testing, processing and storage."
"For all these reasons, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I can vote in favour of this report and would call on you to do the same."
"It is our responsibility to help increase public awareness of this gesture, which saves the lives of tens of thousands of people each year, a gesture that could be more common in future, so that our needs can be met in a human and ethical manner."
"Madam President, I would like to congratulate my colleague, Mr Nisticó, for the outcome of conciliation, which must be considered a good achievement from Parliament's viewpoint."
"Many of our aims were realised, and the directive must surely serve to contribute to general confidence both in the quality of donated blood and in the health protection of donors in an integrating Europe."
"For Finns the end result will not, however, be spot on, as it were."
"Parliament accepted my amendment regarding the non-remuneration of blood donation in the first reading in September 2001, but we had to yield in the end."
"We would have been very glad to see an unconditional principle of non-remuneration applied throughout Europe; now it is mentioned merely as a hoped-for goal, and not, unfortunately, as an obligation."
"In the actual Article that concerns non-remuneration the hope is expressed that blood and blood components should be derived as far as possible from this type of donation."
"The non-remuneration principle was resisted with the argument that it was hard to obtain rare blood products."
"I myself would have resolved the matter in individual cases without opening the floodgates to remuneration for all blood products."
"Many patient groups and authorities at one time appealed to Parliament not to allow the commercialisation of blood donation."
"First of all, there is a safety risk involved."
"There is also an ethical risk."
"We have a responsibility for the extent to which the rest of the world copies what we do."
"If we allow trade in human body parts and blood we have to consider that the less developed countries will follow Europe's example."
"This could lead not only to exploitation but increased risk."
"Furthermore, several Member States are signatories to a bioethical agreement which categorically forbids the economic exploitation of the human body and its parts, including blood."
"Finland does not, however, need to renounce its principle of non-remuneration, as the recitals refer to the rights of Member States to maintain stricter protective measures by virtue of the Treaty."
"I hope that when in time this directive is reviewed, we will also consider the part the principle of non-remuneration has to play."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with the other speakers who have said that this conciliation procedure went well from Parliament's point of view, considering the original position we were in."
"It is essential that matters like these that are so important for human life, such as the quality of blood and its safety, are guaranteed everywhere in Europe."
"For this reason, I think progress was being made in this matter when the objective was voluntary donation and non-remuneration."
"It must certainly be considered regrettable that this objective has not been fully realised, although I believe we shall move in this direction in future discussions on the subject."
"The wording of the conciliation decision also refers to this."
"As has been said here, blood or its components cannot be commercial goods."
"This is more about a gift from one person to another and that is the way it should be seen."
"When in conciliation the greatest worry in the final stages was what level of health professional should carry out a health examination of donors, in my opinion the final outcome was very good indeed."
"It is important that it should be a health professional: we also have to have confidence in others than those practising the profession of doctor."
"The next item is the Commission statement on the presence of nitrofurans and other prohibited substances in poultry and shrimps."
"Commissioner, you have the floor."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I think this is a very wide ranging and difficult subject."
"I have listened very carefully to what you have said and I come now to a topic that I would have liked to have put before you earlier in writing."
"But I believe that a joint effort may perhaps still elicit an answer from you."
"Nitrofurans is a generic term."
"One very important product it covers is Nifursol."
"Nifursol is the last histomonostat still to be permitted in the EU for use as an additive in poultry feed to prevent blackhead disease."
"I admit I am not a scientist."
"According to my information, however, experts say that this product was banned for good in Regulation 2377/90."
"The Scientific Committee for Animal Nutrition (SCAN) was asked by the Commission to make a risk assessment of Nifursol."
"Investigations that will give a definite answer have yet to be carried out."
"Because I also have the feed additives report, I have now heard the alarm bells ringing, because many who are concerned with this matter fear there will be a treatment crisis in a few months' time."
"As a logical consequence of the ban on nitrofurans in Regulation 2377/90, Regulation 1756/2002 was issued on 23 September 2002, banning Nifursol from 31 March 2003."
"When this ban comes into force on 31 March, there will, for example, be a crisis in the treatments used to combat blackhead disease in turkeys."
"No alternative remedy is available legally in the EU, either as a feed additive or as a veterinary medicine."
"The consequences of the ban will hit both fatteners and consumers."
"The consequences are a treatment emergency, a painful end for large stocks of birds, jeopardy for turkey farms, the development of an uncontrollable black market, and an increase in imports of poultry from third countries, where many substances that are banned in the EU are used with few or any controls."
"Only last week antibiotics of the nitrofuran group that are banned in the EU were found again in cheap imports of meat from third countries."
"Logically, mixed feed manufacturers will now have to stop using Nifursol by January 2003 at the latest if there is to be no more such feed in the silos by the beginning of March."
"My question to you this evening, although I do not know whether you can answer it, is: what solutions do we now have available?"
"Personally I find it hard to understand how the Commission can on the one hand, in the report in my possession, on the Commission's draft of which we worked very hard - approve the use of histomonostats,-- while on the other hand, in another regulation, banning the only product in existence on this market."
"I therefore have a few questions."
"What are we to say to the fatteners?"
"What are they to do?"
"What forms of treatment are available to them?"
"And secondly, is the Commission aware that European production is continuing to decline, is disappearing from the market in the European Union and that we are being increasingly exposed to third country imports of turkey meat, although we still do not know what quality standards those imports come up to?"
"I think I can be brief but would very much like to respond to the Commissioner's reply."
"I believe that it is particularly important to acknowledge the problem in the first instance."
"However, I had the feeling that the Commissioner did not wish to acknowledge at all that there is a problem at this moment in the Union as regards the presence of a number of forbidden antibiotics in, for example, chickens and prawns."
"We all know, Commissioner, that you are especially concerned and are making great efforts to ensure food safety and this House, across all party boundaries, supports you in that."
"But it is very important - and we still have doubts about this - that the same statutory framework should be applied to products produced in the EU and for products marketed in the EU."
"I believe this is precisely where the sticking point is."
"I come from Belgium where we had the dioxin crisis, which is certainly not unknown to you. On that occasion, the Commission acted in a draconian manner against Belgium."
"You were right, quite right to take strict measures and one of your main accusations related to the fact that the Member State failed to give sufficient information."
"I believe that we are now in a similar situation."
"We have no alternative but to acknowledge the problem and therefore we regret the fact that the inspection mission did not go ahead, since we are convinced that you did not have sufficient reason."
"I believe that it is absolutely unacceptable that trade relations should be revoked to ensure that certain inspections do not take place or that lower or different standards should be applied."
"I should have therefore preferred a number of more concrete answers to the questions, since I do not have the impression that you dealt with them properly."
"I also think that you can provide a better answer in order to reassure the consumer that what eventually finds its way onto his plate is safe."
"Madam President, Commissioner, there are two areas that give us cause for concern."
"The health of consumers is, of course, one of them, but there is also the position of producers here if we are not able to ensure that what may not be used here, may not be used outside the EU either."
"The question is, who produces these substances and how can they get into the European Union?"
"You have now said there are intensive controls, but - if I understood that correctly - foreign missions are unnecessary because we find bad conditions there anyway."
"So we do not need to go there."
"I have heard that today's meeting of the Standing Committee was to have discussed removing Thailand again from the list of countries that must be subject to special inspections."
"On what basis was that decision to be taken?"
"I have also heard that you have announced inspection missions to those countries for next year."
"What reason do you now have to assume that those missions will be worthwhile?"
"I think that, if these countries do not meet our requirements, they should be put on the list, and then they cannot supply us until they can guarantee that the products they supply to the European Union meet our standards."
"There is another problem that needs to be clarified."
"What happens to the shrimps, poultry meat and turkey that is imported into the Union and does not meet our requirements?"
"Is it sent back?"
"What is done with it?"
"As we have been saying about food waste for a long time, a ban is not enough."
"We saw that with the shrimps from China, which somewhere found their way into animal feed and by that route got into the food chain again."
"What I would therefore like is for you to put forward a clear plan that we, who have to justify ourselves as parliamentarians - including to the Commission - can stand by and say that the Commission, the European Union, is being strict enough here."
"We cannot have it perceived to be true that you say the Commission enters into trade relations with some countries and is less strict with them, even though doubts have arisen about that recently."
"I hope you will be able to clear this up in your reply."
"Madam President, it seems like only yesterday that the Commissioner and I were talking about other issues regarding the safety of some of these foodstuffs."
"Does the Commissioner still believe that his statement of 28 June was a necessary and sufficient answer to the concerns that have been raised?"
"He has just told us that the FVO missions to Brazil and Thailand, and probably elsewhere, were cancelled because 100% testing is now in place within the Member States."
"If the Commissioner did not say that, then I misheard him."
"It is certainly true that in some of those Member States - notably Germany and the Netherlands - considerable concern has been expressed about the degree of nitrofuran residues in poultry and the extent to which even a very sophisticated Member State cannot guarantee by itself the degree of testing."
"The issue is not only what happens within the Member State - as the Commissioner knows, there have been a whole series of rapid alerts during 2002."
"I would like to know how many rapid alerts throughout the European Union have been proclaimed in this calendar year as a result of this continuing anxiety about carcinogens like nitrofuran when residues are discovered in imports."
"I would like to know whether or not he feels that poultry imports from countries like Brazil give cause for serious concern."
"I would like the Commissioner to put on record the opinion of the Commission and its own residues experts on the number of tonnes of poultry from the states in question that have passed into the European Union without proper inspection."
"My information is that something like 2000 tonnes of Brazilian poultry have entered the EU in this way."
"How close does the Commissioner believe we are to achieving 100% safety testing in the Member States?"
"Why are these missions being postponed?"
"Is the SANCO DG under pressure from other directorates?"
"Are there questions here about endangering trade talks, meaning that one should not throw suspicion on any other states?"
"If that is the case, it is not a sufficient answer to give to those whose primary concern is - as is the Commission's - food safety."
"Finally, how soon will these proposed missions take place?"
"The Commissioner said earlier today in the debate on foot and mouth disease that he did not like disguised forms of protectionism - nor do I. However, I do not like disguised forms of concealment either, where there is a risk."
"If the money is not available and that is why these FVO missions have been postponed - tell us so."
"There are members of the Committee on Budgets here now."
"Parliament is very keen to support you, but we need candour in order to do it."
"Madam President, Commissioner, in the past we might have talked about pigs' ears, today it looks more like fishy goings-on."
"We read today in communication COM (2002) 422, which was presented yesterday, that a firm has imported shrimps with very high nitrofuran levels - 20 mg - from Vietnam via Ostend into Germany and then on to Austria and Luxembourg as well as selling them in Germany."
"How is that possible?"
"This communication is dated 25 November, but only today, nearly four weeks later, is there an early alert."
"Why were four weeks allowed to elapse?"
"I would like you to give me, and Luxembourg's consumers, a clear answer."
"My second question is this. On 2 October you relaxed controls for Vietnam."
"That is a Commission decision."
"I will read you what it says:"
"Mr President, firstly I would like to say how grateful I am to Members of Parliament for raising these important issues."
"Let me also say that I am sure all of you may well accept this as a valuable contribution to debates in Parliament but sometimes general questions are followed up by extremely detailed questions that can best be responded to in correspondence."
"However, I will do my best to answer such questions as you have raised."
"I have taken notes and if I am not able to deal with technical issues of a specific nature, I will respond to the questioner in writing."
"The issues that have been raised centre around the question of why the inspections were suspended and when these inspections will be resumed."
"As I indicated in my earlier contribution, these inspections were suspended either because there was a ban on the importation of products from that country or because in the two countries in question there was 100% testing in respect of all products coming from those countries."
"It is expected that the controls that are put in place in Member States effectively carry out the job that they are supposed to do because it is understood that these inspections have to be 100%."
"Therefore it is important that they reveal any residues in any of the foods that are designated for testing."
"When the tests show positive, I want to confirm, as I indicated earlier, that these products are destroyed."
"A number of you raised the question whether there were doubts about standards and whether there was any pressure being put on the Commission and on DG SANCO in particular by other DGs in relation to the carrying out of tests or the changing of procedures, either by suspending FVO inspections in third countries or by not doing so."
"I confirm to the House considerations of that kind never impinge on a decision in relation to food safety."
"I have made that point here in this Parliament on many occasions and I am happy to repeat it now."
"Inevitably you meet representatives from the developing countries that we are talking about and often others, sometimes Members of Parliament, who make the suggestion that perhaps the European Union is putting in place precautionary barriers in place of tariff barriers."
"This is an important issue and has to be taken into account, but I have always responded by saying that the protection of public health, the protection of consumers and the maintenance of the standards that consumers expect in relation to the importation of food must come first."
"I have to assure Members of Parliament who raised this question that the decisions that are taken in relation to these kinds of issues - testing for residues - are strictly based on the scientific analysis and judgement of the technical and scientific staff in DG SANCO, who give their advice as to the appropriate way forward in respect of these issues."
"No other political or trade consideration is ever taken into account."
"That simply does not happen."
"On the question of when the inspections will be resumed, that will happen in the spring, but there is not much point in sending inspectors to third countries - or the ones I have been describing - to carry out tests to determine what we know already, to confirm the continuation of either a ban or 100% testing."
"The only conclusion that is being suggested by those who raised this question is that, if these tests and inspections continue and if it is found that there are still residues or that 100% testing is an inefficient and inadequate response, we should there and then decide to put in place a ban on the importation of foods from those developing countries."
"That is a very serious decision to take."
"We have to determine whether it is a proportionate response to a risk that may exist to the consumers of the European Union, bearing in mind not just trade considerations but the kinds of consideration I am sure questioners have in mind here today."
"I know that you have concerns about the welfare of and benefits to developing countries also."
"This is not an inconsiderable issue."
"In deciding what is an appropriate response, we have to take into account all of these considerations and make sure that we come to proportionate responses."
"One of the most difficult aspects of my job in dealing with food safety is to come up with solutions that are proportionate."
"Very often, when you are too hard, people will point that out."
"Sometimes when they believe that you are too weak, the other side will point that out."
"It is not always possible to keep everybody happy on all occasions."
"But I am satisfied, bearing in mind the rigour with which inspectors from the Food and Veterinary Office carry out their work and the reports they make, which are made available to the public on the Internet for all of us to read, as well as the work that is undertaken by the control authorities in the Member States to ensure that where 100% testing is required, that is done."
"That appears to me to be the proportionate response to the risk that may have been identified."
"All the time we keep this under review."
"In the event that a problem arises, to the extent that it arose in China, it was felt that the only appropriate response in those circumstances was a ban."
"As a consequence, a ban was placed on the importation of chickens, crustaceans, honey and one or two other products."
"That was the appropriate response in those circumstances."
"If we come to the conclusion that is the appropriate response in respect of other countries which seek to trade with the European Union and send food here, as distinct from the continuation from a 100% control programme, that will happen."
"But we have not reached that view in respect of the two countries I have identified."
"The more detailed and technical questions that have been raised by many of you I have taken note of. I will ensure that each of you receives a response in writing in due course."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"Madam President, Mr Liikanen, ladies and gentlemen, I would like, first of all, to thank my 12 colleagues in the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee."
"I can see Mr Bowe, Mrs Schörling, Mr Lund, and Mrs Van Brempt, all of whom have firmly and vigorously defended consumers' right to safe, effective flame retardants."
"This joint text could not have been prepared without the efficient work of the Danish Presidency - who will receive the message - and the Commission either, of course."
"We have come so far since 16 January 2001, when the Commission submitted this proposal for a directive which, I would remind you, was aimed at prohibiting the marketing and use of pentabromodiphenyl ether alone, a brominated flame retardant used, in particular, in the manufacture of polyurethane foam, a chemical substance that is harmful to our environment and our health."
"It is found at high concentrations, in particular in breast milk, with a significant risk of contamination in infants."
"Logically, therefore, at first reading Parliament pronounced itself in favour of prohibiting pentaBDE in all its forms, thus confirming the red card that the Commission had shown it."
"There was therefore unanimity with regard to this first substance."
"Having said this, Parliament, in its vote of September 2001, also wanted this proposal to cover the two sister substances, octabromodiphenyl ether and decabromodiphenyl ether."
"Given the strong indications of the hazardous nature of octabromodiphenyl ether, both for the environment and public health, the European Parliament, once again with a very large majority, pronounced itself in favour of immediate prohibition."
"Parliament, however, chose to show decabromodiphenyl ether the yellow card, by proposing to defer its prohibition to 1 January 2006 at the latest and make it conditional upon the final results of a risk analysis."
"This approach strictly applied the precautionary principle and was not, at this point, shared by either the Council in its common position or the Commission in its amended proposal."
"In this kind of matter, where chemical substances are in the dock, debate is always tricky."
"We needed to establish a fragile balance between obvious advantages in terms of fire safety and equally proven disadvantages in some cases in terms of health and the environment."
"It is this balance in risk management, taking account of factors as varied as scientific risk assessment, proportionality and cost-benefit analysis, that was at the heart of the discussions within our Conciliation Committee."
"Three trialogues were eventually necessary to bring together the various points of view and reach a compromise that was acceptable to all, mainly where decabromodiphenyl ether was concerned, since, I must emphasise, as regards octabromodiphenyl ether, the pressure exerted by Parliament paid off."
"This pressure contributed to the swift, eventually negative conclusion of the risk assessment and convinced the Council to support us in prohibiting the use of this substance."
"In the case of decabromodiphenyl ether, the insertion in the joint text of a recital inviting the Commission to immediately assess the results of the risk reduction strategy, expected by 30 June next year at the latest, seems to me to be objectively the first compromise we have been able to achieve at this stage because, in this case, contrary to the case of octabromodiphenyl ether, in the absence of a final risk reduction strategy and, in particular, in the absence of risks to human health - the conclusions of the French rapporteur are definite in this regard - this deferment accompanied by strict conditions is justified."
"It should, however, be pointed out that decabromodiphenyl ether, which is mainly used in insulating products, in construction and textiles, is a particularly effective, fire-resistant flame retardant."
"In the United Kingdom alone, in the year 2000, 155 lives were saved and 4 537 injuries avoided by the presence of this kind of substance in furniture upholstery."
"So much effort has been put into reaching this agreement in the Conciliation Committee."
"I sometimes had the impression, as rapporteur, that I was acting as a member of the European office for chemical products rather than a representative elected directly by the citizens because of the cumbersome, slow risk assessment process with little transparency."
"It has taken almost ten years for brominated fire retardants, which are included in the list of priority substances, to be assessed at last."
"I sincerely hope that this textbook case will enable the Commission and, in particular, the Member States, to understand the need, when preparing future legislation on chemical products, to establish a new assessment method that is swifter, more effective and more transparent, a REACH system which, as proposed by the resolution adopted by Parliament in November 2001, is based on a genuine risk management strategy at Community level."
"In conclusion, and I shall go back to my footballing metaphor, whereas the Commission, in its initial proposal, only gave half a red card to pentabromodiphenyl ether, Parliament and the Council, as fair, impartial referees, give two red cards to pentabromodiphenyl ether and octabromodiphenyl ether and a yellow card to decabromodiphenyl ether, as the essential aim is to reconcile citizens' immediate safety from fire hazards with the more long-term benefits in the field of public health and the environment."
"The joint text to be submitted to Parliament tomorrow fulfils this dual objective."
"For all these reasons, I would ask my fellow Members to support it."
"Madam President, I wish to begin by thanking Members for their interest in this proposal and especially Mrs Ries, the rapporteur, for her constructive work, as well as the delegation of the European Parliament in the Conciliation Committee."
"This is an important directive, as it would introduce a ban on substances that have been identified as dangerous brominated flame-retardants posing unacceptable risks to human health and the environment."
"It is a far-reaching proposal as it bans the marketing and use of all articles containing these substances."
"The proposed directive will therefore encourage the marketing and use of safer alternatives."
"Furthermore, the proposed directive provides not only for the protection of human health and of the environment but it would also preserve the internal market, as it would introduce harmonised rules throughout the Community."
"The conciliation procedure that is about to be concluded has benefited from the fact that the risk assessment and the risk reduction strategy for ocataBDE became available in July of this year."
"We were therefore able to include 'octa' in this directive."
"The Commission believes that this is a positive outcome."
"Considering the discussions about the extension of the ban to the third brominated flame retardant, decaBDE, this requires further examination and finalisation of the currently ongoing risk assessment."
"Simultaneously, a risk reduction strategy will be developed."
"This is an important step in the procedure."
"It will allow the right balance to be found between the protection of health and the environment, on the one hand, and the need for effective fire protection on the other."
"As the risk assessment procedure and the risk reduction strategy will be completed in the next few months, the Commission will soon be able to propose justified measures."
"In conclusion, I am very glad about the successful cooperation between the European Parliament and the Council and hope that this important directive can now be finalised."
"Madam President, like the previous two speakers I welcome this report and I praise the rapporteur for her work."
"The initial proposal to ban the use of the flame retardant pentaBDE was not considered by Parliament to be adequate, as closely related substances - octaBDE and decaBDE - were not included."
"Furthermore, Parliament was dissatisfied with the speed at which the risk assessment was being carried out, as this was delaying any real concrete decisions."
"No one underestimates the value and importance of these substances: they are very effective flame retardants and they save lives."
"However, they appear to have dangerous effects on the environment and public health and, therefore, we felt something had to be done."
"I am sure that Parliament is pleased that the original proposal is now developed and that octaBDe has also been banned."
"However, Parliament cannot be totally happy about the fate of decaBDE, which remains to be decided."
"Parliament would like a clear date for action on this."
"The fate of this remaining substance is still hanging in the balance."
"We need clear reassurance from the Council and the Commission - by way of an insertion of a paragraph in the text during conciliation - that prompt, immediate action will be taken when the results of the risk assessment become available, as promised, in June 2003."
"I hope the Commissioner will confirm that tonight."
"On this basis, the PSE Group can support this proposal, which will be put to the vote tomorrow morning."
"Mr President, I should like very much to thank Mrs Ries for the sterling work she has done on this matter."
"It is of course a good example of the European Parliament's being able to promote the protection of the environment and of public health in Europe."
"The Commission only proposed a ban on the marketing and use of one of the dangerous flame retardants, pentaBDE, and, following demands by Parliament, the directive was successfully extended so that the final result arrived at by the conciliation committee also includes two further flame retardants."
"With regard to octaBDE, the risk assessment has clearly revealed that the substance entails obvious risks for the environment and public health, and it has now also, happily, been agreed to implement an immediate ban on the use of this substance."
"As far as the third substance, decaBDE, is concerned, the Member States and the Commission, on the other hand, initially maintained their opposition to a ban."
"A majority of the conciliation committee chose to defer to that state of affairs, so that decaBDE is only included in a recital in the directive and - if, quoting Mrs Ries, I may put it this way - has only been given a yellow card."
"It is safe to say that it will be the environment and public health that, for some time still to come, will now bear the risk of the use of this substance."
"I find that very unfortunate, and it illustrates of course the importance, in the chemicals area, of our being able to reverse the burden of proof so that it is the producers who have to show that the substances they use pose no risk to the environment and to human beings."
"Unlike Mrs Schörling, however, I believe that the outcome, whereby the result of the conciliation is being adopted, is, in spite of everything, a clear improvement upon the current situation."
"That is why I shall vote in favour of the conciliation proposal and the outcome of the conciliation in the final vote tomorrow."
"Mr President, there was a direct question about the timing of the Commission proposal."
"As I said earlier, the opinion of the Scientific Committee in its risk assessment procedure will be completed in the next few months, and then we can complete the risk reduction strategy."
"If that is the case, the Commission will be able to make a proposal by June next year."
"My reply to Mr Bowe is therefore 'yes'."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Madam President, this is a difficult text."
"Over the last 18 months a lot of people have asked me, 'What is all this that you are doing in Europe with electronic waste?"
"What is the point of it?'"
"The point is quite simply that a few years ago we in the European Union decided that we wanted to operate a sustainable policy in the economic, environmental and social fields."
"Six million tonnes of electronic waste every year contain an enormous quantity of valuable materials that we want to reuse in future."
"That is the reason for this directive."
"I would like to extend my sincere thanks to the members of the Conciliation Committee, and also to the Commissioner and the members of the Council who, I think, have scored a minor victory with this report on electronic waste."
"They enabled us to reach agreement on difficult points."
"We were, for example, able to state that from 2005 consumers will be more or less enjoined by their Member States - I would have preferred it to have been compulsory - not to throw appliances in the dustbin in future, but to collect them separately."
"We have set binding targets."
"Unfortunately, Europe is always outstanding in its unlimited use of undefined legal terms."
"The hurdles we have set in this directive today are not very high, but they are nevertheless defined and binding."
"I think that can be called a success."
"Unfortunately, we are still rather vague about how such materials will be treated in future, but we have used the best available technology."
"I know only too well that in my country the term 'best available technology' is interpreted in 16 different ways, because Germany has 16 federal states."
"There are bound to still be loopholes, but we have nevertheless made real progress in the field of recycling quotas, too."
"I believe the quotas for industry are achievable and no one can say we are asking too much."
"In 2005, citizens will be able to take their products to a collection point free of charge, unless the Member State goes a step further."
"The Member States can decide that individually."
"I think our agreement on 'individual financing' was a great success."
"It is a step forward because we would like to have a guidance instrument and those who today are building computers that lend themselves to recycling - like this one, for example - should also be rewarded and those who want to continue producing boring old-fashioned ones in the future should be asked to contribute to the high costs of disposal."
"There were actually countries that did not want to take this approach."
"I am pleased to say that by working night and day with the help of other members in other groups we were able to persuade them to agree after all."
"Following on from the packaging regulation and the end-of-life vehicles regulation, this individual liability is the first step towards a really sustainable environmental policy which, combined with economic policy, has my full support."
"We may have succeeded in shutting out the free riders that there always are with such a system."
"There are big firms that order 100 000 refrigerators from the Pacific region just before Christmas and fail to put a logo on them so that the small trader or the citizen has to pick up the bill later."
"We have made labelling compulsory so that the costs can also be assigned and resources will be available for recycling, however the Member States do it - and we are more than willing to leave that to subsidiarity."
"The important thing is the guarantee that it is done, and the text reflects that concern."
"That old appliances must be managed and also paid for - in this case collectively - by the undertakings currently in existence on the market is not in question because there is no other system for doing it."
"We have, however, left Member States the possibility of disclosing how it is financed so that there can be a 'visible fee', or whatever you want to call it, for old stock."
"I believe this was also a good step."
"I would have been pleased if, when debating end-of-life vehicles and electronic waste, we could have had a more aggressive and longer debate about how we might do more to encourage a flow of secondary raw materials in future."
"Unfortunately, we are still very fond of using new primary materials but always tend to turn up our noses at secondary materials."
"I might go so far as to say we should give such secondary raw materials preferential VAT treatment."
"That is not necessarily my group's normal position."
"I do, however, believe it would be an incentive to bring about real sustainability in this area."
"That is what it is really about, ladies and gentlemen."
"We want to reuse raw materials in future."
"By motivating undertakings to build appliances in such a way that they can be recycled, we have found a free-market way of getting the parties concerned round the same table, and I do not need to tell anyone that for me that is an important reason."
"I was also very pleased to have the NGOs fighting alongside us on this question and that the undertakings and NGOs adopted a joint resolution in support of our efforts."
"Nothing like that has happened before in the time I have been in this House - and that is thirteen and a half years."
"I would at this point also like to thank those colleagues who stayed on board in difficult moments."
"There are always plenty who fall by the wayside when the going gets tough."
"Again and again colleagues stuck with it whenever there was pressure from the Council, and in the end, that gave us this success - as did the excellent cooperation you gave us, Commissioner."
"Basically, though, this directive does have two parts."
"The second part is the question of how we are to deal with hazardous substances such as cadmium, lead and hexavalent chromium in future."
"I think we have made a small amount of progress here."
"Ultimately, this is about collecting and concentrating, for example, stray lead from light bulbs, small radios and small appliances with which we are all familiar."
"Ten tonnes of lead in one place are absolutely harmless."
"The same amount in small pieces all over the place, however, is a problem."
"The Japanese, for example, have shown us very promising approaches here, and we are now making clear to manufacturers, with appropriate incentives, that in the long term we want to create a society where these highly dangerous substances are more and more a thing of the past."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to say a personal word to my personal colleagues who have been very busy here, working long hours and sometimes through the night.."
"May I once again thank my colleagues, you, Commissioner, and your staff, who always rendered us excellent assistance whenever we were faced with major questions."
"I was proud of this European House and would be pleased if in future things could continue in the same way with the next directives."
"Madam President, I would also like to thank the Conciliation Committee for its constructive work."
"It has been a very good success for Parliament and indeed for the European citizens."
"Waste from electronic and electrical equipment is now one of the fastest growing waste streams in the European Union."
"As the Commissioner has said, it constitutes almost 14 kilograms per head and is growing by at least 3% to 5% every year."
"Electronic and electrical equipment is one of the largest known sources of heavy metals and organic pollutants in the waste stream."
"Without proper pre-treatment the highly toxic components can contaminate soil and ground water, as well as polluting the air."
"The directive can be seen as one of the basic instruments for an integrated product policy, where the whole life cycle of a product will be taken into consideration and eco-design can be promoted."
"The need for business to adapt to a changing agenda, taking more account of environmental concerns, is becoming more widely accepted."
"Indeed business and the environmental NGOs have been on the same wavelength during this process, which is not always the case."
"It is also accepted that countries and industries which innovate more quickly will end up being more competitive than those which delay."
"The adoption of this directive will be a signal in that regard."
"The guiding principle behind the directive is the extent of producers' responsibility."
"The objective of the EPR is to make producers financially responsible for their products when these become waste so an upstream effect is created which leads to design for the environment, taking account of the durability, repairability or upgrading, disassembly or recycling of the product."
"In addition there is reuse of resources and separate collection, and hazardous substances contained in the WEEE are prevented from entering the environment."
"The directive also applies the principle of internalisation of external costs."
"Costs of disposal, which up to now have been borne by local authorities, usually as part of waste disposal, are now to be internalised and provision made for the reuse, recycling and demanufacture of this equipment."
"Hence the ultimate aim is waste prevention, thus sustainability."
"Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, I shall be brief for two reasons."
"Firstly, I find it rather silly having the same debate here with exactly the same people for the third time in plenary."
"The second reason is perhaps more important, however, and strikes a very positive note."
"This can scarcely be called a debate; these are statements by people who actually agree with each other to a large extent."
"That is the nice thing about the procedure we have been through since, during the first reading, that was absolutely not the case."
"During the discussion we have gradually come closer together."
"In that respect, we are a strong Parliament and a strong delegation in the negotiations."
"As a result, the major aspects that we put forward have actually emerged."
"It is no coincidence that the rapporteur should have dwelt at length on the concept of individual producer responsibility."
"I shall not expand on it yet again, but it is of crucial importance."
"It constitutes a precedent and it is the way in which we must proceed in the months and years ahead in our environmental policy."
"And yet, I should like to set that straight. It is not a matter of collective organisation, but of collective funding."
"I should like to mention a few other points that are important because none of them have been fully achieved."
"I am thinking, for example, of binding targets."
"It is true that we have binding targets, but we had to rein in the level of these."
"We went from 6 to 4 kilograms."
"I do not wish to make a particularly big issue of this, for the simple reason that I have seen how in my country, Belgium, we have managed, in one year in Flanders, to collect 4 kilos and are increasing that figure at an extremely fast rate."
"I am also saying this to my British fellow MEPs."
"I should like to invite them to Belgium."
"We are not top of the class in the environmental field, but, as regards waste prevention and waste recycling, we are."
"We are doing that to tight deadlines."
"If the political will is there, you can meet tight deadlines."
"That is why binding targets are good in themselves."
"What I find particularly deplorable is the question of exporting."
"We simply export a host of problems."
"In that respect, we have not achieved our target for legal reasons."
"I accept this regretfully, but I think we must ensure that this problem is solved through other means."
"I conclude with a final point that I personally have always defended, namely recycling."
"The principle is contained in the directive."
"I hope that, next time, we shall be able to achieve concrete targets regarding recycling too."
"It remains for me to thank the rapporteur and my fellow MEPs most warmly for the pleasant cooperation we have enjoyed in the course of the night."
"I learned a lot and enjoyed myself greatly."
"Mr President, now I know at last how European laws are really made."
"They are made in the Council of Ministers building by exhausted people shouting at each other in corridors in the middle of the night - and the rapporteur and the Commissioner will know exactly to what I am referring."
"If I am asked to give an example of the way in which the principles of sustainable development can be put into practice, then this directive may well be it."
"If I am asked about the burden of new regulations which Parliament sometimes places upon industry in the cause of environmental improvement, I will proclaim this directive as an example of the way in which industry and Parliament can work together."
"It is a splendid piece of legislation."
"It is not the end, but it is a good beginning and much credit goes to both the Commission and our rapporteur."
"I am particularly pleased with the principle of individual producer responsibility, which has been so firmly embraced."
"Within the last week we have seen two good illustrations of the way in which industry is responding to it professionally and effectively."
"Four of the major manufacturers of electrical goods, including our chief lobbyist, Electrolux, have teamed up to develop a common approach to waste management which aims to be both innovative and cost efficient."
"And the mobile phone manufacturers of the world have agreed to cooperate to ensure the environmentally sound management of their end-of-life products."
"My principal concern relates to - and I echo Mrs Doyle's words - the implementation of the directive."
"Just a few weeks ago government representatives in that room in the Council committed themselves to this legislation at the conciliation meeting."
"It is all supposed to be transposed into national law in about 18 months' time."
"But judging from our experience with the end-of-life vehicles directive, that will not be the case so far as many Member States are concerned."
"The UK Government has still not transposed Mr Florenz's legislation."
"I hope the Commission will take advantage of the European Convention to present some proposals to change the enforcement procedures to stop Member States getting away with breaking their commitments and playing the system."
"Finally, the text of Article 4 was the matter I referred to in my opening remarks."
"I tabled the draft to try and deal with the problem of printer cartridges, many of which are not being recycled for anti-competitive reasons and are instead ending up in poisonous dumps in China."
"I hear that, sadly, the UK Government is trying to wriggle out of the intended requirement to prevent producers from making their reuse difficult by claiming that these products are consumables."
"It will probably take a British judge to make them recognise the obvious truth, that a cartridge fitted with an electronic chip is an item of electronic equipment."
"I hope that other Member States will take the lead in this and in other respects in putting this directive fully into practice, and show by example just what a commendable piece of legislation this directive will prove to be."
"I wish you and members of the conciliation delegation, and the Commissioner and her staff, a merry Christmas."
"I should also like to congratulate rapporteur, Mr Florenz."
"This is an historic breakthrough."
"Ten years ago, we, as the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, proposed individual producer responsibility in the packaging directive."
"At that time, we were laughed out of court."
"We have a packaging directive that, as we say in the Netherlands, 'is not worth a light', and that is because there is shared responsibility between the government and the producer."
"In the case of car wrecks we were almost successful two years ago."
"In that case, the manufacturers are largely responsible, and it is interesting to see that German industry, which at the time was so opposed to the move, now takes full responsibility."
"Tomorrow, we shall have achieved our goal, moreover: the manufacturers will become one hundred per cent responsible for electrical and electronic waste."
"It is not the case that the industry was united on the matter."
"The largest company in the field in my country, Philips, was decidedly antagonistic."
"The fact that we in this House achieved a compromise between the various groups as early as the first reading and held our ground up to the night-time session with its accompanying noisy exchanges contributed, however, to our success and, for that, I should like especially to thank Mr Florenz most sincerely."
"Mr President, the concerns about increasing quantities of electrical and electronic equipment entering the waste system have been well rehearsed."
"There can be no dispute that this type of waste is a problem."
"Furthermore, there is no dispute that the problem will continue to grow."
"However, there is a world of difference between agreeing that something is a problem and agreeing with a proposed solution."
"My purpose in making this address, therefore, is to enter into the record my total disagreement with this directive."
"My central objection is that the directive is economically illiterate."
"Its effect will be to create massive quantities of materials in a highly volatile market."
"When quantities increase as a result of this directive, the value of recycled materials will drop, making the economics of recycling extremely uncertain."
"On this basis, producers and eventually their customers, are being asked to sign a blank cheque."
"Neither does any serious consideration seem to have been given to the problem of labour recruitment."
"Salvaging materials is highly labour-intensive yet the work is unattractive."
"Either wages will have to go up sharply to meet the demand for more staff or the scheme will be bedevilled by labour shortages."
"The recycling plants required to meet this directive are highly capital-intensive."
"With such uncertain returns it seem unlikely that there will be any commitment to providing the necessary facilities."
"Finally, I have to add to a list of objections that is by no means complete the fact that, as we have learned to expect from EU legislation, the system is highly bureaucratic, adding massive overheads and a totally unnecessary burden on industry."
"It also requires Member States to create yet more criminal offences to regulate the commercial market."
"Is turning our businessmen into criminals really what European unity is really all about?"
"Is this really what Monnet planned?"
"Surely there is a better way."
"Logically, if there are tax breaks for companies which use recycled materials and import controls which favour equipment with high proportions of recycled materials as well as tax breaks for companies that process the materials, this would create a market."
"One could find that, as with the car batteries' recycling - before the EU destroyed it - a new market would be created."
"Properly designed such a scheme could permit end-users to be paid for delivering waste material, which is exactly what happened with car batteries and the reason why - before the EU intervened - we managed to recycle over 80% of car batteries."
"With that degree of cooperation the most expensive part of the scheme - collection costs - are minimised."
"It seems that, whenever there is a choice between a simple and effective scheme and one that is costly, bureaucratic and inefficient and also criminalises the business fraternity, the European Union always goes for the latter."
"If you need an explanation as to why there is growing disenchantment with the European Union, just look at this directive and the many more like it."
"Mr President, the report by my colleague, Mr Florenz, is one of the most important achievements this parliamentary term from Parliament's point of view."
"Firstly, producers are now to be made responsible for the complete life cycles of the equipment they sell."
"The unambiguous application of individual producer liability is something that I, as the person who originally proposed the amendment, am especially glad about."
"This is precisely the way we can ensure that product design takes account of the environment and therefore the directive's whole viability."
"If producers know they are the ones that have to pay when equipment reaches the end of its life cycle, they will minimise costs beforehand and ensure that as little waste as possible is created and that that small amount has maximum potential for recycling."
"Parliament's wish to prevent anyone from getting a 'free ride' has also been taken into consideration in a fair way, inter alia, by demanding that producers should provide a guarantee to cover costs when products are released for sale."
"Secondly, we have to mention our rapporteur's splendid solution regarding the obligation to recycle, something that has been fully achieved, but regarding which there has to be evidence of a rate of four kilograms of waste per inhabitant a year."
"Thus, not a gram of waste is to remain without someone taking responsibility for it, although for various practical reasons - and this was the compromise that was finally reached during conciliation - the obligation regarding evidence itself is in respect of just 4 kilograms."
"The entire chain, therefore - producers, importers, dealers, consumers, organisers of waste disposal and recycling, and the authorities - will each be in a responsible position, but the balance of responsibility among them that has been found is excellent."
"Furthermore, market mechanisms have been used just as they should: there will be positive incentives to encourage more ecological behaviour."
"Unfortunately, it has to be said that the position taken by the Council right up to the last moment to solve the question of costs would not have worked in this way and it would not have had such an ecological impact, although it might have been tempting for Member States in terms of taxation."
"I hope that the Member States also find a fair solution regarding how collection facilities are organised."
"In so far as it is possible, it will be the responsibility of the local authorities, and the producer's liability for costs starts at the collection point."
"I believe that we have found an excellent model in the WEEE Directive, which, hopefully soon, we will be able to apply to many other product groups."
"When the Commission is drafting proposals on these may it be encouraged by the unanimous support we have had for the proposal now before us from environmental and consumer organisations, as well as the industry itself."
"Mr President, I agree with everyone who has spoken tonight."
"This is a substantial and very important proposal."
"When fully implemented it will bring about a transformation in the culture of recycling in many Member States."
"The rapporteur can be truly proud of his work and he is to be congratulated on it."
"The requirements in these two proposals: firstly, to ensure recycling of substantial quantities of waste electronic and electrical goods, and, secondly, to ensure substantial reductions in the amount of hazardous substances in these products will be technically and financially very difficult to achieve for many people."
"Patience must be shown with some Member States that are starting from scratch and have very little infrastructure for recycling."
"In particular we cannot expect the new accession states to achieve easily or quickly the high levels of recycling of these products that already exist in some more advanced Member States."
"We can be pleased that individual consumers can expect to return their waste appliances free of charge, and that the primary responsibility for collection and disposal of waste electrical and electronic goods will be with the producer."
"However, we may see the unfortunate situation of local authorities - and consequently local taxpayers - dealing with orphan and some historic waste."
"In that situation, the governments that have agreed to this proposal have a responsibility to support financially this necessary work."
"Despite all the difficulties that I foresee in implementing this proposal in parts of the Union, we are taking a very important step tonight and tomorrow when we vote on it - it brings us all a very practical step forward towards a sustainable future for the European economy and a sustainable future for all."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to thank Mr Florenz for this report."
"I would particularly like to thank him because he initially took quite a different position on the end-of-life vehicles directive."
"I think it is a sign of greatness to change your position and make clear that producer liability is possible."
"If we had not found so satisfactory a solution to the problems with the end-of-life vehicles directive, we would not have been able to adopt this directive, either, because it would not have been evident why some were excluded from producer liability and others not."
"I therefore believe it is a very great success not only for the environment but also for consumer protection."
"I think it is very important that consumers will in future be able to have greater certainty that prices are telling the ecological truth and that consumers need not buy new hardware with every new software program."
"In this way, we are also giving industry incentives to pursue not only environmentally friendly policies but also consumer-friendly ones."
"I think it is very important that we have succeeded in arranging this individual financing and also that we were able to prevent the Council having its way and that small and medium-sized undertakings will not be released from liability."
"I would, however, also ask the Commission to strictly control and enforce this individual financing later."
"Only then will this directive really be a milestone in environmental and consumer protection."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to begin by offering Karl-Heinz Florenz my warmest congratulations."
"He has put his heart into his report, he has fought for it and I believe he has achieved a good result."
"I believe putting the focus on firms' own liability goes to the heart of the problem."
"In future, these firms will be able to participate in public tenders, serve local and regional public institutions and invite tenders."
"That means things can get much cheaper for consumers."
"One problem that of course arises for small and medium-sized firms is how they are to provide a guarantee for various services."
"The question of how they are to provide such guarantees in the future is raised at this very time with the Basel II rules, which are all about creditworthiness, securities and transparency."
"It is important that national, regional or local political decision makers give some thought to how they can help small and medium-sized undertakings over guarantees in the future."
"Another point is the bans on substances."
"I think the Commission should be very careful to ensure that proof of sustainability is furnished in the next three years, so that we can see that these bans really do make for a better, more sustainable, more ecological performance."
"Consumption and costs must not be allowed to increase in certain areas because of the bans, putting a counterproductive burden on the system."
"All in all, I believe the discussion has been most worthwhile."
"I would also like to sincerely thank the Commissioner because it is also an important forward-looking step in the area of refuse and waste and because small and medium-sized firms are being given completely new opportunities here."
"Thank you very much, Mr Rübig."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report (A5-0435/2002) by Eija-Riitta Anneli Korhola, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive on public access to environmental information and repealing Council Directive 90/313/EEC (PE-CONS 3667/2002 - C5-0512/2002 - 2000/0169(COD))."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to thank the Commission for the great support that Parliament has received during a legislation process that has lasted two and a half years."
"I do not believe that the result we have now achieved would have come anywhere close to the success it is without that support, even though Parliament's will has been unambiguous and unwavering the whole time."
"I myself have been a steadfast advocate of Parliament's opinions, as in many ways we are dealing with matters that have to do with Parliament's essential function."
"First of all, with this directive we are granting the public important new rights."
"Secondly, we are endorsing the principles of good administration and transparency."
"Thirdly, we are promoting sustainable development in the manner outlined at the Rio Summit."
"In addition, we are ensuring that our citizens have a healthy environment."
"It would be impossible to fit more central issues to the European Parliament than these into a single directive."
"The exceptionally large number of differing opinions with regard to amendments was a special challenge during conciliation."
"Furthermore, we observed that the Council, once we had actually achieved conciliation, was not at all willing, according to the country holding the Presidency, to produce a directive."
"If Mr Florenz's report can be considered a great victory for Parliament in terms of its content, this directive of mine is one of Parliament's greatest victories for the very reason that we were able to achieve a positive solution in spite of the Council digging its heels in."
"This is not just any solution, either."
"This is a directive that represents Parliament's opinion in a significant way and one that meets the minimum requirements of the Århus Convention fully and even goes beyond them."
"The most important details of the outcome of conciliation are those that relate to exceptional circumstances."
"As a result of conciliation the opportunities to resort to these are limited, meaning real transparency can be achieved."
"In addition, the authorities will be obliged to adhere to the practice whereby the benefit obtained by making an exception is weighed against that achieved by making it public, on a case-by-case basis."
"Information on emissions into the environment must always be disclosed even in exceptional circumstances except on grounds relating to defence, safeguarding the course of justice, or industrial or intellectual property rights."
"Another important outcome of the negotiations concerns payments."
"The directive mentions the principle of providing information free of charge as a general practice and particularly when it is a matter of examining information in situ or using public registers and lists."
"When charges do apply they must be reasonable and must not exceed the costs incurred in providing the material in question."
"A third important outcome of the negotiations is that a special new section on the requirements for the quality of environmental information was approved for the directive."
"Member States must ensure that the information is up to date, accurate, and, above all, capable of being used for comparisons."
"With regard to emissions, measurement procedures must also be disclosed so that comparisons can be made."
"The quality of information is especially important now that the availability of information is being granted as a right to a wide public, and one, therefore, that is unfamiliar with that specific subject."
"Experts should be in a position to suspect that the information on emissions they are examining has been compiled using a very different scale or measurement procedure from the figure to which they are attempting to relate the information."
"Another good result is that the authorities will have an obligation to assist and advise people seeking information so that they can apply their rights in the best possible way."
"Other practical arrangements agreed in the directive are also viable and fair from the point of view of the authorities that are responsible for implementing them."
"We might therefore say that correcting the perceived weaknesses and shortcomings in the implementation of the old directive, which was mentioned as one of the aims of this directive, is being successfully realised."
"The objective of the directive that is being realised least satisfactorily in fact is the aim to bring it up to date with developments in information technology."
"It seems very easy to make grand statements about eEurope, but when it is a matter of an obligation to create concrete content for an eEurope, some Member States even oppose the Internet being mentioned."
"Luckily, we had a special statement approved that said that developments in telecommunications and electronic media would be taken into special consideration in a re-examination of the directive."
"I believe that by the time the re-examination takes place the authorities will have realised that in fact it will be to their advantage if there are easy-to-use databases available for the public to use to search for information themselves."
"In this way they will not be taking up the time of the authorities in attending to their request."
"The outcome of conciliation can be regarded as satisfactory as far as Parliament is concerned, as the minimum targets laid down in the Århus Convention are exceeded in all essential respects and an important step is being taken in the ratification of the Convention."
"The end result will be legislation that appears workable and balanced and which the various Member States, including the new ones, can, with moderate effort, make part of their national legislation and implement."
"I warmly recommend the acceptance of this outcome of conciliation in tomorrow's vote."
"Mr President, I want to thank the rapporteur for having fought like a lioness for access to environmental information."
"I might say that if I abstained in the vote by the conciliation delegation it was certainly not on account of the rapporteur's or Parliament's endeavours, but because the Council was clearly unwilling to actually update the directive on environmental information and propose ambitious targets regarding the Århus goals for access to environmental information."
"I believe that Parliament succeeded in preventing the Council's worst aims to allow Member States a very loose framework for interpretation, for example, regarding the exceptions contained in the directive, on the grounds of which it is possible to refuse to provide the public with information."
"It is absolutely typical that the administrative authorities in the Member States should want to have the power to interpret such matters, so that they could then refuse to provide information."
"I believe, however, that in this case the worst was able to be prevented."
"On the other hand, regarding payments, we can be pleased that the principle of non-chargeable information has been established."
"I might nevertheless say that, where a guarantee of information made to the public requires some rummaging around in archives and data to be compiled the authorities will still be able to impose charges."
"I do not know if a member of the public should be obliged to pay for the government doing what it is expected to do anyway."
"Finally, I would like to cite a case."
"The Advocate General of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, Antonio Tizzano, recently stated that the public were not able to be given information by virtue, for example, of the Directive on gene packaging labelling."
"I would just like to say that this directive is now being tested as regards whether we have a sufficiently broad definition for environmental information."
"It mentions, for example, the food chain, and I hope that this really will guarantee that we will be able to provide our citizens with such information in the future."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Hautala."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"I congratulate Mrs Langenhagen on the excellent report she has produced on Special Report No 2/2002 of the Court of Auditors on evaluating the implementation of the Socrates and Youth for Europe Community action programmes in the 1995-1999 period, which I fully support, particularly with regard to the issue of imposing clarity, accuracy and rigour at every stage of the Community programmes, from design to evaluation."
"In this context, I should also like to emphasise that the European Parliament must, under the decision-making process that leads to the adoption of Community acts, call for the clarity of texts, simplified procedures and, when appropriate, mechanisms that ensure the effective management and evaluation of the act in question."
"Danish presidency"
"The Copenhagen summit was a very particular moment in the life of the European Union. I had the privilege of representing Parliament during that summit."
"One could not help being touched by the sense of history in the making when, at the end, the Danish presidency negotiated to a conclusion the accord with each of the accession states."
"I should say also that substantial terrain has been covered in the other work carried out by the presidency."
"Here, I am not referring to the main headline of enlargement, but to the work done over many months with this Parliament on conciliation, which was perhaps hidden from view by the preparations for enlargement."
"In terms of the attendance of the presidency, this is the 39th debate in plenary at which the presidency will speak."
"Contact with committees has been of an exceptional character and it has set us a new headline in interinstitutional relations with the Council which I hope we can build upon going forward."
"I certainly want to say on behalf of Parliament to the Danish prime minister how grateful I am at the improved and substantial level of cooperation between our institutions."
"The first item is the joint debate on the Danish presidency: the European Council report and Commission statement on the European Council summit of 12 and 13 December 2002, and the statement by the President-in-Office of the Council on the work of the Danish presidency."
"- (DA) Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, the last time I spoke in this House was in the course of the debate on enlargement on 19 November."
"That was a great and positive experience."
"I left it with a strong and clear mandate to conclude the enlargement negotiations."
"I am delighted to be here today with an equally clear result."
"Following a long and difficult process, the Presidency concluded the negotiations with ten new Member States at the Copenhagen Summit."
"It is our common dream that is coming true; it is our common aim that is being achieved."
"The European Parliament, the Commission and the Presidency have fought together for enlargement."
"I was especially pleased, therefore, that the President of the European Parliament took part in the final solemn occasion when, on Friday evening, we welcomed the new members into our Community."
"The enlargement negotiations of the last sixth months have been like a long-distance race with a series of difficult hurdles that have had to be cleared along the way."
"Parliament, the Commission and the Presidency have stayed the course together, and in Copenhagen we passed the finishing line."
"Side by side, hand in hand."
"I should like to express my thanks for all the efforts made and for the unfailing support and the help along the way."
"The decisions taken in Copenhagen closed one of the darkest and bloodiest chapters in the history of Europe."
"We put an end to a century characterised by wars and conflicts."
"We finally said goodbye to the Europe of the Yalta Conference and the Cold War."
"At the same time, we opened the door to a new era in the history of Europe: an era characterised by freedom, peace, growth and prosperity."
"The Copenhagen Summit marked a high point in the history of European cooperation: a triumph for freedom and democracy and a gateway to a better future for all our peoples."
"The enlargement of the EU was the Danish Presidency's main priority - but we have a large number of other considerable achievements under our belt."
"We have been a presidency that has set priorities, but not at the expense of other issues."
"This can be seen from our achievements."
"Before I move on to the Copenhagen Summit, I should like to outline a number of the other tasks that the EU has carried out in the last six months."
"We have successfully continued the fight against international terrorism and redoubled efforts against illegal immigration."
"In the field of asylum, we have reached agreement on what is known as the Dublin II regulation, which lays down common rules for which country should take responsibility for handling an asylum application."
"We succeeded in reaching agreement on fully opening up the EU's electricity and gas markets."
"We achieved a breakthrough in EU transport policy."
"The rules on the Single European Sky have secured the basis for fewer cancellations and shorter flight times, benefiting passengers, the environment and airlines."
"Together we have reacted swiftly and effectively to unexpected disasters."
"First there was the flooding in Central Europe."
"The EU showed solidarity by approving the establishment of a EUR 1 000 million Solidarity Fund for use in connection with natural disasters."
"Most recently, we reacted to the tragic loss of the oil tanker Prestige."
"At short notice, the EU showed its ability to act, adopting rules on matters such as the rapid phasing-out of single-hull oil tankers and stricter monitoring in the harbours used by the ships."
"Agreement has been reached on the emissions trading scheme in CO2."
"Progress has been made with regard to food safety, including on common rules for the labelling of food containing GMOs."
"We succeeded in finding a solution to the question of transit to and from Kaliningrad that is acceptable to all parties."
"Lastly, I wish to emphasise the positive and effective cooperation we have had with Parliament: the work on the codecision and budgetary procedures, amongst other things."
"For the first time in many years, we actually succeeded in reaching agreement on large parts of the budget as early as first reading."
"I should like to take this opportunity to express my thanks for the good and positive spirit that has characterised the cooperation between the European Parliament, the Commission and the Presidency."
"Together, we have shown in the last six months that the EU can deliver the goods; that - despite national, institutional and political variations - we can together produce results, create a better, safer daily life for our citizens, create better conditions of competition for our industries and increase Europe's influence in the world."
"I shall now return to the Copenhagen Summit."
"We concluded enlargement negotiations with ten new Member States: Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia."
"These were intensive, difficult negotiations to the last."
"That is the nature of the beast: it ensured that we ended up achieving the right balance between the wishes of the candidate countries and the possibilities of the present Member States."
"The tough negotiations on very specific issues such as milk quotas and credit transfers are, of course, ultimately an indication that the EU is not just a talking shop, adopting meaningless declarations, but an effective forum for discussion, in which we do business and make policy to the benefit of all parties."
"The ten new countries can become members from 1 May 2004."
"By then, both the new and the existing Member States will have completed their national ratification procedures."
"The first stage in this process - which in many of the countries will entail referendums - is the completion of the accession treaty."
"This will then be presented to the Commission first of all, then Parliament and finally the Council for approval, with a view to the treaty being signed in Athens on 16 April 2003."
"I shall call on all three institutions to do their utmost to keep to this timetable."
"The conclusions from the Copenhagen Summit also deal with the question of the participation of the new Member States in the institutions of the EU."
"We have laid down that the ten acceding states will be able to participate in the 2004 elections to the European Parliament as members."
"The accession treaty will lay down that the Commissioners from the new Member States will join the present Commission from the time of the countries' accession on 1 May 2004."
"Once the European Council has appointed a new President of the Commission, the newly elected European Parliament can approve a new Commission, which will have to take office on 1 November 2004."
"This provides a sensible framework for this fundamental issue."
"Here, too, I shall call for cooperation between the institutions to find flexible solutions that ensure the best terms for our new Member States."
"With regard to Bulgaria and Romania, the conclusions are clear: the enlargement process is continuing; and we can confirm that the aim is to be able to welcome the two countries as members in 2007."
"The issue of Turkey came to be one of the main topics in Copenhagen."
"We arrived at a balanced and realistic answer."
"We acknowledge the important steps that Turkey has taken towards meeting the Copenhagen criteria."
"We call upon Turkey to continue its reform process with vigour, and we pledge increased support from the EU to Turkey in these endeavours."
"If the European Council decides in December 2004, on the basis of a report and a recommendation by the Commission, that Turkey has met the Copenhagen political criteria, the European Union will open accession negotiations with Turkey as quickly as possible."
"This sent a strong and positive signal to Turkey, but I would emphasise that it is still an essential requirement that Turkey meet the political criteria before accession negotiations can be opened."
"This is the way it has to be."
"Turkey must be treated in the same way as all the other candidate countries."
"Then there is Cyprus."
"Cyprus will join as a divided island; but, at the same time, there is a realistic possibility that the parties will be able to find a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus issue by 28 February 2003 on the basis of the UN Secretary-General's proposal."
"I would urge the parties to the conflict in the strongest terms to seize this unique opportunity to resolve this unfortunate conflict."
"We all stand to gain by finding a solution now, and none so much as the population of Cyprus."
"In Copenhagen, we sent out a clear message to the new neighbours of the enlarged EU: to the countries of the western Balkans, to Russia, the Ukraine, Moldova and Belarus, and to the countries of the southern Mediterranean."
"Enlargement will not result in the EU shutting itself in; on the contrary, the EU will strengthen links to its new neighbours."
"This will take place both within the framework of, and by means of the development of, the existing cooperation instruments."
"In addition, at the Copenhagen Summit, there was agreement on the frameworks for the future agreement between NATO and the EU on European Security and Defence Policy."
"I should like to mention by way of conclusion that the European Council also met with the Chairman of the European Convention, Mr Giscard d'Estaing."
"He reported on the work in the Convention, and there was consensus in the European Council that the Convention should present the results of its work before the summit in June 2003."
"It was stated that the new Member States will participate fully in the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Bulgaria and Romania will take part as observers."
"Now that enlargement is home and dry, the work in the Convention has become the crucial task in European politics."
"We have enlarged the EU; we now have to ensure that the EU of the future, with more than 25 Member States, can also function effectively."
"We must simplify the decision-making procedures and stress the EU's values."
"We must describe the division of labour between the EU and the Member States more clearly, we must extend the use of qualified majority voting and the codecision procedure, and we must ensure that we have cooperation that is open and subject to democratic control."
"The Danish Presidency is now drawing to a close."
"We are passing the baton of the Presidency on to Greece, wishing them good luck and thanking them for the good troika cooperation."
"Finally, I wish to turn, once again, directly to the Members of this Parliament, and especially to the President, Mr Cox."
"The meeting of the President of Parliament with the European Council in Copenhagen was yet another constructive affirmation of the close relations between Parliament and the Council."
"The Danish Presidency has attached great importance to meeting the European Parliament with an outstretched hand and the will to enter into constructive cooperation."
"It is with satisfaction that I have been able to note that Parliament has met us in the same positive spirit."
"We have had our differences, but the cooperation between us has been characterised by progress, results and a willingness to compromise."
"I have experienced this in this House, at our interinstitutional summits and at my meetings with the Conference of Presidents of the European Parliament."
"This picture is echoed by Danish government ministers."
"I should like to take this opportunity to thank everyone for this constructive cooperation."
"Above all, however, I wish to express my thanks for the unqualified support of Parliament for the implementation of the Danish Presidency's greatest task: concluding the negotiations with ten new Member States."
"The decision, in Copenhagen, on the enlargement of the EU marked the reunification of the peoples and states of Europe, the end of the unfortunate division of our continent and the beginning of a new era in the history of Europe."
"The Copenhagen Summit also marked the beginning of a new era for the European Union."
"In Copenhagen, the EU carried out the greatest task in the history of the Community."
"Following the Copenhagen Summit, the European Union stands as the overall framework around the Europe of the future: cooperation based on the shared values of freedom and the market economy, community spirit and social responsibility, democracy and human rights; effective cooperation that respects the national characteristics of our peoples and states."
"The seed sown by the founding fathers of the European Union in Europe's war-torn ground nearly 50 years ago has taken root."
"The enlargement of the EU has made their dream and their vision a reality."
"A new Europe is born."
"Thank you, Mr President."
"President Cox, Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I stand before this House for the last time this year."
"A year that started with the successful launch of the euro and concludes with another giant step forward."
"We have used a lot of superlatives - too many - in the last 12 months to describe the different stages of this year, which has been the year of Europe."
"I am not overstating the case, however, when I say that the Copenhagen European Summit is a landmark in European integration."
"When I took office, I pledged that enlargement would be my Commission's top priority. We have delivered."
"Some people might - and do - have the impression that the conclusion of the accession negotiations at Copenhagen was a formality."
"Nothing could be further from the truth."
"Courage and political will were required on all sides to achieve this result."
"I should like to single out the tremendous work done by the Danish Presidency."
"As the multiple negotiations went down to the wire, the Presidency maintained a steady hand at the helm and a cool head in a difficult situation."
"Prime Minister, this was a great personal achievement on your part."
"At the same time, this result is the fruit of our hard work too."
"Over the past three years, the Commission has put together 12 remarkable teams of negotiators who have achieved a deal on 31 chapters with each candidate country using a completely new methodology."
"Indeed, for over three years, 350 Commission officials and over 700 people in the Commission delegations have been patiently weaving the fabric of this silent tapestry."
"I want to voice here my gratitude to Günter Verheugen, who has proved to be an astute, passionate negotiator."
"I would also like to thank Mr Eneko Landaburu and all of the Directorate-General for Enlargement for their dedication and first-rate work."
"It is a unique privilege to be President of the Commission on such occasions, and today I am particularly proud to be the head of an institution that has contributed so much to the accomplishment of our dream of 'One Europe'."
"Although ten countries have completed the last lap, others still have some way to go."
"Romania and Bulgaria have been given detailed road maps to reach their target accession date of 2007."
"In December 2004 we have a date with Turkey to see if it meets the conditions for opening negotiations."
"I was heartened by the fact that the first joint act of the 25 current and acceding Member States was to issue a statement in support of the 'continuous, inclusive and irreversible enlargement process'."
"These words echo the vision and generosity that marked the founding of our Union."
"The statement endorsed the Commission's proposal to give Romania and Bulgaria more help in preparing for membership by raising their pre-accession aid by 20%. I urge these countries to seize this chance to further speed up their preparations."
"Turkey will also be receiving an enhanced package to help it prepare its candidacy, a candidacy which, I stress, will be judged on its own merits and according to the same criteria as all the other candidate countries."
"This date will give Turkey time to push ahead with the reforms it needs to make to satisfy the Copenhagen criteria and implement them both in law and in practice."
"The Commission's reports and recommendations will continue to be completely objective and impartial."
"Last week's European Council achieved practically all its objectives."
"I say 'almost all' because we came very close to achieving agreement on the Cyprus question."
"Despite the fervent efforts of the negotiators and the United Nations Secretary-General, we did not achieve a solution which we can consider to be definitive at Copenhagen."
"Nevertheless, both sides expressed willingness to continue with the negotiations and set themselves the goal of achieving an agreement by 28 February."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Europe grows its responsibilities grow."
"We are inviting the new Members to join our area of peace, prosperity and stability, but our work in promoting these values does not stop at the borders of the European Union."
"We must not use the aim of 'One Europe' as an excuse to erect fresh barriers but to embrace the entire continent in our work to establish lasting peace."
"Each enlargement brings us new neighbours which are drawn to the European Union as to a magnet and some hope to become candidates themselves too."
"In my opinion, the countries of the western Balkans belong by definition in the European Union and this view was confirmed by the Copenhagen Council."
"The Stabilisation and Association Process is a powerful instrument and we must use it vigorously."
"The Commission is therefore looking forward to working closely with the Greek Presidency in the run-up to the Thessaloniki Summit, at which, I am convinced, we can offer a detailed, practical response to the letter that the five Presidents of the Western Balkans sent us on the eve of the Copenhagen Council."
"We shall now have to think long and hard about where the borders of the EU are and will ultimately lie - this is the major task before us and I shall say so ad nauseam - but this is something we as Europeans shall decide ourselves, after listening to everyone but without any outside interference."
"The debate on where Europe's borders lie is a debate about our identity."
"It must be conducted in this House and in the national parliaments and must involve all the European citizens closely."
"This search for the roots of our identity does not mean creating divisions."
"Indeed, European integration must provide benefits and new prospects for our neighbours as well, even if they are to remain just neighbours."
"We need to build a strong network of relations based on shared political and economic values with neighbouring countries, from Russia to the Mediterranean."
"This is the new strategic objective of my Commission."
"This proximity policy must bring our neighbours many of the benefits of membership without them having to join the Union formally in the foreseeable future."
"The European Economic Area is a useful model for such relations, but it needs to be enhanced by a series of measures to develop political cooperation."
"Our relations must be based on 'sharing everything but institutions'."
"Our proximity policy must be attractive, unlocking new prospects and bringing mutual benefits."
"It must motivate our partners to cooperate more closely with the Union and it must be dynamic and based on a structured, step-by-step approach."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have successfully concluded the accession negotiations and we now have to make European unification a tangible, everyday reality."
"At last, final drafting of the Accession Treaty, which - as Prime Minister Rasmussen said - must be ratified and signed in Athens next April, can now proceed."
"However, our biggest job in the coming months will be to inform and reassure our citizens in both the present Member States and the accession countries."
"The Commission will be mounting an extensive information campaign in which the Members of this House will play a crucial role."
"Indeed, just a few years ago, many of the candidate countries were governed by dictatorships."
"Many of their citizens fear they might be giving up their new-found freedom and independence by joining another large bloc."
"There is concern in the current Member States, on the other hand, about the costs and implications of the entry of countries much poorer than themselves."
"Most of these fears are groundless. As Günter Verheugen has said, this is the best prepared enlargement in the history of the Union."
"We are all quite aware that the cost of enlargement is nothing compared with the cost of non-enlargement."
"We must therefore disseminate these simple truths throughout Europe and we must work together to make the citizens aware of them."
"The enlargement process has progressed thanks to tremendous determination, political courage and vision."
"We have to convince the Europeans that by coming together we will all gain, and not just materially, through shared prosperity and sustainable development in the largest market in the world, but politically too, as citizens of a democratic, accountable Union."
"The credibility of the new, enlarged Europe will, as I have said before, hang, above all, on the credibility of its institutions and its credibility as an active leader on the world stage."
"I therefore warmly welcome the EU-NATO agreement concluded at the Summit, which will enable us to conduct military peace-keeping operations in the Balkans from as early as next year."
"This is a further responsibility which we will have to, which we will be able to shoulder."
"The moment of truth, however, in the coming year will be institutional reform."
"We will not be able to make good our promises to our citizens unless we completely overhaul the Union's structure."
"Only by strengthening the Union's decision-making process can we build the more cohesive, united Union that will earn their respect and admiration."
"We must therefore all work together with Mr Giscard d'Estaing to make the Convention a success."
"This greater unity and determination must be reflected in our action on the world stage."
"Our growing responsibilities will leave no room for the vacillation and inaction we have displayed in the past."
"The task of the Convention and of all those contributing to its work is therefore just as important as the accession negotiations, for if the Convention does not succeed we will have created a Europe which is large but unable to act."
"Mr President, Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, there are therefore grounds for optimism."
"The success of Copenhagen and the generosity displayed there - we had expected egoism and breaking away but what we found there was a sense of unity in countries for which enlargement has a different meaning, is something different, is being experienced in a different way, but which have all understood the magnitude of what has happened - have shown that, if we can overcome the obstacles still facing us, we will genuinely be able to put to good use the blend of vision and pragmatism that have made the European Union a unique model of political integration."
"Lastly, President Cox, Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you and extend to you my very best wishes for the forthcoming festivities."
"I hope that you all enjoy a very well-deserved, happy, peaceful break with your loved ones."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, you have come here today, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, with the satisfaction of having done your duty, and you deserve the most sincere congratulations from my group, the Group of the European People's Party, for having been able to take this historic step under your presidency and with your government, in which I would like to highlight in particular the work of our esteemed former colleague Mr Bertel Haarder."
"You made a comparison, saying that the race you have run is a long-distance race."
"I believe that under the Danish Presidency this has been more like a race against time, or even a one-legged race, and you have won it."
"I believe you deserve special congratulations for that."
"It is now up to us, as Members of the European Parliament, and all the members of Member State Parliaments and those in countries that are already part of an enlarged Europe, to take the next steps, and we must not underestimate the importance of dialogue with public opinion, as well as fulfilling our duties."
"I would reiterate President Prodi's words, when he said that there is going to be an information campaign in which we must all participate."
"We are prepared to discuss the budget for this campaign immediately."
"I would also like to congratulate the Commission - as the negotiating body - its President, Commissioner Verheugen, and please allow me to mention also the Director-General for Enlargement, Mr Landáburu, with whom I have had the opportunity to fight against Franco's dictatorship and for European integration."
"I believe he has acted seriously, using his experience, in this process."
"Just one question, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in relation to the democratic process of integrating these countries - and I see you have incorporated the proposal made by Mr Hänsch, which was adopted by the European Parliament, that these countries might be able to take part in the 2004 elections."
"The question is transition."
"You said, having taken decisions, that you are going to consult Parliament before the end of January."
"Are these consultations on consumer issues or is it an interinstitutional agreement?"
"Many issues are currently under discussion."
"For example, I do not know if you have decided whether, in accordance with the Treaty of Nice, there will be one or two commissioners, depending on the country, until 2005."
"Will this change or not?"
"That is a question that I believe must be discussed, as well as the changes in the Commission: will there be a second Polish Commissioner for three months or not?"
"We will need to discuss this, but the issue is whether there will be an agreement on this point."
"I have just one comment to make with regard to Turkey: I believe our Turkish friends should be told that they missed a great opportunity, during the week of the Sakharov Prize, to let Mrs Leila Zana come here."
"Those of us who are in favour of Turkey entering the European Union continue to maintain that what is needed in Turkey is a democracy in which civil power takes precedence over military power."
"That is the key issue and that is the question that must be put clearly to our Turkish friends."
"As for Cyprus, perhaps Turkey will now have an objective interest in the ever present Mr Denktash changing his mind and finding a solution for February in order to achieve full integration of the whole island."
"Mr President, with regard to the Middle East you made a bold statement and I believe we must support it as we cannot agree to put the Quartet's proposals on hold, as the United States would like, and we should also welcome the fact that the Commission has freed up funding for the Palestinian elections."
"I believe Europe has serious responsibilities at the present time with regard to the Middle East."
"Lastly, Mr President, I would also like to express my group's deep dissatisfaction with the way in which the Council and the Commission are approaching the problem of the Prestige disaster."
"There has not been equal treatment in terms of what the President mentioned concerning the German and Austrian situation and that of Central Europe, because no fund has been created; existing funds have simply been re-allocated."
"I can tell you that there is disappointment and resentment in my country and a problem that extends to other parts of the Union."
"I shall end, Mr President, by saying that now that Denmark has taken this historic step, please, move closer to us, and remove the barriers that still exist in terms of citizenship and the common currency on Denmark's part."
"I am sure you will do this."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I would like to congratulate the President-in-Office on the successful conclusion in Copenhagen of an outstanding Danish presidency."
"It is rare in my experience for a presidency to receive such wide praise from all sides of this House."
"The improvement in relations between the Council and Parliament has been notable, and we owe much in this regard to the role of our former, much-esteemed colleague, Mr Haarder."
"The outcome of the summit is a tribute to the negotiating skills of Mr Fogh Rasmussen and the persistence both he and his team displayed."
"Their decision to focus single-mindedly on enlargement paid off handsomely: Europe can now reunite."
"However, we must not be complacent."
"The full application of the Copenhagen criteria, both in the new countries and in the existing Member States, must remain a matter of concern."
"Moreover, there are referenda to be won in all the new countries - referenda in which each and every one of us can play an important part, if we so choose."
"Copenhagen offers Bulgaria and Romania the prospect of greater pre-accession aid and the objective of membership in 2007."
"While these two countries will clearly be in the next wave of enlargement, we should continue to be guided by the principle that each candidate will be judged on its own merits."
"Liberal Democrats would have preferred an earlier review of Turkey's readiness for accession."
"However, Turkey is clearly now on the path to membership and, if the Copenhagen criteria are met by the end of 2004, my group will hold the governments to their commitment to open membership negotiations."
"An agreement on the United Nations plan to reunite Cyprus would have been the icing on the cake of the Copenhagen Council."
"Nonetheless, we remain optimistic that agreement can be reached so that a united Cyprus can sign the Accession Treaty in April 2004."
"We hope that Turkey will seize the opportunity to confirm its European vocation by putting pressure on Mr Denktash to reach a compromise."
"However, celebrations over the historic decision to reunite Europe - and I welcome the very prominent role played by Liberals in the Council, Commission and Parliament, whether those on the benches in front of us apply that label to themselves or not - should not be allowed to overshadow another significant breakthrough at Copenhagen."
"That was the agreement with Turkey to allow the EU's Rapid Reaction Force to go ahead and have access to Nato's resources."
"Europe's security and defence ambitions can now be put to the test as the EU takes over Operation Amber Fox in Macedonia."
"This may pave the way for more ambitious missions in the future, including peace-enforcement operations in accordance with the UN Charter."
"A wider Europe must be prepared to shoulder its responsibilities in the world, whether in the Middle East - I congratulate the Council on its firm declaration on that conflict - or elsewhere."
"We must be a bulwark for freedom and democracy and a force for justice."
"In building that strength, we owe much to Denmark."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, pure self-righteousness and self-satisfaction make me want to be a bit sarcastic. 'Lads, you were wonderful!'"
"I would also say to the ladies, who helped you, and are unfortunately not to be seen on these benches: 'Ladies, you were wonderful!"
"You did fantastically well!'"
"Enlargement is upon us - doubtless a great achievement on the part of the Commission, the Council, the Danish Presidency and the presidencies that have gone before it."
"It is a certainty that the coming presidency will have to shoulder the additional burden of making enlargement a reality, and that will be difficult."
"Not only because of all the votes that Mr Wurtz mentioned, that will then have to be held in the various countries, but because we will meet again and can only hope that enlargement does not give us the same hangover that the reunification of the Federal Republic of Germany did, because the finances do not work out quite right, and because people suddenly realise that what they had dreamt of has not become reality overnight."
"We will then get back to talking about the financial framework."
"Let me tell you, Mr Wurtz, that the problem is not our promise that there will be no direct payments before 2013, but our own inability to question why we have direct payments, our failure to make the necessary reform to our agriculture here and now in order to establish justice and take enlargement as the means of developing a new policy."
"There is no point in enlarging something that is wrong."
"The only thing that makes sense is using enlargement to change what is wrong and, together, doing the right thing."
"Very often, we have not managed to do that."
"That is why what I have to say to Turkey is very simple: 'of course we will pay attention to the criteria'."
"But we have to say what they are."
"What we demand of the Commission is that, within the next few months, they tell us what the criteria are to be."
"What, in fact, will we have to discuss with Turkey over the next two years?"
"Will we be discussing the issue of women wearing the headscarf?"
"Is that one of the Copenhagen criteria?"
"Of course it is not; instead, we will be discussing fundamental issues of democracy and of how to make it a reality again."
"This is where we need a road map."
"Finally, I would like to say something about Iraq."
"I approve of what the Council has said."
"The UN Resolution can be interpreted in this way and that."
"Unfortunately, the German Federal Government, for example, with which I have a great deal of sympathy, interprets it in such a way that it can also be read in the way the Americans do, to mean that there do not have to be further debates in the Security Council."
"I see this as the wrong approach, and hope that Europeans, as Europeans, will insist on further discussion and a vote in the Council if the resolution is considered as not having been complied with."
"It is not acceptable that compliance or non-compliance with the Resolution should be a matter for the Americans to decide on their own!"
"At the end of the day - as Mr Poettering rightly said - yes, if we have to stand up to the Americans, then we have to try it out on the Russians."
"We have to tell the Russians that, however friendly we are - and we are very close - certain things will not do!"
"I am grateful to the Danes for not deporting Mr Zakayev - that was the right thing to do, and I hope that the English will not be able to deport him either."
"If, though, Mr Zakayev can be granted political asylum in Europe, there must be something wrong in Chechnya."
"I do not think there should be any meeting with Russia without us telling them that what is going on in Chechnya is not only bad, it amounts to a colonial war."
"That is something that we in Europe never want to see again!"
"Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, I think that it is natural for the European Parliament to express its opinion regarding the outcome of the Copenhagen Summit and I was just about to compliment the three presidents present on the results achieved."
"There is no need for me to do so, however, since they have congratulated themselves enough, given themselves a celebratory pat on the back, which, in my view, did seem a little excessive."
"So, this morning, then, I find myself partly agreeing with Mr Barón Crespo - which is also astonishing - who essentially said that you have done your work."
"If I am completely honest, I must also say that this was a job well done."
"I would like to say to the President-in-Office of the Council that he has certainly succeeded and that he has avoided the worst possible situation, particularly in the latest exchanges, in other words endless haggling, when we are in fact facing an historic occasion."
"For this, you must be complimented."
"This is an historic moment, and this point has been clearly made by previous speakers."
"I fully understand that Mr Wurtz does not wish us to make reference to a certain period of our recent history."
"The fact remains, however, that this scar, this wound, on Europe's body has now healed."
"This is not an 'enlargement' process - I think this word is inappropriate and unsuitable - this is a return, a reunion of a continent which should never have been divided."
"I would add that the message that we must send to the peoples who are joining us is a message of solidarity, a message of understanding of everything that they experienced during these periods of oppression."
"I would also like to say that the shift of emphasis towards the East must not make us forget the South - I know that this point was made in the Copenhagen declaration - and must not make us forget our responsibilities either - I am taking advantage of the fact that the three Presidents are here to remind them of this - towards the outermost regions, because the borders of the European Union are, at present, the borders of these regions, of Spain, France and Portugal."
"In this respect, I would like to express my concern regarding the comments made by some of the members of the Commission or the Convention, who stated that, when clarifying the texts, we could certainly delete Article 299(2) of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which provides the legal basis for the measures taken to assist the outermost regions."
"I would also draw Parliament's attention to the risks that this would pose in the long run."
"Madam President, honour where honour is due."
"Mr Fogh Rasmussen has managed much better than the euro."
"The Danish Prime Minister and the Danish ambassador to the EU deserve praise for concluding the negotiations on time, but the result forebodes disaster."
"Never before have so many rich countries been so miserly towards so few."
"Most Polish farmers will be net contributors to the EU."
"They will pay more in contributions to the EU than they receive."
"On the other hand, the better-off farmers will see a considerable increase in their capital, which future farmers will have to pay interest on."
"One hectare of agricultural land costs 30 times as much in the Netherlands as in Poland."
"If Polish and Dutch farmers are given the same right to buy land from each other, one can hardly call this equality."
"There should now be a radical revision of agricultural systems so that we avoid a situation arising in which financial gain is made from rising agricultural prices, leading to a new need for subsidies and a million Polish farmers being condemned to a life of unemployment in the city."
"The budgetary funds and the Structural Funds are also in need of revision."
"Subsidies to the rich countries must be eliminated."
"Give the new countries free membership instead of theoretical Structural Fund subsidies, which they cannot receive on account of our bureaucratic procedures and the co-financing requirement."
"Let us cut EU law down drastically from its 85 000 pages."
"Let us only require compliance with our standards in the applicant countries when they are exporting to us."
"Let us give them longer transitional periods, more leeway, greater freedom."
"Let us allow far greater flexibility than the negotiations have settled on."
"I am not criticising Mr Fogh Rasmussen for the result."
"He could not have done very much better with the mandate he was given, but he should now say, in his capacity as Danish Prime Minister, that enlargement will not end well unless there are radical reforms."
"In an EU that has 25 countries and more on the way, it is not possible to legislate as if it were a state."
"The EU should now focus on the cross-border aspects and let the parliaments of the Member States adopt the bulk of the legislation."
"An enlarged EU can only function as a Europe of democracies and diversities."
"We had this in mind when we named our group."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, I concur wholeheartedly with the congratulations that the Danish Presidency has received from all sides."
"They are well deserved."
"I myself hardly believed that it would be possible to accomplish enlargement in the unbelievably short time available, in the face of all the colossal problems associated with it."
"It is an impressive administrative and technical piece of work, which deserves the greatest credit."
"I know that the Commission staff, under the leadership of Mr Verheugen; the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs; the Danish Prime Minister's Office; the European Parliament: everyone has pulled together, and it was thanks to the Danish Presidency's aim that the project must succeed now, that it did succeed."
"It was an impressive achievement, which was also due to the fact that the aims and priorities were clearly explained. We were told, 'Help us now, we are listening, we are working together', and the cooperation succeeded."
"It was an outstanding achievement."
"One of the great experiences for me was the meeting, here in Parliament, with the representatives of all the new countries."
"It was moving to listen to them setting out their priorities: freedom, justice, the rule of law, parliamentary democracy."
"We desire peace, freedom, stability and respect for human rights, among other things. That is what they said, loud and clear."
"It was our friends that were meeting with us, perhaps with a higher level of ambition in those areas than we normally voice, but then they have a background that justifies this."
"There was one thing which the President-in-Office of the Council did not mention, but which in any case I shall take the liberty of mentioning: for the first time, there were TV broadcasts from the beginning and end of the Council meetings in Copenhagen."
"This is a giant step forward as regards openness, and indeed it should be pointed out, because if there is one thing we in the European Parliament have wished for, it is just this increase in openness."
"I should also like to say that it was impressive that the Kaliningrad problem was solved in the difficult circumstances that prevailed at the very time this took place."
"This, however, was another demonstration of our will, unity and cooperation playing the role that was needed to put this, too, in place."
"Congratulations."
"We shall be delighted to welcome the new Members to the European Parliament."
"Thank you to the Presidency of the Council and to the Commission for making this possible."
"Madam President, Winston Churchill once spoke of an iron curtain coming down over Europe."
"Today we can safely say that the iron curtain has not only been lifted but has been dismantled, packed up in its box and consigned to the attic of history where it will serve to remind us of the horrors of the past."
"We have a lot to celebrate today."
"Copenhagen reunited Europe 13 years after the Berlin Wall came down and 21 years to the day after martial law was imposed in Poland and already these things feel as if they belong to a different age."
"I congratulate the Danish presidency and the Commission on bringing to a successful conclusion ten sets of parallel and very diverse negotiations, bearing in mind that only a couple of weeks ago, it seemed as if we would not do it."
"I think it is impossible to under-estimate the importance of what has been achieved in Copenhagen."
"However, at the risk of being accused of putting a dampener on our celebrations, I must point out that we are not there yet."
"There is still a lot to be done."
"The candidate countries still have to meet our standards and they must not be allowed to slacken their efforts."
"The Commission still has to draw up its final report on the candidate countries, and we must ensure that the process does not degenerate into a messy argument about the imposition of safeguards."
"We still have to get the process ratified by parliaments, including, in particular, by the European Parliament."
"We will scrutinise the treaties with care and attention to detail and no one should take Parliament's vote for granted."
"We still have to sell enlargement to the people, both in the EU and in the candidate countries."
"We cannot take the people's assent for granted."
"Notwithstanding Mr Rovsing's remarks just now, we must still make the Kaliningrad solution work, and work in a way which does not undermine the sovereignty of Lithuania."
"We must still ensure that the financial arrangements actually work and we must also ensure that Parliament's role in those financial arrangements is fully respected."
"We still have to reform our common agricultural policy before it bankrupts us financially and politically."
"We still have to decide how an EU of 25 or more can work, because failure to reform our decision-making process will guarantee that this enlargement is the breaking and not the making of the European Union."
"A lot has been done, but there is still a lot to do."
"We must not lessen our efforts towards Bulgaria and Romania, nor must they assume that 2007 is a guaranteed date of accession."
"I welcome the decision taken concerning Turkey - although I would have preferred the date of 1 May 2004 - but this must become a defining moment in our relations with Turkey."
"We guarantee that negotiations will begin if they meet the Copenhagen criteria by December 2004, but equally, we must be clear that, if the criteria are not met, then Turkey's accession will be off the agenda for the foreseeable future."
"We must stop playing games with each other."
"I welcome the determination to resolve the Cyprus issue and would point out that, because we have always said that we would not allow third parties to veto our future, this is forcing us finally to reach a settlement in this long-running debate."
"Prime Minister, I am told by my government that in Copenhagen, you were always well briefed, determined, clever and gave real leadership."
"If we are to overcome the obstacles ahead - institutional change and the need for political and economic reform - we need such leadership more often and then we can really celebrate."
"Madam President, thanks are indeed due for the great job that has been done."
"It seems to me that there is good reason to rejoice today, and I can indeed see happy faces around me."
"Mr Fogh Rasmussen is happy, Mr Haarder is happy, and Mr Prodi, we hope, is also happy."
"Mr Verheugen has every reason to be pleased with the great job he has done."
"The candidate countries should also be pleased with the tremendous job they have done."
"I think that this can perhaps get forgotten."
"While standing here welcoming the fact that a little country can achieve so much, it is possible to be struck by the notion that this could be a tip as to how to structure the leadership of the EU."
"It would perhaps be better to entrust the Presidency to the small countries and let the large ones attend to the battles they are fighting elsewhere."
"This, however, is of course a little, humble wish for the future on the part of my country."
"As regards all of the good ideas as to what my country should do with regard to the euro, for example, I would say that, if you can get the Stability and Growth Pact to work, Denmark may well consider them."
"At the moment, I do not think that there is any reason to."
"In my opinion it is not working, and I think that it is true that Mr Fogh Rasmussen has managed better than the euro."
"It is of course galling for me that it is a liberal government that is receiving the praise, but the truth has to be told: you have managed well, Mr Fogh Rasmussen."
"We have now heard enough historical speeches, and it is perhaps time to get going: not with history, but with the future."
"Enlargement has been a success, but we all know, of course, that things will not get any easier."
"Enlargement will not make it any easier to work in the European Union."
"There are many things that will become considerably more difficult, but it would have been worse if we had not prepared enlargement."
"This is the other side of the coin."
"For example, it will not become any easier to carry out agricultural reform, but it is even more necessary than before."
"I would of course urge both Denmark and the upcoming Presidency to take note of this."
"There is something quite wrong in the fact that life is better for a cow in the EU than for a farmer in a developing world country."
"That cannot be right."
"We must make a start on this task, therefore."
"We must also make a start on looking at the EU's global role."
"For what purposes do we mean to use our cooperation?"
"Are we to let the USA determine everything in this world?"
"Is it to be the USA that dictates the list of terrorist organisations, the policy on terrorism, anti-missile shield strategy, Iraq, etc.?"
"Or will the EU find a counterweight to the dominance of the USA?"
"What does the EU want when it comes to human rights? We have been aware of this in connection with enlargement: we have watched over the applicant countries, given them advice and guidance, made demands of them; but what then, and what about ourselves?"
"What will happen about the rights of the Roma when enlargement has fallen into place?"
"It will not get any easier, but it is something we must follow up."
"It is a matter of keeping a constant eye on our own situation."
"What, too, will the EU do at global level as regards oppressed peoples?"
"What will we do as regards Chechnya?"
"Will we allow Russia to call the tune there?"
"What will we do as regards the Iranians and their fight against the mullah regime?"
"Will we let our policy there be determined by feta cheese and oil, or will we really back our grand words up with action?"
"There is much to tackle in the future; it will not get any easier, but we will get through it."
"(Applause)"
"After the men's turn it is evidently the women's turn."
"Ladies and gentlemen, please allow me to congratulate you on the result - although I do not have so much time that I can stand and eulogise."
"Enlargement by ten new countries can now become a reality, as Mr Rasmussen has said, after fifty years of growth, prosperity and, in particular, peace."
"An excellent result, but will we now be able to deliver the goods for some 500 million people?"
"Is this in fact possible?"
"Will we be able to develop institutions that are democratic, transparent and efficient?"
"We have not been particularly successful in doing so thus far, and we do not have much time in which to accomplish it."
"Mr Prodi said that integration must now become a reality, and I found that a particularly significant statement."
"Have you not, however, really underestimated the costs involved?"
"Are the European institutions sufficiently credible?"
"Not in our citizens' eyes, according to the opinion polls."
"Should we not make more efforts in this regard?"
"Or are we going to leave that all up to the Convention?"
"Enlargement will increase your credibility, but at the same time there will be a greater expectation that things will remain as good as they always have been for all citizens, including those in the present European Union, when it comes to peace, prosperity and, in particular, solidarity."
"The question of Turkey's accession is first and foremost a matter for Turkey itself."
"Turkey must develop her democracy in such a way that the different peoples, including the Kurds, can feel at home there."
"Finally, we cannot view this question separately from the issue of how we view our borders."
"Do we really see the European Union - and I do mean the European Union - as sharing borders with Iran, Iraq and Syria?"
"Is this what we are called to?"
"You will have to convince the public."
"You will also have to convince me because I do not believe that we are in a position to develop the institutions we would need for this?"
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Madam President, one of the great disadvantages of this Parliament is that it is never short of superlatives when it comes to heaping praise upon the presidencies that take place in this regular six-monthly cycle."
"The disadvantage is that when we really have some genuine praise to give, it does not come with the force that is deserved."
"For my part, Mr Rasmussen has been an outstanding President of the Council."
"I would like, on behalf of my party, to congratulate him, coming from - and here I adopt what our President said - not one of the largest European countries."
"I had said smallest but I obey the President's edict on this."
"I am bound to say too that my own prime minister may have some personal aspirations for the presidency of the Council if it works on a five-yearly cycle, but I very much hope that Mr Rasmussen has now entered the field in that regard."
"It is quite right that reference was made to the visionary words of Pope John Paul many years ago."
"I want to make some reference to Margaret Thatcher's own words at Bruges."
"These words have sadly become synonymous with euroscepticism, but the real message that Margaret Thatcher gave at Bruges was about a wider Europe."
"In those circumstances her message about Europe not becoming so inward-looking is one that has been carried forward by Mr Rasmussen and is one that we all celebrate today."
"I also endorse the remarks of Mr Verheugen."
"I distance myself from what Mr Abitbol had to say about him because he was quite right in talking about the moral obligation that we have to candidate countries, about the fact that democracy and human rights are the battle that these countries have taken forward."
"Sometimes we adopt too much of a patronising attitude towards these candidate countries."
"We have to recognise that both Parliament and peoples will need to ratify entry."
"I hope we learn the lesson of Nice."
"That is a message for all of us here."
"The élites within Europe do not recognise that we have to treat these countries with the respect that they deserve, not only because we want them to vote positively on entry, but because the institutions that we have must become more accountable and more responsive."
"That is what the Convention is supposed to be all about."
"We have a structured design for six countries which is now difficult to operate on the basis of 15 countries and which shortly will be a mechanism that will have to serve the interests of 25 countries."
"The Convention should not become tied down in a debate covering only institutional matters, but must shift its focus to demonstrate how Europe can become a much more accountable and responsive institution for the future."
"Mr President, I should first like to add my voice to the hearty congratulations to the Danish Presidency."
"I think that the Presidency and the Commission have done an outstanding job on enlargement."
"The result has garnered many positive adjectives along the way, and I should like to join in with those who say that almost all the words have now been used up; but I concur with what has been said, and I would just say that, in my opinion, Denmark can perhaps be pleased about two things in particular."
"It was in 1993, during the Danish Presidency, that the conditions for enlargement were laid down, and now, ten years later, we have the opportunity to close the cycle during a Danish Presidency, too."
"I think that this is a very good thing."
"The second thing that I should like to emphasise is the additional opportunity we have which is peculiar to our region of Europe."
"We now have a region surrounding the Baltic Sea which almost exclusively consists of Member States of the European Union."
"I believe that this presents some good opportunities, and we may have high expectations for the situation."
"Even if the end of the summit was perhaps somewhat mercenary - it often is - this cannot overshadow the big picture."
"Quite simply, we cannot pass a more secure, more democratic basis on to future generations than the strong community that has been created here."
"We must also realise that, once the New Year celebrations are over, our feet must be back on the ground, and, in any case, too many major tasks await us - as they do the new countries."
"One of these is to push the EU legislation through effectively in the new countries: implement it in practice in both administrative and legal terms, so that the EU's standards are indeed respected."
"The other is to do with agriculture. The way in which the compromise on the budget was reached has perhaps not made it any easier to envisage the necessary, proper agricultural reform."
"We all know that the common agricultural policy, as it stands, is grotesque and is very detrimental to the developing countries."
"In my opinion, this really is a field in which there will be a need for political courage and responsibility in the future, too."
"I wish to close with a few words about Turkey. As you know, two things were made clear as far as Turkey is concerned, which in my opinion are very important."
"One of them is that it is a candidate country that can join on the same conditions as other candidate countries."
"The other is that if the Commission, in December 2004, can establish that the criteria - the political criteria - have been met, the Council will also take a decision on starting accession negotiations."
"This is a great opportunity for Turkey."
"It is now up to Turkey itself to take this opportunity: the ball is in the court of the Turkish Government."
"We can establish that today, at any rate, none of the political criteria - democracy, the rule of law, respect for human rights and the protection of minorities - have been met in Turkey; so there remains a real need for further reforms, and there is above all a need to implement the reforms."
"It was, however, a prudent decision that was taken on Turkey last week in the European Council."
"Once more, thank you for a superb Presidency and congratulations on the result."
"I would like to congratulate the Danish presidency wholeheartedly on the completion of a difficult task."
"After all, the summit was not only historic, but also primarily financial in character."
"These negotiations are always the most difficult, and the accession countries obviously have an excellent understanding of what the European Union is about."
"I do wonder, however, to what extent the financial arrangements are scuppering the political debate, specifically the arrangements with Poland and especially those relating to agricultural reforms."
"I also note that although no date has yet been set for negotiations with Turkey, the political criteria are to be evaluated in December 2004, so it is possible that negotiations may start without a national parliament, let alone the citizens of a Member State, becoming involved in such a decision at all."
"I object to this."
"I wonder whether this would not be an appropriate time to stop and consider where we are actually going with Europe and how far we want to go."
"Finally, I welcome Mr Verheugen's promise to my party leader, Gerrit Zalm, that the November 2003 monitor report will state which exemption clauses could come into effect in countries that have not solved the relevant problems before May 2004, and which countries these are."
"I found this to be a positive, confidence-inspiring commitment; one which has unfortunately been paid far too little attention in the Council."
"Madam President, as an Independent Socialist I was sceptical, and in August I did not believe that enlargement would succeed, but I must admit that I have lost my bet with the President-in-Office of the Council; so I shall have to buy Mr Fogh Rasmussen a beer after this debate."
"I have a deep respect for the Danish Prime Minister's leadership."
"He, the Danish Government and especially the civil servants have pursued the goal, and have achieved it."
"Everyone concerned is to be praised highly for this."
"The façade of the new EU house has been built and decorated; now it is a case of putting the furniture in place."
"The greatest task is without doubt reform of the common agriculture policy."
"I still believe that the EU should have reformed the system of subsidies to European farmers before the decision to enlarge the EU was taken."
"Reform would certainly have delayed enlargement, but then we would have reduced the risk of having a two-tier EU; and not until sweeping reforms are in place will we be able to look the world's poorest countries in the eye again, as they are still losing out."
"I also wish to say to you, Prime Minister, that the fact that Mr Bonde is opposed to it is the best sign that this is a really good result."
"Once again, therefore - congratulations!"
"Madam President, Prime Minister Rasmussen, Commissioner Verheugen, after the Copenhagen Summit there is every reason to congratulate and thank Denmark, and above all her Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister, Mr Møller, and former Member, Mr Holter, on and for the smooth and steady advance of the Danish presidential term from start to finish, but mainly on account of their success in the enlargement negotiations that required such precision."
"Prime Minister Rasmussen told the applicant countries what was what, if you will forgive the expression, but in a way they could accept."
"I do not, however, want to forget either the enormous contribution made by Commissioner Verheugen in the negotiations that led to the success of enlargement."
"Many sceptics along the way must have aroused justified anger in you."
"Perseverance, however, was rewarded with success, and I think Parliament should acknowledge that across the parties."
"Enlargement emphasises just how important our neighbours are."
"Russia has not become a new neighbour with enlargement, but an incomparably more important one none the less."
"The border will lengthen by hundreds of kilometres in 2004."
"When Romania and Bulgaria join in 2007 three countries still in a state of turmoil will be surrounded by the Union and Russia."
"These are Belarus, Ukraine and Moldavia."
"I am not proposing increased assistance for Russia, even though we spend only a fraction on cooperation with this our most important neighbour compared with what we spend on cooperation with the Mediterranean region."
"Nevertheless, the Union's political focus should be firmly on Russia, and Russia should be helped, and even pressured, to introduce reforms."
"After that we can initiate private business interaction on a new level with the Russians and start investing in Russia."
"The Chairman of our group, Mr Hans-Gert Poettering, has already mentioned the worst problem: the war in Chechnya."
"I am in full agreement with him on this matter."
"An example of the injustice and corruption that still reign supreme is the necessity to terminate the TIR cargo system agreement with Russia, as it simply does not work there: drivers of freight have had to be prepared for the most diverse range of charges, to grease palms, rather than engines."
"As the Commission will be getting 10 new Commissioners in 2004, I think one of them should be appointed to be responsible for relations with our neighbours to the east, Russia in particular, with regard to day-to-day problems."
"Let us leave high level foreign policy to the High Representative, wherever he or she has her home in the future."
"Another Commissioner could focus, for the sake of balance, on developing real content for cooperation in the Mediterranean region."
"If one of Russia's neighbouring countries, including my own, had a Commissioner specially qualified to offer support when problems arise and when positive developments start to take place, the EU could be involved as a background power in talks in quite a different way than is the case now."
"There is, furthermore, good news coming out of Russia: the economy is growing."
"This is good for both Russia and the EU."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Prime Minister, congratulations on the fabulous result that you, the Danish Government and the Danish civil service have produced."
"The result, a unified Europe, belongs to us all, but your good planning and political will were the decisive factors."
"Enlargement has finally put the Second World War to rest."
"Last Friday, in the Polish press room, this was very clear."
"In the last century, Poland was one of the hardest hit territories in Europe, mistreated from both east and west by regimes whose totalitarian ideologies left behind nothing but destruction and terrible memories."
"The inequalities of the past have now been eliminated, Europe is reunited, the word 'solidarity' has taken on a totally new meaning, Europe has been healed."
"Now it is justice that holds sway, and not brute force, among our 25 countries and in relation to the countries around us."
"The EU thus represents the most binding and only democratic cooperation between independent countries in the world."
"We should be proud of this, and so we are."
"This unique cooperation makes heavy demands on us, however."
"Our citizens expect the right results and solutions; we have to be able to take decisions and be effective."
"We must therefore focus on the essential points while at the same time preserving our diversity."
"Decisions in the Council must be taken by qualified majority: this produces a willingness to compromise."
"The European Parliament must be an equal co-legislator, and, when the Council legislates, we must all be able to follow the process. Justice, not brute force, holds sway in the EU."
"It is the alpha and omega, therefore, that our common EU rules are observed by everyone, big and small, in the north and south, east and west."
"This is only possible if we have a strong Commission."
"An enlarged EU requires that we all uphold the values on which the Community is based."
"This was the message the summit sent out to Turkey."
"Turkey still has a lot to do and has to get back down to work."
"In 2004, it will be assessed in detail and, after this, provided it meets the Copenhagen criteria, will be given a date for the start of its accession negotiations."
"Turkey is thus being treated in exactly the same way as all of the other candidate countries; as it is justice, not force, that holds sway in the EU."
"The Copenhagen Summit has shown that the EU is built on great visions and historic decisions, but, at the same time, time-consuming and sometimes even ugly negotiations on milk quotas, suckler cows and all kinds of transitional arrangements."
"We politicians must be able to explain both sides of this fantastic European cooperation."
"A big 'thank you' to the President and, once again, hearty congratulations: you deserve to celebrate, and not just with a beer."
"I, too, would like to congratulate the Danish presidency, particularly as far as the decision on Turkey is concerned."
"I think that this decision has succeeded very well in striking a balance between, on the one hand, recognition of the reforms that have already been adopted and those already announced, and the new government's willingness to go even further if necessary, and, on the other, the ongoing need to stress that the European Union sees legislative changes as very important but that what actually happens with these legislative changes in practice is even more important."
"Consideration of this will take time, and I think that it is right to look at precisely what has taken place by the end of 2004."
"Let there be no misunderstanding; it is now up to Turkey to act."
"The EU, however, must not sit on its hands."
"Where Turkey is concerned, it is no longer enough to simply refer to the Copenhagen political criteria, which are somewhat abstract."
"On the other hand, there is also no point in producing a whole stack of details without any form of prioritisation."
"I would therefore like to underscore the call made by the president of my group, Mr Cohn-Bendit, to the European Commission, and to Mr Verheugen, for it to be made absolutely clear once and for all what the changes are that we expect Turkey to make."
"To cite one example: the role of the army."
"Yes, this must change - lots of things must change - but what exactly does the European Union want to happen before negotiations begin?"
"What must then happen while negotiations are in progress?"
"Will the constitution have to be changed, for example?"
"Will the National Security Council have to be abolished?"
"These are all specific examples of areas in which the EU will have to be much, much more specific."
"If we are not, I am convinced that we will end up in a disastrous discussion about the interpretation of the political criteria, one that will be dominated by prejudices rather than by objective assessment."
"If we are more specific, however, this will give Turkey a chance - not by exerting pressure but by demonstrating that European values and standards are normative, in Turkey as elsewhere."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioner Verheugen, ladies and gentlemen, I think I too must seize this opportunity to get something off my chest, as rarely have I experienced a Council Presidency that has concentrated so intently on the core issues and had such success in making them a reality."
"I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the Commission, and Commissioner Verheugen in particular, for their tremendous cooperation over the past few years, which has also helped us to contribute to this success."
"It is our belief, however, that we should welcome our new partners in a particularly splendid way, and there is in my view no better way to do this than on the Acropolis, so that we celebrate the unity of Europe right there on the Acropolis."
"At this time, we should, however, also make some critical observations."
"For, if the newly-acceding countries are to be enabled to absorb change, efforts must be stepped up to develop the necessary administrative capacities in these countries."
"I believe it to be equally important for the monitoring process, which has been agreed, to be implemented utterly openly and with the utmost rigour, so that we do not face problems at the end of it all."
"This is in the interests of the European Union as a whole and of its capacity to act even with 25 members."
"It is self-evident that we should make particular efforts to implement the institutional process in the context of the Convention's constitutional debate, and I think that the candidate countries should be given every opportunity to play an active political part both in this process within the Convention and also in the subsequent Intergovernmental Conference in accordance with the Laeken formula."
"The discussion in which we are engaged has, however, moved on to include Turkey and other countries."
"President Prodi, I am very grateful to you for addressing the issue of the wider Europe, to which we need to offer new options alongside full membership, with something like a 'European Economic Area Mark 2'. Here, we must also have the right, as a European Union, to represent our interests in relation to the financial arrangements and the cohesive effect of the legal institution, and be enabled in this way to discuss future memberships or other forms of partnership."
"I am, though, especially glad that it has been decided that Turkey is to be dealt with using the Community method."
"Instead of discrimination, whether positive or negative, there is a progress report by the Commission, and consultation in Parliament and in the Council as to whether the results justify the inception of negotiations."
"I really do believe it to be an essential step forward that this has been made clear and that misunderstandings have been prevented."
"I would, though, like to point out in addition that we have to have a clear view of the European Union's cohesive power, so that the Union may in future retain its capacity for further development, and, when I see that Tony Blair is saying - as reported in yesterday's media - that, with Turkey we are entering the Islamic sphere and that we should also consider North African membership of the European Union, we should say loud and clear that what lies behind this is a plan to destroy the European Union."
"That is something we must have no part in; on the contrary, we have to remain within the boundaries."
"Mr President, Copenhagen has opened a debate not just on the European identity but on the geopolitical borders of Europe and the very idea which must underlie the European Union as a Union of the peoples and regions of Europe."
"I believe that the founding fathers too imagined a Europe of cathedrals, expressing an ideal, with an image of a civilisation which is not that of the minarets of Anatolia."
"I am thinking of Strasbourg cathedral, which was built by great master builders who, like the master builders of Europe, certainly did not think of Europe as including Turkey, of a Europe which would change its borders and become the direct neighbour of Iran, Iraq and Syria."
"What can I say of the inclusion in Europe of a Turkey which has just elected as its leader a person, Mr Erdogan, who said to the Turkish newspaper, jumh Uriet, that millions of Muslims throughout the world are waiting for the reawakening of Turkey to rise up, a Turkey which yesterday refused to allow a former Sakharov Prizewinner, Leyla Zana, to leave the country, preventing her from coming to Strasbourg to take part in the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought awards ceremony?"
"This is a further warning to those in favour of Turkey's accession, whom we would strongly urge to remember the Armenian holocaust which Copenhagen wrongly disregarded."
"Mr President, the Danish presidency has won admiration for the intelligent and principled way in which the summit was prepared and was made a success."
"In the disputes surrounding the financial arrangements, we have taken sound initiatives."
"In the discussions on Turkey, we were surprised by the highly original and appropriate formulations which placed responsibility for accession fairly and squarely on Turkey itself."
"A formulation that was even better than the final outcome."
"My compliments to Mr Rasmussen in particular."
"I must say that I was filled with pride by the starring role played by Bertel Haarder, who was formerly one of our colleagues in this House."
"Mr Verheugen can now indeed look back on the difficult task he has now largely brought to a successful end with a feeling of relief."
"Bulgaria and Romania still have some way to go, and they accept that."
"If they do not achieve the target of 2004, I believe that they will do so by the 2009 elections."
"Turkey is a great deal more difficult."
"Up until the summit, Turkey gave us the impression that she was basing her accession to the European Union on seniority of membership applications."
"In doing so, she was forgetting that when she applied in 1963, the European Union was only an economic community with no internal market as we have today, no elected parliament, and no political aspects or ambitions."
"She is now suddenly asking a whole lot more, and that is the main issue here."
"While the European Union has been developing at high speed, Turkey has remained trapped in the disadvantages of its Kemalist system, a system with great internal tensions and therefore with widespread repression."
"Anyone who did not belong to the main population group of Sunni Turkish speakers had a difficult time."
"During a recent visit to Turkey I realised that as a Protestant I could not live in a place like Dyarbakir, for example, without coming into serious conflict with the authorities."
"That is ridiculous for a citizen of the European Union in an aspiring Member State."
"Things have only really been moving over the past two years."
"There is therefore still a very long way to go."
"Just as with Bulgaria and Romania, I would urge us not to be over-optimistic as regards the speed at which Turkey can change."
"You only have to think of the special position of the army, for example, which Mr Lagendijk has already mentioned."
"This position cannot simply be changed by means of a few formalities."
"The system is too deep-rooted for that."
"If you take away a cornerstone, much more may come tumbling down."
"It may be important to compile a list of the changes we want to see, such as to public order, which is accorded such extraordinary priority that individual human rights also suffer in many other areas as a result."
"I am delighted with the stance taken by Mr Verheugen, who said that his investigation will not be based on any preconceived answers whatsoever and that it will be an honest and thorough investigation."
"I think that there is every reason to believe that it will be, and also that we must make sure that we are not too superficial in what we do - something that often happens."
"I have great faith in what Mr Verheugen has said."
"We want a normal Member State; we do not, for example, want a Member State that makes demands and goes through life exerting political pressure by banging its fist on the table, as we saw recently."
"This is unacceptable; in my view Turkey will have to demonstrate goodwill by putting an end to torture, the deliberate provocation of minorities and suchlike."
"In the meantime we are looking forward to the participation of the observers from the first ten countries."
"This is a momentous event, and it is incredible to think that from 1989 to 2004 we have been part of this Parliament that has brought about such major historic changes."
"It would be arrogance to attempt to sum up the Copenhagen Summit in two minutes."
"I will therefore limit myself to a few points."
"First and foremost, I would like congratulate the Danish Presidency - and these congratulations are not just formal, they come from the heart - on the skill with which it has brought lengthy negotiations to a successful close."
"Secondly, we are witnessing an historic period of history, the full meaning of which we may not yet have grasped: for the first time in the history of mankind, a union of States is being built on the basis of a project of civilisation and shared values without recourse to military force."
"This means that we, the European Parliament, and the Council and the Commission, must evaluate very carefully something which President Prodi mentioned, namely the fact that, at this juncture, now Europe has been built, we need to make the rules."
"The rules of our founding fathers, the rules which were the basis for the development of the European Economic Community, now need very careful revision, revision which I am sure will be achieved by the Convention but which needs a further contribution."
"I would like to quote a statesman who lived two centuries ago in Italy - Count Camillo Benso di Cavour - who said."
"'We have made Italy, now we must make Italians!'"
"We have certainly made Europe at Copenhagen - now we have to make Europeans."
"And to make Europeans we need this large-scale information campaign promoting Europe - which our President mentioned this morning - which has been announced many times but will have to be implemented practically in the coming months, for what is happening here must be by common agreement between all our fellow European citizens."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, it has been said, and rightly so, that the Copenhagen Council put an end to the post-war division of Europe."
"We also need to put an end to a much older division, by which I mean the difficulties preventing eastern Europe from moving from the Middle Ages to the present day, difficulties which condemned it to a period of endless stagnation and cost it dearly in terms of both money and blood."
"It is time we paid our respects to the people of eastern Europe for their persistence and for their faith in the concept of progress, which I hope will be vindicated today."
"There has been a parallel achievement in southern Europe."
"It does not have the same material dimensions as eastern Europe, but it does have similar moral dimensions."
"Look at Cyprus, an ancient European people, a Hellenic people, which found itself in the grip of a nineteenth century colonial regime and finally - and rightly - rebelled against it in the middle of the twentieth century."
"As in numerous other instances, the consequences of that rebellion were - in English for the benefit of my British colleagues - an 'independence of sorts', but an independence accompanied by the partition of two nations, with the colonial power playing one off against the other on the basis of the classic principle of divide and rule."
"Today's Europe, with the admission of Cyprus and the call for the island's two nations to be reunited, will remedy the tragic consequences of the colonial adventure in - or rather the retrogressive order which governed - this European country."
"This is what is important, Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, not the fact that no agreement was reached."
"Of course, the Greek side responds fully to your call for an agreement to be reached by 27 February and, if there is a similar response on the Turkish side, an agreement will be reached."
"But what you should really be looking at is the response in the hearts of the Turkish-Cypriots, whose demonstrations show exactly what they think of their reactionary leaders."
"This is the real response and the real brilliance of Europe in the hearts of its people, when Europe sticks to its principles, and we must rely on this brilliance to move forward and build the future."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, in closing the Copenhagen European Council which brought together the Heads of State and Government of the Fifteen Member States, the President-in-Office, Mr Rasmussen, stressed the truly historic nature of this event which puts an end to the period of separation."
"The subject of our work over recent days was a common vision for the future of our continent."
"A stroke of good luck but also intense and extremely commendable work by the Union, and especially by the candidate countries, has meant that the enlargement process, launched in 1992 in the Danish capital and forming the basis of the famous political criteria, named after Copenhagen, on democracy, the rule of law and human rights, has been completed in the same place."
"Look at how much progress has been made over the last 50 years! Look at how many barriers have been torn down, how many misunderstandings have been overcome!"
"Twenty-five - soon to be twenty-seven - States are finally working together to achieve the objectives of freedom, democracy and responsibility. Such cooperation honours the fight that millions of our predecessors waged at the price of intense suffering and sacrifice."
"We still have a great deal of difficult ground to cover, no one has any illusions about this."
"The European Union must, in particular, respond to the need to make fundamental changes to the way it works and to its institutions."
"This is the work that the European Convention must bring to a successful conclusion under Mr Valéry Giscard d'Estaing."
"We hope that the European Convention will lead to a draft for a single constitutional treaty that is legible and which responds to the need for a Europe that is more efficient, more democratic and perceived to be more legitimate by all European citizens."
"Unless we fundamentally reform the way in which the European Union currently works, Europe's reunification will lead to weaker political will within Europe and this is something that we certainly do not want."
"Mr President, although the Copenhagen decision is indeed of historical significance, this is only one stage in the development of the European Union."
"It has been said quite rightly today that enlargement of this Union must go ahead."
"On the one hand, a number of countries - I am thinking here of the Balkan countries - await membership at a later date, and on the other, there are other countries with a well-founded claim to close partnership and equal status, by which I mean Russia and also the states bordering the Mediterranean."
"An enlarged EU must, though, strike a new balance between flexible and efficient decision-making and the aspects of the decision-making structures that have to do with democratic policy-making."
"Together with the representatives of the Council Presidency - I see that Mr Haarder is present - Parliament, the Council and the Commission are engaged in the search for a common basis for dialogue on better forms of governance."
"Mr Haarder has gone to a great deal of trouble to provide a number of contributions."
"Even though he is now the representative of a government and no longer a member of this House, a certain awareness may be at work here."
"The main thing, though, is that there are a number of governments that are far more restrictive than he wishes to be."
"I see that as highly problematic, as not enough governments have made public commitments to transparency and public access, especially as regards their decision-making structures."
"I would particularly like to thank President Prodi for the way in which the Commission has again presented a range of proposals that point a way forward to possibly better and, at the same time, more democratic ways of governing, principally indicating how the Council and Parliament can participate in lawmaking with equal rights."
"Not all of the Commissioners have realised, however, that when this House delegates and cedes the power to make laws, we can, of course, do so only on certain conditions and in conjunction with a right of recall."
"I hope, though, that the next conversations, which we will be having at the beginning of the Greek Presidency, will bring us a result."
"I appreciate it when the Commission and the Council keep on reiterating their obligation to insist on adherence to the Treaties, but I ask them to acknowledge that we in this House have to insist on the principles of democracy being guaranteed by the legislators' participation in the process of drafting laws."
"We will be having elections in 2004, which we will not win against each other; we can win them only with each other and only when we make it our real concern that there should be greater flexibility, greater efficiency, and also more democracy in the European Union."
"Mr President, the historic decision taken by the Copenhagen Council will doubtless help to restore the unity of Europe lost after the war."
"The accession of central and eastern European countries, together with Cyprus and Malta, is another step in the evolutionary process of the unique phenomenon we refer to as European integration and I should like to congratulate both the Danish presidency and the Commission and Commissioner Verheugen on their successful handling of the entire process."
"I do not have much time so I will make just two comments."
"First of all, because of the economic and financial repercussions of enlargement as the result of the accession of new Member States, the Union will have to be bold in adjusting its financial perspectives if they are to meet the demands both of enlargement and of its citizens and make an effective contribution to the stability and cohesion of the societies of the Member States, especially the new Member States."
"Secondly, I should like to comment on the accession of Cyprus and, more particularly, the atmosphere surrounding the Copenhagen Council."
"It seems to me that the Council satisfied all of us because it showed that Europe can manage its affairs both wisely and decisively, taking as its criterion the construction of a healthy, democratic structure in which human rights and the proper values of human society are respected."
"We must not, however, forget that a solution to the problem still needs to be found and that Copenhagen was unable to find one because the Turkish and Turkish-Cypriot leaders refused to focus on a solution."
"We must now make every effort and do all we can to bring about the integration of the whole island within the next two months."
"However, I would point out that the solution to the Cyprus problem, however badly needed, must keep the fundamental principles of the Treaties of the European Union intact."
"Any derogations from the acquis communautaire, any transitional arrangements included in the solution to the Cyprus problem must not leave factors which violate basic principles of the European Union behind once they expire."
"I call on the European Commission, as the guardian of the Treaties, to keep a close watch to ensure that the solution does in fact abide by the Treaties of the European Union."
"Last Friday, 13 December, I went to the cinema to see Roman Polanski's film, 'The Pianist', the story of a Jewish musician from Warsaw who survived the Second World War in a miraculous way."
"At the beginning of the film we see how his family reacts with relief to the news that the British and the French have announced that they will be coming to help the Poles following the invasion of Poland by the Germans."
"We all know that nothing came of that help until last Friday, the thirteenth."
"On that day the outcome at Copenhagen paid off an old debt."
"The success of Copenhagen is success for everyone - including for this Parliament, which has been so intensively involved in this process."
"We can be proud of this result."
"To paraphrase the words of the great social democrat Willy Brandt, something that belongs together is now really being given the opportunity to grow more closely together."
"What started with Brandt's historic genuflection in that self-same Warsaw has now been completed in Copenhagen."
"The credit for this new historic moment goes mainly to those who brought about the momentous changes in 1989 and 1990 and who were astute enough to make the most of the opportunity to turn the new democracies into fully-fledged EU candidate countries."
"Many of those who were leaders at the time have now disappeared from the political stage, but the outcome of Copenhagen is also a tribute to them."
"Of course, our own European Union also deserves to be congratulated, as it may well have taken a long time to formulate the starting points and preconditions for accession, but it has subsequently maintained the agreed scenario and adhered to the agreed timetable consistently and efficiently."
"In this context I would like to pay particular tribute to Mr Verheugen's efforts."
"The candidate countries are also deserving of praise."
"Their staying power has really been put to the test."
"As rapporteur for this Parliament for Slovakia, I myself have experienced the efforts made by the Slovaks to meet the EU's conditions at close hand."
"They were far-reaching, and there was very little time."
"The emphasis in the reports from the end of last week about the results of the Copenhagen Summit was on the financial arrangements for the negotiations and the Turkey question."
"Both aspects are important, but they are not the only weighty matters."
"Other problems also play a role in the European Parliament's final assessment that we have to issue for each candidate country."
"It is enough in this case to remember our earlier concerns on matters like the battle against corruption, the lack of administrative capacity in the accession countries and the discrimination against the Roma."
"Mr President, I, too, would like to congratulate Mr Rasmussen, Mr Haarder, Mr Prodi and Mr Verheugen on this excellent outcome."
"I would also like to join our group chairman, Mr Poettering, in emphasising that this small country has produced a great achievement."
"This really means that we will not have to change this rotation system in the future."
"Experience teaches us that big countries sometimes do not do things very well, and that small countries sometimes do things very well indeed."
"I say to Denmark that you can be proud of the outcome."
"Secondly I would like to make some comments on enlargement."
"I am delighted that Poland has made it to the first group of accession countries."
"This was of course not without problems."
"It would also probably be a good idea - and I am addressing this to Mr Verheugen - to give the Member States an even better explanation of what enlargement is really going to cost us."
"If we are aware that there is still a leeway of some EUR 25 billion before we reach the EU expenditure ceiling, and if we know that we will only be incurring costs of EUR 12 billion in the first year of enlargement, EUR 12.6 billion in the second year and EUR 14.9 billion in the third year, we will know that despite enlargement we will still have money left over in 2006."
"We must therefore make it clearer that this enlargement is not expensive; in fact it is cheaper than all the enlargements that have gone before."
"Thirdly , I would like to mention Cyprus and Turkey."
"It is a pity that Cyprus has not been included in its entirety, but it is a good thing that we have made sensible arrangements with regard to Turkey, which does not yet have a date for accession, but will have to adhere explicitly to the arrangements agreed at Copenhagen and will be tested against them."
"I think that this is very important."
"Actually I wonder whether Turkey ever ought to accede, as we will then have to tackle the debate about Europe's borders at some stage."
"My last comment is this: you had a visit from Mr Giscard d'Estaing, and I have the honour of being a member of the Convention."
"Mr Giscard d'Estaing once again spoke about the president of the European Union and the congress that would have to be set up."
"Those are his ideas."
"I can tell you that there is really very little support for this in the Convention."
"If we ever need a president of the European Union, it should be the president of the European Commission, and we do not need a European congress at all."
"It is this European Parliament that needs more powers."
"That is also what it says in the Benelux statement."
"If all small countries endorse this, we will fortunately be able to consign this nonsense of Mr Giscard d'Estaing's to the scrap heap."
"I hope, therefore, that Denmark will back this."
"Mr President, the Danish presidency set itself an extremely ambitious agenda for the Copenhagen Summit."
"As a result, two fraught days were spent in Copenhagen negotiating a financial package, with divisions at one stage threatening to stall proceedings."
"However, once this had been resolved, the EU formally invited eight countries from Central and Eastern Europe, plus Cyprus and Malta, to join in 2004."
"This was a momentous occasion in European history, finally bringing to an end the divisions created by the Cold War."
"However, it must be said that enlargement is not yet complete."
"Negotiations have still to be concluded with Bulgaria and Romania and have yet to begin with Turkey."
"I endorse the commitment given at the Copenhagen Summit to start the negotiations with Turkey in 2004, subject, of course, to a review on progress on human rights and rule of law issues."
"I have consistently argued that the accession of Turkey could form an important bridgehead between East and West and help consolidate Turkey as a secular democracy and a calming force in an otherwise unstable region."
"As a result of these momentous decisions, our new neighbours will be Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova."
"Now is the time to consider what sort of relationship we want to develop with these countries and how far we want it to go."
"In conclusion, I am pleased that the recent uncertainty regarding the timetable for enlargement, which was partly due to our rejection of the Treaty of Nice in the first Irish referendum, has been removed."
"It will now proceed in May 2004, ironically under the Irish presidency and indeed, Mr President, during your final six months as President of this Parliament."
"I look forward to welcoming the new accession countries into the EU family on that historic occasion."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the year that is coming to its end has been a remarkable one for Europe."
"The introduction of euro notes and coins has made the internal market a domestic one."
"The Copenhagen resolutions have set in motion the process of ratification for enlargement as a precondition for the reunification of Europe, and have enabled the legacy of Yalta and of the post-war era to be overcome."
"This move also has knock-on effects on all the Member States and candidate countries, including my own country, which possessed the longest external - and dead - border."
"From Europe's margin, we have moved back, to be - as the Austrian national anthem puts it - like a heart at its centre."
"Our task is to draw closer together, to build up Europe's stability and its capacity to act, to listen, to be desirous of mutual understanding, to tear down walls and cut through barbed-wire fences - wherever they were or will be set up."
"Neither Copenhagen nor participation in the 2004 elections to Parliament bring the accession process to a conclusion."
"Information, communication and reform continue to be needed."
"The European projects call for the public to be more deeply involved, and not only prior to the ratification of treaties."
"Far from being already at an end, the process of enlargement is moving forward, and I am thinking not only of Bulgaria and Romania, but also of Croatia and the countries of the former Yugoslavia, of Switzerland and Liechtenstein."
"As my final point, let me say that transit policy is evidence of the fact that the Danish Presidency, to which I am very grateful, is at work right through to its last day."
"Let me tell you, as an Austrian, that we give the utmost support to the proposal to be found in COREPER, because it is right and good."
"It is my expectation that a resolution will be passed at 3 p.m. this afternoon, or, failing that, at the extraordinary council of Transport Ministers on 31 December."
"Let us put an end to transitional arrangements; let us establish European rules and introduce the infrastructure costs directive in 2003 at the latest!"
"- (DA) Mr President, first and foremost, I should like to express my thanks for a constructive and positive debate and for the many positive comments on the Danish Presidency in general and the course of the Copenhagen Summit in particular."
"The Presidency views the cooperation it has enjoyed with Parliament as constructive and positive, and we are delighted to see that Parliament shares this view."
"A number of questions have been posed, and so many subjects have been raised that it is impossible for me to comment on everything that has been said in the limited time available; but I should like to highlight a few subjects that many people have mentioned."
"The debate is closed."
"I have received six motions for resolution pursuant to Rule (42)5"
"When prices increase, the value of wages decreases."
"To protect themselves against this, the trade unions in many European countries have battled for years for indexing."
"This means that it is not necessary to negotiate on compensation for the reduction in purchasing power every year but only on the extent to which workers should participate in productivity increases and on the making up of arrears suffered by some occupational groups who have been underpaid for years."
"Pressure from employers' organisations and the support afforded by neo-liberal governments have in very many cases reversed this indexing."
"This can result in increasing intransigence in wage disputes."
"Attempts are repeatedly being made to place the blame for inflation or the lack of money for useful government expenditure on the shoulders of the workers."
"This means that in the eyes of the Right and the employers, the economy will flourish only if a majority of the people accepts a creeping drop in purchasing power."
"They do not consider the loss of domestic purchasing power that this can cause, or the excessive profits and too low taxes."
"Official statistics on wage costs and the development of prices become an important item of information in labour disputes and in the way in which governments and employers attempt to manipulate these disputes."
"The regulation on labour cost index will not eliminate this conflict of interests."
". (PT) The Commission considers a labour cost index to be of utmost importance for the European Central Bank, to monitor inflation in the EMU, and for social partners to use in negotiating wage agreements."
"The current proposal seeks to remedy that by establishing a common framework for the production, transmission and evaluation of comparable labour cost indices."
"In short, it is being proposed that, in order to calculate labour costs, the total quarterly costs incurred by the employer in the employment of labour must be taken into account."
"In implementing the regulation, the Commission shall be assisted by the Statistical Programme Committee."
"The Commission will submit a report to Parliament and the Council every two years on the regulation's implementation, including an assessment of the quality of the data supplied."
"In its Common Position, the Council has made a number of adjustments to the original Commission proposal. The rapporteur considers that these changes are in line with the spirit of the original proposal and I therefore wish to use this explanation of vote to express my favourable position."
". (PT) Having seen that the lack, to date, of a common framework for the production, transmission and evaluation of comparable labour cost indices has been a major weakness in the action plan for EMU statistics - a fact that will also have a detrimental effect on inflation in the Eurozone - I have supported this report, which rightly seeks to guarantee the existence of this common framework."
"In fact, as the rapporteur points out, this common framework will enable the ECB to monitor changes in inflation within the EMU and will be of enormous benefit to the social partners in negotiating wage agreements."
"As in countless other cases, transparent and reliable information and the existence of clear and understood criteria these days constitute a crucial tool."
"This will contribute both to the upstream adoption of fair, proportionate and appropriate measures by national and Community authorities and to serving as a downstream tool for clarifying the role and interests of economic actors and ensuring that the composition of these is balanced."
"Whilst welcoming the establishment of this common framework, I still look forward to the results of this new regulation's implementation, in which the quality of data in particular will be assessed, because the Commission will have to present a report on the new regulation's implementation to the European Parliament and to the Council every two years."
"(PT) I congratulate Mr Pohjamo on the excellent report he has drafted on the Parliament and Council proposal for a regulation on the carriage of passengers, freight and mail by air, which I support, especially with regard to the need to adopt regulations that will enable mechanisms to be set up to provide European carriers with up-to-date and comparable statistics for this sector."
"These will help to guarantee the safety of passengers and the efficient management of these companies."
"In this context, I should also like to emphasise the importance that this set of regulations will have in helping to resolve the issue of air space saturation."
"As a former rapporteur for Customs 2000, I have an active interest in EU cooperation on customs in the EU and have voted for the Mollar report, which improves the exchange of information."
"In all matters relating to the area of freedom, security and justice, a balance must be struck between the freedom of the individual and the urgent need to tackle the rise in organised crime."
"It is hoped that the customs file identification database (FIDE) will make a positive contribution to the fight against organised crime in the EU."
"As regards Mr Nisticò's report on the regulation of the distribution of human blood, it can truly be said, Mr President, that this conciliation process was a fight to the last drop of blood."
"However, blood also indicates nobility, when it is blue, and we have to admit that the rapporteur, Mr Nisticò, is not lacking in nobility."
"It also indicates a sanguine nature, which Mr Nisticò, like all the people of Calabria, certainly has, so much so that he has achieved great success in this conciliation."
"It also means solidarity, for to give blood is to show solidarity."
"Therefore, with the greatest of pleasure, I voted for the report."
"Mr President, I would also like to welcome this report and the new directive."
"The passing on of contaminated blood can and does have fatal consequences and I welcome strongly the proposals to regulate the transportation of blood and to ensure supervision by qualified staff, which represent an important step forward in this directive."
"I would like to thank medical staff at Addenbrookes Hospital in Cambridge and at the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital, both of which are in my constituency, who have given me help and advice so that I could contribute to this directive."
"They want to convey the importance not only of qualified staff to supervise the process but also of training for all those who handle blood, because human error is the biggest source of accident in this respect."
"Finally, the voluntary donation of blood - which is an important principle for us in Britain in particular - has the added benefit of ensuring the highest possible voluntary screening-out of the health risk associated with blood transfusion."
"We should be thanking and congratulating all those millions of people in Britain and throughout Europe who give blood."
"We should also appeal to the 94% of people who do not give blood to do so in future."
". (PT) This report has sought to ensure that more rigorous standards are adopted for the eligibility of blood and plasma donors and that blood donations are screened, to establish a Community-level quality-control system for blood transfusion centres, complemented by an equivalent system of control and approval in the Member States and to set common standards for staff training and the traceability of blood from donor to patient."
"On 12 June 2002, Parliament adopted eight amendments at second reading."
"Under the written procedure, a compromise solution was reached and accepted by the Council, in conciliation, for donors to be examined by qualified health professionals."
"For all these reasons, this report has won my vote."
". (PT) This new directive makes it binding on Member States to provide the public with access to environmental information held by the authorities, in terms arising from a compromise reached between the Council and Parliament, which I think is acceptable."
"In short, the joint text lays down:"
"the obligation for public authorities to actively assist citizens in their search for information, encouraging them to use the new technologies to answer their requests;"
"quality standards designed to ensure that the information supplied is up-to-date, accurate and reliable;"
"the principle that information should be provided to the public free of charge, although it has been accepted that a charge can be made, restricted to 'a reasonable amount'."
"Because this compromise strengthens the citizens' right to obtain information from national, regional or local authorities, specifically in the event of river contamination, the construction of new projects or the destruction of natural habitats of protected species of flora or fauna, thereby increasing transparency in areas of common interest, I could only vote in favour of this report."
". (PT) I have, of course, voted in favour of this important report, which seeks to establish common criteria for access to information, to ensure public participation in the decision-making process and access to justice in environmental matters, because I believe that this access to information - and I am talking about high-quality information - on environmental matters must today be considered to be a standard prerogative of citizenship."
"In fact, establishing rules for such access will effectively contribute to control by the citizens in an area that concerns everyone - a genuine Citizens' Control to protect our environmental heritage."
"I therefore feel it is quite appropriate to strengthen the mechanisms for access to information and to information technologies."
"The trend of authorities providing environmental information without charge, in conjunction with promoting the use of information technologies - especially the Internet - will lead to this information being widely and freely accessible, subject, of course, to the necessary restrictions when national security, court cases or industrial rights or those concerning intellectual property are concerned."
"Lastly, I welcomed the idea of establishing practical arrangements to ensure that information about the environment is used effectively, and of granting of more rigorous powers to the Member States in this context, which will result in greater responsibility for these, but also in the subsidiarity principle being implemented."
"That concludes voting time."
"(The sitting was suspended at 12.30 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"The minutes from yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, one very quick question: I have just read in a Spanish newspaper that Nestlé, a large multinational, is demanding USD 6 million from Ethiopia in the middle of a famine."
"I really do not know what kind of world we are living in, and I cannot get over my amazement, regardless of the economic and legal reasons this multinational may have."
"Whatever the case, the situation is none the less cruel."
"I share your concern, Mr Bautista."
"The problem is that I asked about the Minutes and, although your contribution was not entirely irrelevant, it is the Minutes that plenary was supposed to be discussing."
"(The Minutes were adopted)"
"- (DA) Mr President, I should like to thank Parliament for this opportunity to express, on behalf of the Council, my deepest sympathy with those affected by the devastating and scandalous pollution that followed the accident involving the oil tanker Prestige off the Galician coast."
"I believe that we all hoped that, following the Erika accident in 1999 - I myself was present at discussions on this here in Parliament - we had put an end to this kind of disaster in the heart of Europe."
"Unfortunately it has happened again, however, and thus maritime safety and the prevention of oil slick disasters is back on the agenda."
"Following the Erika accident, the Council and Parliament adopted a number of measures to improve safety and reduce oil pollution at sea."
"We still do not know what went wrong to cause the wreck off the Galician coast, but the fact that it could happen is, in itself, proof enough that further action is required."
"There is now a need for us to make whatever efforts are necessary to prevent this kind of accident in the future - and for us to send a strong political signal to the population, shipowners, captains, and everyone involved in transporting oil, in particular."
"On 21 November, Parliament made a strong statement on the Prestige accident."
"I should like to say to Mrs de Palacio that the Commission, in my opinion, has shown great energy in acting on this difficult matter."
"Both institutions deserve praise for the Community's swift action in initiating decisions promoting maritime safety and the protection of the marine environment."
"We now have a starting point from which to proceed with the matter."
"It has been the Presidency's intention to treat the Prestige accident extremely seriously."
"The matter was placed on the agenda of the Council of Transport Ministers on 6 December and at the Council meeting of Environment Ministers on 9 December, and I was present when it was also discussed in detail at the European Council meeting in Copenhagen last week."
"This was one of the reasons why there was a delay, meaning that the ministers did not end up dining with the Queen of Denmark."
"It was important to the Presidency that the meeting produce tangible results, and we can now say that it did indeed produce results."
"The Council has declared that all the relevant measures will be taken to prevent this kind of accident: at international, EU and national level."
"I am happy that the Council Conclusions are fully in line with the views of the European Parliament."
"Both the Council and the Presidency hold the view that we have achieved a good result, one which sends out the strong political signal we need: a firm line against single-hull tankers in the EU and the political will to find solutions."
"It is my hope that Parliament will make an active contribution - and I am quite sure that it will - to the rapid achievement of the goals set."
"In particular, I am thinking of the measures that Parliament and the Council will be adopting together under the codecision procedure."
"These include accelerating the phasing-out of single-hull tankers."
"I have no doubt that we can agree on this, given the will and resolve that Parliament has shown in this matter."
"The Council is also looking forward to constructive cooperation with Parliament, so that there is no unnecessary delay in putting in place the tightening of regulations and the rules on liability that are needed for the purposes of prevention and in order to ensure that, if accidents should happen, it is the right people who are made to pay: that is, those responsible."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, only a few weeks ago, when the Prestige had just sunk, I made clear to Parliament my fury and disappointment that we had been unable to prevent this tragedy from occurring."
"Unable to prevent a tragedy that was foreseen, that we knew could happen at any time and that we could not prevent because we lacked the political impetus, the will, the decisiveness required to move more swiftly and decisively in applying the measures proposed by the Commission at the time."
"Today I must reiterate this."
"I would like to do so because we cannot allow a third disaster to take place."
"We cannot, following the Erika and the Prestige, allow another Erika or Prestige to sully our coasts."
"The result of this debate and your vote tomorrow, here in Parliament, must therefore be the same result as that of 6 December in the Council of Ministers, in other words, a clear, determined will to implement radical changes, to take decisions immediately, in all the Member States of the Union and to go further, at international level, because, I repeat, we need to protect European coastlines first of all, but Europe also has international leadership responsibilities, which mean that we need to respect and maintain clean seas throughout the world, not just along our own coastlines."
"In this regard, I would first like to thank the Danish Presidency for the decisive support given by the Council of Ministers the other day to these measures, which specifically led to Council conclusions that are, if they are really put into practice - and that is the key - a genuine, decisive step forward for European maritime security."
"I would therefore like to thank the Danish Presidency for its work, but I would then like to say that the statements made the other day must be put into practice, in each and every country in the European Union."
"Putting them into practice means that when decisions are taken to prohibit the entry into and exit from European ports of single-hulled vessels carrying oil, tar, bituminous products or heavy fuel oil, these decisions must be upheld."
"It means asking the Commission to present a proposal to bring forward the deadline for banning single-hulled vessels, single-hulled oil tankers, for oil transportation, from our waters and then supporting this proposal when it is on the table at the Council of Ministers."
"It means that when we say we are going to increase controls in ports in the various States of the Union, we actually employ the necessary staff, provide them with the necessary means and carry out these controls."
"It means that when we say we are going to promote progress in international maritime legislation at international level, adapting international maritime legislation to new challenges, new risks and new social demands, we really do promote this from now on, all together, all Fifteen of us, and, I hope, the ten new States and the other candidate countries."
"(Applause)"
"It means that when we say we are going to allow the Agency, which we are currently setting up and which will begin work, I hope, in January, to begin to monitor and indicate, where necessary, any deficiencies or shortcomings, we pay attention to the Agency when it does point any out and that we take the necessary steps to correct them."
"These are the factors we need to promote."
"We have already seen the results of prolonged delays, paying more attention to certain problems."
"I do not deny that these problems existed but they prevented us from taking swift enough action."
"We cannot allow the tragic results of this to happen again along European coastlines."
"I must stipulate that, following the Erika disaster, it has been extremely frustrating for me to see that we in Europe have been unable to do what the United States did after the Exxon Valdez incident."
"I refuse to believe that we in the European Union should be content with fewer laws and fewer powers than the citizens of the United States, for example."
"I repeat, therefore, that the European Union is not enough."
"We must also make progress at international level."
"Mr President, the Commission, and I shall end here, understands that there are various levels and timetables."
"We are now experiencing the impact of these coastlines destroyed by an oil slick, and having to deal with these people whose lives, homes and opportunities are affected. That is the issue we must address first of all."
"We must solve existing problems, and European solidarity has been demonstrated clearly here, in the Transport Council and the Environment Council, and, I would imagine, is currently being demonstrated in the Fisheries Council, in any case, in the Copenhagen European Council."
"This solidarity has also been demonstrated with regard to funds; reprogramming funds; direct access to disaster funds; economic contributions, but also providing resources, people and efforts by the various countries of the Union which, in different ways, have helped to mitigate the disaster we are currently facing."
"Although this must be our immediate concern, however, we also need to act immediately, urgently, to prevent any more disasters of this kind."
"We must act, as I have said, to implement bans within the Member States to ensure that the most contaminating products are transported in more secure vessels, to guarantee that these are monitored to the highest possible degree; but we also need to act immediately, while knowing that this will only bear fruit in the medium term, at international level, to promote change in international maritime law."
"Lastly, I would like to say that the Commission, as well as setting up the Agency, as well as authorising and mobilising various funds, as well as making changes with regard to the use and allocation of certain existing funds, will now table a regulation with a European standard to speed up the timetable for banning single-hulled vessels in the field of oil transportation in European waters and ports."
"Immediately banning the use of all vessels but the most secure means banning single-hulled vessels in the transportation of the most contaminating products and therefore requiring the use of double-hulled vessels."
"In order to make progress in clarifying responsibilities, we need to create a penal classification at European level, in all the countries of the Union, to cover serious negligence, when this type of situation occurs."
"I would like, by means of this and other measures, to further increase the security of our ports and our waters, internally and at international level."
"Mr President, I would like to end by saying that the Commission, just as it did in the case of the Erika, is responding promptly, swiftly and decisively."
"We hope that the Council and Parliament will respond similarly and with the same political and practical commitment, so that we might avoid having to hold another debate such as this in years to come."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the European institutions for the solidarity they have shown towards the people and regions affected and I would also like to thank the parliamentary groups that supported us in holding a debate, as Mr Haarder pointed out, on 21 November, and in repeating it today."
"It is essential for Galicia in particular, but also Asturias, Cantabria, the Basque country, and the French and Portuguese regions affected, to see very clearly that we shall continue to support them, and that by no means should they feel alone."
"I would now like to put forward a proposal that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is to table, for the Conference of Presidents to request a report from the European Commission and make the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism responsible for holding a public hearing on maritime transport safety in Europe and the consequences of this kind of accident."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this is by far the worst ecological disaster that my country has suffered and it is a disaster of European proportions that no country has the means to tackle alone."
"It is true that the sinking of the Erika was a nasty but salutary shock which, as we have seen, was insufficient, and the Vice-President of the Commission is right to express her indignation."
"I therefore believe that today we in Parliament should remember the measures she proposed at the time with the support of the European Parliament, which the Council did not support."
"That must be the basis for our work, in order to achieve a reasonable level of safety so that this kind of event does not occur again on our seas and along our coastlines."
"Mr President, this is not a natural disaster."
"There are guilty parties: not the wind or the sea, but people with names."
"This ecological, social and human disaster, however, requires us to mobilise all the financial means available to the European Union and also the recently created Solidarity Fund."
"It is true that we in Parliament are subject to the Rules of Procedure that all the groups approved, but the situation requires that we act generously and flexibly."
"Although this Fund did not exist when the Erika sank, I would also like to ask the European Commission, what means were authorised for recovery operations along the French coast?"
"I shall now turn to the Council to ask it to commit to the proposals to increase maritime safety, which have the backing of both the Commission and Parliament, and to fulfil the commitment given in Copenhagen to create a compensation fund for the damages caused by oil spills."
"I shall end, Mr President, by calling upon the Socialist Group in general, but more particularly my fellow Spanish Members."
"Two motions of censure have already been discussed against the government of the Partido Popular in Galicia, and the Galician Parliament has set up a committee of inquiry."
"Here we formally propose that we all work side by side to help those affected and increase maritime transport safety, but if you do not want to, if you do not have the heart, at least let us work towards this."
"Mr President, yet again this Parliament finds itself debating another maritime disaster."
"We are now faced with a disaster of such magnitude that it is no longer just a transport issue, it is also an environmental, social and fishing issue, which is why my group believes a committee of inquiry is needed to ascertain what went wrong with the Prestige."
"On behalf of my group, I express to the people of Galicia our sadness at their tragedy and our solidarity and support in their battle against this modern-day black death that is threatening their livelihoods and damaging their shores."
"This Parliament would be fully justified in saying to our own Council of Ministers and to the IMO: 'We told you so!'"
"The parliamentary records are full of calls from this body for action on maritime safety."
"From the Estonia to the Braer, from the Sea Empress to the Erika."
"We have highlighted flags of convenience, inadequate port state control, single-hull tankers and deficient crews and yet, despite our best efforts and the support of the Commission, our own Council of Ministers has failed to heed the warnings and take decisive action and has been instrumental in ensuring that the IMO is one of the most ineffective bodies ever."
"I say to the people of Galicia that it should be our own Council of Ministers and the IMO, not them, with oil on their hands at this moment."
"They have let the people of Galicia and all of us down on this issue of maritime safety."
"The Council of Ministers does not want a committee of inquiry, as there are probably too many skeletons in its cupboard for that."
"However, it is shocking that the PPE-DE Group opposes such a move."
"It is a clear snub to the people of Galicia."
"They seem to be more concerned about protecting political friends than protecting the people of Europe."
"This is the worst ecological disaster for years and the PPE-DE Group calls for a hearing - pathetic!"
"The time for talking is over."
"What we need is action - to ban the flags of convenience in our waters; to improve our port state control; to ensure that the ships of shame are detained; to ban all single-hull tankers; to ensure that those responsible for these disasters pay the full cost of the damage that they caused; and last, but not least, to ensure that the Prestige is the last tanker to spread its black death over our coastline."
"Mr Haarder, take the message back to the Council: no more blocking, delay, subsidiarity or hiding behind the IMO - action is what we demand!"
"Commissioner, you are not the only one who is angry."
"When I see how this event is destroying the livelihoods of so many people and of a whole region, we are all angry."
"On behalf of my group I can tell you that our hearts are with them all, and I believe that we must offer them help through all the channels we have."
"Here in Parliament we must do what a parliament must do, however, which is to make rules and reinforce existing rules."
"The first thing I would like to ask - and I am also addressing this request to my good friend Mr Bertel Haarder - is that we apply the existing rules and that we take Erika I and II in hand."
"There is still a document being debated in the Council, Mr Haarder, and I hope that you will do something about this."
"We must also tighten up a number of things that are contained in Erika I and II;"
"I am thinking in particular of ports of refuge and safe anchorages."
"In order to prevent major catastrophes, we must make this system compulsory, so that ships that get into difficulties can get help there and are not turned away."
"We must draw up a rule for this."
"The Commission is supposed to be carrying out a study."
"We must have this."
"We must also have a compensation rule for ports or places of refuge that take in ships."
"We now have a ship lying at a depth of 3 500 metres with 50 000 tonnes of oil still on board, and this ship will be causing problems for years."
"We must avoid this kind of thing in future."
"Secondly, I would like to comment on port state control, as mentioned by Mr Simpson."
"Let us tighten this up for hazardous ships."
"It is absolutely no use checking 25% of ships in good condition; you must focus the controls on hazardous ships and old ships."
"We must make sure that ships passing through sensitive shipping zones are better controlled."
"We ask that you enter into negotiations with third countries, including with Russia, with a view to possibly signing bilateral agreements in this regard."
"It is time to put an end to the quarrels between the Council, the IMO and the Commission."
"The Commission must negotiate and must be given the opportunity to talk about this; then we will have much stricter rules."
"International legislation - and this is clearly stated in the resolution we all agree on - cannot be a reason to destroy the environment and people's lives."
"The one must not take priority over the other."
"Finally, with regard to the debate on procedures; together with the Commission and the Council, we must act fast and get rules down on paper."
"We are therefore not in favour of a committee of enquiry, as this would take too long."
"Mr President, the speed at which the European Union has taken certain decisions is a perfect illustration of what up till now has been Community inaction in the field of maritime safety."
"Clearly if these decisions had been taken earlier, if the Prestige had had an accident, it would not have occurred in Community waters."
"Two points should be made in this regard: firstly, to determine the reason for this inaction and the delays in taking decisions, and secondly, to determine whether the measures adopted are sufficient."
"In this respect, my political group considers the decisions adopted in Copenhagen to be insufficient, even though they are a step forward, and by way of example, the matter of flags of convenience has not even been addressed."
"The Council, and I am now going to refer to its previous management, who could have prevented the current situation from arising, considerably shortened the Commission's proposal, thus allowing floating timebombs to continue sailing until 2005, instead of having taken them out of use in September 2002, which is what would have happened if attention had been paid to the Commission."
"The delays in transposing the legislation, or in applying the Erika I and Erika II packages, speak volumes, as do the failures to comply with this legislation, concerning inspections and controls of vessels, for example."
"The permissive attitude that allows flags of convenience to be entered in registers by the Member States is no more constructive, and there are other causes for concern."
"I think that the issues I have raised constitute grounds for investigating levels of infringement of Community law and poor administration and, consequently, for establishing a committee of inquiry."
"Mr Galeote, although you chose to address the Socialist Group, which is very large, and my group is tiny, I am going to speak sincerely, on behalf of a very small group, but one that on vital issues has been involved, modestly, side by side with all our Spanish colleagues."
"From this modest experience I am going to say, first of all, that you have forgotten that you prevented a committee of inquiry from being set up in the Spanish national Parliament."
"Secondly, it is one thing to take decisions that could be questionable and that, at best, have proved to be wrong, and it is another, more serious, matter to adopt a communication policy to deny the problem, failing to take preventative and corrective action."
"The most serious aspect of your government's management in Galicia is that the State had no plans or instruments to address the crisis immediately."
"This comes as no surprise, Mr Galeote, when Mr Aznar supports the idea that we need to reduce State public services to a minimum."
"The issue we must now address - as elected Members of Parliament - is the people's feeling that they have to tackle a disaster with small-scale means and great sacrifice, while the State, to which they pay their taxes, remains either impotent or implacable, I am not sure which."
"What is done is done."
"There is nothing more to do except think about compensating those affected until economic activity can be rebuilt."
"In order to do this, the Solidarity Fund and the Structural Funds need to be mobilised rapidly."
"In conclusion, allow me to make one point: at a time of enlargement, we need a large Europe, but not a Europe that is an empty shell, and what cannot go on is the current failure to implement serious processes to prevent those operating on the edge of the law, in search of speculative profits, reducing safety conditions and social protection, from continuing as if nothing had happened."
"Mr President, Mr Haarder has described the tragedy of the Prestige as scandalous. The Commissioner, Mrs de Palacio, has said it was an unnecessary incident which could have been avoided."
"This means that both the Presidency of the Council and the Commission and even Mr Galeote feel that there is blame to be apportioned."
"This is why we are calling for Parliament to set up a committee of inquiry with the task of identifying where the different responsibilities for the incident and for the subsequent salvage and emergency operations lie, particularly where the Spanish Government is concerned, which, I would remind you, was amongst those who firmly supported the rejection and weakening of the 'Erika package' and which is now calling in major building and construction firms to clean up the beaches."
"We condemn the fact that the Council has only adopted part of the Commission's proposals. Here, we would like to pay tribute to the Belgian Minister - who, moreover, is one of the few remaining Greens - who was one of the very few people to support the package proposed by the Commission and to fight for it to be adopted in its entirety."
"The European Union needs its own legislative framework because we are absolutely sure that the international community will not be able to produce adequate legislation."
"We feel that there are two supplementary measures which need to be taken in addition to those already adopted."
"Firstly, the port state control bodies must carry out inspections on at least 25% of the ships entering each of the ports of the individual Member States rather than an average calculation being carried out at national level."
"Secondly, there must be new standards ensuring that dangerous substances are transported in smaller container ships than at present with a maximum capacity of 10 000 tonnes. Moreover, we feel that the Commission proposal for a directive on environmental liability must also include marine pollution and that, in the event of oil spillage, the European Union must adopt the same financial responsibility system as that already applied in the United States, where ship owners have unlimited financial responsibility if blame for the incident can be attributed to them."
"Lastly, Mr President, the European Union must provide sufficient financial support through the Structural Funds and through the Solidarity Fund to meet the needs of Galicia and northern Spain and help them to recover from this disaster."
"Moreover, we must on no account disregard the fact that many Nature 2000 areas are affected by this disaster."
"Mr President, all policy-makers must realise that our dependence on imported oil inevitably brings with it transportation risks."
"If we are to reduce this dependence, we will need to invest more in investigating the use of renewable energy sources."
"We should also be looking at the possibility of bringing in more oil in through pipelines."
"This does not, however, detract from the need to improve the general conditions for transporting oil by sea."
"Firstly, this means tightening up the present system of port state control."
"More stringent and more frequent inspections should result in unseaworthy ships or ships that are not in good enough condition to carry certain goods being placed under arrest at an earlier stage."
"Secondly, the Council deserves support for its plans to speed up the phasing-out of single-hull tankers."
"It is, however, in everyone's interest that we establish double-hull transportation capacity so as to avoid a shortage of supply."
"Thirdly, Member States must offer tangible help to ships and areas that are in distress."
"By no means all Member States appreciate the need to designate ports of refuge and create rescue, assistance and cleaning facilities in them."
"Furthermore, we must also press ahead with the setting up of the COPE fund, which will reimburse affected areas for the damage they have suffered."
"Incidentally, our attention should not be directed solely at the cargo but also at the bunker oil used as fuel for the ships themselves."
"This can also cause significant damage to the environment and has thus far not formed part of the remit of the IMO."
"Sadly, we have already experienced several major oil disasters."
"It is time we took a fundamental look at our position and our approach to these."
"I hope that everyone concerned realises this."
"Mr President, the European Union Member States agreed last summer that ships in distress should immediately be accommodated in a place of refuge."
"The Spanish Government, on the contrary, decided to tow the Prestige into open sea, regardless of the consequences."
"This week in the Spanish Parliament we witnessed the Spanish Government's arrogance."
"For more than a month it has produced a day-to-day falsification of facts, failing to adjust itself to circumstances."
"Mr Aznar, as the main political authority responsible, has been totally unable to achieve a sense of reality."
"On the other hand, even if the Galicians have made little progress in their cruel work, they do not lose heart."
"Galicians are admirable."
"The disaster of the Prestige has become the disaster of José María Aznar and the 'prestige' of the Galician people."
"Mr President, surely the first thing we have to bear in mind when discussing safety at sea and the introduction of any new legislation is the application of existing legislation."
"The problem - and it is a huge problem - is that this legislation is not being applied, especially when it comes to port controls."
"Secondly, we must not forget that shipping goes beyond national and European borders."
"So action is needed at international level."
"And that means giving the European Commission the necessary credentials, so that it can reach agreements right from the start with candidate countries and with our neighbours so that we can coordinate our action."
"And of course it needs proper credentials from the Council so that it has the necessary authority to negotiate correctly with the International Maritime Organisation, which really does drags its heels."
"Thirdly, we must not forget that there are numerous sides to this problem."
"There is a lot of talk, and rightly so, about old, single-hull tankers."
"But may I remind you that a fairly new double-hulled ship, the Ievoli Sun, which was about 10 years old, sank off the coast of France recently, about two years ago in fact, which just goes to show that double hulls are not necessarily the only answer."
"However, nor is focusing on flags of convenience the only answer, because problems are frequently caused by ships not sailing under flags of convenience."
"So what exactly am I getting at?"
"Obviously we need to address the question of single hulls, obviously we need to examine the question of flags of convenience, no doubt about it; but we must not overlook all the other questions which we often underestimate."
"Port controls are vitally important."
"The question of ports of refuge, maintenance of ships, all these questions need to be examined overall, globally, if we want results."
"So we need a package of measures to deal with the problem."
"As for the committee of inquiry, may I call on my honourable friends not to turn Parliament into a referee in order to resolve internal Spanish differences."
"Mr President, I said a month ago that this was a European disaster and requested a European response."
"The Galician citizens - my fellow citizens - who are caught up in a titanic fight against the oil that has arrived on their doorsteps, have been the casual victims and have paid the price for all European citizens."
"Since day one, therefore I have insisted both here and there on the need to provide a clear and simple European response, as we did for the floods in Germany, which takes account of two aspects: prevention and mitigation."
"Should we toughen and change transport legislation?"
"Yes."
"Should we reprimand ministers?"
"Yes."
"But we need to do more."
"We need to explain to the people who are currently collecting oil by hand why there are no resources and assure them that, if this were to happen again, these resources would be available."
"We need to tell them, at the very least, that we are sorry for the lack of resources and coordination that there have been in addressing this disaster from the very beginning."
"They are the ones who are enduring this, and their cries for help have reached this Parliament, and we cannot deny this fact."
"The Galician, and therefore, European citizens need to feel supported in the long and difficult journey into which the negligence of their own ministers has thrown them."
"We therefore cannot understand why anyone in this Parliament would be opposed to knowing what has happened, where mistakes have been made and what we must do to ensure that this never happens again."
"This is not a disaster of European dimensions: it is a European disaster and we do not want it to be repeated anywhere."
"If it does happen again, however, we clearly cannot act as we have done here."
"The pathetic images that have been shown around the world - which have shown what I saw - make it unnecessary, Mr Galeote, for me to give any further explanation."
"We Galicians are strong."
"We always have been, we have always been able to fight against adversity and we shall not let ourselves be beaten by this disaster."
"What my people in Galicia cannot understand is why, if all of Europe recognises the lesson that we as a people are giving, the PPE-DE Group in this Parliament continues to deny us the opportunity to clarify what has happened, assess the damage and propose emergency and crisis management programmes at European level that could serve all Europeans."
"We are not the ones who can answer this question, we compatriots, as Mr Galeote says."
"Compatriots are not the same thing as accomplices, and we do not want to be accomplices."
"Do not insult us by asking us for complicity in the decisions of a government that for a whole month tried to minimise this disaster and has been incapable of mobilising the Community institutions."
"On the other hand, Mrs de Palacio, you should ask the Spanish Government a question."
"Nobody has been able to use and set in motion the abundant means available to Europe."
"Why not?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, like many of my fellow Members and like many European citizens, I welcome the proposals - which I support - made by the Commission in the wake of the Prestige disaster and presented again here vigorously by Mrs de Palacio."
"As we all know, however, they may not be enough."
"If we want to avoid finding ourselves discussing the effects of another disaster in the near future, certain measures need to be taken without delay, with less lukewarm cooperation from the Council: port controls must be stepped up, crews must be given training, assistance must be provided to vessels in difficulty, and, above all, 'old tubs' must be banned and single-hulled vessels rapidly replaced."
"I stress the need to speed up as fast as technologically possible the introduction of the obligation for oil tankers and other vessels with dangerous cargoes to be double-hulled."
"If we are actually to make a difference in this area, we need practical measures."
"I therefore propose that access to certain ports located in sensitive areas should be restricted without delay to double-hulled vessels."
"These areas should be progressively defined and delimited at European level, with the introduction of similar measures to those currently in force, for instance, in Venice harbour."
"Moreover, the capacity for demolition of old vessels, which is currently inadequate in northern Europe, in particular, must be enhanced with the provision of incentives."
"The problems ensuing from this drastic measure will only be temporary and will, in any case, be incomparably less than those which would arise should similar disasters take place in sensitive areas, and I am thinking with horror of certain parts of the Mediterranean."
"Are the Commission and the Council prepared to subordinate the economic considerations which thus far have been given priority to the demands of environmental protection?"
"The Commission's response would appear to bode well. I call upon the Council to be equally courageous."
"Mr President, the disaster caused by the Prestige oil tanker took place more than a month ago and we still do not know how long we will continue to see waves of oil slicks, which alone is an indictment of the leaders of Spain and the EU for having adopted such belated and ineffectual measures in an attempt to play down the effects of the real tragedy that has befallen the communities and the sea of Galicia, but which has also spread to the maritime territories to the North and to the South, affecting Portugal and France."
"Although the tragedy has shown that underlying the ecological disaster are the profits that some shipowners and oil companies seek to make by any means possible, even at the cost of maritime safety and working conditions, specifically by flying flags of convenience, the fact is that governments have allowed them to undertake these activities through increasingly neoliberal practices, including the delay in applying the directives decided on following the Erika disaster."
"We must therefore determine the reasons for the current crisis, such as the persistence of the causes, the indecision we have seen and the delay in transposing laws. We must also go further, however, as my group has proposed in the proposal to which I have added my name: banning flags of convenience and the transport of oil products and other dangerous materials in single-hull tankers, establishing shipping lanes that are further from the coast and stepping up inspections are crucial measures for preventing further tragedies."
"Mr President, the pictures of the fishermen and the volunteers fighting the oil slick from the Prestige with their small boats and their bare hands demonstrate the enormous strength of an entire people - the Galicians - and prove the culpability of the European Council and the Spanish State."
"It is now clear that Galicia's citizens are suffering the consequences of the serious political conflict which opposes the positive proposals put forward by the Commission and which has led to the selfishness and irresponsibility demonstrated by the Member States of the Council."
"The Copenhagen decisions have not answered the anguished questions of the citizens but instead the interests of the predatory capitalism of the oil companies which, taking advantage of the murky and primitive international situation, reject all and any attempt to establish European legislation to protect our seas."
"The Council, as well as Mr Aznar, has shown contempt for the people of Galicia by having taken no rapid decision to help that region."
"It has shown contempt for the fact that Galicia suffers more disasters than any other part of the world."
"The Council has granted Galicia and the neighbouring territories a miserable EUR five million more, whereas the United States, which has strict and specific legislation, clearly lacking in Europe, is claiming USD four billion for the Exxon Valdez accident."
"Ladies and gentlemen, our citizens are demanding that we put an end to this situation, starting with setting up a committee of inquiry."
"This must never happen again."
"Never again!"
"Mr President, my heart goes out to the Galicians, and to the people who are clearing up the oil, which is now more than a metre thick."
"Unfortunately, however, we do not have an emergency response team, and we do not have a professional approach. I find this particularly regrettable."
"We must, however, stop simply passing the buck."
"Naturally it is important to have this discussion, but not now, and not here."
"It is much more important to pay attention to making sure that Europe's coastline is protected."
"My colleague Mr Dirk Sterckx's specific suggestions about ports of refuge are particularly appropriate."
"I would like to call upon the Commission and Council to avoid hot-air politics when it comes to the safety of shipping."
"I support the Commission in respect of the agency and the exercising of controls, as Mrs de Palacio has just mentioned."
"A ban on single-hull tankers carrying crude oil is soap-box politics and avoids the actual structural problems of international shipping."
"A well-maintained single-hull tanker is safer than a badly maintained double-hull tanker."
"I am not a fan of the IMO, but it is absolutely necessary for coming to agreements and for honouring and implementing agreements that are already in place."
"It looks as if we are creating a more realistic policy than the one you are proposing."
"In my opinion it is important to negotiate with Russia on the control of ships that are loaded there and travel along the European coast to Africa."
"I think that it is very important to check classification agencies so that we know the responsibilities of the skippers, captains and shipowners and in particular in order to plan clear shipping routes."
"I hope that this will result in a better policy."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, we must indeed do something, and we can go even further than what has already been agreed."
"I am therefore pleased that the two biggest groups here in Parliament support our proposals for a European coastguard and a European civil 'rapid reaction force'."
"Firstly for prevention. We need a European coastguard to watch over European interests and to prevent ships in distress from being passed from pillar to post by Member States who put their own interests first and in doing so make the wrong decisions."
"The coastguard must be the strong arm of the agency for maritime safety."
"Secondly, the European civil protection intervention corps must be able to turn out immediately in an emergency and arrive with its own equipment."
"These 'Green Helmets' will then be able to step in anywhere in the European Union, as not all Member States have the equipment and expertise needed to tackle disasters."
"I witnessed what was happening in Galicia a week after the disaster, and I saw what a difficult job our Belgian civil protection intervention corps had to do and how long an action of this kind takes to get under way."
"I have been told that big construction companies are now having to be called in."
"This is of course unacceptable."
"Finally I would like to ask the Council to urgently direct its attention to the liability directive, as this lies at the heart of the problem of maritime transport, both in Europe and worldwide."
"Commissioner, perhaps you could pass this message on to the next presidency: 'Nunca mais' [never again]."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the face of the vast ecological, economic and social disaster that Galicia is currently suffering, which has become a genuine European problem, I believe we must be clear in this debate we are holding."
"Prevention first, cure second, it was said here."
"The former, prevention, means we must not be distracted from the real culprits in this tragedy."
"We are dealing with a floating dump, with dangerous goods, with an opaque network of the interests of soulless businessmen that we should untangle and condemn."
"Must we investigate all these aspects?"
"Yes."
"Should we prevent them?"
"Again yes."
"I hope and believe that this time the European Union has learnt its lesson."
"The European Commission has learnt its lesson."
"The European Commission is clear about the matter, and I believe that now the European Parliament and the Council must be intransigent in the face of the laxness and casual attitude of this maritime traffic."
"Secondly, cure."
"We must focus on repairing the damage that has been caused."
"Galicia cannot pay the physical price, in addition to the damage it is suffering."
"The real victim is the entire people of Galicia."
"Our responsibility now is to work together to achieve the maximum structural funds and the application of the Solidarity Fund; we are going to achieve it."
"An inquiry?"
"Of course."
"I would like to say here - it has already been said, but I would like to repeat it - that the Galician Parliament has set up, today and with the agreement of all the political parties, a committee of inquiry."
"It is applying the principle of subsidiarity so that the closest politicians investigate the matter and therefore we, together with the Liberal Group and the UEN Group, have tabled an amendment for a comprehensive technical inquiry to be undertaken into this complex aspect."
"We are going to ask for more European means to achieve better coordination and civil protection; however, Mr President, seeking to use the tragedy for electoral gain, as some politicians are doing, is simply repulsive."
"I believe this division is damaging to the politicians themselves as well to the victims, who are confused and stunned both from the effects of the disaster and from seeing politicians attacking each other with their partisan egotism."
"I shall end, Mr President, by thanking, as a Galician European, all of Parliament and the institutions present here today, for the solidarity they are showing us and which I know they will continue to show us over the coming days."
"Mr President, Madam Vice-President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Haarder, I am glad that you are here and that we are engaged in discussion, but I must go straight to the heart of all these debates."
"I was delighted to read the resolutions from the Transport Ministers' Council of 5 and 6 December on increased safety at sea, but - alas - I have no faith in them."
"Let me give you two examples. Up until now, the Council has always done its utmost to defend the use of single-hulled tankers up to 2015, and suddenly the Transport Ministers in Council announce an immediate end to the use of single-hulled tankers for the transport of heavy oil."
"In addition, there is this wonderful question, Mr President-in-Office: by virtue of which law is this to come about?"
"We cannot make it Community law within the next couple of weeks."
"Can you quote me any national regulations that will put the Member States in any sort of position to implement the ban on single-hulled tankers?"
"My second point, Mr President-in-Office, is that Mr Piecyk and others have already referred to the fact that a number of Member States are failing to meet the obligation imposed on them by the port state directive of controlling 25% of the vessels calling at EU ports."
"Now, acting through the Council of Transport Ministers, the Council has decided to increase its efforts to step up monitoring of controls, if at all possible by 1 January."
"Can you, in your capacity as President-in-Office, confirm how many posts have been newly created for inspectors, and in which countries, in the course of the last week or the last ten days, and how many qualified applicants there are for these positions as inspectors?"
"You see, Mr President-in-Office, passing fine resolutions is no use at all."
"What we want you to tell us is how they are to be implemented."
"I would like to refer back to Mr Sterckx, who wrote the report on ports of refuge."
"He is perfectly right, and here too, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the same questions arise."
"You have now said that the Member States should set up ports of refuge and register them more quickly, but I would like you to tell us how you propose to ensure that, once the individual states have designated the ports of refuge, they are actually set up."
"Let us remember that the Erika wanted to call at a port and was not allowed to, and the question is similar when it comes to the Prestige: if she had called at a port, might she not have avoided breaking up, might it not have been possible to pump out the crude oil more easily and to avoid a disaster of such a magnitude?"
"Mr President-in-Office, how do you intend to make sure that the Member States do actually set up these ports of refuge so as to avoid greater calamities?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the shipwreck of the Prestige has demonstrated the powerlessness of the European authorities and the various Member States when faced with a disastrous situation like this one which, although the coasts it has ravaged belong to Galicia, is nevertheless a European disaster and is felt to be so by all European citizens."
"It is precisely the European public, shocked at this appalling event, and the upset and fury of all those affected - particularly the wonderful Galician coastline and its communities - that are demanding that such a situation must not be allowed to happen again on our common coastline."
"It is the citizens that are hoping that Galicia will be given appropriate assistance by the EU."
"A committee of inquiry is required, in order to shed light on all the circumstances of the disaster and to determine responsibility so that we can learn lessons for the future."
"Europe's citizens are demanding that legislation be made tougher, and that it enter into force and be implemented earlier than planned, without further ado."
"Protecting Europe's maritime industry must increasingly be a common concern and therefore a common policy."
"Protecting the marine environment and the European coast are now major challenges for us all."
"If the tragedy of the Prestige serves to raise political consciousness and to stimulate action, the despair and the fury of the Galician people - and ours too - will not have been in vain."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I wish to begin by reiterating my solidarity with the Galician people and with all the communities who might be affected by this tragedy, in Spain, in France and, of course, in my own country."
"As time passes, the true scale of this disaster is becoming ever clearer."
"I hope that the investigation requested by Parliament will be undertaken in a thorough and timely manner."
"And, as I have already said in this Chamber, we must also clear up the mysterious change of direction taken by the ship which, after moving westwards, turned suddenly towards the South, until it sank, thirty miles outside Portuguese waters."
"What we need to do now, however, is to talk more about the future and this is why I would like to address four issues."
"Firstly, the European Union must provide funds to compensate, as much as possible, for the damage caused by the oil slick."
"In this context, I believe we would be justified in mobilising the EU Solidarity Fund, which has not yet been done."
"The second aspect is that since this has clearly had a terrible effect on fishing and shellfish farming, we must consider a more integrated and far-reaching package of measures that will provide practical responses for the communities that have been affected."
"The third aspect is that a technically and scientifically justified decision must be taken on what to do with the ship, which is now lying on the ocean floor with its 60 000 tonnes of oil."
"Unless this is resolved, we will be condemned not only to an oil slick but to a succession of oil slicks for months and years to come."
"Lastly, I wish to emphasise that it is now time to properly establish the European Maritime Safety Agency, which means that the Council must agree on where it should be based."
"To conclude, I wish to say that we want there to be a rigorous inquiry, as Parliament has already called for."
"What we do not want is for Parliament to be used to debate a country's domestic problems."
"Mr President, we could classify the speeches made in the course of this debate into two categories: firstly, those which view the problem from a European perspective and which propose actions to be implemented through European and Community policy and, secondly, those which, at this time of human tragedy, tragedy for a country, which is five months from an election, believe that this is an opportunity to gain electoral advantage without considering what the real consequences for these people are."
"There has been talk of a temporary committee of inquiry, in accordance with Rule 150 of the European Parliament's Rules of Procedure, which must be justified on the grounds of non-compliance with European legislation."
"What grounds have we heard here?"
"To know what has happened; clearly we all want to know what has happened, but we are not going to achieve this through a parliamentary committee."
"We will be told this in the reports of the experts and that is why the PPE-DE Group's proposal is that it should be the Commission that informs the Council and Parliament by means of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism."
"Assessing the damage; criticisms are being made, although the time limit for assessing damage ends on 23 January, but today, at the beginning of December, the Spanish State is being criticised for not having assessed the damage."
"Measures to be adopted;"
"Spain has adopted measures."
"Coordinating 10 000 volunteers, coordinating the work of the institutions, coordinating international aid; what is coordinating all of this are the measures that have been adopted."
"Mobilise the European institutions; yesterday we had a meeting with Commissioner Barnier, during which he acknowledged the talks and contacts he had had with the Spanish Government."
"The fishermen are being paid, aid is arriving."
"Therefore, what are the justified grounds?"
"They do not exist."
"Simply a will to criticise for political reasons in view of the elections, and this is neither the forum nor the place, and you will not find us participating."
"You will find us helping the Galicians, you will find us helping the Spanish and saving these coasts. That is what we are working on."
"."
"(DA) Mr President, may I on behalf of the Council state that I agree with most of what has been said, and with the anger, vexation and deep concern that has been expressed, and the demands for action that have been heard in this House."
"It is not fair to say that the Council has done nothing, and therefore I would like to start by quoting from the Copenhagen conclusions, which state that 'the conclusions of the meeting of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism of 6 December 2002 and of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy of 9 December 2002 should be implemented straight away in every respect'."
"It then continues by expressing satisfaction with the Commission's work in respect of the economic, social and environmental consequences of the loss of the Prestige."
"It also expresses satisfaction with the Commission's intention to investigate the need for further specific measures, including in respect of liability and associated sanctions."
"There was thus complete support in Copenhagen for Mrs de Palacio and for the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"What, then, was decided in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism on 5-6 December?"
"It was a series of paragraphs which approximately correspond to Parliament's viewpoints, which are indeed vigorous on a great many points and which already meet nearly all the requirements put forward here in this House."
"Naturally, there is a certain justification in saying that if steps had been taken a long time ago the catastrophe might possibly have been avoided - yes, we must acknowledge that fact."
"But now something is being done, and what is being done is exactly what the honourable speakers have asked for, and the rapid action taken by the Commissioner has been applauded."
"There are two types of liability. The first is to be met by the funds for covering expenditure on cleaning up beaches and providing compensation for fishermen - and there is nothing to suggest that these funds are insufficient to cover the expenses concerned."
"There is also, however, the liability for environmental damage, of course. The possibility of requiring greater liability to be accepted is open to discussion; and it is agreed that, if at all possible, there must be a requirement to accept such liability."
"Mr Sterckx and others are right in saying that it is not the number of inspections which is crucial, but that inspection is carried out at the right points."
"It is a requirement that 25% are to be inspected; it is also correct that some countries are not meeting this requirement - and naturally that is wrong."
"The crucial thing, however, is that the right places be inspected and that they be inspected in the right way."
"Mrs Ramos was concerned by certain attacks on the Spanish Government."
"Having been present at the debate in Copenhagen, I would like to bear witness to the fact that the Spanish Government put these problems right at the top of the agenda."
"With regard to the issue of coastguards and agencies, I would refer to sections 7 and 9 of the Transport Ministers' resolution of 5-6 December."
"With regard to the imposition of liability, I would refer to section 18. It must be conceded, however, that section 18 of the resolution is not particularly strong, and I believe there is a common hope that the Commission can come up with a stronger solution than that which is being prepared, and I believe that such a solution will have the Council's blessing."
"With regard to ports of refuge, which I did not manage to mention, I refer to section 8 - where the issue of ports of refuge is expressly mentioned, and that is my reply to Mr Jarzembowski."
"My final advice to Parliament is as follows: hold the Council to the right declarations that have been made."
"That applies to the European Council, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"Hold the Council to the right things that have been decided."
"After all, Parliament and the Council are in agreement concerning what is to be done; the task now is to put it into practice, as many speakers have also said."
"I wish Parliament luck with this and with providing inspiration to forthcoming presidencies in the years ahead."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would begin by saying to Mr Piecyk that on this issue the Commission can hold its head high, because if what we proposed had been done we would not have had the Prestige, because it would have been out of use for several months before it sunk."
"Having said this, however, I would also like to say to the honourable Members and to everybody, let there be no mistake, that out there in waters off our coasts and other coasts of the world, there are currently more than 400 Erikas or Prestiges."
"There are such vessels with more than 20 000 tonnes of oil or more than 30 000 tonnes of oil-based products."
"There are 258 of a lesser tonnage, with 10 000, 20 000 and 30 000 tonnes approximately, which are also quantities which can cause enormous pollution. And what we have to do is respond so that, as soon as possible, these vessels are no longer off our coasts or, if possible, anywhere in the world."
"This is what we have to do and we must do it now."
"That is what we are talking about. And this is the first issue we have to confront here."
"Secondly, the Erika I and Erika II packages must be implemented straight away."
"And what does this mean?"
"Implementing them in terms of the controls of the port authorities, and several Members have mentioned this, and it is true that there are two countries which do not even comply with the current legislation which is much more lax and less complicated to implement."
"It is urgent that they do so and they have committed themselves politically to it."
"The Agency, which will soon be operational - its board of management has already met, because we have brought forward its implementation and although it does not yet have its final headquarters it is beginning to function already - will have to ensure that in all ports of the Union - and it must be in all of them, since there cannot be ports of convenience in the European Union - appropriate controls are carried out in the appropriate way."
"In the meantime, however, the Council must approve, by March, the regulations that the Commission will present by the end of the year on the accelerated withdrawal of single-hull vessels from European ports and the European prohibition of the use of single-hull vessels for the transport of heavy oil and bituminous products, tar and more polluting products."
"We must make progress in the field of responsibilities and I hope that, in agreement with Commissioner Vitorino, we can quickly present this Parliament and the Council with a proposal for a criminal definition of serious negligence."
"And we must continue to make progress because, let us not beat about the bush, who is responsible here, who is responsible for the Erika?"
"Firstly, we know very well, the shipowners, who have ships in bad condition."
"And those who charter ships at a low cost because it is cheaper and optimises certain profits and who do not care that there are risks, which are then suffered by coastal populations and society as a whole."
"This is what we have to prevent once and for all. And this means making progress in the field of responsibility and preventing this whole chain of companies involved from evading responsibility."
"But this means action on an international level as well as on a European Union level."
"(Applause)"
"And this means, ladies and gentlemen, that the Commission must be a full member of the International Maritime Organisation in order to be able to promote its work."
"The fifteen States are already members and have acted in a coordinated fashion, but more is needed, the Commission must also be able to participate in this forum, in which it will be able to promote issues such as the responsibility of States with flags of convenience, that is, the system of obligatory audits which is being proposed within the context of the International Maritime Organisation."
"And we must make progress on the issue of flags of convenience."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we must distinguish between two types of flag of convenience: fiscal and financial convenience and the convenience of those States which give their flags to wrecks, to ecological time-bombs, to ships which under no circumstances deserve to sail the seas."
"We must combat both types and I am also prepared to combat those which simply become tax havens."
"Also within the context of the IMO, the FIFG Funds, achieving the EUR 1 000 million we have proposed and if not, to promote the complementary European fund which is on the table in the Council of Ministers and which, of course, if in May there is no resolution within the IMO, will have to be approved quickly so that we may at least have that complementary fund."
"Ladies and gentlemen, somebody spoke of the human factor: crews."
"Before the summer you will have proposals under the Greek Presidency which place great emphasis on promoting training and which furthermore - let us make this clear since there are many different opinions on this - clearly opts for a quality maritime sector."
"I would also like to say that we must continue to make progress on international maritime law."
"We all know that it takes years, but we must do what is necessary so that it takes as little time as possible, and meanwhile we must talk to our neighbours."
"We must talk to Russia, we have the Baltic, which is an enclosed sea, where any accident, just as with the Mediterranean, would be much more tragic and would have much more dramatic consequences from an environmental point of view than in an open sea such as the Atlantic Ocean, which has greater capacity for regeneration."
"Therefore we have to speak not only to Russia, but to all the countries of the Mediterranean and the Black Sea, that is, the Mediterranean in the broadest sense."
"Because we must manage to strengthen, guarantee and safeguard all our coasts and those of our neighbours and make progress in the international field."
"The honourable Members say that there has been no progress at the Copenhagen European Council."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say that I have the conclusions of the Council of Nice and, in fact, they ask for the Erika I and Erika II packages to be implemented as soon as possible, even before the dates for their entry into force, and this has not been done."
"Copenhagen has said the same thing, and I hope that this time it will be done."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is too horrendous that after the Erika we are now talking about the Prestige."
"I am sure that this time the States of the Union will really honour what they have said."
"And if not, we will say it and remind them of it here; and if not, I hope that all the honourable Members with connections and with national parties will raise the issue by means of your colleagues in national Parliaments as well."
"Of course, the Commission, by means of the Agency and the reports we will present here, will specifically monitor true compliance by the Member States with the issues agreed."
"Amongst other things, the entry into force of the Erika I and Erika II packages, without waiting for 30 June 2003 or February 2004."
"I would like to point out, ladies and gentlemen, that this includes, for example, ports of refuge, which have until February 2004."
"I do not believe we can wait until February 2004. We have to get to work now and in January we are going to begin talking to the Member States in order to confront this."
"Let us make it very clear that a port of refuge is not just any port."
"A port of refuge must be a port with special facilities, easily accessible, so that a vessel with manoeuvring difficulties can access it during difficult storms."
"Because that is when accidents take place."
"They take place when the sea is rough, with winds of more than 100 kilometres per hour, in situations where ships have problems with manoeuvrability, with waves of 8 or 10 metres as in the case of the Prestige or the Erika."
"This means equipping these ports in a special way, providing them with access which is particularly easy and suitable."
"Providing them with material and human resources and action plans which allow them to deal with emergency situations."
"And that is what we have to deal with."
"Ladies and gentlemen, do not confuse a port of refuge with just any port, they are different things and this is a very complex issue."
"I would like to continue with the issue of funds, which the honourable Members have mentioned."
"Ladies and gentlemen, in the case of the Prestige I believe that European solidarity is clear."
"In the case of the Erika, do you know how much support and contribution to funds Europe has provided?"
"Well I will tell you: a reprogramming of EUR 10 million, of the Objective 2 funds, which Brittany benefited from."
"In the case of the Prestige, it is true that the disaster is even greater."
"But we are talking about a reprogramming of fisheries funds - FIFG Funds - of a supplement of other funds relating to fisheries which would be added to those FIFG Funds, we are talking about access to the Solidarity Fund to combat disasters which, it is true, is 2.5% of the amount for disasters, no more, but it is a European solidarity effort in any case."
"We are also talking about reprogramming the Cohesion Funds or Structural Funds allocated to Spain or to Galicia."
"European solidarity is shown through funds and the Commission has been able to use them, as have the authorities, for example, of the Council, which has said yes clearly, and which has raised the possibility of adopting additional specific measures because, ladies and gentlemen, there are unfortunately still 50 000 tonnes of fuel oil on the sea bed."
"50 000 tonnes of fuel oil in two wrecks which, unfortunately, are still leaking oil."
"The Commission is also participating in the Scientific Committee organised by the Spanish Government, which also includes French representatives and, if I am not mistaken, Portuguese representatives, and I hope that that scientific committee will tell us soon exactly how that fuel oil on the sea bed is developing."
"Because naturally what we cannot tolerate is that these two submerged sections of hull should continue giving out and expanding the oil slick."
"We must provide a solution."
"We will have to see what solutions are possible and we will also have to see how Europe can show solidarity, and I sure there will be no lack of it."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, coastguards have been mentioned."
"I believe we must make progress on this, but I would also like to say that while we are able to create coastguards and other European bodies, which I am sure we will create in the future, what we need, at least, is to improve the coordination of all the maritime services in the States of the Union."
"I hope that, following this tragedy, all of this will be strengthened and that we will be able to make further progress and prevent any more tragedies such as the Erika or the Prestige."
"(Applause)"
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"To conclude these Council and Commission statements, I have received 7 motions for resolutions presented in accordance with Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"Mr President, I feel that Mr Galeote has made personal comments about me, in my capacity as President of the Spanish Socialists in this House."
"I would ask him to withdraw his falsities and slurs."
"I really do not understand Mr Galeote."
"I do not understand why Mr Galeote is determined to turn a European debate into a Spanish debate."
"I do not understand why he provokes us, I do not understand this narrow nationalist attitude, trying to bring about a debate amongst Spaniards, when what we should do is resolve - as the Commissioner has said - a problem which is European and which should be resolved from a European perspective."
"However, Mr Galeote, from one Spaniard to another, I will define what I think of your attitude by means of two traditional sayings."
"The first is that 'offence is not caused by those who want to but by those who can', and the second, which is also very traditional and descriptive, because we all have memories and we all have history, Mr Galeote, is that 'the thief believes that everybody is like him'."
"History has recorded what your attitudes have been and what our attitudes have been and still are, the attitudes of the Spanish Socialists here in this Parliament and those of the Spanish Socialists down there, in the Spanish Parliament."
"Mrs Díez, you felt that personal comments were made about you and the Presidency has given you the floor."
"Perhaps the second of your sayings, although the Presidency understands what you mean by it, contains a word which perhaps, for the sake of parliamentary courtesy, you should also withdraw, Mrs Díez."
"Mr President, a saying is a saying."
"In no way have I tried to call Mr Galeote a thief."
"It is a saying which means: everybody believes that others are like them."
"He has accused us of dishonest conduct, which has never been the case, and he knows that there has been dishonest conduct in his ranks."
"The Presidency is grateful for this clarification, Mrs Díez, which restores our sense of parliamentary courtesy."
"Mr President, Mrs Díez, of course I would withdraw any type of insult or slur in my speech, if I could, and I would challenge you to read the verbatim report for this sitting and tell me whether it contains any insult or slur, because I will withdraw them without question."
"What I want to say, Mr President and Mrs Díez, is that committees of inquiry are laid down in Rule 151 of our Rules of Procedure - I would ask you to read them, please."
"And this request to create a committee of this type is justified by non-compliance with Community law, and it has been said here, explicitly and literally, by some of your colleagues and compatriots, that the intention through this committee is to establish the responsibilities of the Spanish Government in relation to the Prestige disaster."
"This has been said here, literally."
"What I am saying is that you cannot say in Spain that we are going together to ask for more funds and then say here that the funds should not be given because the Spanish Government is at fault."
"That is what I meant."
"."
"(DA) Mr President, thank you for this opportunity to give an account of this very important area of work in which my dear colleague Commissioner Vitorino has been extremely active ever since he started, and in which I believe we are starting to reap rewards of which I am pleased to give an account."
"With the Treaty of Amsterdam, it was decided that various measures on asylum and immigration should be taken within five years of the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, that is, 1 May 2004."
"As we know, the European Council repeated and reinforced its desire for action in these areas in Tampere in October 1999, in Laeken in December 2001 and in Seville in June of this year."
"In Seville, specific priorities were devised along with deadlines for adoption of the individual legal acts."
"We have not simply met these deadlines; we have gone even further."
"As was stated in the Seville conclusions, the Council must find the right balance between, on the one hand, an integration policy for immigrants who have settled lawfully in the Member States of the Union and an asylum policy that complies with the international conventions - first and foremost the Geneva Convention of 1951 - and with the efforts required, in particular the efforts to combat illegal immigration and human trafficking."
"The implementation of the Seville conclusions has been a task of the Danish Presidency."
"This applies also to the issue of combating illegal immigration and administering the external borders."
"Seventeen different projects and initiatives have been implemented with a view to strengthening border controls at both sea and land borders and at airports."
"In addition, a general dispatch programme and a specific plan for the return to Afghanistan have been adopted."
"These two were approved a couple of weeks ago."
"With regard to asylum policy, substantial progress has been made in respect of implementation of the Treaty of Amsterdam objectives and the priorities set in Seville."
"The European Fund for Refugees was established back in September 2000, and in July 2001 a directive was adopted on minimum standards of temporary protection in cases of mass influx of displaced persons."
"Further progress has been made on the area of asylum under the Danish Presidency."
"There is now agreement in the Council on the Dublin II regulation, which is expected finally to be adopted."
"This was the particular task to be achieved under the Danish Presidency."
"This task has been achieved; there is political unanimity."
"There is possibly one more parliamentary reservation, but I am sure that we will be able to adopt the Dublin II regulation - possibly as soon as tomorrow, when there is a Council meeting in Brussels."
"The Commission's proposal for minimum standards for the reception of asylum seekers is similarly expected to be adopted at the Council meeting tomorrow."
"Over the past six months intensive negotiations have taken place concerning the Commission's proposal to set minimum standards for the recognition of third-country nationals and stateless persons as refugees or persons in need of subsidiary protection."
"Substantial progress has been made, and there is now political unanimity on the definition of a refugee and political unanimity on the definition of subsidiary protection."
"This unanimity is based on the Geneva Convention and the European Convention on Human Rights."
"We have achieved political unanimity on virtually all of Articles 1-19 concerning the basic terms used in refugee law."
"All that remains is the issue of the rights of refugees and of persons with subsidiary protection, which is why we can expect the proposal to be adopted by the summer at the latest, as was decided in Seville."
"The things on which agreement has been reached are some of the difficult things."
"Some might say: that is all very well, but where is the skill in adopting something based on conventions that have already been in force for a long time?"
"The answer is: it is skilful because it means that from now on these conventions must be observed in every country, and that includes the new Member States that we decided just last Friday to bring into the Union."
"Moreover, there is a big difference between having conventions and having directives."
"The difference is that the Commission has much greater authority when it comes to considering whether the directives are being complied with, and finally there is also the possibility of going to Court if countries breach the conventions."
"The answer to the question that I myself asked is therefore: it makes an incredible difference that the standards of these conventions are now being introduced in the form of directives."
"At the Council meeting in October we had an open debate on the Commission's revised proposal on minimum standards for asylum procedures at which the ministers of the Member States contributed various comments on the proposal. This proposal, too, will be adopted by the end of 2003."
"As far as immigration policy is concerned, the Seville conclusions state that the Council must approve the Commission's proposal for provisions on family reunification and long-term residence status by June 2003."
"Substantial progress has been made in the negotiations on the revised proposal for a directive on family reunification - the proposal that was submitted by the Commission in May this year - and it is expected that it will also be possible to adopt this by the deadline set in Seville, that is, by June 2003."
"As regards the proposal on long-term residence status, on 15 October 2002 the Council discussed a number of outstanding political issues."
"A certain amount of progress has been made in this area under the Danish Presidency, but a number of crucial issues remain - including the right to a certain form of free movement."
"The Council will work towards meeting the deadline laid down in Seville for adoption of the proposal."
"At the same time, an open debate was held in the Committee on Justice and Home Affairs on 15 October 2002 on the Commission's proposal for a directive on the conditions for entry and residence by third-country nationals for study purposes."
"Parliament has been consulted in all these cases, and Parliament's statements have been incorporated, or will be incorporated, into the basis for the Council's decision."
"The Council considers it very important that Parliament be involved in this area, to which the codecision procedure does not yet apply."
"The Council looks forward to even closer cooperation with Parliament in the area of asylum following the entry into force of the Treaty of Nice."
"I hope that I have, in this way, given you a comprehensive status report as regards the results achieved within the area of asylum and immigration policy."
"I believe that, overall, it conveys a positive picture."
"I agree that matters have proceeded too slowly."
"I know that the Commissioner felt this too, as indeed I myself did, when I sat on the relevant committee here in Parliament."
"Though I say so myself, I think that the Council has picked up speed, that we have eventually started to see quite a number of results and that we have started to live up to our own aims."
"It is important that the deadlines are met."
"Asylum and immigration policy is of great significance for the people concerned, and it is important that we achieve results and find the balance that I spoke about in the introduction to my speech."
"Mr President, I could have spoken for much longer, since in reality there are a great many initiatives - for example, in the area of border controls, in which a full 17 initiatives have been implemented - which I could have talked about for a long time, but everything must come to an end, so I will stop here and let the Members' contributions decide what we will discuss in more detail in the hour ahead."
"Mr President, although the Commission has presented all the proposals required by the Treaty 18 months ahead of the deadline set by the Treaty of Amsterdam, it is true that only a few of the objectives defined for the establishment of a common asylum and migration policy have effectively been met."
"I hope that the Council will continue to press ahead quickly with the examination and adoption of the several measures under discussion, as the European Council requested at both Laeken and Seville."
"I recognise that under the Danish presidency significant progress was made, not only as far as the Seville conclusions are concerned, but in particular on the development of the common asylum policy."
"This progress was due to the personal engagement and knowledge of Mr Haarder, whom I praise for that."
"In fact, the Dublin II regulation is expected to be formally adopted in the Justice and Home Affairs Council tomorrow."
"Together with the start of operation of the Eurodac system, which is scheduled for 15 January 2003, this will constitute a positive step forward."
"I am fairly optimistic about the discussions in the Council on the directive laying down minimum standards for the reception of asylum seekers in Member States."
"I share the President-in-Office's view that it is possible for the Council to have this directive adopted tomorrow."
"Thanks to the adoption of this legislation, the first phase of the common European asylum system is progressively taking shape."
"Two main elements of the system are still to be adopted."
"However, as the President-in-Office said, good progress was made, thanks to an energetic Danish presidency, on a common definition of 'refugee' and a common approach to subsidiary protection."
"Little remains to be done on this key proposal which could be adopted by the Council at its first meeting in 2003."
"I also expect the Council to speed up the examination of our amended proposal on asylum procedures, which we presented six months ago."
"It is of the utmost importance for the credibility of the Union in these areas, which are at the heart of public opinion's expectations about Europe, that substantive progress is really achieved."
"In such sensitive policy areas, the strategy of small steps will prove to be efficient and win the confidence of our citizens."
"Moreover, the time has come to consider seriously the forward-looking ideas that were recently presented by the High Commissioner, Ruud Lubbers, and which have been blessed by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Executive Committee."
"In early 2003 the Commission intends to put forward a communication where we will express our own views on the main elements of this new agenda for protection presented by Mr Lubbers."
"As you know - and as already mentioned by the President-in-Office - the directives on family reunification and long-term residence status are still under examination."
"I encourage the incoming Greek presidency to finalise these negotiations as soon as possible."
"It is possible to have them adopted during the first half of next year."
"The rules on admission of third-country nationals for the purpose of employment, presented by the Commission in July 2001, have now been complemented by a new proposal, presented in October, on the conditions for entry and residence for study purposes."
"Urgent progress is needed on these two texts, which are key elements for an active EU immigration policy."
"Moreover, with regard to international relations, the Commission has recently put forward, on a joint proposal by myself and my colleagues, Mr Patten and Mr Nielson, a communication presenting our views on the nexus between migration and development."
"In this document we also elaborate on the possibilities, but also the limitations, of the Community budget in this area."
"I would like to take this occasion to confirm that the Commission will put forward a proposal in 2003 with the aim of establishing a multiannual programme of cooperation with third countries in the field of migration, working on the experience that we have gained on the basis of the use of budget line B7-667."
"Our intention is to respond in a specific and complementary way to the needs of third countries in their efforts to ensure better management of all aspects of migratory flows and to stimulate them in their preparation for implementation of the readmission agreements or to assist them in the implementation itself."
"This programme complements other Community cooperation and development instruments."
"The degree of harmonisation attained or currently being negotiated has often failed to meet the Commission's expectations."
"Certainly more could have been done."
"However, the harmonisation being attained is worth our effort."
"Those of us involved in the formulation of this policy should not forget that we have been pioneers in laying the first building blocks of European legislation and policy on such a difficult subject as migration and asylum, and Parliament most of all."
"Nevertheless, this first attempt at building a policy has also taught us a few lessons."
"This policy is still encumbered by too many institutional and legal constraints, as the President-in-Office was commenting in his remarks on conventions."
"Codecision should become the norm and general provisions should allow the Commission to formulate a fully harmonised policy."
"The objective should not be simply the achievement of minimum standards but a fully common asylum system."
"Unanimity in the Council - especially in view of an enlarged Union - appears more and more to be an invitation to stalemate."
"Therefore, I am very pleased with the constructive conclusions reached by the Bruton report within the framework of the Convention."
"They point in the right direction as to the future of European policy on asylum and migration."
"I am sure that those conclusions will receive the full endorsement of the European Parliament."
"Mr President, we have spoken much in recent weeks about the enlargement of the European Union."
"That enlargement extends our borders to Russia, to Ukraine and Belarus - it is hardly surprising if issues of border control and immigration policy are centre stage."
"But when it comes to immigration, no country is an island."
"A real debate is needed at European level, and not the kind of distasteful sloganeering that we suffered at the Seville European Council."
"As a policy issue, immigration is simple."
"Unless we open our markets to goods from poorer countries, thus helping their people to prosper, we will take their people."
"And unless we set our own immigration policy, either anarchy will reign or - more worryingly - criminal gangs of human traffickers will set that policy for us."
"What a pity that our governments did not listen a little more carefully to the advice of the Canadian Government about how, if we wished to get on top of the trafficking in people, we should open our front door a little to legal migration, in order to close our back door more effectively against illegal migration."
"I congratulate Commissioner Vitorino on the proposals that he brought forward a couple of years ago at the beginning of this whole debate."
"I deeply regret that Member States did not adopt them as proposed."
"The debate has been dominated by the repressive aspects of migration policy and has shown scant regard for its humanitarian aspects."
"The strategy has hardly been one of small steps as the Commissioners suggested - one of 'faltering feet' is perhaps a better description."
"I had the honour of chairing the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs in this House for the first two years of that discussion."
"I regret not only the EU's failure to establish effective and complete policies on immigration and asylum, but also its failure to ensure responsible stewardship of our economy which is intimately linked with immigration."
"The Commission's review of the European economy in 2002 shows the devastating economic consequences of stagnating population growth, which could lead to the rate of potential economic growth falling by 1% of GDP per annum for the next 50 years."
"What should we do?"
"Well, exhortations to procreation have never been known to work."
"The evidence suggests that the higher our living standards become, the less people will want to have children."
"So for economic reasons too, we need a mature debate about a policy of managed migration."
"I hope that this afternoon's debate will contribute to achieving some joined-up thinking on immigration policy."
"I have been asked to report on the readmission agreement with Hong Kong."
"I regret that Parliament has been neither consulted nor kept informed during the negotiations on this readmission agreement, that we find ourselves in the position of having to deliver our opinion after the agreement has been initialled - and, moreover, after the Agriculture Council on 23 December adopted the decision authorising its signing."
"According to Rule 97 of our Rules of Procedure, throughout the negotiations - and here I quote: 'The Commission and the Council shall inform the committee responsible regularly and thoroughly of the progress of the negotiations'."
"I deplore the fact that did not happen, all the more so because this is the first readmission agreement negotiated by the Community."
"In the case of future agreements, I ask that Parliament be kept informed about the state of negotiations by the Commission and the Council."
"Readmission is about the return of persons found irregularly on our territory."
"Few in this House would deny the need for a policy of return."
"It is an integral part of any credible immigration policy."
"Effective return safeguards the integrity of asylum policies and of regular immigration programmes and it acts as a deterrent to irregular migration."
"Return has risen to prominence essentially because of the way in which our over-stretched asylum systems are being used as alternatives to a closed-door immigration policy."
"When the Council adopted its return action programme at the end of last month, I am sure it took into account the many advantages of assisted voluntary return, as well as the possibility of forced return."
"The advantage of assisted voluntary return is that it permits return in a non-punitive and a cost-effective way."
"It has been shown to work in Germany, in the United Kingdom, in the Netherlands and in Belgium."
"It is more convenient and it is less costly, both financially and politically, than deportation."
"It has been almost exclusively a European phenomenon and we need more research on the sustainability of return under AVR programmes."
"But our policy needs to be rational, driven not by prejudice, but by a sober assessment of our needs."
"It must be carried out by governments who ought to resist the temptation sometimes to deport in order to seek approval from the mob."
"That policy must also address gender and health issues which are vital in this debate."
"The readmission agreement on which I have been asked to report is the first readmission agreement that the Community is entering into."
"I share the Commissioner's appreciation of the willingness of the Hong Kong authorities to negotiate this with us."
"There is a danger that today's debate will be confused with a debate on Hong Kong tomorrow which reflects concern about the implementation of Article 23 of the Basic Law."
"Some may argue that Hong Kong is not a safe country."
"I accept the assurance given on 10 December by Donald Tsang, Hong Kong's Chief Secretary, when he gave his personal guarantee about the free flow of information and the freedom of speech remaining essential characteristics of Hong Kong society."
"Nor have I any doubt that the Hong Kong administration is competent to administer a readmission agreement."
"Moreover the agreement itself refers to international commitments to the protection of vulnerable persons."
"However, what concerns me about this agreement is that it is the first in what will be a series of such agreements."
"Authorisation has already been given for the negotiation of such agreements with many countries - some of them have even been initialled."
"The fact is that some of those agreements will be far harder than this one."
"Therefore, I would ask the Commission this afternoon to clarify a number of issues."
"The first concerns the scale of voluntary and forced repatriation promoted by the Member States, the categories of people involved and their countries of origin."
"Are the measures that Member States have adopted adequate and effective?"
"Since this House is also very concerned to ensure that the policies of return and the readmission agreements we negotiate respect fundamental rights, I would also ask how the Commission proposes to ensure that the rights of individuals are respected in the event of repatriation, especially if this occurs on a large scale."
"Is the Commission sure that the readmission agreements it is proposing are compatible with our obligations under international refugee law?"
"Will the Commission commit itself to establishing joint monitoring mechanisms with the countries with which we make readmission agreements?"
"The House would like answers to all these questions."
"I would also like to know why the European Parliament is never mentioned in the Commission's communication on a Community return policy."
"I would like clarification as to which coherent and transparent financial instrument will be used for the return policy in question and readmission agreements in particular."
"The role of the European Parliament as one arm of the budgetary authority is clearly important in this, and I would be interested to know whether we will, from a financial point of view, need a new legal base for this policy."
"The human rights clause in the readmission agreement used for Hong Kong is not strong enough to protect us against all eventualities in such agreements with other countries."
"We should recognise that, while concluding the agreement with Hong Kong was a relatively easy matter, as we were able to offer them visa-free access to the EU in return, cutting a deal with countries such as Russia and Morocco will be not a whit as easy."
"We will need to provide incentives for many third countries to cooperate with us, rather than threatening them with economic sanctions, as Mr Blair and Mr Aznar proposed in Seville."
"That is why I welcome the Commission's recent communication on integrating migration issues into the Union's external relations policy."
"If we join up the dots between this paper, our development policy, the negotiations on readmission and our economic need for immigration, we will be demonstrating the joined-up thinking we so urgently require in immigration and asylum policy."
"Mr President, it is a pleasure to be here and address these issues again with Mr Watson who has made a major contribution to this debate in the House as Chairman of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs."
"I am happy to see that has carried on and followed the evolution of these issues."
"Commencing with Hong Kong, we welcome this first ever European Community readmission agreement with a third country or territory."
"It proves not only the willingness of Hong Kong to commit to cooperation in the management of migratory fluxes with the European Union, but it also reinforces the credibility of the 'One Country, Two Systems' principle."
"As far as this concrete agreement is concerned, we have adopted a balanced approach."
"As you may recall, the European Union decided to grant visa-free access to Hong Kong citizens in March 2001 and, at the same time, we proposed the negotiation of a readmission agreement."
"I recognise that we should have kept Parliament better informed regarding these negotiations."
"In my defence, the only thing I can say is that there was only one round of negotiations."
"It would have been difficult to inform Parliament in the middle of the talks."
"Nevertheless, we take seriously the fact that we will now negotiate several readmission agreements."
"We need to introduce practical ways of consulting Parliament and keeping Parliament informed."
"I can assure you that I have already contacted the secretariat of the Citizens' Rights Committee to establish how Parliament can be granted direct access to information on how negotiations on readmission agreements are developing."
"I hope that I will be here next time to discuss readmission agreements with you and that I will then have a better story to tell you."
"As far as the oral question is concerned, the Commission does not have exact figures concerning the overall scale of voluntary and forced repatriation promoted by Member States."
"I can tell you that an average of 40% of the money allocated to Member States in the European Fund for Refugees is used to finance voluntary return."
"Only voluntary return comes under the provisions of the Fund for European Refugees."
"According to CIREFI statistics for 2001, with returns from 12 of the 15 Member States - the UK, Ireland and the Netherlands did not provide figures - a total of around 333 000 people have been returned."
"In 2002, from January to September, 98 000 people have been returned by Member States, but this figure does not include the UK, Ireland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg which have not provided us with the figures."
"I recognise that we need to have more accurate statistics on these issues."
"For instance, I cannot distinguish between voluntary returns and forced returns because national Member States' statistics do not make the distinction."
"I can give you the citizenship of those who have been returned but I cannot tell you to where they have been returned because, as you know, some of them have not been returned to their own country, they have been returned to the countries through which they entered the European Union."
"We recognise the need for better information and, therefore, we will present a proposal during the Greek presidency to have a specific instrument for exchange of harmonised and standardised statistics so far as asylum and migration policy are concerned."
"With regard to enforcement of decisions to return people, the Commission has no responsibilities so far as enforcement is concerned."
"That is exclusively the responsibility of the Member States."
"Nevertheless, we believe that some instruments should be adopted at European level."
"For instance, mutual recognition of expulsion decisions is a key element."
"There is an instrument with very limited scope in this area; we are now assessing how it has been working in practice and I hope that next spring we can present you with our evaluation of how mutual recognition of expulsion decisions works in the European Union."
"The same applies to the standards for expulsion."
"We believe that we should have some common standards at European level for decisions to return people;"
"I therefore hope we will be able to present some specific proposals on this topic fairly soon."
"I recognise that the Commission does not have any instrument for monitoring post-return situations."
"It is not within our remit and we do not have the tools to make such an evaluation."
"Of course, I welcome the idea of having a broad debate on return policy."
"As you know, we have published a Green Paper, we have presented an action plan and the Council has endorsed this action plan."
"I hope that, in the framework of the debate on communications about migration and development, we will be able, together with Parliament, to discuss what the key elements of return policy in the European Union are."
"I am looking forward to hearing Parliament's view on this subject."
"Mr President, Mr Haarder, at the last Justice and Home Affairs Council, thanks to the complexity of Community procedures, you adopted a very effective measure in the fight against illegal immigration, but you probably did not realise - because it was the final point on the agenda - that, without debate, you approved the conclusion of an agreement extending and increasing the quotas for the import of tomatoes from Morocco."
"Apart from this decision, you have not taken any great measures, either in this Council or in any other, in relation to the field of immigration at least."
"We have on the table a full range of proposals from the Commission in relation to immigration policies, a proactive immigration policy, and I will not list them since I will bore Parliament if I do so in every speech."
"None of them have been adopted."
"At the European Council in Seville, without having done its homework in this field, the Council once again established priorities and time limits in relation to immigration policy."
"They began to talk there less about this policy and more about the fight against illegal immigration."
"But we have not made much progress on that either."
"In any event, what did happen there was to begin to talk about this in a different way which gives me some concern."
"They began to talk about the return of immigrants, the control of external borders, in a way in which there is not much room for many concrete proposals."
"There was talk of security, the term border control was introduced into this field and, listening to you, it appears that illegal immigration has to do with lack of security."
"If you take a walk around our cities, you will see that illegal immigration has more to do with domestic staff, people working in agriculture and people working in our restaurants."
"And we know who they are."
"To give you a figure, in my country, and in just one town close to Barcelona, L'Hospitalet, which has 800 000 inhabitants, 17 670 people have been recorded, many of them illegal immigrants."
"During this period, the Commission has presented two proposals which provide a global approximation of the issue, as laid down in the Tampere conclusions: the Green Paper on return, the inclusion of the immigration policy in the Union's external policy."
"Of course, this global approximation must include a repressive aspect, but in order to ensure the fulfilment of an immigration policy, in order to control illegal employment - if Berlusconi will allow me - in order to establish a policy for integration of external trade."
"If we do not have this global approximation, if we do not focus on this approach, we are not going to be effective in the fight against illegal immigration."
"Mr President, we all acknowledge that there have been two problems in the achievement of common asylum and immigration policies: lack of speed and lack of balance."
"On the speed problem, there has been a spurt on asylum policy under the Danish presidency."
"I too pay tribute to the energy of Mr Haarder."
"However, on the question of balance, I still feel very frustrated that legal migration and rights of migrants have been neglected."
"There is so much criticism of migrants who fail to integrate, but little is done to assist them through, for example, family reunification or rights of free movement."
"Let us take, for example, the reception conditions directive which highlights the classic danger of the 'lowest common denominator' approach imposed by the unanimity rule."
"This is not Mr Haarder's fault."
"After apparent agreement on the text last April, debate was reopened."
"The result was that the Germans got their way, and consequently there is no requirement to allow asylum seekers to work if a decision on their case is not forthcoming within a year."
"The British have got their way in that Member States will be allowed to refuse reception assistance where the asylum seeker cannot show that he has made his claim as soon as possible."
"If there was qualified majority voting and codecision with this Parliament, neither clause - I am sure - would be in this text since a more progressive majority would have prevailed."
"On the question of return, are we forcing women to return to Afghanistan, to an environment described by Human Rights Watch as being just as oppressive as it was under the Taliban?"
"Spied on by teenage boys, women are marched to hospital and forced to undergo abusive gynaecological examinations to prove their chastity."
"They still have to wear the burkha, which is medieval."
"I suggest that we cannot guarantee the security of women returned to Afghanistan."
"I would like assurance that we are not returning women to Afghanistan."
"Mr President, there are two aspects to this issue: firstly, the problem of excluding unwanted migrants from the European Union - or at least controlling their access; and, secondly, the reasons for migration."
"Excluding population pressure, political instability and regional war, it is clear that the main pressure stems from economic disparities."
"In short, the bulk of immigrants seeking access to the European Union Member States are economic migrants."
"Therefore, any successful policy must deal with not only the exclusion issues but also the causes of migration."
"Here it seems clear the European Union is making things worse."
"Virtually all its external policies in respect of third countries and its policies towards the candidate countries seem geared to causing migration from less-developed countries."
"The Union has rigid quotas, tariffs and other protectionist policies restricting trade with third countries."
"While it subsidies its own industries - especially agriculture through the unreformed common agricultural policy - and it dumps subsidised goods on the world market, all of this destabilises third-world economies."
"In terms of fishing agreements, the Union pillages third-world waters, instead of encouraging local industries."
"It also takes skilled, educated workers from these countries, depriving them of the building blocks of economic development."
"All of this cruelly exposes the imperialism of the European project."
"Instead of getting on with practical issues, you launch upon idealistic common policies. These policies are making the problems worse."
"It would make far more sense to stop damaging third-country economies, rather than embarking on these extraordinary new ventures."
"In other words, leave immigration control to the Member States - a policy that my party supports - and address the failures of existing policies."
"There it seems to me, in deference to the Council member present, you must try harder."
"Mr President, credit is certainly due to the Danish Presidency for producing a more judicious immigration policy, particularly as regards questions such as the very sensitive issue of asylum, for policies on these matters have, for a long time, in practice, actually tended to encourage illegal immigration."
"However, although we are more aware of the dangers related to illegal immigration, that does not mean that the Union has practically implemented all the most effective measures for opposing it, such as, for example, readmission agreements with third countries, which must progress much faster and be much more practical, given that - as we are all aware - the Union has strong tangible grounds for putting pressure on these countries."
"On the coasts of southern Italy, the flow of illegal immigrants ferried to the country by sea continues, despite the adoption of new, more stringent criminal legislation against traffickers, precisely because there has been no fall in the support or complicity traffickers enjoy in countries such as Albania or Turkey."
"The measures announced to combat illegal immigration include the project for a European police force to deal with all border control, not just control of sea borders, although this police force must be properly trained."
"This project must be given full support and pursued without delay, and proper training in this field must be given to the police forces of the new Member States, which will very soon have to address these issues - if they are not already addressing them - for their borders will become ours in this respect too."
"There is, however, another important warning bell which it is our duty to ring too: we cannot continue to turn a blind eye to a number of proven cases of active members of Bin Laden's network who have penetrated our cities as regular immigrants in order to prepare the ground, as has recently been discovered in France, for biological weapons attacks, possibly with what are known as dirty bombs containing nuclear waste."
"This danger is now present within Europe."
"We must take care that we do not help those intending to bring about incidents similar to those which took place in New York, Mombassa or Bali with excessively generous provision."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I would like to thank you for being in the European Parliament today to discuss issues which do not only have a large human component, but which also have a very high profile in the media and in politics; immigration and asylum."
"I will refer firstly to immigration."
"It is a good thing that it is said and repeated time and time again in this House that regulated migratory flows make a very positive contribution to the development of the receiving country, the situation of immigrants themselves and even the development of the country of origin."
"But it should also be repeated that the unrestricted arrival of persons in an illegal manner leads to a saturation of the structures of our societies and ends up exceeding those societies' capacity for reception, resulting in situations of inequality and marginalisation."
"We therefore need a coherent European policy which takes account of all the elements inherent to the phenomenon of migration."
"The European Councils in Tampere, Laeken and Seville have represented a significant advance in the field of immigration."
"Nevertheless, not without reason, many people have criticised the lack of agreement in non-repressive fields, as my colleague and predecessor, Mr Watson, has said; it is true that, on the basis of such tragic events as those which take place on an almost daily basis in the waters of the Straits of Gibraltar, or on Italian coasts, vigilance, border control and the fight against mafias and exploiters of illegal workers, can and must be the response to the concerns of the citizens, who are increasingly sensitive to issues such as insecurity and human trafficking."
"Nevertheless, I would like to stress the importance of other aspects still awaiting substantial progress."
"Firstly, the intensification and reconsideration of the policy of development aid in order to generate, in the countries of origin, a dignified and promising environment and thereby prevent the exodus of people - the majority of whom are young - who, rather than fleeing towards the unknown, risking their lives, could and should play an essential role in the development of their own countries."
"Secondly, to begin work on the implementation of an observatory, which at the moment is virtual, for migration, which by means of analysis and distribution of information, would allow us to deal with the phenomenon of immigration on the basis of true facts, which are reliable and comparable between Member States, as the Commissioner has just acknowledged."
"Thirdly, promoting the integration of legal immigrants, one of the keys to the success of any immigration policy, by means of measures which include family reunification, the education of children, non-discrimination, access to housing, facilities for the learning of the language of the reception country, or social or health measures."
"Now, in order to prevent clashes with the receiving society, and as was acknowledged at the fourth Mediterranean forum in Bari, held on 17 and 18 June, it is necessary not to forget the twin aspects of the phenomenon, that is, the need to also work to ensure the respect on the part of the immigrants for the principles and values of the society receiving them."
"Finally, cooperation with countries of origin and transit in a spirit of partnership and co-responsibility, as agreed at the aforementioned forum, on the control of migratory flows, the fight against illegal immigration, the adoption of national readmission agreements and integrated management of the Union's borders."
"This is a task which, in order to be successful, must be carried out in close cooperation with the third countries bordering the European Union."
"And to move on to the field of asylum, Mr President, I would like to stress the importance of, and respect for, the Geneva Convention, regulating, in a complementary manner, other necessary forms of international protection for those cases included in it."
"However, I regret once again to have to make a criticism, as I did when we discussed the directive, for which I was rapporteur, in relation to the conditions for receiving and asylum because, in practice, the negotiations on the different aspects of the asylum policy are still being carried out in a confused and disorganised fashion."
"There is a saying: 'do not bite off more than you can chew'; and I have the feeling that this is the current situation in the field of asylum."
"It is also incongruous to discuss proposals which, in their provisions, depend on concepts regulated by others, the negotiations of which should have been concluded earlier, but which instead are making no progress."
"I would therefore appeal to you to rationalise the European process, and let us not get tied up in vicious circles which are highly influenced by national interests."
"Finally, Mr President, last but not least, I would like to draw the attention of the Commission and the Council to the fact that, with the entry into force of the Treaty of Nice, scheduled for 1 February, the Parliament-Council codecision procedure, and the qualified majority, will be applicable in such sensitive areas as all those which relate to the minimum standards regulating the different aspects of the procedures, requirements and conditions for asylum."
"As many people have already said, the common asylum and immigration policy is progressing in a very unbalanced way."
"Where repressive measures, including combating illegal immigration, are concerned, the Council has once again done a lot of energetic work this year."
"There is, however, currently no sign of an actual common asylum and migration policy, and that is not the Commission's fault - no, it is the Council's fault."
"The Council has opted for a highly unilateral approach."
"It has put control of our external borders and sanctions against offering assistance to those entering and staying illegally right at the top of the agenda."
"The removal and return policy has now been added to this as a priority."
"In this context we are talking today about the readmission agreement with third countries, in this case Hong Kong."
"Parliament was more or less left standing on the sidelines during the negotiations for this agreement, and has not been able to act in accordance with its allotted role."
"This should not have been allowed to happen, particularly as this agreement will be a model for future agreements of a similar kind."
"I have taken note of Mr Vitorino's promise that this will not happen again, and I intend to remind him of this."
"My group can otherwise live with the content of the Hong Kong agreement, but we do endorse Mr Watson's critical approach."
"Leading on from his questions, I would like to make the three following comments."
"Firstly, to what extent are the deportation measures already taken effective in general, and how do we prevent people from third countries who have been deported from coming straight back into the EU countries they came from?"
"Or is our policy of return primarily a virtual policy intended for domestic consumption, and is it supposed to mask the fact that the political courage to tackle the real problems is lacking?"
"Secondly, is forced return not supposed to be a tailpiece of our policy of return, a last resort, and what instruments does the European Union actually have to promote voluntary return in order to avoid forced return?"
"My last point: collective deportation is forbidden, including in the European Charter of Human Rights, but how are European Union Member States supposed to ensure that decisions to deport individual illegal immigrants from third countries are individually monitored, and how do we then prevent the principle of 'non-refoulement' from being violated?"
"Mr President, the will of the Commission in response to the orientations of the European Council to establish a global and integrated policy of migrations is very laudable, but the police and Interior Ministry approach, which can be gathered from the communication, clashes directly with this Parliament's view of the relations the European Union must maintain with the developing countries, whose immigrants, by the way - and according to the Commission itself - are not a problem from a quantitative point of view."
"As the Commission itself points out, more than 90% of the world's immigrants live and work outside the European Union, close to their countries of origin."
"At the time of the Seville European Council, we warned of the danger of making cooperation for development conditional upon the control of immigration on the part of the countries in which it is generated."
"Development cooperation is not an instrument for resolving the internal problems of the donors of aid, but a tool for fighting poverty."
"The origins of migration, whether legal or not, lie in poverty, political repression and armed conflicts."
"These are the causes which must be combated through development cooperation, rather than using it to repress their effects."
"This Commission's desire to integrate European immigration policy is a wonderful opportunity to ensure that, instead of spending development funds on monitoring borders and the forced repatriation of immigrants, they are assigned to more constructive activities in accordance with the principle of combating poverty which governs European cooperation policy."
"It is a question of co-development or, in other words, contributing to the development of the areas of origin of immigrants, so that they can return with hope for the future."
"In this way, the Commission would be acting coherently with itself, since it states, in the communication we are debating today, that it is aware that the European Union's relations with the developing countries must be based on solidarity."
"Article 13 of the Cotonou Agreement on readmission led to problems and protests."
"Therefore, we say yes to negotiated readmission within the framework of global development programmes, but no to forced repatriation, especially when this is paid for from development funds."
"We will be vigilant in order to prevent, by means of the reallocation of the scant resources in category 4, any modification of the development priorities established by this Parliament, especially given that the Commission's report demonstrates the concern at the lack of money available for resolving this problem."
"Mr President, there is certainly no lack of suggestions when it comes to asylum policy, suggestions which can provoke feelings either of fear or of excessive generosity and tolerance."
"It has, of course, been pointed out here - and I agree - that what we need instead is good sense, wisdom and, above all, a great ability to recognise the complex nature of issues."
"I would therefore like to ask the Commissioner whether the position of minors, in particular, is being addressed, with regard to the right to asylum and migration issues, and if so how, and whether a huge problem known as 'Eurocracy' - in other words the fact that waiting times for both the rejection and the acceptance of certain applications relating to what are still extremely lengthy, complex procedures are excessively long and certainly do not respect what we call human rights - is being addressed, Commissioner, and if so how."
"Lastly, a fundamental question."
"You talked about harmonising asylum laws and thus of the need for a clear legal framework and, I would go so far as to say, constitutional framework for all the European countries, for our credibility depends on this."
"I agree with you on this point and I hope that you will work towards this goal."
"Mr President, at the Seville European Council, three fundamental aspects of the Union's immigration policy were specified: firstly, the necessary management of migratory flows, in cooperation with countries of origin; secondly, taking account of the integration of legal immigrants; and finally, opening up negotiations of readmission agreements at European level."
"With regard to the first point, initiatives such as the proposal for a Directive on the free movement of citizens or family regrouping, or those relating to the conditions for entry for work purposes for immigrant or third-country nationals, should be approved by this Parliament as soon as possible and with the greatest possible consensus, in order to demonstrate that we are in favour of a single immigration policy."
"With regard to the second point, the success of an immigration policy undoubtedly depends on the integration measures which must accompany it."
"Therefore, reception and integration must be considered as an essential part of the general immigration policy and this means agreed action, not only on the part of the European Union, but also on the part of national and regional governments, civil society and the immigrants themselves."
"We must take advantage of the generally positive impact which legal immigrants have on our economies and ensure an appropriate balance between the rights of third-country citizens and the rights of receiving communities."
"I am happy to support the measures of the Danish Presidency with regard to readmission agreements."
"I would point out that in one of the Convention's working groups it was said that the negotiation of readmission agreements with third countries has been shown to be more effective when carried out at European level."
"Another important point is the creation of an integrated system of management of external borders."
"In this regard, I would also praise the Danish Presidency, which wished to promote a rapid and secure exchange of information between the Member States, with a view to strengthening cooperation on the control of borders."
"In this regard, it is appropriate to mention the report adopted last week in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on this issue."
"I would like to end with a quote from Mr Vitorino, which I have often used: 'immigration is neither a problem nor a solution, it is a phenomenon of a clearly human, social, economic and political nature'."
"Mr President, I fully support Mr Watson's excellent report, particularly the text of the question in which the European Parliament calls upon the Council and the Commission to take seriously the fundamental human rights which the European Union proclaims every day."
"We believe that it is possible to respect human rights while pursuing a proper policy of combating illegal immigration."
"However, we do need appropriate instruments, appropriate forms of control, for otherwise a blind, bureaucratic system of rejection and forced repatriation will lead to tragedies such as that which occurred recently in Italy."
"In Milan, a family travelling from Syria, in transit from Amman to Casablanca, was forced to be repatriated to Syria, where the head of the family was immediately arrested and is in danger of being tortured and may be sentenced to death."
"We call upon you to ensure that similar tragedies are avoided so that nobody can say, as is stated in the minority opinion, that the Union's readmission policy leads to the death of human beings."
"I call upon the Commission and the Council to make every endeavour to remedy the consequences of that tragic act carried out in my country, which can lead to a person being killed in another country."
"Mr President, Commissioner, on the eve of 2003, the Greek Presidency has promised to give the very fullest attention to the decisions taken in Amsterdam, Tampere and Seville."
"Greece's extensive coastline forms the external border of the European Union with the countries of Asia, countries from which immigrants are now flooding into Europe, which is why it is vital that the Greek Presidency introduce a framework policy to divide obligations and responsibilities fairly between the Member States of the European Union."
"Of course, as other members have also pointed out, immigration policy means more than just guarding borders."
"It means more than repressive measures, repatriation and readmission."
"It also means recognising the human rights and fundamental employment and civil rights of immigrants and what they have to offer and can contribute to the development of Europe."
"It means fully recognising the rights of anyone who has resided in the European Union for five years, as we have repeatedly proposed here in Parliament."
"It also means recognising that women who have left home under the threat of religious fundamentalism or barbaric traditions and practices which clash with the modern perception of respect for human rights have a right to apply for and be granted asylum."
"."
"(DA) Mr President, I will start with Mrs Hazan, who complains that there is disagreement concerning asylum policy and that therefore it will not really come to anything."
"I did not entirely understand this remark, because I was after all able to say that we have just reached agreement on the cornerstones of a common asylum policy."
"We have agreed on the definition of a refugee, on what is to be understood by subsidiary protection and on the directive on reception conditions, and by all accounts all this will be confirmed at a Council meeting tomorrow."
"In addition, we have also agreed to convert the Dublin convention into a Dublin directive."
"The agreement is based on the first receiving country being responsible for the first year and thereafter the country in which the person concerned has resided for five months, and if the person concerned has not resided in any country for five months then it is the country in which the application for asylum is submitted."
"That may sound very easy, but the opposing interests of the various countries are so enormous - depending on where they are situated in Europe - that it has been tremendously difficult to reach agreement."
"I believe it is extremely satisfactory than we now have agreement on these cornerstones of a common asylum policy."
"Mr Vitorino and I met for the first time in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs."
"He was the chairman and I was a member."
"The first thing we talked about was these things, which we wanted to lead to a common policy, and we talked a lot about Eurodac."
"When will it come to something, we asked the Commissioner."
"Now we can answer: something will come of it on 15 January, that is, next month."
"So I think we have achieved a great deal."
"Thank you for giving me the opportunity to repeat that."
"Mrs Sbarbati is right that something must be done for asylum-seeking minors in particular, and I can only state that in my home parliament I have introduced a Bill which ensures that an adult is present, that a lawyer is present when necessary and that cases involving minors are processed extra quickly."
"Similar efforts are in progress in other countries."
"Turning to Mrs Ludford, I would say that if not much has come of a common immigration policy, that is partly to do with the number of work permits to be issued."
"Most governments maintain that this must be a national decision."
"This is why it has also been difficult to arrive at common rules on the right to free movement between countries."
"It is only natural that reaching agreement on this point is a difficult task, not least because some countries have very high levels of employment whilst others have very low levels of employment."
"We will probably make some progress, but as I have mentioned, it is not that easy."
"I would go on to say to Mrs Swiebel that one specific aspect of the common asylum policy on which we have now agreed is that we ensure compliance with the conventions in every case."
"With regard to Mrs Swiebel's concerns regarding forced returns, I believe that all the governments are doing everything to ensure that those whose asylum claims are rejected are returned voluntarily; likewise illegal immigrants, if the governments wish to return them."
"One cannot rule out forced repatriation, however; if we were to rule that out, we might as well pack up and forget all about an asylum policy, including a common asylum policy."
"Regarding what Mrs Ludford said about women being returned to Afghanistan, it is naturally the case - as it should be - that nobody must be sent back to persecution, torture or degrading treatment."
"To reassure her I can state that the Afghans in most countries - this is true in my country at least - are young men from the Kabul region."
"Even they are not being sent back home at the moment; but it is obvious that, when this becomes possible in the spring, then it is only reasonable that, if their asylum claim has been rejected, we ensure that the person in question returns one way or another."
"I think it is great that Mr Vitorino has now achieved agreement in the Council not just on a general return policy, but also on a special return programme for Afghanistan."
"For this aspect of the matter must be included."
"Finally, I would say to Mr Olle Schmidt that I thank him for his interest in Danish legislation."
"It already meets all the common minimum rules that we are talking about, and even goes beyond them."
"So thank you for your concern."
"Thank you very much, Mr Vitorino."
"Mr Berthu has the floor for a point of order."
"Unusually, we are going to give the floor once again to Mr Vitorino."
"I would ask you to be brief."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow from 11 am."
"Question No 1 by Josu Ortuondo Larrea (H-0724/02):"
"Subject: Charter of Fundamental Rights: signs at the railway station in Bayonne (Basque Country, France)"
"The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, solemnly proclaimed at Nice in December 2000, stipulates, inter alia, that 'the Union shall respect cultural, religious and linguistic diversity' (Article 22) and that 'any discrimination based on any ground such as? language? membership of a national minority? shall be prohibited' (Article 21(1))."
"However, on 14 October the French Government detained a number of people in the city of Bayonne, in the northern Basque Country, for erecting a sign at the railway station in the Basque language, Euskara."
"The sign read BAIONAKO GELTOKIA, which simply means Bayonne railway station."
"In the Council's view, is the French Government complying with the stipulations of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in suppressing the use of a language, especially in its place of origin, where its use predates that of French?"
"Does it not believe that the French Government itself should see to it that Basque citizens are provided with all public signs in their vernacular language so as to prevent them from suffering discrimination on grounds of language or membership of a national minority?"
"Mr President, thank you for drawing attention to what this question is about. I frequently have a bad conscience about answering questions that no one has heard."
"As you mentioned, however, it is about the fact that French authorities have removed a sign in the Basque language which points the way to a railway station."
"And the question is: does this not contravene the Charter of Fundamental Rights?"
"The answer is that the Charter addresses the EU authorities and the national authorities when they administer EU policy."
"Consequently, I am forced to answer 'no'."
"Whatever may be thought about this language dispute, this case will never become relevant to the EU's Charter of Fundamental Human Rights because the Charter is aimed at the EU and at the Member States when administering EU policy, and as we are aware, the EU has no policy on railway signage."
"On 28 October, the Council of State of the French Republic approved a resolution declaring illegal the integration into the French public network of Diwan schools, which teach the Breton language, another autochthonous European language, like Basque, Catalan and also Alsatian, which originates from this very city of Strasbourg."
"Does the Presidency-in-Office of the Council not believe that, in order to comply with the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which was so pompously proclaimed in Nice by President Chirac and the former President of the European Parliament, Mrs Nicole Fontaine, the French Government should legally guarantee public access to the learning of these other native European languages within their respective territory?"
"This is an issue, Mr President, which is included in the European Union's Charter of Fundamental Rights, which states that linguistic diversity and all cultures will be defended."
"And this is not only an inter-State objective, but also a European Community objective."
"Mr President, that was precisely what I was trying to say."
"I have the greatest sympathy for regional languages."
"I believe that they have a future and I believe that we will become more aware of them, but in this connection I am forced to say that, where the Charter talks about the Union respecting cultural, religious and linguistic diversity etc., it is talking about the Union's policies and not about the Member States' policies."
"Question No 2 by Manuel Medina Ortega (H-0726/02):"
"Subject: Expulsions in Northern Cyprus"
"What action will the Council take in connection with the expulsion from Northern Cyprus of 16 Spanish citizens, including 10 journalists and two university professors, after they had held meetings with trade unionists, non-governmental organisations, journalists and television broadcasters?"
"Bearing in mind that the authorities in Northern Cyprus are dependent on Turkey, what consequences might such measures have for Turkey's application for membership of the European Union?"
"The Council was asked what measures the Council would take after 16 Spaniards were expelled from the northern part of Cyprus."
"I can answer that the Council has not been informed of the event in question."
"The Council, which met on 24 and 25 October, was pleased to see the significant steps that Turkey has taken towards meeting the political criteria from Copenhagen."
"And the Council established that the country has made progress with regard to the economic criteria and adaptation to current Community law."
"The Copenhagen European Council on Friday once again called upon Turkey energetically to continue its process of reform and urged Turkey to take further practical steps."
"As part of the accession partnership Turkey has undertaken fully to support the efforts of the UN Secretary-General at finding a solution to the Cyprus problem."
"After the Secretary-General submitted his plan for a solution, the Council noted a declaration by the Danish Presidency in which the Presidency confirmed that the EU was willing to adapt to the terms of an overall UN solution in accordance with the principles on which the European Union is based."
"On Friday, it was confirmed that the Council is willing to adapt the accession treaty to these terms, and the European Council expressed its pleasure that the Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots had agreed to continue negotiations with a view to arriving at an overall solution by 28 February 2003."
"I agree with the opinions expressed by the President-in-Office of the Council."
"Of course, I completely disagree with the view of Mr Giscard d'Estaing that Turkey's entry should be conditional upon certain racist requirements; but what is clear is that we MEPs have an obligation to communicate to the Community institutions any cases in which a candidate country is not complying with the conditions demanded of it."
"Bearing in mind that Turkey's candidature still has a long way to go, does the President-in-Office of the Council not believe that the Turkish Government should be made aware of these facts in order to demonstrate to it, in a specific manner, that this type of measure - the expulsion of journalists carrying out their work - is not compatible with membership of the European Union?"
"Specifically, does the Council have any type of mechanism for informing the Turkish Government of these cases, in order to prevent any repetition of these incidents, and in order to demonstrate to them in a practical way what the democratic functioning of the European institutions consists of?"
"As I have said, I cannot comment on the specific case, but I would like to remind you of what Mr Verheugen said in very strong terms on Friday evening shortly before midnight at the press conference and which he has repeated in even stronger terms today in this House, namely that Turkey will be assessed according to the same strict standards as the ten countries that have just been accepted, that the Commission will carry out its work zealously and meticulously, and that torture in prisons, political prisoners and the theoretical existence of what Mr Medina has spoken of are naturally unthinkable in a country which is to start negotiations for accession to the European Union."
"I must tell you that the third question, raised by Baroness Ludford, relates to the debate we have held today, but there is a part which refers to the draft directive on the status of long-term resident third-country nationals."
"With this in mind, I would ask the President-in-Office of the Council to answer the question."
"Question No 3 by Sarah Ludford (H-0728/02):"
"Subject: Integration of third-country nationals"
"Following the meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Council of 14-15 October, the Council Conclusions on the integration of third-country nationals were approved."
"These Conclusions encouraged active participation of third-country nationals in community life and emphasised how integration measures are a key element in developing a common EU immigration and asylum policy."
"Why is it that, when the Council sends political signals that it is committed to such goals, originally set out at the European Council in Tampere three years ago, it has been unable to make any substantial progress on the Draft Directive on the status of long-term resident third-country nationals?"
"Does not the Council think that the way to encourage and ensure integration is to offer third-country nationals stability, security and rights similar to EU citizens as set out in the legislative provisions of the text rather than to keep repeating general statements and offering only a 'network' of best practice?"
"Does not the failure to deliver legal rights make the supportive statements appear hollow and insincere?"
"The issue of the integration of third-country nationals is one of the priorities of the programme of work of the Danish Presidency."
"Its importance and the need to prompt and encourage integration were recognised and underlined by the Council in the conclusions adopted on 14 - 15 October."
"As a follow-up to those conclusions, the Presidency called upon the Member States to establish national contact points for integration by the end of this year, and all the Member States have accepted this."
"Using these contact points, we will exchange best practice and learn from each other's successes and fiascos."
"I would add that a major conference on integration was held in Copenhagen in July, which also provided opportunity for such exchange of experience and best practice."
"The relevant bodies of the Council have considered various proposals for Council directives, which the Commission has submitted with a view to implementing the Tampere conclusions in respect of the entry and residence of third-country nationals."
"These legislative instruments are aimed at creating a legal framework of rights and obligations at Community level for third-country nationals wishing to enter and reside in the territory of other Member States."
"The aim is naturally that, as far as possible, they be treated in the same way and be subject to the same conditions as EU citizens are when travelling from one country to another."
"This will contribute to integration but, as I said during the debate that we have just concluded, it is not that easy to reach agreement concerning these conditions."
"There is no doubt as to the aim, however."
"When I tabled this question two months ago I did not know that, coincidentally, there would be a debate this afternoon on immigration and asylum."
"I would like to thank the President-in-Office for that reply."
"I do not underestimate the importance of the exchange of best practice on national integration policies and I pay tribute to the measures put in place in Denmark under his stewardship."
"However, we still do not have this directive."
"What kind of timetable is there to get this directive agreed?"
"It will give the estimated 20 million people who are legally long-term residents in the European Union the legal framework of rights and obligations that will help to integrate them."
"Is it not ludicrous to keep calling for mobility of labour to boost economic growth while preventing those 20 million from going to work in another Member State?"
"They are a rather obvious category of people who might be inclined to do that."
"Is there a timetable, is there a target date for getting this directive agreed?"
"Mr President, I am afraid there is no such target date."
"We could easily arrange one if we were prepared to accept a bad directive, but, if we want a good directive, we need more time."
"Question No 4 by Jonas Sjöstedt (H-0729/02):"
"Subject: Common patent system"
"The Commission's proposal on a common patent system has been the subject of debate and negotiation in Parliament as well as talks between Member States' governments."
"Some of the most difficult aspects to agree on have proved to be which languages should be used for the detailed description of an invention and the process of establishing a legal system and common case law."
"Concurrently with these negotiations, the London Agreement is being implemented under the European Patent Convention."
"For companies which make large numbers of patent applications, the present situation is creating uncertainty as to what rules will apply in the long term."
"What is the timetable for the introduction of a common EC patent?"
"What steps have been taken to bring the negotiations to a successful conclusion during the current presidency?"
"Which aspects of the Commission's proposal are causing most controversy in the negotiations?"
"Since the Commission tabled its proposal concerning EU patents in August 2000, the Presidency has made a significant effort to promote the work on this proposal."
"In recent months, the work has been concentrated on the patent system's court-related aspects."
"Its starting point has been a working document submitted by the Commission in August."
"Following intensive discussions, the Presidency tried, at the meeting of 14 November, to reach agreement on a number of central principles for the court system as part of an overall compromise, but it was not possible to reach agreement on all the features."
"In spite of the lack of progress, the efforts have continued."
"At the meeting on 26 November, the Presidency concluded that COREPER should continue its work, giving high priority to the issue of finalising an agreement and so paving the way for a political agreement."
"The Presidency also concluded, however, that the Council would do its utmost to reach such an agreement in good time before the European Council's spring summit in 2003."
"Against the background of an overall political agreement, the aim is to have the matter of the EC patent finalised and adopted as quickly as possible."
"The most important issues in the negotiations are as follows: the role of the national patent authorities; languages; costs and who is to pay these; the distribution of fees; and the whole court system in connection with the patent."
"It may sound simple, but it is in fact fiendishly complicated, and when I think of how many debates there have been in my own Parliament in Denmark, I can readily imagine the problem that rotating presidencies will have in getting 15 - and soon, in fact, 25 - parliaments to agree on the same rules."
"This must happen, however."
"It is absolutely crucial, so I want to thank Mr Sjöstedt for his question."
"We must get this matter finalised."
"I think it has to be said that this issue is all of a piece and that agreement on one point also requires agreement on the other points, for everything is of course interrelated."
"I am not in a position to say whether one of the subjects might be more difficult than others, but I can in any case imagine that the issue of expenses is something that has a role to play."
"The Council is carefully following the work of the Convention and is of course aware of the structure for a constitution, presented by Mr Giscard d'Estaing in October."
"As is well known, it will be the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference that will adopt a final position on the issues raised by the two MEPs."
"It is rather difficult for me here and now to predict what the Intergovernmental Conference will say."
"I also believe that, as matters develop, the Convention will go a very long way towards finding a solution acceptable to all the governments."
"That solution will, on the other hand, be less ambitious than some might have wished. I believe, however, that it will be viable and also be able to survive an Intergovernmental Conference."
"Mr President, I wish first of all to express my surprise at the question asked by the President-in-Office of the Council."
"I personally feel, as I am sure do all the Members of this Parliament, that an enlarged Europe will be a political Europe, with more democratic institutions and a Constitution, a fairer Europe, with greater internal solidarity, a Europe which takes its place in the world as a power, a force, a Europe of peace and solidarity, a Europe that improves the European Union, contributing to the historic unification of the continent, but not a Union that is institutionally different or new."
"Its name must be the European Union then, a name that is furthermore clearly pleasing to the ear and appropriate."
"With this in mind, I would ask, what then is the meaning of Mr Giscard d'Estaing's proposal - which the President has just implicitly accepted - that the European Union's name might be changed?"
"Is this a desire on his part to play a leading role; vanity?"
"Could this be a sign that the Chairman of the European Convention is attempting to reduce the Union's political power?"
"Can you give us a straight answer, Mr President, as to what you really think about this?"
"The Presidency does not share responsibility for the proposals tabled by Mr Giscard d'Estaing."
"He is perfectly entitled to table them, but the Presidency has no comments to make, either on its own, or on the Council's, behalf."
"What Denmark, as a nation, thinks is something we shall make known after the New Year when, in common with so many other countries, we shall declare our position, but I do not wish, here today on behalf of the Council, to adopt any kind of position whatsoever on Mr Giscard d'Estaing's proposals."
"I shall simply answer your question, Mr Martin."
"Does the Council also adopt that line of reasoning etc?"
"Is that the Council's view?"
"The Council has no view."
"Nor should it have, either, for we have left it to the Convention to prepare all these things."
"I must not therefore, on behalf of the Council, stand here and evaluate the proposals that are made in the Convention."
"I am certain that many here in the Chamber, including Mr Duff, would explode with rage if I did that."
"I shall spare him that."
"I am able to state that Mr Solana has not visited Cyprus since he took office."
"He has had a wide range of contacts with many of the actors involved and has taken every opportunity to call for a constructive solution."
"He has expressed support for the efforts made by Kofi Annan and, on 12 November, he expressed satisfaction with Kofi Annan's decision willingly to present a proposal for solving the issue of a united Cyprus."
"At the European Council meeting held on 24-25 October, it was decided that a three-year programme should be set out for the period 2004-2006 for the benefit of the northern part of Cyprus and with a view to implementing a political solution."
"No practical priorities have yet been set or more specific provisions laid down."
"Last Friday, the European Council called upon the Commission to cooperate with the Cypriot Government in considering how economic development might be promoted in Northern Cyprus and how Northern Cyprus might be brought closer to the EU."
"In connection with the Council meeting of 19 November, the ministers debated the Cyprus issue over lunch, once the UN Secretary-General had presented his plan for a solution to the situation."
"Subsequently, the Presidency presented a President's statement, warmly endorsing the Secretary-General's plans, and noted that the EU is prepared to respect the conditions of an overall solution in accordance with the principles that form the basis of the EU, and this with a view to arriving at a solution that makes it possible for Cyprus to accede to the EU as a united island."
"Last Friday, the European Council meeting welcomed the fact that both Greek and Turkish Cypriots had promised to continue the negotiations with a view to reaching an overall solution on the basis of the UN Secretary-General's proposal before 28 February 2003."
"In the Council's view, Kofi Annan's proposal constitutes a unique and historic opportunity to put an end now to the conflict that has devastated this beautiful island for far too long."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the minister for his reply, but I must say that the fact that Mr Solana is so detached from the process of settlement of the dispute in the island of Cyprus fills me with great disquiet."
"Would the minister agree that it is fear for their security that is proving the principle obstacle to Turkish Cypriot compliance with the Annan proposals?"
"Would he not also agree that peace-keeping on the island will be a central responsibility for the European Union, through the process of settlement and following this process, for a considerable period before tranquillity and stability truly return to that poor strife-torn place."
"Mr President, just as I have the greatest respect for the engagement that the honourable Member has shown in the Cyprus issue, I can certainly follow his reasoning. I must just underline that the Cyprus negotiations take place under the auspices of the UN and not under the auspices of the EU."
"There is a perfect relationship between the UN and the EU."
"Each knows exactly what the other is doing."
"If the UN were to ask the EU, via Mr Solana, to work with it towards a solution, we in the EU would do so immediately."
"Mr Solana would go to Cyprus straightaway."
"There is, however, a division of labour and I think we should keep it as long as this is the wish of Kofi Annan."
"Question No 9 by María Izquierdo Rojo (H-0738/02):"
"Subject: Repercussions of enlargement on the least-favoured regions"
"In the light of the most recent Council meetings on the forthcoming EU enlargement and bearing in mind the existing forecasts for agriculture and CAP reform, structural policies, policies on economic and social cohesion and the 'British cheque', can it be deduced that it will be the weakest who will end up paying the bill for enlargement?"
"Will enlargement have a negative impact on the least-favoured regions?"
"Enlargement will have no consequences for the regions in the present Member States until 2006, whereupon a decision will have to be made on the policy in relation to all the regions."
"At its meeting in October, the European Council concluded that EU expenditure must be such as to ensure that the enlarged Union has sufficient resources at its disposal to ensure the orderly development of its policies for the benefit of all its citizens."
"The needs of producers living in the disadvantaged regions of the present European Union should be safeguarded."
"It was added that multifunctional agriculture will be maintained in all areas of Europe, in accordance with the conclusions of the 1997 Luxembourg European Council and the 1999 Berlin European Council."
"In any case, the Community must go on endeavouring to reduce the differences between the various areas' levels of development in accordance with Article 158 of the EC Treaty."
"To contribute to this process, the Brussels European Council decided that, with a view to enlargement, all commitment appropriations must be added to the structural funds and the Cohesion Fund to the tune of EUR 23 000 million in the period 2004-2006."
"The financial consequences of enlargement were reported on in the Presidency's conclusions arising from last Friday's European Council summit in Copenhagen."
"The overall, well-balanced result forms a solid basis for integrating ten new Member States, at the same time as ensuring that the enlarged EU is able to function effectively."
"I would therefore refer you to the conclusions of the summit, showing the economic situation throughout the period."
"I am able to reply neither fully nor otherwise, because enlargement will have no consequences for the regions before 2006, and that is precisely of course because a proper amount of time will be needed to adjust this policy to the new situation that will arise following enlargement."
"I am also able to refer to paragraph 11 of the President's conclusions stating that EU expenditure must continue to respect both the imperative of budgetary discipline and efficient expenditure and the need to ensure that the enlarged EU has sufficient resources at its disposal to ensure the orderly development of its policies for the benefit of all its citizens."
"Moreover, paragraph 12 reads: 'The needs of producers living in the disadvantaged regions of the present European Union should be safeguarded; multifunctional agriculture will be maintained in all areas of Europe, in accordance with the conclusions of the 1997 Luxembourg European Council and the 1999 Berlin European Council.'"
"I cannot be more precise at the present time, but I think that a framework has in this way been set that should reassure the honourable Member, for there is of course no question of any sort of revolution."
"There is no question of a huge amount of money being transferred from the one part of Europe to the other, so I would say, rest assured, there will be enough time to sort things out after 2006."
"As the author is not present, Questions Nos 10 and 11 lapse."
"Question No 12 by Bill Newton Dunn (H-0745/02):"
"Subject: EU-US 'secret agreement' on criminal matters"
"When will the European Parliament, and the Member States' parliaments, be consulted about the arrangements which are currently being negotiated secretly?"
"These arrangements were due to be debated in depth for the first time at Copenhagen on 13 September at the Informal Meeting between EU Justice and Home Affairs ministers with Mr John Ashcroft, US Attorney General."
"These subjects would include the death penalty, extradition, the creation of joint investigative teams, and 'a common approach to searches, seizures, and interceptions of telecommunications'."
"There is really no secret about the fact that negotiations are being conducted between the EU and the United States on cooperation in criminal matters."
"The Council took an open decision to embark upon these negotiations on 20 September 2001 and, following the usual relevant procedure, the Council gave the Presidency a precise negotiating mandate on 25 April of this year."
"It is on this basis that the Presidency conducted negotiations."
"On 28 November 2002, the Council was informed of how far the negotiations concerning a draft had progressed, and due note was taken of this."
"The Council agreed upon the strategy to be followed in subsequent negotiations, and I can tell you that the issue will be on the agenda of the General Affairs Council's meeting tomorrow."
"In accordance with Article 39, paragraph 2 of the Treaty on European Union, the Presidency intends to inform Parliament of the negotiations concerning this matter once the negotiations have reached an advanced enough stage for such information to make sense. It will do so even though Article 24 of the Treaty on European Union does not oblige the Council to consult Parliament."
"With regard to the national parliaments, it is, in accordance with the latter's own rules, the Member States' task to inform or consult them."
"That is all I can say at the present time."
"Mr President, the fact that negotiations are taking place is no secret: that was why I was able to ask the question - we do not disagree on that - but the problem lies in the content."
"It is awfully nice of the Council to tell us that it will inform us afterwards, but we - the only democratic body in the EU - would like to be consulted as it negotiates whether or not it is currently written in the Treaty."
"The principle is real exposure."
"I have a suspicion that the President-in-Office is personally in favour of transparency."
"He should therefore tell us what is really going on."
"I would like to wish the President-in-Office a happy Christmas and say thanks to him for being with us over the last six months, because I have a terrible feeling that we will not see him again."
"Thank you very much for your kind wishes."
"I can assure the honourable Member that, if these contacts with the Americans lead to any sort of legislation or any change in the acquis, all rules will be followed."
"It is quite normal for governments to communicate with each other and if they agree on something that involves the parliaments this will be referred to the parliaments."
"I could provide the honourable Member with written information on what the subjects are but, as stated in the question, they concern the death penalty and it is clear what the European Union's opinion on that is."
"In accordance with the scheduled programme and the time available, we are going to put a final question to Mr Haarder."
"Question No 13 by Paul A.A.J.G. Lannoye (H-0749/02):"
"Subject: Weapons used in Afghanistan"
"At the sitting of the European Parliament on 9 April 2002, the President-in-Office of the Council said that no weapons or munitions containing depleted uranium had been used in the military operations in Afghanistan in the autumn of 2001."
"However, it is clear that guided bombs made of very high density metal were used to destroy Taliban command centres."
"If this high density metal is not uranium, what is it?"
"As far as the Council knows, there is no ammunition of the type referred to in the question and produced in Europe that contains depleted uranium."
"Various types of special steel and/or tungsten including wolfram are used for remote-controlled missiles, but not depleted uranium."
"I can only repeat that, as far as the Council knows, no ammunition of the type concerned, containing depleted uranium, is produced in Europe."
"As the time allotted to questions to the Council has elapsed, Questions Nos 14 to 36 will be replied to in writing."
"European Year of Education through Sport 2004"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we used to learn at school: 'Mens sana in corpore sano' - a healthy mind in a healthy body, and we are, in theory, all acquainted with this wisdom from ancient Rome."
"Of all leisure activities, sport is the most widespread, with one out of every three Europeans participating in some form of it, some of them, indeed, continuing to do so well into old age."
"Physical activity promotes health, and competition in sport develops a range of social skills, such as friendship, team spirit, solidarity, commitment, perseverance and, last but not least, fair play."
"As you will all be aware, you can tell a good sportsman by the way he wins, but a great one by the way he loses."
"Despite sport's essential social role, ladies and gentlemen, there is no policy on it at Community level."
"We have therefore been campaigning in this House for a number of years already, for the legal basis for this to be enshrined in the Treaties."
"We can therefore unreservedly welcome the way the Commissioner has at last responded to the aspiration expressed in my last report on sport, produced as long ago as 1996, and proclaimed a year of sport."
"It is admittedly not being called the Year of Sport, but, for many understandable reasons, the 'Year of Education through Sport 2004'."
"It is about using a large number of projects to highlight sport's role in informal learning and its educational value, and also the close partnership between school sport and the services provided by the many kinds of sporting organisations that exist in Europe."
"To come to the point, the objective and rationale of the 'European Year of Education through Sport 2004' is not to show what people are capable of in the sporting arena - something that we can demonstrate to ourselves to our own satisfaction every day of the year on dozens of television channels - but to show what sport can do in human terms and for people."
"There is consensus in this House as regards the Year's seven objectives."
"It is to promote cooperation between educational institutions and sporting organisations, the development of social skills through sport, voluntary activity, pupils' mobility by means of international competitions, a balance between mental and physical activity, as well as consideration of how the educational needs of young sportsmen and women are to be met."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Council has accepted the essential points of the report passed by this House at First Reading stage."
"What is important is that it has confirmed the amount of funding involved, the EUR 11.5 million that the Commission believes to be sufficient to complete in this Year those things that it has in mind to do."
"If everyone now plays their part - and that includes the media - then this Year can be of truly great significance for sport."
"I very much hope that the trend towards the decreasing importance of school sport can be turned round."
"By means of this Year, we want to build up networks and give an impetus to cross-border cooperation."
"What we do not want is for the small amount of money to be spent on even more interminable research projects."
"Research is always in progress, and that is not what this Year is for."
"I believe that the only research we need is to ask ourselves, when it is all over, 'what has this Year achieved?' but otherwise not to spend money on it."
"The Council shares our view on this."
"It has also accepted my idea of organising a European competition in the run-up to the Olympic Games - incorporating it, not into the Treaty, but into a protocol."
"I am very happy about this, and I very much hope that the Commission will respond to our concern by announcing a competition culminating in its victors being allowed to be present at the lighting of the Olympic flame in Olympia in 2004."
"That would be a fitting climax for the Year of Education through Sport."
"What, ladies and gentlemen, is all this about?"
"It is our intention to establish a platform for educational measures in sport above and beyond frontiers, institutions of state education and organisations."
"We want to kick-start cross-border initiatives and networks, and we have to set up an ideas exchange, enabling exemplary projects and initiatives - that is to say best practices - to be followed by as many as possible during the preparations in 2003 and the actual Year in 2004."
"The Community projects instrument will receive 80% support, and those things done at national level alone will receive 50% co-financing."
"This seems to me to be very well suited to putting this Year's European dimension centre-stage."
"I think I will leave it at that, but would like to thank the Council and the Commission and express the hope that we will all be able to take the idea of this Year of Education through Sport back to our communities, and that, eventually, the Convention will be astute enough to give sport a legal basis."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I have an announcement to make to you, which has to do with the tragic accident to the oil tanker Prestige, which foundered off the coast of Galicia, and the final conclusions newly adopted by the Council in Copenhagen."
"I have received from the Commission a proposal, relating to these events, for a regulation instituting specific measures to compensate the Spanish fisheries, shellfish industry and aquaculture affected by the oil spills from the Prestige."
"In view of the circumstances of extreme urgency and the grave effects involved, the Council will do everything in its power to ensure that this proposal is adopted without delay and, if possible, during the Council meeting that is currently in progress."
"Parliament should deliver the opinion required of it as soon as possible."
"The proposal has been agreed with the Committee on Fisheries, and I propose that we should change the agenda in such a way that we can vote on this proposal at midday today."
"As there are no objections to this proposal, that is how we shall proceed."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I often have had the pleasure of speaking in this House, but I have to say that today is a special occasion and I share with you the feeling that what we are doing here is of great significance."
"I would even go so far as to say that it is almost a historic moment for the young people of our countries."
"Indeed, you are about to adopt the decision to make 2004 the European Year of Education through Sport."
"This is the first time that such a large-scale initiative has been launched at Community level in the field of sport, particularly one focusing on its educational value."
"It is also the first time that such a clear message has been sent to our citizens, showing them that the Community institutions will henceforth be concerning themselves with the social and educational potential of sport and its fundamental role in informal education."
"It was right that the recognition of this value should take place in the European Parliament, for it is the European Parliament which has been calling for years for more focus on sport."
"Within the framework of the European Year, resources, good intentions and imagination will be mobilised throughout an entire year to promote a policy, to promote an approach, to enable civil society to participate."
"I am sure that a European Year of Education through Sport can make a decisive contribution to the promotion of the ideals we share, the ideal of sport as having an educational role and as a means of imparting values."
"Today, therefore, the decision that you are about to adopt with your vote is good news for the worlds of education and sport."
"It is also the formalisation of the astute work carried out together by Parliament, the Commission and the Council."
"Our spirit of partnership, our faultless cooperation and our consensus on the text mean that, today, if this were an Olympic competition, we would have to share the gold medal."
"All this means that everything is now in order and we can therefore move on and start the practical work, for the discussions have progressed quickly and well."
"There has been no need for red cards to be given out, to use a football metaphor, which is clear evidence that our joint effort has been carried out in a spirit of sincere friendship."
"Moreover, the European Parliament has played its part fully: our original text has been amended and altered and the result - I am not ashamed to admit - is an improvement on the Commission's text."
"Ladies and gentlemen, you emphasised the need to carry through practical measures relating to basic sport."
"You placed the emphasis on projects in the field rather than on reports and studies."
"You highlighted the need for a partnership between sports organisations and education organisations."
"Lastly, you clarified the objectives of our Year of Education through Sport and you pointed out the need to respect the principle of subsidiarity and the respective competences."
"All these demands have been taken into account and included in the final decision."
"At its last meetings, the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport deemed that the Council's common position gave due consideration to Parliament's main concerns, and I believe that is the case."
"I have noticed, during my travels throughout Europe and my conversations and meetings how popular this new initiative is already and how high the expectations are of our citizens, in our schools, in sports organisations and public authorities."
"I am therefore quite convinced, ladies and gentlemen, that this European Year of Education through Sport will be a great Year."
"If, by way of example, we consider the European Year of Languages and the way it developed through the contributions of the citizens, I am sure that, run along the same lines, the European Year of Sport will be even more effective and have an even greater effect on our different societies."
"Some days ago, in Vienna, at a conference on the subject of Europe and ethics, President Prodi said: 'Europe ? needs ideas and a soul'."
"Our work on the value of sport, on social and educational sport, will help to bring this about."
"I am delighted to say that education and sport are at the centre of everyone's daily concerns."
"The only thing we have to do, and we will succeed in this, is to promote the positive aspects of sport over the negative tendencies."
"On a practical level, I can now tell you that my staff have already been working on the calls for proposals which need to be launched in the coming months."
"We are already thinking about a schedule, events and setting up an advisory committee."
"I must admit that, as you can see, this vote is not the final whistle marking the end of an impeccably played political game."
"Rather, it is the starting pistol."
"Of course, Parliament will be regularly informed of the progress made on the European Year."
"The Commission does, of course, have a formal obligation to keep Parliament informed, but this will also give me the opportunity to hear your ideas, for you have made such a useful contribution to the initial development of the idea of the Year."
"Mr President, I spoke just now of the historic vote on education through sport."
"The year 2004, as everyone knows, will be a historic year in many other respects too: enlargement, then the Convention and many other major events."
"In this connection, I would like to ask you to reflect on the following questions."
"In a Europe which wants to be close to the citizens, can we continue to see sport just as a commercial activity?"
"Should we not take notice of the fact that sport has pride of place in the citizens' daily lives?"
"Is sport not an important part of any citizenship policy?"
"Mr President, I know that Parliament has started to discuss these questions and that you are already aware of the role played by sport in European integration and in awakening a European spirit in our fellow citizens."
"In a similar way, the sporting values that we are going to promote vigorously among the younger generations and citizens of Europe will be the basis for active citizenship in which there is respect for others and respect for the European ideal."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur on the hard work she has done and to say once again that sport has shown itself to be a very effective tool in education."
"Both in normal situations and in extreme situations, in marginalized areas, when there is a need for integration, amongst many others."
"Furthermore, it is a great tool for educating on issues such as the environment, food, health, teamwork etc. We should take the greatest possible advantage of this."
"We must take advantage of the fact that 2004 is the European Year of Education through Sport in order to demonstrate to the Europeans that we in the European Union are also concerned about sport and that we attach much importance, for example - since I do not want to give an interminable list - on the benefits which it brings for health, for the integration of people in our Europe and for the fight against xenophobia."
"We must also take advantage of the possible impact of 2004 to demonstrate that it is entirely compatible to work for sport in the 15 Member States - or 25, when enlargement takes place - and also at Community level, at the same time, and that they must not fear that we are going to take over their competences."
"What we do want is to fill the vacuum left by subsidiarity so that the Europeans can benefit from the numerous positive aspects of sport."
"I therefore ask that we all make an additional effort so that, in the next review of the Treaty on European Union, an article relating to sport may be included, once and for all, so that the Europeans may see that here, in the European Parliament, in the European Commission and in all the European institutions, we care about sport as an essential tool for improving their quality of life."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I am glad that sport has been put on the agenda for today without, as is so often the case, having to be deferred until the evening."
"I see it as a good start that we are able, today, to discuss it during the day."
"I am glad that 2004 will be so fully devoted to sport."
"The Olympic Games, the Paralympics, the European Cup in football, to name but a few, will draw the attention of millions of people, filling many of them with enthusiasm, disappointing others, but also prompting people to themselves get involved or step up their involvement."
"The European Year of Education through Sport can make use of this public interest in order to highlight the social value of sport."
"There is already evidence, provided by numerous studies, of sport's educational value, of its capacity for preventing ill-health and rehabilitating after illness, of the social skills that it imparts to young people and the elderly, and of much else that has already been mentioned."
"So I welcome the fact that we will be producing no more new studies, but will be gathering new insights from practical experience of the Year of Sport's extension of activities such as the encouragement of cooperation between schools and sporting organisations."
"That is of great importance in bringing the two together and maximising the advantages to both in terms of the mobility of pupils, clubs and officials, and also supporting sport in performing its social functions and discharging its social obligations."
"For me, however, it all keeps coming back to the importance of asking what we mean by fair play, which is inseparable from sport."
"I believe that racism, doping, and the treatment of sportswomen and sportsmen as commodities have left deep scars on the image of fair play."
"In the same way, we should be treating women in sport with a new respect, and doing something about their status in this area too."
"That is also underlined by our call for clubs to be involved in the Year of Education through Sport - something not called for in the first proposals."
"There are 600 000 sports clubs, with thousands of officials, and they make a very important and essential educational contribution that we can never dispense with."
"Ladies and gentlemen, 2003, the Year of People with Disabilities, is almost upon us."
"I believe that here too we have to make use of this issue as an early preparation for 2004, asking even now how many opportunities disabled sportswomen and sportsmen have to integrate?"
"What activities can the sports clubs - all 600 000 and more of them - offer these people?"
"This is where there is a need for public awareness and also for financial support."
"All this underscores our demand for this to be incorporated into the Treaty."
"I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on this important report."
"Parliament has been pressing us for a European year of sport in previous resolutions, the last of which was in 1997."
"Up to now, the European Union has primarily paid attention to professional sport and much less to recreational sport and its cultural, educational and social merits."
"As has rightly been said, this is probably and primarily due to the fact that the Treaty still contains no articles giving the European Union explicit powers in this area."
"Yet in view of the fact that a third of EU citizens actively participate in sports and that there are more than 600 000 sports clubs, sport is undeniably an important social phenomenon."
"Sport is not only important on a social and cultural level but on a financial one as well."
"According to estimates, the sector accounts for about 2% of the European Union's total gross domestic product."
"Sport is of great significance as a disseminator of positive values such as willpower, courage, tolerance, loyalty and friendship."
"In view of its enormous impact, however, sport is also often approached negatively with feelings of chauvinism, racism and violence, and it unfortunately also gets negative publicity as a result of violence, corruption or hooliganism."
"In this European Year the spotlight will be on sports education and training for young people, and this is therefore something to be celebrated."
"It is also true to say that less and less time and attention is devoted to sports education at school, a trend that urgently needs to be reversed."
"This is where sports clubs can play a complementary, supporting role for schools."
"It is therefore essential to improve links between clubs and schools."
"Sport should primarily be creating a physical and mental balance as well as social integration, and, as we are heading for enlargement in 2004, this is more than important, particularly at a time when intolerance is increasingly raising its ugly head."
"Mr President, I commend the rapporteur and welcome this excellent initiative."
"Apart from being an important social phenomenon and a way to improve psychological and physical health, sport is also an excellent educational instrument which helps young people acquire important social skills."
"That is why I strongly and warmly welcome the celebration of the European Year of Education through Sport 2004."
"I am most looking forward to seeing the positive impact that sport will have on the lives of young people from disadvantaged communities as a result of this programme."
"It will present sport as a way of improving the social inclusion of these groups and communities."
"Nevertheless, I regret that both the Council and the Commission rejected Parliament's amendments providing for the organisation of school competitions which would have allowed winning schools to attend the next Olympic Games in Greece."
"That said, however, I welcome the Council's recognition of the will of Parliament on this issue."
"Mr President, the value of sport as a tool to promote national identity and further integration has long been recognised."
"Not for nothing have both democratic and totalitarian governments used taxpayers' funds on sporting activities."
"In terms of the construction of Europe, the role of sport was formally recognised by the Communities in the Adonino report presented to the Milan European Council in June 1985."
"There can be no question that this issue was seen as a major asset, enabling the Communities to foster active engagement of the citizens of Europe in the construction of that project."
"Therefore, whatever the fine rhetoric that might flow from this House, the true aim of this particular European Year is to promote further European integration."
"In other words, this is naked propaganda."
"It is not a coincidence that the Year has been declared to coincide with the Olympic Games."
"Members of this House may think otherwise, but this is a cynical attempt to hijack the Games in order to promote the European agenda."
"It is therefore outrageous that European taxpayers' money is to be spent on this project."
"The sum of EUR 11.5 million may be a small amount in the grander scheme of things, but it is still a lot of money."
"There is no justification."
"We are not here to finance such naked and cynical propaganda."
"Mr President, I feel that the presence in this Chamber, among the many esteemed Members, of a number of people whom we remember as sporting champions of history, immediately makes the meaning of what we wanted to convey in cooperating with Mrs Pack on this report clear."
"Our dear friends, Mrs Zabell, Mrs Matikainen-Kallström and Mr Mennea, are in some way an example, evidence of the simple fact that educating people through sport means producing a generation which knows the value of things as well as the price."
"Precisely because it understands their value, it is able to display a great passion for social values when it matures, displaying a strength and commitment which are not limited to the quest for results at all costs, and that is why these Members are fully entitled to sit in this Chamber and are worthy representatives of the European Union."
"Our intention is to convey this concept and these values in a debate which embraces the education systems too."
"At the moment, if there is any severe criticism in our report, it is criticism of the European education systems, which are devoting increasingly less time to the playing of sport in schools and under which there are an ever-increasing number of schools with dilapidated sports facilities."
"These must receive support and assistance. This is one reason for the rapporteur's concern to approach the matter in a practical way, promoting a practical debate on the educational potential of sport through the staging of the competitions."
"In other words, I believe that the European Year of Education through Sport may be the right stimulus to get schools to do something for the European youth of tomorrow, to change the fate of a generation, so that, in the future, we have different young people who not only become champions but, more importantly, become people who see sport as a path to truth, in other words who become champions of humanity, for a champion of humanity can become a sporting champion too."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the main effect of sport on those who participate in it is the promotion of physical and mental health, as well as education in tolerance, respect for rules and acceptance of a result by everybody."
"These rules are profoundly democratic and promote dialogue and companionship."
"In this world where single, absolute and reductionist thinking is dominant, the promotion of the values of sport is the key antidote to intolerance and xenophobia and favours social integration."
"Educating through sport means ensuring democratic values for future generations and this must appear in the Treaties."
"Mr President, I want to thank my colleague, Mrs Doris Pack, for the valuable work she has done in producing this report."
"You have done some really excellent work for many years now to promote sport and physical education."
"It has been a genuine pleasure to work with you."
"It is excellent that the Commission should have begun to organise a Year of Sport."
"The positive role of physical exercise as a basis for mental and physical well-being is now becoming common knowledge throughout Europe."
"Leaving aside for a moment the benefits of having a regular, wide-ranging hobby and an attitude to life that goes with it, even a little exercise prevents heart and vascular diseases, ailments that affect the organs of locomotion, rheumatic illnesses and mental health problems."
"The very fact that exercise is able to prevent mental problems often gets little attention."
"Exercise can help keep a nation's major economic problems in check."
"An enormous amount of lost working time could have been prevented through exercise."
"Seen in this light, the budget of EUR 11.5 million granted for the Year is at least not oversized."
"Schools in many Member States organise important optional activities after the school day has officially finished."
"Resources to make these afternoon activities possible must be increased considerably, as there is a huge demand for what they can provide."
"Afternoon clubs organised voluntarily often do valuable work."
"Afternoon sports programmes help children satisfy their natural desire and need for exercise."
"At the same time, they are doing something meaningful and social problems and exclusion are being prevented."
"Why can we not talk of sport as sport?"
"It is ridiculous that sports projects in the legal basis have to be hidden away under other articles, as there is not one for sport."
"It is better to call things by their own name, both now and in future."
"Mr President, I will be very brief, because I know that time is flying by and that you have a very full agenda."
"I would like to add my congratulations to those of all the Members who have highlighted Mrs Pack's remarkable work and her vigorous, tenacious endeavours over many years, which have, at last, brought success."
"Today one might say, her baby is being taken to church to be baptised."
"I would like to respond briefly to a number of specific questions which have been asked."
"Although it has not been possible to include in the text Parliament's suggestion that schools competitions could be staged and that winners could be present at the ceremony of the lighting of the Olympic flame in Olympia, I can let you into a secret."
"My co-workers are already working with the International School Sport Federation to see what can be done to accommodate Parliament's request."
"I am fully aware, Mr President, that Parliament does not want an avalanche of studies on the matter."
"That is all well and good, provided that it does not turn round afterwards and say that studies would have been useful after all."
"While I acknowledge the need for practical work, I still feel that it is necessary for an evaluation to be carried out afterwards, as, moreover, happened in the case of the European Year of Languages, which was such a success that I feel we can use it as a model in terms of what to do and what not to do."
"I can let you into another secret. I have already received numerous requests from the major European sports federations, who want to contribute to or participate in the project or to work with us."
"They all want to be involved and to make their contribution to the enterprise."
"They will not ask us for money, for they have much more money than we have!"
"The EUR 11.5 million budget is intended to encourage, to set in motion a driving force, for it is civil society, sportspeople and schools which will actually do the practical work."
"A number of questions have been asked relating to the European Year of People with Disabilities, on which we are actively working. The Special World Olympics will take place in summer 2003 in Dublin."
"In this context, we will fund the hiring of Irish volunteers to make this major sporting festival for people with disabilities possible."
"This is an experiment which will be repeated throughout 2003 and 2004: getting young volunteers - 100, 200, 300 volunteers - from all the countries of Europe to work together in the service of sport during major events of great symbolic importance."
"The first experiment, in Dublin, will thus bring together 200 volunteers from all over Europe."
"This will be repeated in Athens for both the Olympic Games and the Paralympics, and for all the major sporting events where the voluntary contributions, good will and idealism of our young people can come into their own."
"In other words, our young people will take centre stage."
"You can therefore see that practical measures are currently being taken."
"As I promised you, you will be kept informed of developments, and I am also counting on your contribution so that we can make this year the year of all the citizens in your regions and your countries, for, as representatives of the citizens, you have a major role to play in this sense."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m."
"The next item is the Commission statement on services of general interest in Europe."
"Mr President, the issue of public services is the subject of a major debate in Europe and elsewhere, and the general trend observed during the past 20 years has been a development of the role of the public authority, which no longer produces directly but regulates and establishes the rules for the game."
"This is the case in Europe, in particular, where the goal - which was also a necessity - of creating a single market has certainly facilitated this development."
"Experience has shown that the creation of a single market based on the system of healthy competition is fully compatible with socioeconomic concerns, of which services of general interest are one of the most practical elements."
"Furthermore, a higher level of competition throughout the economy has led to an increase in the effectiveness of services of general interest."
"The history of the Community has always been consistent."
"At each new stage in European integration, progress has been made towards both freer movement of goods, persons, services and capital and greater inclusiveness and cohesion."
"Each step forward in the area of the internal market has gone hand in hand with the introduction of measures to ensure that the weaker regions and citizens are not left lagging behind."
"This was the case as regards the Single Act and the case at Maastricht and Amsterdam too."
"One example is the inclusion in the Treaty of the policy of economic and social cohesion, of consumer protection and of environment policy, all of which are intended to complement and balance the strategies of opening up the markets and liberalisation."
"Article 16 of the Treaty, introduced at Amsterdam, explicitly recognises the role of services of economic general interest."
"It confirms the need to find a better way of reconciling harmoniously and coherently the principles relating to services of general interest and the other objectives of the Treaty, particularly the internal market and free competition."
"The Commission has always recognised the primordial role of services of general interest."
"In its 1996 communication on services of general interest in Europe, it proposed a reference to the promotion of these services."
"The sectoral legislation adopted at Community level relating to major network industries, particularly the energy sector, contains extremely ambitious goals as regards high quality public services."
"Moreover, the Commission has always applied competition and market rules in such a way as to avoid the supply and development of high quality services of general interest being hindered."
"I could mention by way of example the communication on public broadcasting, introducing rules on state aid, which was drawn up by Mr Monti and myself last year and which is an example of the way we can apply competition rules intelligently while giving governments all the leeway they need to organise public services properly."
"Services of general interest are thus an essential component of the European model of society."
"They contribute to the citizens' quality of life and are an essential condition if the citizens are to be able to exercise many of their rights fully."
"In its report to the Laeken Council, the Commission declared its intention, and I quote: 'to examine the suggestion to consolidate and specify the principles on services of general interest underlying Article 16 of the Treaty in a framework directive'"
"The Commission decided to carry out this examination within the framework of a Green Paper."
"There are two main reasons why it has adopted this approach."
"Firstly, the questions raised are very broad in scope and cannot be addressed in a debate limited to a proposal for a framework directive."
"Secondly, given the expectations and existence of very different positions with regard to the feasibility of a framework directive and the added value it would represent, it appeared essential to establish a reference framework first."
"We must not underestimate the technical and conceptual problems which would certainly be raised by the establishment of a framework directive either."
"The Green Paper will allow the Commission firstly to examine whether a framework directive would be appropriate and secondly to launch a large-scale debate on the overall issue."
"Therefore, the purpose of this Green Paper is not to delay the feasibility study on a framework directive."
"Quite the opposite: given the diversity of the traditions, structures and positions existing in the Member States, only a broad European-level debate will be able to draw out enough common ground for an overall Community framework to be established."
"In addition, alongside the preparation of the Green Paper, we are working on other dossiers, particularly in the area of the application of rules on state aid and in the field of the evaluation of services."
"This work could, moreover, be a useful contribution to the Green Paper."
"As regards the timetable, the Green Paper should be adopted in March 2003 and the conclusions drawn before the end of the year."
"This, Mr President, is the Commission's statement on this matter."
"Mr President, Commissioner Reding's task today is a difficult one, to make a statement on the Commission's behalf on action that the Commission has been putting off for a year."
"It is the case that, thirteen months ago, Parliament delivered its opinion on services of general interest by a well-supported vote, with 435 votes being cast in the final vote."
"Since then, the Commission has done little."
"It has submitted four documents."
"The latter two of these, submitted before the Copenhagen Summit, just as the submission of the others six months ago preceded that in Seville, say nothing more than that rulings are awaited from the European Court of Justice."
"I do not at all understand, Commissioner, why the Commission does not have its proposals debated here in Parliament, openly and with no holds barred."
"If, as in this case, you gaze fixedly at the European Court of Justice in the same way that a rabbit gazes fixedly at a snake, you are not acting as if all options were available to you."
"Although, Commissioner, you are affected by this only tangentially, this being primarily a matter for the Competition Commissioner, it is for this reason that I really do want to insist with some emphasis that the Commission should not just hand out 'non-papers' that it sends to governments - the last was on 12 November this year - but should involve Parliament in this debate."
"We are not prepared to take the rap for whatever decisions the Commission comes up with if Parliament cannot be properly involved in the legislative process."
"So let me say quite bluntly that, as you have already mentioned, we called for a framework directive."
"We called for a framework directive on the basis of Article 95, which deals with the internal market."
"That means that this public debate on the basis of Article 95 leads to a decision by Parliament and the Council by way of the codecision procedure."
"What has been submitted to us so far says only that previous procedure in competition policy was being followed, in other words, that a decision by the Council would be sufficient, that Parliament would be informed and should then see what happens next."
"It is exactly as you have said: the topic will give rise to a great debate on social and economic policy."
"Far from being something that the Commission can sort out with the Council behind closed doors, that must be done in public view, here in the directly-elected Parliament."
"The reason why I make these somewhat pointed observations is that these issues are dealt with in none of these documents, which are numerous and of varying quality, the non-paper being far and away the best of those that have been submitted."
"The evaluation methodology set out in the summer was put together so carelessly, and was of such poor quality, that it cannot serve as a basis on which to raise proper awareness."
"I call on the Commission to stop biding its time and do the business at long last!"
"The European Court of Justice's ruling in the Ferring case is a workable basis on which to evaluate state aid and public services."
"I call upon you to be prompt in submitting decisions based on it and to delay no longer."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would naturally like to thank the Commissioner for her announcement and for the prospect of a Green Paper."
"However, I do not often find myself in complete agreement with what Mr Langen has said."
"My group is particularly disappointed with the Commission's reluctance to proceed with presenting the European Parliament with a framework directive."
"As you yourself said, services of general interest are the cornerstone of our European social model."
"I am talking about people's social rights, basic facilities such as water, energy, public transport, communication and healthcare, which are furthermore essential for social cohesion and for the proper functioning of our economies."
"My group, and in fact the whole of Parliament, has been pressing for this framework directive for years."
"Even the Council is ahead of the Commission, as the Council pressed for this framework directive in Nice and then much more explicitly in Barcelona."
"Despite this, the Commission insists on broad consultation first via a Green Paper in the spring of 2003."
"I understand that the problems surrounding services of general interest are complex."
"I understand the differences in approach between the Member States."
"I know that there are public and private players involved, and it is therefore true that there are differences depending on the sector."
"However, in the meantime we are constantly being confronted with standpoints concerning the liberalisation of various sectors in the economy without having a framework directive that sets out the general principles."
"Let there be no misunderstanding: my group is in favour of the internal market, subject to certain social and ecological adjustments."
"However, the market is an instrument, and the market has its limits, and when it comes to people's basic social rights, it is not the rules of the market and competition that should be laying down the rules of play."
"The Green Paper will furthermore arrive too late to contribute to the discussion in the Convention about the role of services of general interest."
"We are already holding this discussion at this moment. We will be completing it in February, and the Commission will not be presenting a Green Paper until March."
"I think that the Commission will be missing the boat."
"Finally, there is one last reason, one fact that causes me great concern, and that has to do with Mr Langen's comments."
"So far the Commission has always assumed that Member States were allowed to finance their services of general interest as a social mandate without this being regarded as illicit state support - and rightly so, in my opinion."
"However, the Treaty is undeniably lacking in clarity."
"Recent conclusions by two advocates-general at the European Court of Justice have demonstrated that this principle is no longer above suspicion."
"The Commission will now obviously conclude that they cannot give legal security to Member States in the area of the financing of services of general interest."
"So what has happened to this much-vaunted autonomy to organise their own public services?"
"Ladies and gentlemen, the conclusion is clear to us."
"Firstly, we will immediately ask the Commission to issue a framework directive, as we have repeatedly done."
"Secondly, the Convention must provide the opportunity to establish the basic principles of public services with complete respect for the powers of the Member States."
"Thirdly, our constitution must clearly specify that services of general interest are our people's social rights and must not be left to market rules and competition."
"I hope that the Commission can support us in our ambitions."
"Mr President, I was going to say on behalf of my group that we are pleased to see that a Green Paper is forthcoming, but perhaps I am in the minority in saying that I am pleased to see that a Green Paper is forthcoming in the sense that something is actually happening."
"The promise of future consultation and feasibility studies is to be welcomed, but this should not be an excuse for doing nothing."
"In that sense I agree with my colleagues that something has to happen sooner rather than later."
"Process can be important, and we must get that right."
"I would like to make two points on behalf of my group, the first relating to competition."
"Competition is excellent - we agree with the internal market - in that it is a way of raising standards generally and can also be a way of raising standards in the services concerned, but not for its own sake."
"Perhaps it would be interesting to look at a country outside the EU - Switzerland - in terms of energy policy."
"Recently the Swiss had a referendum to ascertain whether they should liberalise their energy provision, presently provided by their local cantons."
"Swiss citizens voted against this because they were not satisfied that choice in that sense would raise standards - it might just prove confusing."
"That question was put to the citizens of Switzerland."
"We, on the other hand, are waiting for a framework to establish how we should introduce such choices across Europe."
"The second issue of particular importance to my group is universal services provision."
"This guarantees social cohesion across Europe."
"Taking my own constituency, for instance, and the current issue of broadband, letters are flooding into my office from constituents in rural areas who complain that broadband is available in certain cities, but not for them."
"Such matters have to be resolved so that we can provide the same level of service to all our citizens and therefore guarantee the social cohesion which is so important to Europe."
"It is ridiculous that the Convention and its working groups are currently discussing these issues."
"These matters call for coordination as we move forward with the development of Europe."
"So it is good that something is actually happening, it is good that there has been a statement, but let us get on with it."
"Mr President, I welcome the fact that we are debating services of general interest once again, on the occasion of the Commission's statement."
"I believe that services of general interest are at the heart of European integration, or rather that they ought to be."
"Although their place and role in the Union are indeed recognised, in principle, in Article 16 of the Treaty, they are still subject to competition rules, with all the ensuing consequences."
"There has been growing pressure for faster liberalisation in many sectors."
"The Brussels European Summit, last March, was a decisive moment in this sense, moreover."
"Energy, transport, a new era for the postal services sector: the recurring argument is that liberalisation would be the solution to the need to modernise these services."
"This is not true, as we can see from numerous examples."
"I believe that one of the functions of services of general interest is to ensure social and territorial cohesion."
"They must guarantee access to high quality services for all citizens throughout the whole of the territory and at the same price."
"However, the rules of profitability and the principle of competition run counter to these objectives and these functions."
"The citizens' needs as regards high quality European public services are currently being expressed in many Union countries."
"The drawing-up of common European rules allowing harmonisation from the top downwards has become a necessity, particularly in view of enlargement."
"The modernisation of services of general interest must be part of a measure not seeking to open up the market to competition but intended to respond to the needs expressed."
"That requires genuine democratisation and the genuine participation of workers and users in the development of these services."
"In this connection, the European Union has a particular responsibility."
"It must, first of all, allow a proper evaluation to be carried out of the different liberalisation processes, country by country."
"Despite calls from the European Parliament on a number of occasions, this evaluation of the consequences for safety, the environment, quality and social concerns has never been carried out."
"Why?"
"I too believe that we cannot wait for a Green Paper to be drawn up in a few months' time to address this issue, however useful a Green Paper might be."
"Although a Green Paper might serve some purpose, I feel that services of general interest should no longer be seen as an exception to competition as they have been hitherto but, quite the opposite, that they must be seen as one of the European Union's priority responsibilities."
"They must therefore no longer be subject to competition."
"Work is being carried out on a new Treaty within the framework of the work of the Convention with a view to the 2004 Intergovernmental Conference."
"We must address this issue in the debate on the Treaty."
"It is time to listen to the demands of the citizens, of the trade unions, which are demonstrating everywhere in a plea for high quality services."
"These demands go hand in hand with the need for a Europe of social progress, a more democratic Europe."
"That is why we cannot be content with a minimal definition of a European universal service."
"We must be ambitious for social Europe."
"We must place services of general interest at the centre of European integration and European citizenship."
"Commissioner, I am quite surprised to hear you say that it has been proven for 20 years that the single market governed by competition law is perfectly - as you said - compatible with social objectives."
"I have already heard more sense from the Commission, when it started to express a doubt precisely as to this ability of competition law to bring about the achievement of all the social and environmental objectives."
"I believe that, in actual fact, we, and the Commission, in particular, would find it much easier to make these self-congratulatory statements if we had an evaluation, as my fellow Members have said."
"I feel that there is absolutely nothing to be gained in any quarter by underestimating the huge expectations of the European citizens, who are demanding more services, better quality and a higher level of safety."
"I believe that, if we were to turn a deaf ear to the doubts being expressed today regarding the continuity and sustainability of these services, particularly since they have been called into question as a result of disasters and particularly since this deterioration is currently evident in a number of public services, we would be severely jeopardising the future of Europe and the result of the decision that its citizens will have to take on the future Constitution."
"You have decided to open a broad consultation process on the Green Paper."
"It is true that this initiative is very surprising, given its connection with the - extremely problematic - debates that we wish to hold within the Convention with a view to fully enshrining the right to public service in the future European Constitution."
"I would therefore like to hear you speak about the organisation of the agendas, for it would appear quite incredible that a debate should be opened on the feasibility or usefulness of a framework directive under the current Treaties, even if the aim of the debate is to achieve the recognition of and basis for a European approach to public services in the future Treaty."
"Moreover, as regards the consultation procedure, we have already been sufficiently traumatised by a number of proposals which were clearly going against a whole range of different interests within European society."
"I would like the Commission to explain clearly which public method of hearing will be used to enable the different players - users, trade unions, NGOs, local and regional authorities etc. to make themselves heard during this consultation on the Green Paper."
"Mr President, Commissioner, as regards services of general interest, the Commission is attempting to reconcile two requirements which are, in a number of respects, opposed: the need to guarantee the provision of certain services which the market is considered not to be able to provide efficiently and at affordable prices, and the need to prevent certain services becoming a source of distortion of the market or distortion of competition."
"I believe that the Commission's concern continues to focus too heavily on the first point and too little on the second, the distortion of competition."
"This is not surprising, because the governments, and, therefore, the Council, are pushing in this direction because of the existence of a clear conflict of interests."
"There are key sectors, such as the telecommunications, energy, water, transport, television and media sectors, in which the governments are both referees and players, they have to juggle with a burdensome conflict of interests, they are not regulators and legislators, they themselves are entrepreneurs with large multinational businesses which are sometimes used for political and other ends."
"Today, this conflict of interests has yet to be resolved in many European countries."
"Indeed, in these sectors, a no-man's-land is being created where, rather than the good of the European consumer and the general interest, the specific interests of companies and of the economic and political potentates associated with them are being pursued."
"There are countless cases of the allocation of inappropriate market spaces to such companies."
"One example is Deutsche Post, which uses its monopolist's profit in the postal services sector to overcome competition through take-overs too, as happened in the case of DHL International, which Deutsche Post acquired, exploiting its monopolist's profit to knock a competitor out of the market."
"Not to mention EDF: France agreed to work towards opening up its energy sector within the country, in the sure knowledge that EDF, which was 100% state-owned and not quoted on the Stock Exchange and which could give loans guaranteed by the state, would acquire companies abroad, in Italy and elsewhere, in other words that it would go shopping, consolidating a dominant position in the European market."
"Then, in Italy, there is the case of a major television company such as the RAI, financed with huge sums of taxpayers' money, which competes in every way with other television companies as a commercial channel."
"This is the situation: there are public services which ultimately create state companies that distort competition."
"When the states have freed themselves from all the companies, it might be easier to imagine a regulatory state, a state which contracts out or puts out to tender services which it considers that the market alone cannot provide adequately."
"I would like to make one last point, Mr President, Commissioner."
"There is a service, the mobile telephone service, which the Commission does not deem to be a service of general interest."
"I feel that this is a serious mistake and that, now, the mobile telephone service is to all intents and purposes a service of general interest."
"Indeed, it is one of the services which is provided most effectively throughout Europe, extremely efficiently and with optimum prices, and it is a service of general interest which the market provides through a system of competition."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies, gentlemen, and our erstwhile lady colleague, I believe that any framework directive or Green Paper should take into account our previous experience with services of general interest."
"That being so, I want to give an example of how we in this House can bring some influence to bear."
"If we were actually to manage to at last make some progress with the legislation on local public transport, we would have done a substantial chunk of Parliament's and the Council's work."
"Here, for once, I would like to give the Commission credit for submitting a very specific proposal for a regulation on local public transport as long ago as 2000."
"We in this House delivered an unambiguous opinion on it in 2001."
"And what is the Council doing?"
"It has shoved the draft in a drawer, done nothing with it, and still does not want to do anything with it."
"I believe that we have to make it clear to the Council that we will not put up with further delays on matters as fundamental as the right range of services provided to people in towns and in the regions, but may well have to consider bringing proceedings against the Council in respect of its failure to act."
"Why, ladies and gentlemen, is this issue of legislation on local public transport so important?"
"The law on the situation we are in is unclear."
"We have the option of awaiting rulings from the ECJ, but we want the decisions on what public transport systems should be like to be taken politically, and so we, the towns, the communities and private enterprise, need legal certainty as to how local public transport is to be organised."
"The second point I want to address is as follows. I believe that a slip of the tongue has crept in here."
"Services of general interest and competition are not mutually exclusive, but are, in my view, mutually complementary, something that we see particularly clearly in local public transport."
"If, in the exercise of its responsibilities for public services, the city or the region makes the right decision and defines what is required of local public transport - its accessibility to disabled people, the timetables, the intervals between services and the fares; you can add all the social factors you want - then, Mr President, it must be put out to tender, and then the best offer must be accepted, whether it be from the public or private sector."
"It is competition that decides, and the public that benefits."
"Mr President, I am deeply disappointed by the Commission's statement here today."
"We have had more lip service to the principle of services of general interest."
"We were told that the Commission was going to produce a framework for services of general interest before the end of this year, now we get a promise of a Green Paper."
"We urgently need the framework directive, not a Green Paper."
"We urgently need a change in competition law which enables services of general interest, public services, to survive and to prosper, and we need a clause in our new constitution which guarantees public services right across Europe."
"Solidarity and citizenship are at the heart of the whole notion of the European Union."
"I would argue that, having taken a major step this week towards the political and geographical unity of Europe, if we are to create European citizens, we must have services of general interest universally available, accessible, affordable and of high quality."
"Properly understood, services of general interest are for all citizens, not just for those who are excluded, or poor or indeed disadvantaged - though obviously they are of key importance to people in that situation."
"Services of general interest support and sustain growth."
"They sustain environmental sustainability."
"They are a key component of any serious spatial strategy which will enable us to have sustainable rural communities and indeed liveable cities."
"They will provide us with healthy citizens who do not fear illness."
"They will enable citizens to commute and to communicate."
"They will enable citizens to be well-informed, to be well-educated, not only in terms of technological education, but also politically literate."
"All of these things are necessary if we are to create a Europe of which we can be proud and which citizens will feel they own."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, far too late though it is, I of course welcome the Commission's statement of its intention to submit a Green Paper on services of general interest in the first quarter of 2003."
"It does, however, strike me as incomprehensible that the final conclusions and specific initiatives associated with it are to appear as long as six months later."
"Analyses and the demands for action resulting from them belong together."
"Having been called upon to do so by the Barcelona Council in March 2002, the Commission, in June of that year, adopted a new methodology for evaluating the quality of public services."
"You will be well aware that opinions on this are sharply divided, and I am telling you now that, in terms of its quality, this new evaluation methodology is an unmitigated disaster."
"In view of the invariable tendency of the debate on public services to bring forth ritual repetitions about deregulation and privatisation, it would at least be proper to conduct, in parallel with the Green Paper, a scientifically sound analysis of the situation in those markets and enterprises that have already been deregulated and privatised."
"There are marked distinctions to be drawn between the successes and failures in the various lines of business involved."
"The questions that demand answers are, firstly, whether equal rights of access are guaranteed to all citizens of the European Union, irrespective of where they live or of their levels of income."
"Secondly: has the cost of the service increased or fallen?"
"Thirdly: has its quality improved or got worse?"
"And fourthly: have the service's employees experienced an improvement or a deterioration in their social conditions?"
"This also involves putting the service providers on an equal footing irrespective of their ownership structures."
"There is nothing fair about the competition if the regulations on aid put enterprises with a larger than 25 % public stake in them at a disadvantage over against their private-sector counterparts."
"So 'yes' to competition on the basis of the best services, and 'no' to competition on the basis of ownership!"
"Mr President, Commissioner, I expect your morning could have been more pleasant."
"What is more, you have the task of representing the Commission and your colleagues who are directly responsible for the matter, who have delegated this task to you."
"However, that is part of the job!"
"I am not going to talk about the content, for my fellow Members have already amply expressed what are my views too."
"I have familiarised myself with the most recent Commission document, a concise text which was produced a few days ago."
"It points out, in particular, that the first general document on the subject produced by the Commission dates back to 1996."
"Six years on, the Commission has announced a Green Paper."
"I do not feel that this is a responsible way to behave."
"You have timetabling problems which have already been pointed out by many people: you have problems scheduling your work to fit in with the Convention, you have scheduling problems with regard to the implementation of sectoral directives and you certainly have scheduling problems - as Mrs Ainardi mentioned - where enlargement is concerned."
"In any case, I believe that there is no point, ladies and gentlemen, in continuing to ask the Commission to produce documents."
"I am being mildly provocative in saying this: the Commission is divided."
"There is clearly no political leadership, which is disturbing considering that the Commission has sole right of initiative."
"I feel that we Members of Parliament must now shoulder our responsibilities within the Convention."
"A number of contributions have already been submitted on the subject of services of general interest and the reconciliation thereof with competition law."
"In its first contribution to the Convention, in May, the Commission itself pointed out how important it is that we have legal bases for services of general interest."
"Page 6 of the document even states that, without this, any changes will actually be to the detriment of the European model of society and the values recognised by the European democracies."
"The Commission is therefore both aware of the problem and incapable of taking political decisions."
"We who are members of the Convention or Members of the European Parliament must turn to our national governments and, within the Convention, we must fight to ensure that the future European Constitution genuinely contains legal provisions providing a framework for competition law."
"Mr President, in December 2000, the Nice Council called upon the Commission to consider, and I quote: 'in close cooperation with the Member States, ways of ensuring greater predictability and increased legal certainty in the application of competition rules relating to services of general interest'."
"In simpler terms, that meant that there had to be an end to the inconsistencies arising from unclear case law and the Commission's never-ending attempts to use its competences in the field of competition to meddle with the definition and functioning of services of general interest."
"Two years on, after a report from the Laeken Council and a call from the Barcelona Council for work to begin on a framework directive, we are still at more or less the same point, and the Commission's only proposal is to put off resolution of the issue once again and draw up a Green Paper which will lead to a huge consultation process."
"This is extremely disappointing."
"Although the solution is simple, clearly, the Member States still have to impose it."
"The Treaty must state clearly that, firstly, the Union recognises the freedom of administration of the States and their authorities, which includes their right to define and organise their public services, and, secondly, that the funding offsetting the additional costs of successfully providing services of general interest is not to be deemed state aid."
"Similarly, there must be an end to the inconsistent behaviour of the Commission at international level."
"The negotiations taking place in the WTO on a future General Agreement on Trade in Services - GATS - are currently in serious danger of going off course, drifting away from the liberalisation of private services and becoming an indirect debate on the shortcomings of public services."
"These discussions are being led by the Commission with a complete lack of transparency and without a clear democratic mandate for the parties to agree on after a broad public debate."
"Moreover, this situation is strangely reminiscent of what is happening in the field of agriculture as regards the application of the so-called Doha decisions, which have not been democratically ratified by anyone."
"As regards all these points, Mr President, the Member States meeting at the Council must take things in hand without delay."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission communication bears the words 'status of work on the examination of a proposal for a framework directive on services of general interest', a phrase which I feel is something of a provocation."
"We do not need an examination of the need for a framework directive; rather, what we need is for the Commission to present a framework directive, in accordance with Parliament's long-standing request that it should do so."
"If examination is what you want, you should read the Langen Report, the thirty-five pages of which will give you a detailed explanation of why we need a framework directive of this sort."
"We therefore demand that the procedure be speeded up and that Parliament's resolutions be acted upon."
"Commissioner, there is such a thing as the Lisbon process, which speaks unambiguously in terms of the European Union having social cohesion as its objective."
"In my view, services of general interest serve that social cohesion."
"A large proportion of services of general interest are provided on a voluntary basis and not only as a main job."
"They contribute to a higher degree of humanitarianism, and, as a rule, they are at home in the area between the state and the private sector."
"The support they receive from the state is not to be regarded as state aid, and they are private, although not wholly subject to competition law."
"It is for this precise reason that we need a legal framework that provides legal certainty."
"Christmas being only a few days away, I would like to extend the warmest thanks to those who work, whether professionally or voluntarily, for the common good."
"Without them, our society would be a colder place, and the European social model would be unworkable."
"Mr President, Commissioner, it is true that there was still talk of a framework directive at Barcelona but that, at Seville, it was no longer on the agenda."
"Now, the subject is a Green Paper, but there has already - in the year 2000 - been a Commission communication on services of general interest, a Commission report to the Laeken Council and, indeed, many documents and positions adopted by the institutions, particularly the European Parliament."
"Well then, at this rate, by the time the framework directive is adopted, all the sectoral directives on energy, postal services and transport will already have been adopted, the timetables will have been established for liberalisation and there will thus not be much left needing a framework."
"The Commission is, indeed, very behind and we can only wonder what this means."
"Where liberalisation is concerned, we legislate and we set dates without even planning proper mid-term reviews."
"When it comes to public services, we organise debates on debating documents."
"Like many of my fellow Members, I, for my part, feel that a precise legal framework is essential to protect and facilitate the development of public services in Europe as an essential part of citizenship."
"Now, public services cannot be subject principally to internal market rules because their objectives are long-term objectives, not immediate profitability, whether they relate to social and territorial cohesion, equal treatment or, as is sometimes the case, even equal pricing."
"Thus, these are not objectives which will bring an immediate return on investments, and they therefore cannot be governed by purely commercial reasoning, including where their compatibility and financing are concerned."
"I believe that, in the field of public services, we must be able to continue to finance what is not profitable with what is, and, therefore, that it is necessary to balance out prices."
"Since there is going to be a Green Paper, it would be appropriate, together with the social partners, users and local government representatives, to assess the long-term impact of liberalisation in a number of sectors in terms of quality and safety."
"I am thinking, by way of example, of the British railways, of employment and territorial cohesion."
"I am thinking of the postal services and the risk that oligopolies will form, and another example is telecommunications."
"I believe, in conclusion, that we need to give the Member States the possibility of having exclusive operating rights in certain geographical areas and of having reserved sectors which are not open to competition, for the expectations of the Union's citizens are very high when it comes to public services."
"Mr President, the representatives of the Lutte ouvrière object to the term 'service of general interest', for using it to replace the term 'public service' means abandoning public services and leaving services which are useful to the people to be governed solely by market forces."
"You, yourselves are forced in some cases to provide for some compensatory funding, otherwise known as state aid, for you know that market forces are stupid and inegalitarian and that they only meet financial needs."
"You cannot but be aware that the race for profit in public transport leads to disasters."
"By handing public services over to private interests, you are removing or restricting the access of those in the lowest income bands to education, healthcare, postal services and proper transport."
"We therefore object to both the form and the content of your communication, and we demand that public services be preserved and, where necessary, reestablished in all sectors which are useful to the majority of the people."
"We reject any privatisation of public services and any introduction of the concept of profit or profitability."
"Mr President, Commissioner, all of us - or the overwhelming majority of us in this House - view the single internal market and competition in a very favourable light."
"There are, though, many people who are affected by this issue of general interest, and we are indeed seeing a burgeoning commercialisation of what are called services of general interest."
"To a large degree, such commercialisation is justified, but thought ought also to be given to whether or not we should go down this road."
"Much has already been said about the Green Paper and the Convention, and also about the question of whether we have left things too late."
"There is one thing that we can say with certainty, and that is that Parliament believes that the dialogue between the Commission and the European Court of Justice must come to an end."
"Parliament is being ignored to an extent that, in this area in particular, could scarcely be surpassed; hence the urgent call for the Commission to make some progress on laying down specific criteria for this."
"There are two points that are of great importance to me, and that I would like to see resolved once and for all. One feature of the discussion on services of general interest is that the Commission is willing to get involved only where economic activity is concerned."
"I am sure that this is perfectly understandable in principle, but it always ends up being about questions of detail."
"Is an ambulance service an economic activity?"
"Yes or no?"
"We do not need decisions in individual cases, but we do need the Commission to at long last specify the criteria to which it will refer when it takes decisions in future."
"It is not acceptable for decisions - like those on savings banks - to be at short notice and always, immediately beforehand, forwarded only for information."
"My second point relates to subsidiarity, which does, indeed, loom large in the Convention's deliberations."
"This is where the Commission's delay in making its presentation to the Convention has been crucial, but the regions and the Member States must continue to be given the option of determining these matters themselves on a local basis."
"What must not be allowed to happen is standards being imposed by the Commission through the back door."
"Subsidiarity is about having scope to take your own decisions on a local basis, so that things may perhaps be different in Bavaria - where I come from - from what they are in, say, Luxembourg, where the Commissioner comes from, or in Spain, Portugal, Greece or, in future perhaps, in Lithuania."
"That is why definitions must not be imposed through the back door."
"At the end of the day, though, I have to say that what we and the public need is legal certainty, and that is not promoted by what one of your fellow-Commissioners occasionally gets up to, then going as far as to advocate the deregulation of water."
"That, at the moment, is not on the agenda, and has to be dealt with in a sector-specific way; it is for that reason that the Commission needs to get around to taking action on this."
"Mr President, I hope that the Commissioner will not hold it against me for saying this - it is not intended personally - but what you gave us today as a statement from the Commission was vacuous, every bit as vacuous as the documents you have sent to us - and I emphasise 'us', as I am referring to Parliament - over the past few weeks."
"I will shortly be saying something about the existence of other documents that are worth talking about and discussing, but first I will turn to the documents and the statement that you have given us."
"You started by mentioning in your introduction that we are engaged in a discussion, and one that is being conducted in a very open way."
"At any rate, that is how it came across when interpreted into German."
"What do you mean by 'open'?"
"Open as regards the possible outcome or open in the way the discussion is conducted?"
"Both interpretations make me uneasy."
"With an open outcome?"
"We have already moved on too far for that."
"Now you issue a Green Paper, which I see as nothing more than a means of creating a smokescreen while there are other decisions that urgently need to be taken."
"This is yet another exercise in avoiding doing anything, whilst, at the same time, very practical preparations are going ahead in other areas."
"Nor is the discussion being conducted in an open manner, for, as I have just told you, we have been given your statement on behalf of the Commission, along with documents of four or five pages each, not that the number of pages is of great importance."
"Yet, while we are given these documents, others are getting what are described as 'non-papers' - substantial documents that are really worth discussing, and in which we could find that there is legal certainty on specific points."
"Take the so-called non-paper dated 12 November, with its margin numbers - all 102 of them!"
"You discuss these things with others, but not with us."
"I just want to pick up one point and be told what the Commission really thinks about it."
"Item 100 says: 'An enterprise may provide more than one service to the public, some of them realising a profit and others showing a loss."
"Even if the enterprise does not provide public services, its services may cross-subsidise each other'."
"What that means is that, if we get an answer, we would be resolving an important financial issue, one that would help bring legal certainty."
"What we need right now is an answer and not this or that Green Paper, which serve only to delay the discussion process for ever and a day."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, although the role of services of general interest has been acknowledged, forcing these to comply with the rules of competition devalues their social role as public services of vital importance to the population at large."
"This is the major problem we are facing today, caused by successive decisions by the Commission and the Council, specifically at the Lisbon and Barcelona Summits, which have speeded up the liberalisation and deregulation of several sectors, such as telecommunications, postal services, energy and transport to name but a few."
"We are already beginning to see the consequences of these decisions, not only in the redundancies and in the greater instability of employment in some of these sectors, but also, in some cases, in the higher charges and prices and the poorer quality of the services provided. These developments have won the firm opposition of workers and of society as a whole, as demonstrated recently by the general strike in Portugal."
"We must, therefore, acknowledge the importance of high-quality public services in guaranteeing all citizens the right of access, which also requires a firm stance to be taken in WTO negotiations against the liberalisation of public services."
"So, Commissioner, what commitments can you give in this context of the WTO?"
"As the last speaker, Commissioner, I can either repeat the comments of those who have already spoken or oppose them."
"I will try to make one or two additional points."
"In my view, if the European Constitution does not include a substantial chapter or article on public services, its authors will be in danger of playing into the hands of those who want it to be rejected."
"They must take heed, for the Constitution is to be ratified by referendum! My second point is as follows."
"If the concept of public services is not present, our citizens will stop believing in a European social model and see it as devoid of sense."
"This concept must therefore be introduced."
"Lastly, Commissioner, beware of ideologies!"
"Just because the communist system of 'all state' did not work in the twentieth century, that does not mean that the capitalist system has necessarily got it right."
"Do not fall into the trap of jumping from ideology of 'all state' to the ideology of 'all market'."
"The god of competition does not need a monument."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m."
"The next item is the vote."
"Report (A5-0445/2002) by Joan Colom i Naval, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council decision on the mobilisation of the flexibility instrument according to point 24 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 (COM(2002) 399 - C5-0599/2002 - 2002/0157(ACI))"
"(Parliament adopted the text)"
"Draft amendments to the draft general budget 2003 as modified by the Council"
"Before the vote:"
"Mr President, I have some technical changes to announce before the vote."
"Earlier this week I gave many well-deserved thanks to the Commission and Mrs Schreyer, my fellow rapporteur; my colleagues in the Committee on Budgets and our dear Chairman, Mr Wynn et al."
"However, as the Danish Finance Minister was not present at the time, let me repeat my sincere thanks to the very constructive and efficient Danish presidency and in particular the Finance Minister, Mr Pedersen."
"He has managed to unite all the Member States and find solutions with us to very difficult issues."
"He has paved the way for the very broadly accepted solutions that form the basis for this, hopefully, short and uncomplicated vote today."
"I thank the Danish presidency very much."
"Let me also thank the extremely efficient and competent secretariat of the Committee on Budgets, who worked extremely well under extreme pressure, but also in a very nice and friendly atmosphere."
"Finally, I warmly thank the sittings services who have always handled complicated issues on voting lists etc. in a very correct and efficient manner."
"(Applause)"
"Now I turn to the formalities."
"Before the vote on the budgetary amendments starts, I must make a statement about some technical adjustments, some of which need to be put to the vote."
"First, a purely technical adjustment: Amendment 1 on budget lines B1-406 and B1-4081 - Improving the processing and marketing of agricultural products - has been withdrawn, because it is covered by Letter of Amendment No 3 to the draft budget, which we have already voted on."
"A vote is necessary to confirm the following corrections. First, Amendment 25 on budget line B2-5120 - Farm accountancy data network (FADN) - the figures should be modified as follows: an addition of EUR 1 391 000 in commitments and of EUR 1 383 000 in payments, giving the final figures of EUR 11 337 000 in commitments and EUR 11 329 000 in payments."
"Secondly, Amendment 238 on budget line B2-517 on plant and animal genetic resources."
"This should be withdrawn because it has also been covered by Letter of Amendment No 3."
"Thirdly, Amendment 246 on budget line B3-3062 on Prince."
"The following five words should be deleted in the remark: '... of the national public sectors'."
"Lastly, in Amendment 168 on budget line A-200 - Rent and ground rent - the figures should be modified as follows: add EUR 3 409 073, giving a final amount of EUR 132 590 904."
"I suggest that we vote on these corrections en bloc before we start voting on the amendments."
"Mr President, it is the right of any Member of this House to raise a point of order properly under the Rules, not just some Members of this House."
"If you are to refuse an electronic check on the third part of Amendment 139, which was properly called for immediately after that vote was announced, I would be grateful if you could explain to the House on what basis you are refusing that check."
"Unless this House accepts that explanation, which I do not, I ask you to make that check."
"It was evident from where I sit that it was the same majority."
"Secondly, the result has been announced."
"After a result has been announced, we will not go back on it."
"Mr President, Mr Färm, the rapporteur, has said all that I was going to say."
"I simply wanted to thank the presidency but also the sessional services for all the work they do to ensure that this process goes through so smoothly."
"I should just like to briefly interrupt the vote to invite the chairman of the committee, the rapporteurs, the Council and the Commission to join me for the signing of the budget."
"We have voted a budget with commitments of just under EUR 100 billion."
"We have done it in record time."
"I too wish to add my thanks to everyone involved - political colleagues and the administration - for the extraordinary work, efficiency and dispatch with which this was carried out."
"Mr President, you still have to ask the President-in-Office of the Council whether the Council agrees with this budget."
"I am quite happy to follow your advice."
"Mr President, Parliament has now undertaken the second reading of the 2003 budget, and I note that the agreement reached between Parliament and the Council at the consultancy meeting on 25 November of this year has now been ratified in the 2003 budget."
"There are, however, still certain differences of opinion regarding the classification of the expenditure in the budget, on which the Council reserves its rights."
"The Council is, however, able to accept the budget as it emerges from Parliament's second reading."
"Now that the Danish Presidency has come to an end, I should like to say that I have always had a lot of respect for the European Parliament, and I can assure you that this respect has not diminished as a result of the positive cooperation I have been fortunate enough to be able to experience during the last six months."
"I should also like to extend special thanks to the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Wynn, and to the budget rapporteurs, Mr Färm and Mr Stenmarck."
"Right from our first meeting as part of this budgetary procedure, which originated in a meeting in Copenhagen, I have encountered considerable ability and a very positive desire that we should each individually accept our responsibility and find those solutions that I think entitle me to congratulate Parliament on the budget that has now been adopted."
"Thank you for your constructive cooperation and your attention."
"Mr President, given the tragic nature of the disaster off the coast of Galicia and the other Member States which have since been affected by the oil tragedy, there is great solidarity and support in this House for our colleagues in Galicia."
"Therefore, I would urge the House to support the switching of EUR 30 million."
"This money would otherwise have been used to compensate those who lost their livelihoods when we failed to renegotiate the Morocco Agreement."
"Since those funds are no longer required for compensation, they will be earmarked for helping the victims of the Prestige tragedy."
"I would urge the House to support this and show solidarity with the beleaguered fishermen and families in Galicia."
"Mr President, in normal circumstances this procedure, as it is being proposed by the Commission, would be totally unacceptable."
"The Prestige accident occurred on 19 November."
"Six days later Parliament's delegation was in a conciliation meeting where we agreed on the mobilisation of the flexibility instrument for the remaining EUR 27 million for the restructuring of the Spanish and Portuguese fleets."
"All this could have been dealt with differently and in a different time frame."
"The proposal as it is violates certain principles."
"Firstly, it violates a procedure that is transparent."
"Secondly, it violates the principles of specificity of the budget established by the financial regulation."
"It violates last year's decision to mobilise the flexibility instrument for the restructuring of the Spanish and Portuguese fleets, and it also violates the principle of sound management since there is no margin left under heading 2, which implies that decommitments and then recommitments have to be made to make the necessary funding available."
"Having made all that clear, let us look at the political and the pragmatic approach."
"We, in the Committee on Budgets, are political and pragmatic people - not just budgetary people as people seem to think we are!"
"(Mixed reactions)"
"As Mr Gerhard Schmid said to me a short while ago, not everyone believes in God but they all believe in the Committee on Budgets!"
"The Commission proposal at least gives us the chance to use this year's budget - the 2002 budget - and that would be a better solution for taxpayers, to make sure that we are using money from this year, rather than getting supplementary own resources for next year."
"Whilst condemning the procedure and making it abundantly clear that this calendar of the Commission should not in any circumstances represent a precedent, I can recommend, on behalf of the coordinator of the Committee on Budgets, approval of the urgency."
"(Applause)"
"Mr Wynn, I believe the applause indicates that the House deeply appreciates your exceptional outburst of pragmatism on this occasion."
"(Parliament approved the proposal for a regulation)"
"Recommendation for second reading (A5-0419/2002) by the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council decision establishing the European Year of Education through Sport 2004 (9605/2/2002 - C5-0498/2002 - 2001/0244(COD)) (Rapporteur: Doris Pack)"
"(The President declared the common position approved)"
"Report (A5-0381/2002) by Graham R. Watson, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision on the signing of the Agreement between the European Community and the Government of the Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China on the readmission of persons residing without authorisation (SEC(2002) 412 - C5-0263/2002 - 2002/0092(CNS))"
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Joint motion for a resolution"
"Mr President, my voting buttons have malfunctioned."
"I wanted to vote against!"
"We take note of your intention but the result stands."
"(Parliament adopted the joint resolution)"
"President."
"That concludes the vote."
"I would like to make a point of order before you go."
"Mr Howitt, I hope you do not feel that you received the rough end of my treatment in this season of goodwill."
"I wish you all a very happy Christmas."
"I hope you have the relaxation and rest that we all deserve."
"I look forward to resuming with vim and vigour in the New Year."
"Happy Christmas!"
"EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE"
". (PT) We have voted in favour of this report because as a result, the funding of EUR 27 million for the conversion of the Spanish and Portuguese fishing fleets which operated in Moroccan waters will be ensured."
"We would also emphasise the fact that the proposal to which I put my name, as draftsman of the budget for 2003 in the Committee on Fisheries, has, at least in part, been adopted. This proposal aims to ensure that the flexibility instrument is used."
"We must ensure that the commitment given last year by the budgetary authority, to include EUR 27 million in the 2003 budget, is met."
"Nevertheless, I must express my unhappiness at the serious precedent being set by anticipating transferring structural funds that have not been used in 2002, totalling almost EUR 15 million, affecting their future reprogramming and redistribution, since we know that this is a highly sensitive area for all Member States."
"The 2003 draft budget is, in itself, sound."
"For the first time, the European Parliament is achieving genuinely rigorous work, mindful of the economic situation and the constraints upon the Member States, and is treating European finances with an austerity which we can only welcome."
"It does, however, contain a number of measures which we dispute, the most unacceptable of which concerns aid to peoples and healthcare in the area of reproduction, for which an increase of 200% is proposed, an increase which was rejected by the Council."
"Indeed, if we place this budget line alongside the objectives of the Sandbaek report, which it finances, we see that there is no guarantee that the practice and promotion of abortion will be excluded from this funding."
"Parliament does not permit such practices and 'solemnly' reaffirmed, when voting on the report on 'life sciences and biotechnology', 'that the life and dignity of all human beings, whatever their stage of development and state of health, must be respected'."
"In the light of this doubt and in the absence of any clarification from Commissioner Nielson, we cannot vote for this budget line."
"The EU's Budget procedure is becoming a set ritual every year."
"Parliament wants to spend more money than the European Commission is proposing, but the Council guards the Member States' purses by wanting to spend less."
"The result is an ever-increasing disparity between the expenditure ceiling agreed in 1998 and actual spending."
"As a representative of the Socialist Party in the Netherlands, I am faced with two choices each time."
"My party defends the maintaining or increasing of government expenditure intended for better public services, a better living environment and more solidarity with people in the poor parts of the world."
"It goes without saying that this will entail higher taxation levels than the governing neo-liberal politicians want."
"These taxes have to be collected from the top earners and from companies."
"However, accepting higher spending and higher taxes does not mean that we are happy to spend a great deal more money on an unnecessarily centralised EU."
"We regard part of the EU's expenditure as a waste that only goes to support bureaucracy and megalomania."
"Even the structural funds and the common agricultural policy, which could deliver benefits for poor regions and small farmers, are sometimes spent on the wrong things."
"The only points on which I can support the increase in the budget proposed by the GUE/NGL Group are those relating to social funds, the Northern Ireland peace fund and cohesion funds."
". (PT) We support the idea of designating 2004 as the European Year of Education through Sport, which matches the need to value the most positive aspects of sport in society and especially its contribution to the educational process."
"We should remember that one potential contribution to this year that must be included is Euro 2004, which will be held in Portugal"
"There must be a closer relationship between the educational and the sports systems, in other words, between school and club, associations, organisations, and also local authorities."
"This is the best way to promote the organisational component at grassroots level, of sports for everyone, which also requires more communication and transparency in explaining measures and in preparing projects that will be funded."
"Nevertheless, the appropriations that have been earmarked are limited and do not match the concerns that have been expressed - this is something we regret."
"We are also voting in favour of the report because we hope that this aspect will still be given further consideration."
". (PT) I wish to congratulate Mrs Pack on her excellent report, which I fully support."
"By adopting the Council common position, it aims to conclude an issue that I feel is of considerable importance: designating 2004 as the European Year of Education through Sport."
"Sport is acknowledged to be a major social phenomenon in Europe, and constitutes an extremely important educational tool."
"Like the rapporteur, I feel that the importance of the effect that the Olympic ideals can have on education should be emphasised."
"Sport contributes, in particular, to increasing the social skills of young people, such as team spirit, solidarity and fair play."
"I therefore welcome the decision to hold the European Year of Education through Sport 2004, which will make a positive contribution to reversing what has almost been the norm to date, and by this I mean Community action on sport which is restricted to pilot schemes and preparatory measures."
"I also agree with the rapporteur with regard to the need to adopt the Council common position as it stands, since it takes on board most of the amendments tabled by the European Parliament."
". (PT) The Commission has proposed that 2004 should be designated 'the European Year of Education through Sport'."
"It should be remembered that in that year, the European Football Championships will be held in Portugal and the Olympic and Paralympic Games will take place in Athens."
"Mrs Pack's approach aims, as does that of the Commission, to allow better use to be made of the educational values of sport in improving curricula, and particularly parallel education, by establishing a broader partnership between education organisations and sports organisations."
"In terms of the objectives, in terms of what has been said about the activities that will contribute to achieving these objectives and the financial envelope that has been proposed, which should focus on supporting practical initiatives that strengthen links between sport and education, this initiative definitely warrants our support, and so I have voted for it."
". (PT) I have supported this report and I fully agree with the recommendation made by the Committee on Culture, Youth, the Media and Sport to amend the Commission proposal in order, firstly, to eliminate the budget lines for surveys and studies and then to add these savings - totalling around EUR 420 000 - to the sums available for local, national and transnational actions and for initiatives by sports and educational bodies whose task is to disseminate information about this Year."
"As you all know, I have always supported these initiatives, ever since 2004 was designated as 'European Year of Education through Sport' - and I stated this in the earliest debates on the matter in this House."
"I wish to reaffirm that this will give an important boost to better use being made of the educational values of sport in order to improve curricula and especially, parallel education, by establishing broader partnerships between educational and sports bodies."
"Furthermore, I would say that, in this context, it is worth emphasising the connections between sport and education and thereby increase the visibility of the 'European Year of Education through Sport', by holding and funding, for example, athletics meetings at school level in each participating country."
"Schools sports must, in fact, be a priority within sports policy and must, at the same time, occupy a prime position in schools and educational policy."
"(FR) I voted against the Watson report, which endorses the agreement signed between the European Community and Hong Kong on the readmission of persons residing without authorisation, because it is accompanied by a very dangerous parallel provision: the exemption of Hong Kong citizens from the visa requirement."
"The Commission has tried to give me explanations during the debate, but they are not convincing."
"Firstly, it claims that the two decisions are not connected because they are not simultaneous."
"It is true that they are separated by a year but, in terms of reasoning, they are very closely related. Moreover, they are presented as such at the start of the explanatory statement of the agreement."
"Secondly, it states that the number of illegal immigrants coming from Hong Kong is very small."
"Even if this were true (and I do not believe it is), this decision to exempt Hong Kong citizens would still be irresponsible, given the special situation of Hong Kong, currently a Special Administrative Region of China."
"To cap it all, we learn that the final approval was given at the beginning of December by an Agriculture Council meeting."
"This is where we will end up if we continue to abandon our national powers of negotiation and ratification in favour of a system which is far-removed from the people and over which we have no control."
"This agreement comes in the wake of other, equally scandalous agreements concluded by the European Community with various poor countries across the world and which fall directly in line with the repressive policies decided on by the governments and authorities of the European Union, concerning those who are attempting to escape poverty or oppression in the hope of finding work and a future here."
"What they can expect from this agreement is questioning, imprisonment and finally expulsion."
"This will be the fate at least of those who have not perished in the attempt to surmount the new obstacles put in their way by our leaders, who would like to turn Europe into a fortress surrounded by barbed wire."
"This agreement, which is particularly harsh on the poor, whom it considers to be undesirables, but reduces formalities required for businessmen, shows the true face behind the hypocritical mask - if we had not already seen it - of official speeches about Human Rights that this European Union claims it wishes to protect in Hong Kong or other countries."
"Because Hong Kong was once stolen from China and subsequently leased, China was entitled to have it returned."
"However, this is causing a problem for the many people who now live there."
"They have a higher standard of living than those around them and make greater demands on their government."
"They want to contribute critically to government policy, and yet they have simply been transferred from one colonial power to another."
"The 'one country, two systems' arrangement may guarantee the continued existence of capitalism, but it does not guarantee the introduction and development of democracy."
"It is therefore to be expected that many people will feel unsafe there and will want to leave. They want to go to Europe, the USA or Japan, where they are more likely to find the kind of society they have become used to."
"On the other hand, the Chinese Government wants to make Hong Kong more like the rest of the country."
"It may be being allowed to become a rich show-piece, but movements that are banned in China and normal democratic elections in which an opposition can come into power are not permitted."
"I therefore doubt whether an agreement on the readmission of refugees would really work."
"The intention that this agreement should become a model for other states in which critical people feel unsafe is even more controversial."
"That is why I am voting against this."
"As the amendment concerning the special partnership with Turkey has been rejected, I do not have to explain it in specific terms now."
"For some of our group, this was a pragmatic step; for others it actually meant another step in the direction of Turkey's membership, something about which they are still quite pessimistic."
"As the text has been rejected, however, there is no point in discussing it any further."
"Mr President, like some other Members, I have abstained for several reasons."
"Firstly for those expressed by Mr Goebbels on several occasions, concerning the inadequacy of the funding earmarked for the Union's enlargement."
"Next, because we remain convinced that the thickest fog still covers the budgetary margins of an enlarged Union and we note that the same fog is now creeping over the timetable for legal operations, which are crucial if enlargement is to be completed successfully."
"Lastly, I wish to express my hope, Mr President, that, especially when you take part in summits, you strive to defend the prerogatives of our Parliament and the requests we make."
". (FR) We have voted against the resolution on the outcome of the Copenhagen European Council because it uses the fact that most Members clearly approve of the entry into the Union of ten candidate countries from the East to slip in some paragraphs which also approve the accession process for Turkey."
"These paragraphs welcome in particular the doubling of financial assistance to that country under a strategy which, according to the Copenhagen conclusions, is no longer even called 'pre-accession' but 'accession' proper."
"In fact, Article 49 of the Treaty on European Union does not apply in this case: it provides for the accession procedure for 'European' States."
"It does not cover other countries."
"What we believe was needed was to first open a joint discussion on the purposes and boundaries of the European Union, which could have been held within the Convention."
"Lastly, the resolution welcomes the 'comprehensive agreement reached with NATO', omitting to state that the European Union is at the same time committed to including Turkey in European security and defence policy as soon as possible."
". (FR) You welcome the outcome of the Copenhagen European Council and, in particular, the integration of ten new countries into the European Union."
"We do not."
"We are in favour of the EU's enlargement, considerably beyond, furthermore, the ten countries that you have just accepted."
"Enlargement in the form that you are undertaking it, however, simply enshrines the hegemony of the major capitals of Western Europe over the poorest and least developed countries."
"It enshrines and even prescribes attacks against the working classes of these countries, through company closures, increased unemployment and the elimination of many small family-run farms, in other words, turning rural workers into jobseekers."
"Furthermore, the inhabitants of the newly-integrated countries are considered to be second class citizens who, for a long transitional period, will not have the same rights as other members, in particular that of settling or working wherever they wish."
"We have, therefore, voted against your self-congratulation."
"Seen from a historical perspective, achieving enlargement is an issue that lies at the very heart of the European Union."
"This is the sharing of a common set of values in the field of liberal democracy, respect for human rights, social protection of the weakest, the protection of minorities, a market economy and peaceful coexistence under the rule of law."
"Enlargement is enabling us to revive the geographical, political and cultural identity of Europe."
"The prospect of a Union of 25 is now a reality."
"This enlargement, on an unparalleled scale, corresponds to an historic duty to reunite our continent."
"It also requires us thoroughly to reconsider the European project, the way in which an enlarged Europe will function."
"It also represents an opportunity."
"Extending the Union to more than 100 million new citizens, from this first stage formalised in Copenhagen onwards, will encourage exchanges and economic activity and will breathe new life into the development and integration of Europe's economy as a whole."
"The accession of new Member States will increase the Union's power and influence on the international stage."
". (PT) The conclusions of the Copenhagen Summit demonstrate that the European Council has opted to put off resolving serious problems, and has instead taken a radical step forwards, having decided on an enlargement involving more than ten countries, on a basis of discrimination, not only towards these countries, but also towards the current Member States with the weakest economies and greatest social problems, such as Portugal."
"It has also discriminated against Cyprus, creating further doubts about what will actually happen there."
"Nevertheless, the reference in the Summit conclusions to the specific situation of Portuguese farming was made in such vague terms that it provides no guarantees at all."
"The consequences could be extremely damaging unless Portuguese interests are properly considered in the negotiations still to take place, even after the political decision on accession."
"It is unacceptable that a thoroughgoing revision of the CAP and the financial perspectives has not been advocated, in the joint motion for a resolution, for example, which we rejected."
"There is a real risk of inequalities and differences being accentuated, with the aim of economic and social cohesion becoming increasingly distant."
"We also reject the conclusions' support for closer links between the EU and NATO, under the comprehensive agreement that has been concluded."
". (FR) Whilst I am delighted at the political unification of Europe decided on in principle in Copenhagen, I regret the fact that this is to be undertaken with excessively limited financial resources."
"The European Council has not even exhausted the envelope set in Berlin for the period 2003-2006."
"At the time, this was supposed to fund the accession of six new States."
"With less money, we are now supposed to cater for ten new members."
"Of the less than EUR 41 billion earmarked over three years, almost EUR 14 billion actually come from contributions from the new States themselves, which reduces the 'joint' effort of the 15 to some EUR 27 billion over three years, in other words, an annual transfer of less than 0.1 % of current Community GDP to the acceding countries."
"This is shamefully little, given the structural problems of almost all these countries."
"Under the Marshall plan, for five years after World War II, the USA transferred 1% of its GDP at the time to Europe."
"The FRG has for more than ten years transferred between three and four per cent of its GDP to the new 'Länder', totalling some EUR 75 billion per year."
"Since commitment appropriations are not the same as payments, it is to be feared that some of the earmarked funds will not reach the countries for which they are intended."
"As the Court of Auditors has just observed, of the EUR 520 million earmarked in 2001 under the Sapard programme, only EUR one million has actually reached the candidate countries."
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule (137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)"
"The Copenhagen Summit and its decision to enlarge the ?U was a very important act of imperialist expansionism."
"The victims of this enlargement, who will swell the ranks of the exploited, will be the workers and small and medium-sized farmers in the enlarged ?U, especially those in the new Member States, which are joining on even worse terms."
"The main purpose of making such derisory resources available is to strengthen the power of capital and tear down any social achievements left over from the socialist era."
"The fact that communist parties, support for communist ideas and the use of communist symbols are banned and senior communist party members and veterans of the anti-fascist movement have been gaoled in countries which supposedly meet democratic criteria is quite in keeping with the pseudo-democratic sensibilities of the leaders of the ?U."
"The shotgun imposition of the - basically partition-based - Annan plan in Cyprus is also unacceptable and signals an end to the UN resolutions and any hope of a fair and viable solution."
"Not only did the summit provocatively ignore the question of war with Iraq, and later with other countries, it pushed ahead with the militarisation of the ?U and reinforced the new 'anti-terrorist' ????."
"A final decision was taken on operations by the European army in the FYROM, with similar operations planned in Bosnia-Herzegovina."
"Today's resolution about the Copenhagen Summit congratulated the Government of Denmark for sustaining an excellent Council presidency, and for enabling us to celebrate today the largest enlargement in the history of the Union."
"This brings in ten new states, most of them relatively small, including six which have recently achieved independence by democratic means."
"We in Scotland are frequently told that as a small country we would have no great standing in Europe if we were likewise to achieve independence in Europe through democratic departure from a larger union."
"During the current fisheries negotiations, on the other hand, we have been warned not to expect too much since the UK lacks solid allies in Europe."
"There are five million Danes and five million Scots."
"I salute the huge achievement of one of the ancient small nations of Europe."
"I look forward to the day when my own ancient nation can play a similar role."
"The idea that small states count for nothing while large ones can cut the mustard has been shown up for the nonsense it is."
"My vote was motivated by these thoughts, as well as by a great satisfaction at seeing this greater Union safely achieved."
"It seems that for some Member States, enlargement of the EU boils down to an opportunity to buy as big a market as possible for their own domestic companies as cheaply as possible."
"This will result in the contributions to the structural funds that have already been established being redistributed amongst a larger number of Member States than initially planned by 2006."
"There will be much less money available to the farmers in the new Member States than to their counterparts in the present Member States."
"Things could have turned out worse, but thanks to the compromise proposed by Denmark and to Poland's tenacity, the Copenhagen Summit goes some way to bridging the gap between rich and poor."
"The Netherlands' calculated efforts in particular have failed. That is not likely to prevent Central Europe from being the poor cousin of the West for a long time to come."
"If the majority of voters vote in favour of accession to the EU, hopefully of their own free will and not as the result of a propaganda bombardment, enlargement will happen in 2004, probably including half of the island of Cyprus."
"The EU must make sure that it does not become involved in a war for this island or succumb to pressure to allow Turkey to join quickly without applying standards for democracy and human rights."
". (PT) I have voted in favour of the joint motion for a resolution on the Copenhagen European Council, despite disagreeing with some of its paragraphs, because the historic step of enlargement achieved at that European Council represents a firm commitment to the peace, democracy and development of the European nations, as well as a fully justified tribute to the efforts made by the candidate countries in the process of adapting to the Copenhagen political and economic criteria and to the Community acquis."
"Nevertheless, amongst other aspects I disagree with, I must mention my unhappiness with the second part of paragraph 5 of the motion, which stresses the need to reform the common agricultural policy before 2006, on the basis of the Commission's proposals."
"In fact, this proposal goes against the decision taken by the Fifteen Member States only to amend the CAP after 2006 and demonstrates its presumptive approval of fundamental choices that have not yet been subject to the necessary parliamentary debate."
"With regard to Portugal in particular, this debate will certainly take account of the specific characteristics of Portuguese farming and the abnormally low income of Portuguese farmers as a consequence of our only joining the European Community in 1986, when the other Member States had been benefiting from it since 1962."
"I have voted in favour of the resolution."
"We Swedish Christian Democrats sincerely welcome the fact that the division of Europe can now be a thing of the past."
"The Second World War has thus been brought to a definitive end."
"The EU is no longer just a form of West European cooperation, but not far from being pan-European."
"The EU would nonetheless be seriously threatened as a peace project if, in the future, the Council were to give Turkey a date for entering into membership negotiations while that country continues with the military occupation, begun in 1974, of 37% of the territory of the Republic of Cyprus, that is to say of a future Member State."
"I therefore find it deeply regrettable that Amendment No 13, which calls attention to this fact, was not adopted."
"Amendment No 10 by the Christian Democratic Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats provided scope for a revised aid strategy for Turkey on the basis of a special partnership."
"It was unfortunate that this alternative and complement to Turkey's membership ambitions was voted down, with 201 'yes' votes, 238 'no' votes and 16 abstentions."
". (FR) The Copenhagen Summit will go down in history as a summit of total incoherence."
"Hardly had it prepared the ground for the reunification of Europe when it put in place a process that would completely change its nature, by improperly extending its boundaries to encompass a country that is in Asia."
"Flying in the face of the geographical and historical evidence, Copenhagen has not only failed to make up for the mistakes of Helsinki, but has even compounded its 1999 mistake of misleading Turkey and has embarked on a course of action that will ultimately make Ankara the dominant power in the European Union."
"Instead of offering Turkey its rightful place within a close Euro-Mediterranean partnership, which respects the specific characteristics of each country, in short, which is adapted to geopolitical realities, the European Council has preferred the ideology of making no distinction between countries, flavoured with a hint of anti-Christianity."
"The day following the Copenhagen Summit, a major Parisian daily ran the headline 'Bush opens Europe's door to Turkey'."
"The European Council has indeed given in to pressure from the US and the joint NATO/EU letter issued after the summit attests to this."
"It suggests that Turkey should henceforth be fully involved in the Union's foreign security and defence policy."
"Copenhagen has therefore put in place all the necessary elements to ensure that the European Union will never see the light of day."
". (FR) The outcome of the Copenhagen Summit has left a bitter taste in everyone's mouth."
"The Europe that the Heads of State are building fluctuates between powerlessness and contempt."
"Powerlessness first, when we see that the European Union is incapable of achieving a fair and lasting peace in the Middle East or even of demanding the withdrawal of Russian troops from Chechnya or of French troops from Côte d'Ivoire."
"It is also powerless because the EU has shown itself to be incapable of preventing the predictable shipwreck of the oil tanker Prestige, which was 25 years old and flying a flag of convenience off the coast of Galicia."
"We then see contempt when the Eurocrats meeting in the Convention take decisions concerning 450 million citizens on basic constitutional texts without involving or consulting these citizens."
"Contempt has been shown towards the ten new countries which will have to undergo further waves of liberalisation and privatisation."
"Contempt for the populations of Turkey who, according to Giscard d'Estaing, do not share 'the Christian values of European civilisation'."
"The emphatic speeches of our leaders on the historic nature of this summit did not drown out those who, in their thousands, brought the values of another Europe onto the streets of Copenhagen - the values of democracy, peace and social justice."
"With them, here as I did there, I have rejected the outcome of this summit."
"Mr President, I really wanted to talk about the budget in relation to the fact that the reprogramming of funds to meet the needs resulting from the Prestige accident had my support and I am grateful, if you will allow me, for the unanimity achieved in this Parliament."
"I must point out that reprogramming is not the right route, and that the Council has still not approved the compensation fund in the Erika packages, it has still not been approved in the Council of Ministers, the European Council, and there is a genuine division between the European institutions which is jeopardising the fight against the international maritime traffic in dangerous goods in our waters."
"I must also point out that the European Council has only given EUR 5 million for the Prestige, a sum which I described yesterday as miserable and this must be said, bearing in mind that the United States have applied specific legislation through the Oil Pollution Act and are going to claim, and will achieve, EUR 4 000 million from Exxon Mobil for the Exxon Valdés accident."
"I believe these things should be pointed out so that the European Union may really become a political union which shows solidarity, especially in the case of an accident such as the one that has taken place in Galicia, which is a truly European problem."
"It is being suffered by Galicia because that is where the majority of traffic passes, but it is genuinely a European problem."
". (PT) It is greatly to be welcomed that, once again, in a matter that can be addressed most appropriately at the common European level, it has been possible to draft a compromise which expresses the broad consensus of all political groups."
"I fully agree with this basic text, of which we were the main proponents and which follows on from the useful content of the debates in plenary, now and as long ago as 21 November, and from that of the previous resolution in this field."
"I wish to reaffirm our two main approaches: the Commission and the Council must act immediately on what has been learned from this appalling disaster, in terms of rigorous new measures for the future, anticipating the full applicability of others that have already been adopted and a thorough examination of the entire legal and technical framework."
"The Commission must also, however, undertake and provide us with a detailed and rigorous study of the entire Prestige crisis, including the way in which it was managed in practical terms."
"We would all gain from learning, point by point, from this terrible lesson."
"This lesson must, therefore, be technically rigorous, scientifically precise and politically unbiased and dispassionate."
"Bringing any partisan national pettifogging to bear on this crucial evaluation, as those on this House's left have attempted to do, destroying the spontaneous consensus of 21 November and seeking to mislead the European Parliament because of a political spat in the Spanish parliament, can only harm the seriousness and objectivity of the debate - by all sides, I must emphasise - and, consequently, once again, endanger our common future, as a result of overlooking the main aspect: our coasts, the coastal communities, the greatest interest of the European citizens, a greater ability to prevent and to respond in the right way in future."
"What is important here is the sea - not Mr Aznar!"
". (FR) The chairman of the French shipowners' association has said that 20% of the world's fleet should not be allowed to sail because of poor upkeep and because it has not been inspected."
"These floating dumps, however, are treated with a reprehensible tolerance by some shipping companies and some flag States, not least Turkey, which heads the blacklist."
"I spoke yesterday of the need to clearly establish the liability of chartering companies, in order to encourage them to tighten up their practices."
"What oil slicks also demonstrate, however, is the complete surrender of their sovereign role by flag States who do not ensure that their ships comply with maritime law."
"This is why the States that are affected by oil slicks should systematically pursue the international liability of the flag State concerned at the International Court of Maritime Law."
"Spain, therefore, should today - and France tomorrow, probably - take the Bahamas to the Court in Hamburg."
"Establishing the liability of the charterer and determining that of the flag State are probably the two most promising ways of preserving the marine environment."
"The most badly affected States should defend these means and pursue them jointly."
"Mr President, I have, of course, voted in favour of this resolution, but I cannot agree with the way you treated Mr Schnellhardt when he told you that his machine was not working."
"He would have voted against the resolution and the majority was achieved by only one vote: 223 to 224."
"If Mr Schnellhardt's machine had worked - he has told you that this is not the case - the amendment would have been rejected."
"I believe that you should take account of the fact that a machine does not work, especially if the Member informs you straightaway."
"It is actually extremely important for us when an amendment is adopted or rejected by a single vote."
"I believe I am within my rights, Mr President to tell you that I do not agree with the way you have handled this matter."
"Mrs Lulling, as a Member of long standing - even longer than myself - you know perfectly well that what you have just said lies entirely outside the precedent of the House."
"You are completely misinterpreting the Rules."
"They are clear on this point: when we have a roll call vote and when we call the result, the result stands."
"That has been the constant practice of all my predecessors and is consistent with the Rules."
"I sometimes regret that, owing to technical problems, Members' votes are not properly registered."
"However, I have followed to the letter a precedent on which I exercise zero discretion."
"In those terms, although colleagues can be upset that their vote has not been recorded, it is a fact and a practice of this House that only those votes recorded and duly announced carry the result."
"Close at it was, c'est la vie, Madame!"
"Mr President, on a point of order, if that is how the Rules are, then they are stupid and should be changed."
"Mrs Lulling, this is then in your hands."
"I wish you a happy Christmas in redrafting the Rules."
"I wish a happy Christmas to Mr Fatuzzo, who today omitted to speak on behalf of the pensioners, but I am sure he would wish me to record that had he spoken, he would have done so."
"Mr President, this is my customary Christmas present to the Presidency, to the officials who assist the Presidency, to the interpreters, to all those who work in this Chamber and devote so much time during the year to listening to Mr Fatuzzo's explanations of vote."
"It is now a custom that, at Christmas, Mr Fatuzzo delivers no explanations of vote during the last voting time of the year, precisely as a Christmas present to you all."
"That concludes the explanations of vote."
"(The sitting was suspended at 12.30 p.m. and resumed at 3.05 p.m.)"
"The next item is the report (A5-0403/2002) by Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, on the Sixth Annual Report from the Commission on equal opportunities for women and men in the European Union (2001) (COM(2002) 258 - C5-0336/2002 - 2002/2180(COS))."
"Mr President, may I start by saying how delighted I am to see the new generation of Europe in the visitors' gallery following this debate, which directly affects their future."
"No one will be surprised if I say that this European Commission report gave us yet another opportunity to confirm that the equal opportunities situation is totally unsatisfactory."
"Unfortunately, however, the European Commission report is also unsatisfactory."
"It is still a descriptive annual report."
"Of course the 2001 report contains more facts and figures than previous reports but it is still the product of a routine exercise."
"It fails to illustrate properly either where we have failed to achieve our targets or commitments or the real difficulties in applying our policies at European and national level."
"Although it refers to future developments, it fails to set specific commitments or timetables."
"Turning now to individual issues, the European Commission is clearly finding it hard to apply equal opportunities and is failing to do so adequately."
"Some Directorates-General are not making commitments in this area."
"At the same time, action to encourage more women to apply to participate in applications has been unsuccessful."
"Our motion for a resolution calls on the European Commission to examine new ways of disseminating information and simplifying bureaucratic and other commitments which will allow women and women's organisations to find out about and take part in European programmes."
"The same applies to the Member States, which are having trouble understanding gender equality and implementing it in practice."
"Where there are no central or regional political support mechanisms, equal opportunities programmes are not being applied."
"Member States generally have no quantitative targets in their programmes, do not evaluate the repercussions of equal opportunities on their economic policy and have no indicators or statistics broken down by gender either for programming or for evaluating national policies."
"So it would be very useful for the purpose of raising awareness of the situation and drawing up future policies if the European Commission were to conduct a serious study with indicators and comparative data on the situation in each Member State, especially on the application of Community legislation, so that we can compare problems and achievements and exchange best practices."
"During the forthcoming year, 2003, the European institutions and Member States will need to act boldly and decisively."
"During the mid-term review of the Structural Funds which, as we know, will take place in 2003, the Member States will need to decide where there is room to promote equal opportunities, so as to prevent appropriations for measures to benefit women from being transferred to other objectives."
"We shall be preparing for the first European elections to include the candidate countries in 2003, and for national elections in various Member States."
"The Council recommendations on the equal participation of men and women have not brought about the expected results."
"Nor does the Council have a competent agency to help improve the coordination of equality-related issues."
"As for the European Commission, we are anxiously waiting for it to present a proposal for a gender equality directive based on Article 13 as quickly as possible, so that we can follow up the equal opportunities programme decided in Beijing and achieve our self-imposed targets throughout the fabric of economic and public life."
"All of this, you will say, has been said many times before, and you would be right."
"Numerous people have commented, both inside and outside Parliament, that we women and some of the men working on these issues are becoming tiresome and repeating ourselves. We need to ask ourselves why they make these comments."
"Why does this issue not affect our society or at least not with the degree of importance we attach to it as regards both the human and economic factor? Why are our policies and principles not being applied directly and properly?"
"I think that now more than ever we need to conduct a broad, ground-breaking dialogue with society and with those responsible for exercising European policy."
"What we want from the European Commission, Commissioner, are good ideas and efficient ways of applying them."
"Where the European Commission cannot force the Member States, it should encourage them to realise that equality brings benefits, not losses and difficulties."
"Let them understand how important promoting equality is to the strategic objectives set by the European Union, and I refer here both to the Lisbon objectives, which have been complicated by enlargement, and the objectives of defending human rights throughout the world and contributing to the economic and social advancement of mankind, especially in our own neck of the woods, by which I mean the Balkans and the Mediterranean."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by congratulating the members of the committee, and particularly the rapporteur, on the extremely careful and valuable work they have done, as well as thanking them for both their excellent suggestions and critical comments."
"Very progressive and inspiring ideas have been explored, and these encourage the Commission to continue its efforts towards this objective."
"Every year, we observe how effective, efficient and innovative our dual strategy is, involving as it does on the one hand, the inclusion of gender mainstreaming in all the Commission's areas of activity, and, on the other, the implementation of specific measures of positive action in favour of women."
"As we did in the last annual report, we have taken care, in the report on 2001, to take your comments and proposals into account."
"Your proposals, suggestions and concerns will, of course, also be taken into account in preparing and elaborating the report on 2002, work on which has already started."
"I would like, at this point to enlarge on one point in particular, the evaluation issue."
"I am already in a position to inform you that, in 2003, evaluation will be carried out by means of two methods which, although different, complement each other."
"As happens every year, what we call a gender scoreboard will be set up, whilst it is planned that a second evaluation will be carried out by external experts."
"These efforts have to do both with the assessment of the 2001-2005 framework strategy and also with the financial plan."
"It is envisaged that a provisional report on these activities will appear at the end of 2003."
"Turning to lawmaking, we will support the revision of the directive on the equal treatment of women and men, planned for 2003, by, among other things, drawing up a report evaluating the implementing measures taken at national level."
"It is precisely this to which you have just drawn attention, and we will make it our common concern to carry out an assessment in this area."
"The object of the revision of the equal treatment directives is to simplify them, help to make them more coherent, and bring them into line with the acquis communautaire."
"Another reason why the coming year will be significant is that we will be focussing on how to balance the participation of women and men in the decision-making processes."
"In this respect, too, we are endeavouring to achieve tangible results in all areas, with women becoming better represented in all sectors, including in the social partners."
"Your report will be a very valuable help to us in doing this."
"In 2004, we will be concentrating on the crucial area of combating negative stereotyped images of women."
"Misogynistic clichés, being a substantial obstacle to equal treatment for both genders, can and must be combated."
"This will be a comprehensive action, aimed at all the actors, with the objective of robbing obsolete ways of thinking of their power and, in the medium term - who knows? - perhaps even completely eradicating them."
"In any case, misogynistic clichés should soon be seen as ridiculous relics of times that are no more."
"Parliament has insisted on the best possible utilisation of funds for this purpose."
"Let me, in this context, remind you of the assessment to be carried out by outside experts, and, furthermore, bring to your attention the imminent adoption of a Commission communication on the introduction of the gender question in the Structural Fund."
"This communication will be a valuable instrument in the programme's mid-term assessment."
"Although the candidate countries have made evident efforts to transpose the acquis communautaire on equal treatment, substantial advances remain to be made, and so the Commission will continue to give the utmost attention to this topic."
"The success of European enlargement policy is dependent on the common rules being correctly applied."
"In this respect, the role of the programme of action, with which eight candidate countries have associated themselves this year, is that of giving impetus, and a valuable one."
"I would like to conclude by returning to the issue of violence against women, in relation to which the Commission welcomes the Council's framework resolution of 19 July 2002 on the fight against trafficking in human beings."
"This resolution is of great importance in terms of the conclusions to be drawn at criminal level as regards the trafficking in human beings."
"The Commission will follow closely the way in which this resolution is transposed into the laws of individual states, and will work very closely with the committee in closely monitoring this as well."
"Commissioner, we are dealing with the annual report for 2001 on the progress and difficulties observed in the achievement of equal opportunities."
"The political measures implemented are being analysed but their consequences are not being assessed."
"The objective of this framework strategy is to guarantee that all the Commission's policies take account of gender issues and analyse the repercussions of its activities on men and women."
"Once again we have to insist on the need to create more and better jobs between now and 2010, in accordance with the objectives set at the Lisbon Summit."
"We must insist on the need to guarantee equality between men and women in all political fields, in accordance with Article 3(2) of the Treaty."
"We must once again demand that indicators be produced on the structures for childcare, dependent persons and family assistance, as well as the differences in salary between men and women."
"The Barcelona European Council called on the Member States to eliminate the obstacles preventing women from fully participating in the labour market, in particular by creating crèches."
"Respect for and promotion of equality between men and women are part of the Community acquis and are therefore an essential condition for the new countries of the European Union."
"It is true that the Commission has made efforts to promote equality between men and women, but so far they have been insufficient."
"With regard to programmes funded with Structural Funds, it has been noted that the objective of equality has not been met, including in the Regulation referring to them."
"Even when certain programmes present it amongst their objectives, the results are not analysed and we know that this objective of equality is not really being met."
"The absence of women through balanced representation in decision-making bodies is significant, particularly social partners and other bodies."
"Additional efforts must be made so that the presence of women in decision-making bodies becomes a reality."
"It is cause for satisfaction that this issue has been included as a priority for 2003 and we hope that it yields positive results."
"It is very important that the Commission has included the integration of the principle of equality between men and women in external relations, and it must be present in all agreements with third countries."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have an almost balanced representation of Members here today for this debate on women's rights."
"On behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I would like to thank the Commission and Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou for their reports."
"The Commission has succeeded particularly well in giving clear pointers for the way forward in equal opportunities, by means of the framework strategy on gender mainstreaming and the associated fifth action programme on gender equality."
"More rapid progress is being made in some areas."
"Last year, we adopted the directive on equal treatment in employment."
"That is a milestone, and we keenly await the first evaluation report."
"In other areas, things are taking a little longer."
"However, there are already clear pointers in the case of the Structural Funds and as regards combating violence."
"I would like to point out that we in the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities have already on several occasions proposed what was agreed here this morning: to make 2004 the European Year of Education through Sport."
"This House and I myself have for many years been calling for a European year of action against violence."
"I hope that will be picked up again."
"We are also very anxious to see the proposal for a directive under Article 13 banning discrimination."
"There is also some delay on that."
"This needs to be pursued with great vigour."
"We also need to maintain the political will to make progress in involving women at all levels of decision making, both legally speaking and in practice."
"The outcome of the Convention in that respect has been very disappointing, so we need to act now."
"There is also still a great deal to be done in the European Parliament, and my criticisms are accordingly also aimed at this House."
"Let us not beat about the bush - Parliament is lagging somewhat behind the Commission when it comes to implementing gender mainstreaming internally."
"We need to make progress both in terms of political decision-making and as regards the administration."
"Balanced participation of women and men can only be achieved if a genuine political will exists, and it requires a top-down approach."
"We are particularly looking to the political group chairs, to the President of Parliament and to the committee chairs to set a clear example."
"We are at present working in the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities on an initiative to achieve gender mainstreaming in the European Parliament, a kind of gender equality health programme if you like."
"It will be ready in time for the 2003 International Women's Day."
"I believe that we can set an example here to make it crystal clear that the European Parliament - even when enlargement is in the offing - is serious about equal opportunities for women and men."
"Particularly when elections are on the horizon, it is not enough for the parties just to include equal opportunities in their manifestos; we also have to make sure it is implemented in practice."
"We expect that here in the European Parliament, where 30% of the Members are women, which means that we are somewhat better than average, things will be even better after the elections, so that we will move significantly closer to the goal of equal representation of men and women in this House."
"There are many other points appearing in both reports that I could comment on."
"I believe that ultimately the crucial factor will be the political will that needs to be demonstrated if the position of women is really to be improved."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, no sensible person would dare to reject the principle of equality between men and women, or in other words between human beings."
"In recent days, in my region, Galicia, this equality is being clearly demonstrated, through solidarity and also through pain."
"Yesterday, television stations broadcast the human and heart-breaking image of the minute's silence expressing condemnation and rejection of the latest terrorist attack by people, men and women, who were working to recover Galicia's environment, the marine environment, in the fight to deal with the consequences of the Prestige disaster."
"Yesterday as well, the media reflected the figures relating to domestic violence inflicted on women by their husbands, boyfriends or ex-partners."
"In some sections of the media it was also pointed out that the great majority of victims did not recognise their situation."
"This is what seems to me to be the most serious violation of sex equality."
"On the other hand, it is of some comfort that the result of the survey suggests an improvement in the situation in comparison with the survey of 1999, but it is worrying that this situation is continuing 15 years after a constitutional text, in its marvellous Article 14, declared that all Spaniards, in this case, are equal before the law, and that there could be no discrimination on the grounds of race, sex etc."
"Our Charter of Fundamental Rights, in Article 20, declares that all persons - it does not say men and women, which is not necessary - are equal before the law. And Article 21 states that all discrimination is prohibited and, in particular, discrimination on the grounds of sex, race etc."
"Last Tuesday, the plenum of the Spanish Congress of Deputies approved the idea that all legislative provisions produced by the government should include a report analysing their impact on gender equality."
"I believe that practical conclusions should be drawn from Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou's report, which is excellent, given the balance she has achieved on an issue on which it is very easy to fall into demagoguery and not do enough, and we must move on from theory to reality and insist on the objective of equality through the horizontalisation of policies promoting equality, so that principles may become reality and so that reality may reflect the principles which the great majority of us advocate and which we want to see alive and enshrined in the Europe we are building."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there are in all nine directives on equal treatment, but no measures to improve their implementation."
"That is why we need data and statistics to facilitate comparative assessments based on which solutions can be identified."
"A simple statement that men and women are equal before the law is not enough."
"The Commission's priority theme for 2001 was equal pay."
"However, the report once again reminds us that women's pay for the same or equivalent work continues to average only 76% of men's pay."
"The Joint Report on Employment for 2001 states that the Member States have taken only limited measures to reduce this pay differential, and the Commission needs to play an active role here, especially with the prospect of enlargement."
"The committee is actively working on the priority themes for 2002 and 2003 - the reconciliation of work and family life and the participation of women in decision-making processes."
"The provisions in force at present will have to be better adapted to current requirements."
"If women, and men too, opt for family life and to have children, that should not prevent them from participating in working life."
"Women need to be involved in decision-making processes at all levels."
"The only way to make credible progress with a policy for both sexes is by means of mutual cooperation based on equal opportunities."
"Commissioner, some good projects have been worked out by women's organisations, but those organisations need more information on access to the Commission's system of financing and aid."
"The objective should be to ensure that as many stakeholders as possible can participate in the relevant programmes."
"After all, appropriations are made available every year to support projects relating to women, for example in the Structural Funds and in particular in the 2000-2006 action programme."
"However, the procedures involved need to be rationalised and simplified, because they are too complicated, both at Community and at national level."
"I would like to conclude by very sincerely thanking Mrs Rodi Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou for her balanced report."
"Unfortunately, the limited time we have available means that I can only touch on a few points."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou on her work, this Parliament's Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities for the excellent work it has been doing and the European Commission, in relation to equal opportunities policy."
"It is very important that we take equality seriously. Not only through declarations, but also through intentions, policies and actions."
"We therefore need to take the pulse of the equality policy, measure it and assess it."
"We therefore call for quantitative objectives for policies on employment and access for women to information, training and politics."
"Amongst all of us, men and women, we must make it possible for both governments of the current countries of the Union and the governments of the candidate countries to take equality seriously, to transpose the directives when necessary and ensure that they do not fail to comply with Community legislation."
"A new stage is beginning in which we will have to be very vigilant."
"Equality - as many of us here know - needs to be fought for every day and every day no progress is made is in reality a step backwards."
"Many women are looking to the European institutions."
"Many of them live far from our prosperous Europe."
"For them, the progress we can make here is absolutely essential."
"It is possible that for many of them their only hope is that the European institutions will take equality seriously, both for the women within the Union and for all of those who, because they are outside the Union, encounter many more difficulties fulfilling their expectations of life."
"We often say that there is no discrimination worse than that which comes from happening to be a woman."
"One does not choose to be born a woman."
"One is born one and, from that moment, one faces a huge number of obstacles which would not be there if one were a man."
"Therefore, given that we women make up half of the citizenship of the European Union, it is essential to attend to their needs and expectations, because they are the needs and expectations of the majority of the European citizenship."
"We are also talking about the expectations, the rights and the defence of equality for the majority of women in the world."
"This Parliament's Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities has been working very intensively on all these issues."
"This committee has achieved, I believe, significant progress, but it is not sufficient. We are interested to see the work the European Commission is doing as well and I believe that this report reflects perfectly both what we have assessed and also everything we are asking for for the more immediate future."
"I believe that this excellent cooperation in our committee has borne fruit."
"Now that the time has come to evaluate the work of the year, we can all be pleased."
"Mr President, several Members have asked when the Commission will be bringing forward a proposal for a directive on discrimination based on gender under Article 13."
"The Commission will be presenting a proposal at the beginning of next year."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner, for this clarification."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place this afternoon at 5.30 p.m."
"WRITTEN STATEMENTS (RULE 120)"
"Mrs Kratsa-Tsagarapoulou's report clearly lays out the sticking points: the persistent pay differential and the explosion in trafficking in human beings and prostitution."
"I welcome the dynamism of our rapporteur, although I would like to make two observations."
"Firstly, we must remember the scale of poverty amongst women."
"Most of the 60 million people living beneath the poverty line in the EU are women."
"Secondly, we must remain vigilant over Europe's desire to protect the equality of the sexes."
"In fact, the first preliminary draft of the constitutional treaty presented by the Convention in October 2002 causes me some concern."
"The absence of any reference to equality between men and women in Europe is notable: it appears neither as a value nor as an aim, despite its inclusion in the Treaties."
"The Convention's work programme, which is now dedicated to social issues, will enable this oversight to be corrected. We cannot conceive of it failing to do so."
"Equal opportunities, addressed in Article 23 of the Charter, are a fundamental right and a value that we hold dear."
"Since 1975, the date of the first directive on equal pay and treatment, progress has certainly been made, but a great deal remains to be done."
"Statistics broken down by gender and the gender dimension that is included in all our policies are essential prerequisites."
"Practical actions to ensure that parents, both men and women, can benefit from infrastructures such as nurseries, for example, which enable them to reconcile family life and working life, would constitute a considerable step forwards."
"Our actions must increase the population's awareness of changes in mentality so that finally more women gain access to positions of responsibility and to supposedly typically 'masculine' careers."
"This also requires a common effort to be made with the social partners to ensure that this fundamental principle is applied in every company and in all collective bargaining."
"Equal pay is only one issue within equality between men and women; let us not forget domestic violence, sexual exploitation, etc."
"Europe has a duty to set an example."
"I thank Mrs Kratsa for having pursued this approach."
"The next item is the Commission statement on sustainable development in mountain regions."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament is right to be taking an interest in mountain regions."
"As you know, the Commission is also paying great attention to these issues, as demonstrated by the conference organised in October at the initiative of my colleagues Michel Barnier and Franz Fischler on the subject of 'Community policies and the mountains'."
"My colleagues Mrs Wallström and Mr Barnier - the latter of whom is in Brussels at a meeting of the Presidium of the Convention - have asked me to update you on some of the work being undertaken and on some issues still outstanding as regards the Commission's work on the European Union's mountain regions."
"The EC Treaty does not refer to the concept of mountain regions as such."
"Article 158, which provides the legal basis here, states, in connection with the policy of economic and social cohesion, that the Community shall aim in particular to reduce disparities between the levels of development of the various regions and the backwardness of the least favoured regions or islands, including rural areas."
"It could be argued that specifically incorporating the concept of mountain regions into the Treaty would better reflect stakeholders' concerns."
"For example, 95% of mountain regions come under Objective 1 or Objective 2 of Europe's structural policy."
"Compensatory payments for less favoured regions made under the common agricultural policy also benefit mountain regions in many cases."
"The Commission has commissioned a study in order to assess the strengths and weaknesses of mountain regions more effectively."
"This study has three objectives: to define the mountain regions of the enlarged EU, to create a database of these regions and to carry out an objective analysis of the situation in mountain regions and of existing Community and national policies, and to evaluate those policies."
"In line with the first of these objectives, a definition of mountain regions is to be created for the 27 current Member States or candidate countries covered by the study."
"This definition is being drawn up on the basis of topographical criteria, and in some cases climatic criteria are also taken into consideration."
"At the beginning of December 2002, the contractor carrying out the study presented the Commission with 16 possible definitions, and these are at present being examined in detail."
"A decision will be taken at the end of December as to which definition can be used."
"On the basis of this process of defining regions, a start can now be made on collecting statistical data."
"We expect that the process of collecting and analysing data and the presentation of the final report will be completed by September 2003."
"As regards regional policy and the common agricultural policy taking account of mountain regions in future, I have already explained that regional policy and agricultural and rural development policy are indeed two policies that directly take account of mountain regions."
"In the case of regional policy this is done through regional programmes for Objective 1 and Objective 2 areas, and also under the Community initiative known as Interreg, particularly through the Alpine region programme."
"Under the CAP, mountain regions are chiefly supported by means of compensatory payments for less favoured regions."
"Consideration is at present being given to the future of these policies."
"The Commission's proposals on the future of the regional policy are to be presented at the end of 2003 as part of the Third Cohesion Report."
"It would therefore be premature to prescribe at this early stage how mountain regions are to be taken into account in the forthcoming 2007-2013 planning period for regional policy."
"Under the current mid-term review of the common agricultural policy, the Commission's proposal places particular emphasis on strengthening agri-environmental measures, which often benefit mountain regions."
"As regards measures in favour of mountain regions under other Community policies, I would like to say a little more about competition policy and about general interest services."
"As you know, EU policy on grants of state aid is based on Article 87(1) of the Treaty, which stipulates that grants of aid by the state are fundamentally incompatible with the common market."
"However, this article also specifies cases in which grants of state aid may be approved."
"These exceptions include aid of a regional nature, or to be precise aid 'to promote the economic development of areas where the standard of living is abnormally low or where there is serious underemployment', in other words areas whose per capita gross national product is less than 75% of the Community average."
"Certain other areas may also be covered by this exemption."
"Furthermore, the Commission attaches great importance to services of general interest, as demonstrated by its communication of January 2001."
"However, as you know, maintaining and developing services of general interest is solely a matter for the individual Member States."
"The Commission can only offer encouragement in this field."
"In its communication, the Commission states that the aim of services of general interest is to ensure universal basic provision, that is to say access to essential services, including those in remote or inaccessible areas."
"In addition, the new Article 16 of this Treaty specifically recognises the important role played by services of general economic interest in promoting economic, social and territorial cohesion."
"The importance of these provisions was also emphasised by the Heads of State and Government at the Lisbon Summit in March 2000."
"The final point that I would like to mention is the Alpine Convention."
"Although this convention only directly affects four Member States, the Commission was involved in launching this initiative."
"It was not until summer 2002 that a sufficient number of signatories to the convention had ratified the various protocols so that it could come into operation."
"For its part, the Commission is investigating the various options available to it for more active involvement in the context of the Convention."
"The Commission has already presented its proposal for signing the transport protocol to the Council."
"However, I have to report that this proposal has so far not made much further progress within the Council."
"Furthermore, it needs to be made very clear that these protocols also have to be supported by the Member States at Council level, as the Council is responsible for signing and ratifying them on behalf of the Community."
"As you know, several states participating in the Alpine Convention have not yet ratified the protocols."
"However, we hope that things will move forward positively in the coming months, reflecting the effort made by some Member States at the end of the summer to breath new life into the Alpine Convention."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission will continue to pay close attention to issues concerning mountain regions."
"Present and planned work, in particular the Directorate-General for Regional Policy's study, the results of the mid-term review of existing programmes and the conclusions of the Third Report on Economic and Social Cohesion will give us a more accurate picture of the situation and options for further action."
"Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for your statement, which suggests that mountain regions will perhaps no longer be entirely overlooked in European policy."
"Until now, unfortunately, mountain regions have rarely been a subject on which we have made observations or recommendations."
"And yet these regions warrant particular attention."
"Mountain areas offer a huge variety of riches."
"They are usually exceptional areas, which must therefore be managed in a very specific way, within a global policy of sustainable development of the mountains."
"These are complex areas due to their geography and their climate."
"They are areas in which farming plays a crucial role, but not any old farming; it must be a form of farming which is extensive, that takes care to preserve species of fauna and flora and the abundant supply of water, and to protect forests and natural habitats as defined by the European Union."
"This type of farming cannot exist, however, without people, hence the need to preserve these mountain areas from desertification and to do everything possible to maintain a human presence there."
"We must therefore strengthen and update provisions to benefit young farmers."
"The Commission has set up a number of programmes with which we are quite familiar: Leader and Interreg, inter alia, as you mentioned, Commissioner."
"This aid probably needs to be simplified, precisely because these are areas with specific characteristics, in order to make them more flexible to ensure that they are better suited to the terrain and that they take account of the specific characteristics of the region, the necessary protection of the environment and the existence of numerous specific methods for the management of these areas, such as pastoralism, for example."
"The same applies to tourism."
"We must encourage sustainable tourism, promoting the natural wealth of these areas but refusing to allow mountains to be turned into leisure parks built of concrete - which has, unfortunately, happened all too frequently in the Alps, amongst other areas."
"In order to achieve this, we must encourage private initiative, we must help local SMEs, which often suffer as a result of their isolation and communication difficulties and we must maintain services."
"Commissioner, I was very pleased to hear what you had to say on this matter, particularly your reminder that it is important for services to be available everywhere, including the most remote areas."
"We must therefore give priority to structural projects aimed at promoting forms of transport that respect the environment and probably at giving a greater role to the railways."
"In mountain areas, this is, of course, more difficult, but, in the Alps, we have first-hand knowledge of these problems."
"We must also give priority to renewable energies such as water and wood and increase research into the prevention of both natural and material risks."
"You also emphasised, however, the need to define mountain areas and not to forget hilly areas, because these play a crucial buffer role between mountains and lowland areas."
"We must also bear in mind, when talking about mountains, that the Alps are not the only ones; there are also the ancient massifs, which have their own specific characteristics and which must also be taken into account."
"In conclusion, the sustainable development of mountain areas can only be achieved if all partners are fully involved."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I am delighted to have the floor after Mrs Grossetête, because all Members representing mountain regions face the same problems and share the same ideas about their respective areas."
"I am very grateful to you for your words, Mrs Schreyer, which show how interested the Commission is today in the range of problems facing mountain regions; we are quite aware of this."
"I would also like you to know that we firmly intend to work together to ensure that our areas, which have very well-defined handicaps, can be effectively protected."
"I shall therefore dwell on a few points that complement what has just been said."
"If we want our territories to enjoy a form of economic development that comprehensively brings together preserving the countryside, preserving the type of farming that is characteristic of a mountain region and developing tourism, perhaps the Commission should listen more carefully to two or three points that are absolutely crucial."
"I should like to recall that competition policy, as it is currently legislated for and regulated by the European Union, can by no means meet the needs of these regions, which do not have as many opportunities as others."
"I think it is crucial that Community competition legislation is adapted to take account of the specific characteristics of our regions, in order to reduce these economic and structural disadvantages."
"We must also put in place economic and financial support and tax concessions of a structural and sustainable nature. Such measures are essential if we wish to combat the desertification and the ageing of these regions because, at the moment, these developments appear to be inevitable."
"I also wish to reiterate the importance of the EU's environmental policy."
"This might be a taboo subject, but I hope that, whenever work is done in this field, thought is given to the applicability of these provisions, which were designed for an urban context, a context of lowlands that do not experience the same type of problem."
"Very often, when regions with a geographical handicap are forced to apply this regulatory approach, they find themselves totally disempowered."
"I would even say that they suffer genuine deprivation."
"We therefore fervently hope that, together, armed with a coherent vision, we will be able to make progress, because enlargement will give mountain regions an extremely important role to play."
"Furthermore, in its work, the Convention must address our set of problems quite specifically."
"This concerns the territorial coherence and the cohesion of the European Union."
"Mr President, I would first like to say that we are at the end of the International Year of Mountains, which was organised by the United Nations."
"I think it is very positive that Parliament is able to discuss Europe's role in this matter, particularly at the end of the Year of Mountains."
"I would also like to welcome, along with the Commissioner who is present and those who are absent, the fact that we are witnessing a change in perspective."
"Over the years, my colleagues here and I have criticised the Union's lack of interest in the problems of mountain regions."
"Today you have shown a different attitude, which was already evident in the October meeting organised on the Commission's initiative around the theme of 'EU policies and the mountain', which included, among others, a speech by President Prodi."
"I appreciated your speech, Commissioner, because you succeeded in summarising the various issues."
"I would like to briefly go back over a few matters."
"First of all, as Mrs Guy-Quint said at the end of her speech, there is the major problem of introducing the issue of mountain regions into the treaties, which is absolutely essential."
"I think that we should take into account the important role of the Convention in this."
"We also need to make use of the two presidencies of the Council: the Greek Presidency and the Italian Presidency, two countries that are obviously affected by the problems of mountain regions."
"Introducing the issue into the treaties will provide an essential legal basis for obtaining a directive on mountain regions, in which we must of course solve the problem of competition."
"I therefore think that progress should be made in this respect."
"Having said that, we should also look at the prospects for regional policy for 2007-2013."
"Why not consider a specific structural fund for mountain regions?"
"Or, better perhaps, for areas that are geographically or naturally handicapped?"
"I will not add anything regarding agriculture."
"Agriculture remains essential for safeguarding mountain regions."
"The same can be said about tourism, which Mrs Grossetête discussed in detail."
"I would like to add a few words on the International Convention on the Protection of the Alps."
"Unfortunately, I do not think that the Commission has sufficiently monitored the work of this Convention."
"In this respect, we need to promote the transport protocol, in order to have a legal basis for taking specific measures to regulate the flow of heavy goods vehicles in mountainous areas."
"We obviously also need to look more closely at the issue of the funding of the major rail links such as Turin-Lyon, the Pyrenees and the Brenner pass, because in my view it is one of the keys to sustainable development in mountain regions."
"Mr President, this is the International Year of Mountains, and I am glad that Mrs Frassoni, our co-Chairman, managed to have this put on the agenda, as it is an essential issue."
"Mountains are areas that contain some of the few remaining wildlife sanctuaries left in Europe."
"They need special status as sensitive areas."
"There is a clause in the Treaty for ultra-peripheral regions that provides for flexibility in adopting EU policies for special needs."
"This is what the Commission should be doing."
"It should declare mountains to be sensitive regions and then adopt legislation accordingly."
"It is disappointing that the Commission had no initiatives this year concerning mountains - not even a communication or a White Paper."
"That would have been very welcome."
"The Commission, whilst pushing for the International Convention on the Protection of the Alps, states that the protocols have been ratified, but not everyone has ratified the transport protocol."
"It is essential, in relation to the threat that highways and the trans-European networks are having on mountain regions, that these protocols are properly implemented, not just in relation to the Alpine regions but also in other regions such as the Pyrenees which are in danger."
"We also need conventions for those areas to protect them."
"In relation to priorities, there is a conflict between the trans-European networks and the needs and concerns of people."
"It is quite clear that the people who have opposed trans-European networks have voiced real and true concerns."
"Their concerns have been ignored to prioritise the trans-European networks."
"This is a conflict."
"Finally, I cannot understand why the Commissioner is not putting pressure on Member States to ensure that they comply with Natura 2000 in the Alpine regions or why we do not have officially adopted lists of sites of Community interest."
"That is disgraceful."
"I urge the Commissioner to put pressure on the Member States."
"Mr President, mountain regions are proclaiming themselves as areas of economic, social and cultural life, but they are seeking recognition. Firstly, they are seeking recognition of their handicaps."
"Regions can only be classified as mountainous on the basis of their altitude."
"Difficulty of access, harsh climate and declivity should also be taken into account."
"Mountain regions are also seeking recognition for the quality of their products."
"They do have a reputation for high quality, but that can only be valued if consumers can identify the products."
"Steps are being taken on this and we should support them."
"In promoting the mountain economy we need to take into account the fact that it is developing in a fragile environment that needs to be both preserved and developed."
"It is therefore difficult to find the balance, which needs to be supported by coherent legislation, which is not currently in place."
"I am thinking in particular of legislation on bringing livestock rearing and shepherds' huts up to standard, which is difficult to implement in some mountain ranges."
"Conservation programmes, such as the LIFE and NATURA 2000 programmes, for example, also have damaging consequences for economic activity."
"Mountainous regions will only remain open if everything possible is done to offer those who have chosen to live there prospects for the future, particularly young people."
"We therefore need effective policies for mountainous regions that are adapted to each mountain range and based on management that is devised jointly by elected representatives, public services and professionals."
"These policies must work towards compensating for the excess cost of production, the opening up of regions, the diversification of activities, maintaining public services and developing specialised training and access to new technologies."
"Agriculture, pastoralism and forestry play an essential role in mountain regions."
"Not only do they generate quality products, but they are also the only means of maintaining sites and keeping them secure."
"In certain mountain ranges, however, pastoralism is being put at risk by the reintroduction of predatory species, and the poor management of their populations."
"Diverse landscapes, high-quality products, 'green lungs', rare species: mountain regions are and must remain diverse."
"We should not make them into sanctuaries, or into deserts."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, mountain regions account for 30% of the surface area of the Community of Fifteen, and 10% of the population lives in mountain regions."
"Up to now, the European Union has viewed its policy on mountain regions as part of agricultural policy."
"I believe that this issue needs to be seen as a whole and not just sector by sector."
"Mountain regions account for over 50% of the total surface area of Member States such as Austria, Italy, Spain and Greece."
"For this reason it is absolutely essential, in addition to the issue of defining mountain regions, to consider the impact on various aspects of life, and for mountain regions to be seen as an area in which people live and not just as a business area for particular sectors of the economy."
"I am delighted that the Commissioner has been able to inform us that a positive solution to the problem of creating a definition has now emerged."
"I think that in the final report to be presented in September 2003 this will provide us with a foundation on which we can build."
"The suggestions that it is too soon to be specific about financial issues may reflect an unavoidable degree of caution, but it is certainly not very satisfactory, Commissioner."
"I myself come from a mountain region which is in a relatively good position by virtue of its autonomous status."
"We have had some degree of migration, but only a low percentage in recent years."
"However, mountain regions in Piedmont, Lombardy or the Veneto, for example, have been totally depopulated and have ultimately become back gardens for affluent areas in the big cities - and I am sure that are many similar examples in other EU Member States. If you consider those, it becomes clear how absolutely necessary it is to give those who have stayed on positive signals that changes are being made and that they will not have to wait for almost another decade."
"One possible measure would be for short-term changes to be introduced in competition policy."
"Classifying mountain regions as sensitive zones in the treaties would also give a strong signal with this in mind."
"In my view, both Parliament and the Commission have treated policy on mountain regions rather shabbily."
"Up to now, we have only had three debates on this topic in this House, something that I regret, even though the Commission rounded off the International Year of Mountains by organising the conference you have already mentioned in an effort to form a picture of the situation and invite or listen to everyone involved in that Year."
"This conference was held in Brussels in October thanks to the efforts of Commissioners Fischler and Barnier. However, it would also certainly be advantageous if you could make a strong case to the Commission for it to take due account of the report on this subject adopted by the European Parliament on 9 September last year and to act accordingly."
"By way of conclusion, let me briefly mention the Alpine Convention."
"The Commission has been completely inactive in this area."
"The picture you painted was not quite accurate."
"It is not so much the signatory states to the Alpine Convention that have not done their homework, as the Commission, which has signed only three protocols and for cost reasons has even stopped turning up to meetings."
"I think there is an urgent need for action here."
"Madam President, our hearts leap up as we talk about mountains today, although, as always, the numbers in the Chamber are on the low side."
"The very fact that this debate is being held is an achievement and I would say that, this year, in honour of the International Year of Mountains, the European Parliament too has endeavoured to make its contribution."
"The Commission and I remember that memorable seminar of 17-18 October, we discussed this matter in the context of the mid-term review of the common agricultural policy and Agenda 2000 too, and we are discussing it today."
"It is a shame that, as always, this is an intimate conversation between a few friends, but that has always been the fate of the mountains in the history of the Community."
"Madam President, if you were to do a little research on the Internet and search in our databases for the word 'mountain', you would find three references to past resolutions."
"The first was tabled by a certain Mr Colleselli in 1983, the second tabled by myself in 1998 and the third tabled in 2001 by Mr Ebner, who spoke just now."
"If you add these names to the few Members present today in this Chamber, you have the mountain people, the champions of the mountains, if I may be so bold as to use that phrase."
"However, mountains, as we know, cover 30% of the Community's territory. In countries such as my own, Italy, and in Greece, Portugal and Spain too, over 50% of the land is defined as mountainous."
"Why, then, has there been so little attention paid to mountains throughout history?"
"Because the inhabitants of the mountain regions are few."
"Between 5 and 7% of the European citizens live in mountain regions, on average."
"There are few inhabitants who are therefore unable to form a strong lobby in terms of either numbers or wealth."
"That is a shame, for this may well be a historic time for the mountains in terms of their future and prospects."
"First and foremost, they have to convert their diversity from the weakness it has been hitherto into added value in order to start to exploit the genuine potential they offer."
"Europe is not a depressed region: it is a complex, complete economic and social system."
"I would say that, strangely, Europe does not need economic assistance so much as credibility and specific legislation which will allow it to launch its initiatives for the future."
"That, Madam President, is why, if you search for a directive in the database, you will find that the most recent directive dates back to 1975."
"Twenty-seven, almost thirty years have passed: the mountains have changed dramatically in that time but we are still working with a very outdated directive."
"What, then, can we suggest?"
"Some of the Members have already made proposals and I too would like to make some demands. We must cling to the proposals of Article 158, which the Commissioner mentioned just now."
"This article calls upon the European Union to reduce and avoid development divides between the regions of Europe."
"Then the same article recognises the specific situation of the Community's islands."
"We are not demanding another article or a different legal basis: we are asking for the specific situation of the mountains, at least, to be recognised alongside the specific situation of the islands."
"It is clear for all to see that the mountains are different from the rest of the territory: they are different environmentally, biologically and in terms of natural history and social conditions."
"In this regard, I would mention a suggestion made by Mr Mantovani - who is unable to be here because he was unable to get a flight at an appropriate time - who laments the fact that, in addition to the environmental and economic problems, life is difficult in the mountain regions when it comes to healthcare too."
"When a hospital closes in a mountain region a serious problem is created. When, in particular, healthcare networks are insufficient, genuine difficulties ensue."
"That is why the mountains need overall, general measures."
"All we have to do is give them a hand: they are not asking for aid, they are just asking for a little attention and, as I said just now, for the specific nature of their situation to be recognised."
"I would like to take the opportunity presented by this extremely interesting debate on the mountain regions to congratulate Mr Ebner and Mr Radwan on the very impressive and agreeable way in which they have taught us something about the mountain regions this week by arranging this splendid exhibition and celebration here."
"It has been a great success and I would like to thank them for having presented these wonderful regions in the South Tyrol and Upper Bavaria to us in such an excellent way!"
"Allow me to add that Swedish mountain regions too have been presented in Parliament in recent times."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is debates on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law (Rule 50 of the Rules of Procedure)."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following seven proposals for resolutions on Hong Kong:"
"B5-0643/2002 by Mr Andreasen, Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, Mr Van den Bos and Mr Watson on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party on Hong Kong,"
"B5-0645/2002 by Mr Sjöstedt, Mrs Eriksson, Mrs Frahm and Mr Di Lello Finuoli on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left on Hong Kong's constitution,"
"B5-0649/2002 by Mr Gahrton and Mr Wuori on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance on Article 23 of Hong Kong's constitution,"
"B5-0650/2002 by Mr van den Berg on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists on Article 23 of Hong Kong's constitution,"
"B5-0653/2002 by Mr Belder on behalf of the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities on Article 23 of Hong Kong's constitution,"
"B5-0655/2002 by Mr Cushnahan, Mr Posselt and Mr Sacrédeus on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats on Article 23 of Hong Kong's constitution,"
"B5-0657/2002 by Mrs Muscardini, Mr Ribeiro e Castro and Mr Queiró on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group on Article 23 of Hong Kong's constitution."
"Madam President, Commissioner, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is extremely concerned about the planned change to Article 23 of Hong Kong's constitution."
"In conversation, journalists, politicians, various religious groups, representatives of human rights organisations and organisations such as Falun Gong all express great anxiety faced with this planned change."
"The strength of Hong Kong lies in its success in retaining the principle of one country, two systems."
"I, together with many others, fear that this change will seriously undermine that principle, something which would naturally be completely unacceptable."
"The fact that China is pressing for this change to take place is not reassuring."
"We know that China often puts pressure on Hong Kong to get it to accept legislation there that exists in China."
"I am afraid that the way in which Article 23 is being interpreted may lead to the disappearance of fundamental freedoms such as academic freedom, freedom of expression, freedom of organisation and religious freedom."
"If a group such as Falun Gong, which is banned in China, were also to be banned in Hong Kong, it would be a serious offence against the principle of one country, two systems."
"It is not only I who am concerned."
"The major demonstration at the weekend, in which thousands of Hong Kong citizens protested about the change, shows that the Hong Kong authorities have not succeeded in reassuring their own citizens, and they are not therefore reassuring ourselves, either."
"If the change is only a technical one, as Hong Kong maintains, the point needs to be made extremely clearly."
"I am afraid that that is not the way it is."
"I hope that the Commission will look into this issue very carefully."
"I also wish to appeal to the Hong Kong authorities to extend the period of referral for consideration and to be extremely vigilant where these changes are concerned."
"We hope that Hong Kong will not adopt the Chinese system of general rules that permit the completely arbitrary persecution of political opponents."
"Like Mrs Malmström, we particularly fear for Falun Gong supporters, whose peaceful protest does not justify persecution in any form."
"Hong Kong must be allowed to remain what it is, in the expectation that China will also go down the road to democracy and human rights."
"Only on this basis can we maintain the dialogue and the cooperation."
"When I visited China along with some members of our Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I noticed the extent to which the Hong Kong economic model was held up as an example to the big cities on the Chinese mainland."
"Yet the concept of 'one country, two systems' still applies in the areas of human rights, democracy and freedom of speech."
"In that regard, Hong Kong still to this day remains a unique phenomenon in the Chinese sphere of influence."
"Many people in China told us that developments towards greater democratisation and human rights could be expected in the future."
"We therefore view with the greatest concern the creation of the law to combat subversive activities in Hong Kong."
"We fear that this will be at the expense of freedom of speech, the objective administration of justice, religious and artistic freedom, scientific freedom and so on. This would be precisely the opposite of what we have always hoped for, which is that one large area of democracy and human rights will be allowed to come into existence."
"Madam President, one country, two systems."
"It sounds almost too good to be true for Hong Kong."
"Article 23 of the Basic Law, however, is a potential time bomb under all of this."
"This article requests the drafting of laws against a whole range of serious crimes against the government of the People's Republic of China."
"The Hong Kong authorities have embarked upon the implementation of this highly controversial article at a most inopportune moment, and in a manner that lacks transparency."
"That is why the residents of Hong Kong came out on the streets en masse at the beginning of this week."
"Does Hong Kong really give Peking reason to fear treason, secession, unrest, subversive activities, theft of state secrets or dangerous foreign political activities or connections?"
"No!"
"Yet the Chinese authorities are insisting on the implementation of Article 23."
"Mark you, this is an article that was given its current form only after the bloodbath in Peking's Tienanmen Square ."
"Article 23 therefore reflects Chinese Communist paranoia, both past and present."
"The same can be said of Hong Kong's citizens' fears then and now."
"While Hong Kong is going through a difficult economic period, Peking is making matters worse with its crippling political uncertainty."
"Even the business sector in Hong Kong is reacting negatively, and that speaks volumes."
"It reflects the broad dissatisfaction amongst the populace with a desultory consultation process on the legal implementation of Article 23."
"What is lacking is the publication of the exact draft laws."
"The Council and Commission must therefore address the powers that be in Hong Kong and Peking on this matter quickly, as the European Union is serious about maintaining the principle of 'one country, two systems' for Hong Kong."
"Madam President, since July 1997, the European Parliament has been a staunch defender of the autonomy of Hong Kong under the 'one-country two-systems' policy."
"In pursuit of this policy, we have worked constructively with the Hong Kong administration, reflected by the attendance of the former Chief Secretary Anson Chan and her successor, Donald Tsang, at meetings of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy."
"It is therefore appropriate that we should continue to monitor developments which could in any way undermine the autonomy of Hong Kong and threaten fundamental freedoms."
"Enactment of legislation under Article 23 has raised such concerns."
"While I welcome the personal guarantee given by Chief Secretary Donald Tsang that he will not allow the freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong citizens to be undermined, this must be reflected in the proposed legislation."
"Last weekend, a large demonstration in Hong Kong illustrated the genuine concerns that Article 23 laws could undermine existing human rights and civil and religious liberties."
"I share these concerns and I urge the Hong Kong SAR Government to address them in the final proposals that they bring forward."
"In particular, the new laws must not violate the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, nor must they in any way undermine the independence of the Hong Kong courts and their right to exercise the power of final jurisdiction."
"The reinterpretation of the Basic Law by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress during the right-of-abode case is still fresh in many people's minds."
"There must not be a repeat of this with regard to Article 23 issues."
"I would ask the Hong Kong authorities to take note of this debate, to take note of this resolution, especially our request for the publication of a draft bill which should be subject to further consultation."
"Madam President, I begin by declaring an interest as the joint president of the Hong Kong Friendship Group, joint, that is, as with my good friend and colleague, Mr De Clercq, from the ELDR Group."
"The first point I would like to make - and this has been alluded to by my friend and colleague, Mr Cushnahan - is that Hong Kong cannot pass law under its constitution if it contravenes the international standards of human rights."
"My second point is that all countries need security legislation."
"I would argue that even what is proposed is milder than the recent Homelands Security Act passed in the United States, without much obvious protest from this House."
"We asked the Hong Kong authorities to ensure that the Article 23 proposal would not be used to silence opposition."
"I shall give a couple of quotes."
"A few days ago on 27 November, Mr Antony Leung, the Financial Secretary, was in the European Parliament."
"From the minutes of the meeting he attended - and I quote: 'He gave a very personal reassurance of the government's commitment to upholding the rule of law and the guarantees of human rights and freedoms set out in the Basic Law and enshrined in the Hong Kong legal system'."
"That was in front of our Members very recently."
"A few days ago, on 10 December, the former financial secretary, now acting Chief Executive, Donald Tsang, said in a speech in Hong Kong: 'The free flow of information, the freedom to say and do what we want are the very fabric of Hong Kong society'."
"I put it to you that there is concern."
"I also look forward to having a clear and detailed provision and would like to see a draft bill for us to debate."
"But let us concentrate on getting good legislation, and not fall victim to those who want to campaign against the PRC by proxy."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has been closely following the public debate surrounding the proposal adopted by the Hong Kong regional government on the implementation of Article 23 of Hong Kong's Basic Law."
"The Commission is conscious of the enormous significance and political sensitivity of this initiative, especially as regards the development of Hong Kong and China as a whole."
"As this proposal by the regional government has been framed in very general terms, it will not be possible to judge this draft law properly until it is presented to Hong Kong's Legislative Council."
"That will probably happen in February 2003."
"The Commission's approach is based on the assumption that a wide-ranging consultation process will now take place, and that this will subsequently be extended to the detailed legislative provisions as soon as they are presented to the Legislative Council."
"The Commission believes that it is very important for the views expressed by various groups during this consultation process to be taken fully into account when drafting the future legislative provisions."
"Furthermore, the proposed legislative provisions and their application should not undermine the preservation of a constitutional system or respect for human rights and basic freedoms in Hong Kong, in accordance with its 'one country, two systems' principle."
"Lastly, in accordance with Hong Kong's Basic Law, the legislation proposed must be compatible with UN agreements on civil and political rights and on economic, social and cultural rights."
"The European Union is carefully monitoring developments in this area through its ambassadors."
"On the basis of their recommendations it intends to transmit a declaration to the Hong Kong regional government at the highest possible level and as soon as possible, and in any case before the end of the consultation process on 24 December; this declaration will emphasise the European Union's commitment to the principles I have just mentioned."
"Thank you, Commissioner Schreyer."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following four resolutions on the destruction of cultural heritage in Hebron:"
"B5-0644/2002 by Mrs Morgantini, Mrs Boudjenah, Mr Herman Schmid, Mr Seppänen, Mr Cossuta and Mr Miranda da Silva on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left on the destruction of cultural heritage in Hebron,"
"B5-0647/2002 by Mr Lagendijk, Mrs Boumediene-Thiery, Mr Dhaene, Mr Gahrton and Mrs Isler-Béguin on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance on the destruction of cultural heritage in Hebron,"
"B5-0652/2002 by Mr Trentin and Mr van den Berg on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists on the destruction of cultural heritage in Hebron,"
"B5-0654/2002 by Mr Perry and Mr Morillon on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats on the destruction of cultural heritage in Hebron."
"Madam President, the destruction of their cultural heritage is an open wound which bleeds constantly for the Palestinians."
"Between 1948 and 1952, the Israeli Government destroyed 420 Palestinian villages, as documented by Israeli historians."
"Some of the Arab districts of Jaffa were destroyed."
"In 1967, after the occupation of East Jerusalem, the Moroccan quarter of the Old City was destroyed to make room for a large square in front of the Wailing Wall."
"Throughout these years of military occupation, permission was never granted for restoration of the historic parts of the various cities."
"After the Oslo agreement and the creation of the Palestinian Authority, a very enthusiastic start was made on restoring the Old Cities of Nablus, Bethlehem and Hebron."
"In the past two years, with the reoccupation of the autonomous territories, the destruction caused by the Israeli tanks and bombings has been huge."
"Sixty-six palaces built between the thirteenth and eighteenth centuries have been destroyed, including the caravanserai, the Turkish bath and the old soap factories."
"Today, it is the turn of the Old City of Hebron, where the houses are next to the Tomb of the Patriarchs: Mameluk and Ottoman houses and houses from the British Mandate."
"This is more than just a question of preserving old buildings however: the Old Cities are inhabited by women, men and children, like those in the refugee camps in Jenin and Rafah who have no roof over their heads."
"Moreover, their numbers have risen to over 15 000 in the past two years."
"The official justification given by the Israeli authorities in the military decree providing for the demolition of the houses in Hebron talks of security and military grounds."
"Nothing could be further from the truth. Ariel Sharon has clearly said that there is a need to build a link between the settlement of Qiriat Arba and the Tomb of the Patriarchs."
"This is annexing of territory, for the Qiriat Arba settlements are illegal."
"It is true that the decision was taken to destroy the Old City, the subject of our resolution today, after an armed attack by a Palestinian group killed nine people, army soldiers and armed guards from the settlements. It is true that, in some cases, the houses destroyed in the West Bank belong to families in which a son, brother or cousin has taken the tragic, horrific decision to kill himself and Israeli civilians, but over 2000 houses have been destroyed in the past two years!"
"This does not give the Israelis a licence to violate international law and the Geneva Convention, which clearly bans collective punishment, the destruction of property and the killing of civilians."
"Over 2000 houses have been demolished in these past 2 years and 20 000 people have been wounded."
"I am sad to say that there have been many Israeli deaths too - over 600 now."
"Israel is an occupying country which is violating the obligation laid down by the fourth Geneva Convention to move its people out of the occupied territories - there are over 400 000 settlers now - and should be ensuring the well-being and providing for the needs of the Palestinian people, whereas 72% of Palestinians are unemployed and confined in the villages."
"The first illegal fact is the military occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, which has now been in effect since 1967."
"Israel can no longer be allowed to continue to violate all international legislation, inflicting pain and suffering not just on the Palestinians but on its own people too."
"We must send out a signal to the Palestinians to give them hope of justice and to enable them to prevent the growth of fundamentalism. We must send out a signal to the Israeli Government so that it knows that it cannot always act outside the law, playing on the threat of anti-Semitism and terrorism."
"Our only concern is for there not to be two sets of checks and balances: human rights and the right to life are equal for all people."
"Today's resolution sets a limit: the demolition must stop."
"We must act alongside those Israelis who, together with the Palestinians, have appealed against the demolition of the homes in Hebron and are going to demonstrate tomorrow in Hebron, for the cultural heritage of Hebron and Palestine is part of the cultural heritage of mankind and must be preserved, not destroyed."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Middle East has a unique heritage, rich in symbols and history."
"But that heritage, which for too long has undergone the colonial conflict ravaging Palestine, is in danger of disappearing."
"Many age-old historical centres have been devastated, destroyed by the Israeli occupying forces."
"In Hebron, the army is preparing to destroy around one hundred houses bordering the prayer route."
"It is a real corridor, riddled with watchtowers and only accessible to the settlers, which will be developed to link the settlement to the tomb of the patriarchs, the symbol of the three religions, which Israel wishes to appropriate."
"Hebron is a blatant example of apartheid."
"The town is separated in two by a large road used only by Israelis, and some streets are entirely forbidden to Palestinians."
"This is a symbol of a downward spiral that can only lead to an escalation of violence."
"During the conflict, Palestinian heritage has become a major political issue."
"The foundations of cultural sites are giving way under the attacks from Israeli tanks and helicopters, which are also battering public and professional buildings, schools, houses and refugee camps, causing thousands of civilian casualties."
"Is that not true terrorism, military terrorism, state terrorism?"
"Israel is thus clearly showing that a Palestinian identity has no place in its plans to extend the settlements."
"This idea of eradicating the history and memory of the Palestinian people is a result of the Israeli State's quest for legitimacy."
"I would also like to commend the courage of civilian and international missions, which with no power to intervene but the right to report and observe, are playing a moderating and protective role."
"Through their action on the ground, they are carrying out citizen's diplomacy where our international diplomacy is unable to intervene."
"We must urgently condemn what are genuine crimes against humanity's shared cultural heritage, demand that the Hague conventions and Geneva conventions on the protection of goods and persons be respected and ask the Commission to call on the UN Security Council to send an intervention force to protect the Palestinian people, their cultural and historical heritage and their environment."
"Let us remember that fair and sustainable peace for these two populations can only be based on respect for international law, the withdrawal of settlements and occupation forces and the creation of a Palestinian State within the 1967 borders."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in a few days' time it will be Christmas and we are calling in our resolution for worshippers to be allowed to visit the Church of the Nativity at Christmas."
"Things really have come to a pretty pass, all as the result of indifference or negligence or fanaticism."
"A few part-sessions ago we were passing resolutions to protect infrastructures in Palestine, because they were infrastructures built with European Union money."
"Now we are passing resolutions to protect the cultural heritage because nowhere on earth does the cultural heritage belong to the Sharons or Arafats of this world; it belongs to history and to the people."
"In this sense, we now need to realise that the resolution system is too limited to bring in results."
"In Copenhagen a few days ago, the European Union showed that it can act decisively and intervene when it has to."
"This being so, it makes no sense to stand and watch the machinations going on in the Middle East, the clashes, the destruction, the loss of human life on all sides."
"We now need to apply a different policy, a different sort of decisiveness, in order to stop this endless, stalemate of a crisis."
"Settlement policies, terrorist policies - not that terrorism qualifies as a policy - offer no prospects or framework for a solution of any kind."
"Ladies and gentlemen, when a few months or rather a couple of years ago, we watched the destruction of the Buddha statues by the Taliban on our televisions, we said, who do they think they are, destroying the history of mankind?"
"Today the same is happening on our very doorstep."
"And we just stand and watch."
"It is not our job in these circumstances to stand and watch."
"It is not our job to complain."
"Our job is to intervene."
"An end to settlements!"
"They get us nowhere."
"An end to destruction!"
"It gets us nowhere."
"And an end to terrorist action!"
"It gets us nowhere."
"We need to keep to the policy decided years ago by Arafat and Prime Minister Rabin, God rest his soul."
"Therein lies the way forward, therein lies the solution."
"No other policy makes sense."
"Having said which, a European Union of the twenty-five which wants to play a political role and intervene in international affairs needs to change its tactics on this issue."
"It is no good being in the audience."
"It needs to play the lead role and now it has the chance to play the role which it should have been playing for years."
"Thank you for listening and Merry Christmas."
"Madam President, it is with the utmost care that I take the floor once again on the painful issue of the Middle East."
"It may seem derisory or even distressing at first sight for Parliament to issue another resolution on this subject, this time to protect stones, however loaded with history they may be, while human lives continue to be sacrificed every day in the infernal spiral of violence and fear, blood and vengeance that has been unleashed in this land that is so dear to so many of us."
"Although the PPE-DE Group is nevertheless taking part in this debate today, it does so aware and with the conviction that the action announced by the Israeli authorities to safeguard access to the Kiriat Arba settlement can only have disastrous consequences for the development of the continuing conflict, without genuinely guaranteeing the security of its, the settlement's, inhabitants."
"My experience of the previous conflicts that I was involved in, both in Algeria, nearly fifty years ago, and more recently in the Balkans, taught me that no wall, even it is surrounded by mines and watched over by the most sophisticated methods, is insurmountable."
"However, like our colleague Mr Souladakis, even more recently, I have not forgotten the horrified reaction from the public worldwide following the destruction of the Bamyan Buddhas, which triggered the unanimous condemnation of the Taliban regime."
"This is why, while not wishing to be the judge, and even less the prosecutor, of a situation in which the European Union, as Mr Souladakis rightly said, has not yet succeeded in establishing a role, we can only draw the attention of the Israeli authorities to the significance of the consequences of any decision leading to the destruction, or even partial destruction, of the ancient city of Hebron."
"Madam President, the destruction of cultural heritage in Hebron is very symbolic."
"The power of oppression originating from it is not only destroying houses and stone; it is destroying people and their existence."
"It is killing them."
"The State of Israel is oppressing the Palestinian people, with the clearly displayed or hypocritical collusion of all the major powers."
"Why should the extreme right-wing powers in Israel be worried by the friendly admonishments from the major powers every now and again when the Israeli army goes beyond certain limits?"
"Mr Sharon is aware that what he is doing in Israel is simply a copy of what the United States' leaders did in Afghanistan and are preparing to do in Iraq."
"Why should Mr Sharon be bothered by the empty protestations from countries who pretend to distance themselves somewhat from his policies, such as France, when that very country is in the process of engaging in a dirty war itself?"
"The French army is not protecting the population against ethnic and xenophobic killings; it is protecting the clique in power that is carrying them out."
"The rebels are undoubtedly no better, but it is not for the French army to act as arbiter or policeman."
"By protecting the government in power, it is mainly protecting the French corporations that have major interests there."
"So yes, the Israeli army should withdraw from Palestine and the French army should leave Côte d'Ivoire and Africa."
"Madam President, this is not, unfortunately, the first time that Israel has vandalised religious and cultural monuments and contravened the Venice Charter and all the UNESCO and ICOMOS conventions, without the world's protesting."
"This time, the world's protests should be as vociferous as they were following the barbaric destruction of the Buddha statues in Afghanistan."
"We are concerned here with an irreplaceable heritage of buildings of religious and cultural value, from the Mameluk period in the fifteenth century to the Ottoman period in the nineteenth century - cultural treasures that belong not merely to the Palestinians but to the whole world."
"The destruction of these cultural treasures has nothing to do with security and self-defence."
"It is pure vengeance, and vengeance that will increase the spiral of violence in which, far removed from the public eye, Israeli soldiers and settlers kill Palestinian civilians with tanks and rifles, while young Palestinians, in the full media spotlight, blow themselves up."
"More than three hundred homes face destruction."
"The historic town of Hebron, with its unique architecture and religious importance, will never be the same again."
"It is a disgrace, and the EU must call upon the world community to accept responsibility for stopping the destruction."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is deeply concerned about the planned destruction of Palestinian families' homes in the old town of Hebron."
"Not only are these buildings of cultural and historical significance, but the planned action will also add further to the suffering of innocent Palestinian civilians."
"The European Union has condemned the attack by Palestinian militants on 15 November in which 12 Israeli soldiers were killed."
"The Commission cannot, however, see how the measures planned would increase security in Hebron; if anything, these measures will serve to exacerbate the situation, which is already extremely tense."
"The Commission considers that the destruction of historic Palestinian dwellings is in breach of the Hebron Protocol agreed by Israel and the Palestinian Autonomy Authority in 1997."
"That protocol commits both parties to preserving and protecting the historic character of the town, so that no part of its heritage is damaged or changed."
"The Commission also wishes to draw Parliament's attention to the recent conclusions of the European Council held in Copenhagen, when the Council expressed its alarm at the expansion of settlements and related construction work."
"It called upon Israel as a matter of urgency to reverse its settlement policy, to freeze settlement construction and halt the confiscation of any further land."
"Thank you, Commissioner Schreyer."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following six proposals for resolutions on Tibet:"
"B5-0642/2002 by Mr Andreasen, Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel and Mr Van den Bos on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party on Tibet,"
"B5-0646/2002 by Mr Sjöstedt, Mrs Eriksson, Mrs Frahm and Mr Di Lello Finuoli on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left on the human rights situation in Tibet,"
"B5-0648/2002 by Mr Messner, Mr Gahrton, Mrs Maes and Mr Wuori on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance on the human rights situation in Tibet,"
"B5-0651/2002 by Mr van den Berg on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists on the human rights situation for Tibetans in Szechuan Province,"
"B5-0656/2002 by Mr Mann and Mr Posselt on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats on the human rights situation in Tibet,"
"B5-0658/2002 by Mrs Angelilli on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group on the human rights situation in Tibet."
"Madam President, Commissioner, we have discussed Tibet many times here in this Chamber."
"This will certainly not be the last time, either."
"There is a very great deal of solidarity with the Tibetan people here in the European Parliament."
"The Tibetan people have for many years been exposed to appalling treatment by Beijing, and this is continuing."
"Perhaps there is, however, a very small light at the end of the tunnel inasmuch as a cautious dialogue has been instituted between Beijing and representatives of the Dalaï Lama."
"The fact that two people like Ngawang Sangdrol and Jigme Sangpo - two very well-known prisoners of conscience to whom attention has been drawn on several occasions in this Chamber - have now been released from their long-term imprisonment is also very positive."
"There are, however, many more prisoners."
"I do not believe that this development indicates any fundamental policy change on the part of China."
"I only wish that it did."
"I do not, however, believe that that is the case."
"It is, at any rate, a step on the way."
"It is all the more worrying, therefore, that the two Buddhist Tibetans, Tenzin Delek and Lobsang Dhondup have now been sentenced to death."
"They were in the wrong place at the wrong time and have now been branded as terrorists."
"They have not been given anything in the way of a fair trial; no evidence has been presented; they have been kept in total isolation for eight months; and now they are to be executed."
"The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party demands a fair legal process in accordance with the rule of law and treatment in accordance with international conventions."
"As always, we condemn the death penalty wherever it is practised."
"China's contribution to the international fight against terrorism appears so far, unfortunately, to have been confined to Beijing's branding opposition dissidents and various minorities as terrorists and in that way obtaining an excuse for oppressing them."
"That is not how matters should proceed."
"The fight against terrorism must always be combined with the rule of law."
"We shall continue to fight for the rights of Tibet, continue to condemn all human rights violations in China and hope that the Commission will step up the human rights dialogue with China."
"Tibet is an area with its own culture, its own religion and its own political traditions."
"It is also a so-called autonomous region in China, however meaningless this autonomy is in practice."
"Every attempt to achieve real autonomy is, after all, regarded as a crime, giving rise to legal proceedings, and the concept of political offences is unknown in China."
"Political opponents are simply treated as common criminals."
"The struggle against terrorism provides yet another excuse for this."
"The death sentences against Tenzin Delek, an influential Buddhist lama, and his assistant, Lobsang Dhondup, pronounced on 3 December, are a sad illustration of this."
"We regard the accusations as unproven, but the way in which the two people were held in solitary confinement and ultimately sentenced to death after months of incarceration and after a mockery of a trial, confounds us."
"These death sentences must not be allowed to be carried out; the verdicts must be reviewed on the basis of a fair trial."
"The dialogue between China and the representatives of the Dalai Lama, who inspires so much hope in this hemisphere, must be resumed, but we must not be naïve in our relationships with this big country."
"They pay a great deal of attention to what we think of them, but we must not allow ourselves to be blinded by diversionary tactics."
"We must see what is actually happening and bring about change judicially and in practice."
". (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as a member of the Delegation for relations with the People's Republic of China I have recently been able to hold many fascinating discussions with my Chinese counterparts."
"I had gained the impression that a real opening up, a genuine dialogue on human rights was actually going to take place."
"So I too very much welcomed the release of both Ngawang Sangdrol and Jigme Sangpo."
"We regarded that as a sign that pledges were being honoured and promises were being kept."
"We very much welcomed the fact that Li Peng honoured his commitment finally to enter into contact with the Dalai Lama and that initial discussions were actually being held with representatives of the Dalai Lama."
"We regarded these as two very positive signs."
"So we are all the more dismayed now that at exactly the same time two people, Tenzin Delek and Lobsang Dhondup - a lama and one of his followers - were arrested and kept in solitary confinement for six or even eight months, although to this day it has not been established beyond doubt that they really committed the act of which they were accused."
"This is totally contrary to the constitutionality that we naturally expect and demand from a people or from a government."
"We understand very well that the fight against terrorism is important, but that means combating genuine terrorism, not dissidents."
"The fight against terrorism must of course also respect constitutional criteria, otherwise it cannot be justified."
"I only hope that this was a blunder that will be very quickly rectified by the Chinese Government, and that these two people will be released or will at least receive a fair trial."
"I also hope that China will make sure that the door to human rights, which has been very slightly opened, will not be slammed shut again but will be opened further, so that genuine constitutionality may also prevail in China."
"Madam President, things did indeed get off to a promising start. In September an official delegation from the Dalai Lama visited China's leaders."
"In October, the nun Ngawang Sangdrol was released after decades of imprisonment, following massive international protests, including those from the European Parliament itself."
"A considerable number of Members of this House had repeatedly nominated her for the Sakharov Prize."
"Did these welcome steps on the part of the Chinese amount merely to political manoeuvring in the run-up to their President's visit to the USA?"
"Will the path to constructive dialogue now peter out again in the aftermath of the Communist party conference and the far-reaching changes in personnel brought about by it?"
"Are the hardliners getting the upper hand?"
"We have heard some alarming reports recently."
"At the beginning of December, as other Members have mentioned, two Tibetans were sentenced to death by the Kardze People's Court after a trial so rushed that doubt must be cast on its legality."
"They were accused of owning illegal weapons, of separatism and of taking part in an attack using explosives carried out in Chengdu in April."
"One of those involved is the Tibetan Tulku Tenzin Delek, who has a death sentence hanging over him with a two-year reprieve."
"He has been committed to preserving Tibetan culture, language and religion for decades."
"He founded new monasteries and championed the social well-being of the public."
"His colleague Lobsang Dhondup also faces a death penalty, without reprieve."
"It is evident that neither of the two defendants received a fair trial."
"International standards were breached."
"For example, Tenzin Delek spent eight months in solitary confinement without any contact with his family or with lawyers, which is clearly in violation of the UN's minimum standards for the treatment of prisoners."
"The authorities demanded the payment of bail equivalent to EUR 120 000 before a proper trial could be initiated."
"His students were arrested when they tried to raise the money."
"This is a flagrant violation of international human rights."
"It is imperative for the Chinese authorities to maintain legal standards."
"However necessary the war on terrorism may be, and however much we may all support it, it cannot be waged without respect for the law and for human rights."
"It is totally unacceptable for the peaceful struggle to practice Tibetan religion and culture to be treated as an act of terrorism."
"On behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats, I call on the Commission immediately to raise these unfair verdicts under the dialogue on human rights with the Chinese."
"We must prevent unlawful sentences from being executed and the grant of financial aid must be made dependent on improvements in the area of human rights."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I urge you to stir your Member States' embassies in Beijing into action without delay, so that these defendants can be given a fair trial."
"The first step must be to lift the death sentence."
"Lastly, as Chairman of Parliament's Tibet Intergroup, I would like to express my hope that the forces of reason will prevail in China and that our worldwide campaign for human rights and the rule of law will succeed."
"Madam President, as others have already said, these death sentences have absolutely nothing to do with the war on terrorism."
"However, that also demonstrates that we have a responsibility to wage that war."
"The United States also bears that responsibility within the international institutions, the United Nations and under international law."
"If you only fight terrorism - and that is unfortunately a danger that also exists in Washington - strictly by means of a coalition of the major powers, there is a risk that those powers will misuse that war on terror for their own ends: Moscow will use it against the Chechens and Beijing will use it against Tibet."
"We need to be fully aware that the sort of repression that has been practised in Tibet or in Chechnya is no way to fight terrorism, it will simply engender it."
"We were talking earlier on about mountain regions."
"A few decades back there were even bomb attacks here in the Community, in the South Tyrol, which is nowadays a peaceful model region of Europe of which we can be proud."
"There were even extremist movements in our European democracies."
"That sounds unlikely today, because by granting autonomy we have ensured that no one takes separatist or terrorist action. We now feel comfortable in the greater community of Europeans and regard ourselves as being at the heart of Europe."
"My message to the Chinese is therefore this: 'Give the Tibetans autonomy, give them democracy, and give them human rights!'"
"That is the way to fight terrorism and separatism."
"That is a successful approach that will not lead to terrorism but will genuinely bring peace and ensure that peace will prevail in the world's most important and most historically precious mountain region, peace that can be a model for the entire world."
"The motion for a resolution before us has much to recommend it, but the wording is rather infelicitous, by which I mean the phrase 'the Tibetan minority in China'."
"Of course, in comparison with China's massive population, we are all minorities."
"However, what we are talking about here is the great Tibetan people with its ancient world culture, which is a valuable heritage for mankind."
"We appeal to the Chinese to respect this people and its culture as full partners, just as we treat the Tibetans and Chinese as equals."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Posselt is quite right, this is about a Tibetan majority within Tibet."
"Also, Mrs Maes, the problem raised today by these two death sentences reveals changes in the borders made by the Chinese."
"The Tibet of the autonomous region is one third of Tibet."
"There is also the province of Sichuan, a large proportion of which is part of the historic Tibet."
"Those who spoke before me discussed this."
"Three months ago, there was a sign of hope for some on the return of Kelsang Gyaltsen and Lodi Gyari, the Dalai Lama's envoys who went on an official visit to Peking for the first time in a long while."
"Meanwhile, a small change has taken place in the People's Republic of China. Hu Jintao has become the new President, the Secretary General of the Chinese Communist Party."
"The result of the so-called dialogue that was undertaken is these two death sentences: those of Tenzin Delek and Lobsang Dhondup."
"Obviously, Mrs Gebhardt, there could be better signs emerging from this dialogue."
"Having said that, I think that above all we should question ourselves, as members of the European Parliament and as Europeans, on how we are supporting the Tibetan people."
"I think that we should seriously ask that question."
"There is a risk of exoticism, and a risk that the peaceful struggle of our Tibetan friends will not be capable of achieving the objective of freeing Tibet."
"This is an objective for the Tibetans, but also for all free men and women across the world."
"Nearly three years ago now, in June 2000, Parliament adopted a resolution inviting the governments of the Member States to recognise the exiled government of Tibet, the Dalai Lama's government."
"I believe that is how we can genuinely give power to our Tibetan friends and show our Chinese friends that the rule of law is based on solid foundations of dialogue, and not just on semblances of dialogue, on the crumbs of dialogue that they throw to the Tibetans and to us, the Europeans, to make us believe, as they have been doing for 40 years, that they want dialogue while each time they reject real dialogue and any political solution."
"The President of the exiled Tibetan Parliament, Professor Samdhong Rinpoche, has asked for restraint until June."
"I will restrain myself until June, but I think that from then on we should reconsider our entire approach to supporting the battle to free Tibet."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission welcomes Parliament's initiative in presenting a resolution on the human rights situation in Tibet."
"We are deeply concerned about the death sentence passed on Lobsang Dhondup and Tenzin Delek on 2 December."
"You may recall that Mr Delek was on the list of individual cases that we handed to the Chinese authorities under the human rights dialogue between the EU and China."
"The Commission is also concerned because these death sentences are the first to be passed against Tibetans because of alleged political crimes for some years."
"The Commission wishes to take this opportunity to inform Parliament that the EU troika raised this matter through diplomatic channels with the Chinese authorities on 13 December, at embassy level. The EU requested information on both these cases and in particular on what evidence had been presented, and called for the trials to be reopened in accordance with international standards for fair trials."
"Furthermore, the troika reaffirmed that the EU rejects the death penalty and its use in China in general, referring to the ongoing campaign of 'drastic action'."
"By virtue of this prompt intervention on the part of the European Union and because of pressure from the United States and Australia, the executions have so far not been carried out, and the two convicted men have entered appeals."
"The executions can therefore not be carried out until the People's Court has re-examined the case."
"Although we believe that the immediate danger of execution has been averted for the time being, the Commission will continue to follow this case very closely, particularly as regards the provision of solid evidence and guarantees of a fair trial."
"The European Union is also continuing to put pressure on China to guarantee the cultural, linguistic and religious identity of the Tibetan people."
"It has repeatedly called for the initiation of a direct dialogue between Beijing and the Dalai Lama, as this is likely to be the only way to secure a peaceful and lasting solution to the Tibetan question."
"Against this background, the Commission is encouraged by the positive news conveyed by the two envoys of the Dalai Lama who visited China in September 2002."
"We hope that this will be a first step towards the establishment of a more regular dialogue between Beijing and the Dalai Lama."
"The Commission intends to continue to take only such cooperative measures in Tibet as will directly benefit the Tibetan population."
"Thank you, Commissioner Schreyer."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place directly following the debate."
"Madam President, we suggest that because of the way the debate developed, the title here should be changed."
"I am sure that many speakers will be in favour of this proposal, which is to change the title to 'Situation des droits de l'homme des Tibétains' or 'Human rights situation of Tibetans'."
". (DE) Madam President, I would simply like to say that, in the interests of consistency, the same wording should also be used in Paragraph 7."
"I therefore request that this should be used throughout the resolution, in the title and in Paragraph 7."
"Madam President, I think that we also forgot to ask in item 8 for the resolution to be sent to the Dalai Lama and the exiled Tibetan Government, as is always done with our resolutions."
"That is a good point."
"We shall make sure that happens."
"(The President observed that no one had opposed the proposed oral amendments, as a result of which they were taken into account).1"
"Madam President, I am wondering whether you have just held a vote by roll call."
"My voting card was somewhere else, so I voted too late."
"Please will you note that I voted in favour?"
"We have noted the fact."
"The vote is concluded."
"EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE"
"on the report by Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou (A5-0403/2002)"
"The Swedish Moderate Party's delegation to the European Parliament has voted against Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou's report on the Commission's sixth annual report on Equal Opportunities in the European Union, 2001."
"We believe that equality proceeds from the equal value of every person and from every individual's right to respect for their person and their choices when it comes to personal, family and professional life."
"It is a matter of justice that no one should be discriminated against because of their gender or for other reasons."
"Any form of oppression, discrimination or stereotyping must be combated, and the opportunity of everyone to make free choices promoted."
"We do not therefore believe that the proposal in the report indicates the right road to go down."
"We oppose those parts of the report that recommend the adoption of quotas and what is termed positive discrimination."
"It is not the task of politicians to determine how private employers take their recruitment decisions in the light of these considerations."
"Mathematical redistribution does not mean justice and does not lead to genuine equality."
"Selection procedures for recruitment and admission to higher education should, however, ensure gender neutrality as far as possible."
"Moreover, we see the continued work on equality as being, in the first place, about changing attitudes in the long term, and we would emphasise the importance of schools in shifting attitudes in this direction."
"We believe that the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs should have responsibility for those issues now being dealt with by the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities."
"(FR) Yet another report on 'Equal Opportunities for Women and Men in the European Union', which will be followed up with as few actions as the previous ones."
"We voted in favour of it, of course, because of what it stands for, whilst being aware that it will not actually change anything at all."
"We could delude ourselves by saying that the delays are the result of the cumbersome nature of society, and that by repeating principles, the European Parliament will at least be able to be ahead of society."
"But that is not even true."
"To take just one example, in several countries that are already part of the European Union or in the process of joining it, abortion is practically forbidden and, in any event, highly restricted."
"The European institutions could take strong political measures by making women's rights a condition for membership of the Union."
"However, the Union, which is quite capable of breaking down barriers when it comes to the movement of goods and capital, is not able to do so when it comes to protecting the fundamental right of women to be in charge of their own bodies."
"Madam President, as our President already wished us a Happy Christmas at lunchtime today, which may explain why many Members have already inadvertently left, I would like to take this opportunity to thank you as our President for Thursday evening for your excellent chairmanship and to congratulate you."
"We wish you, and of course all the staff who have remained with us until this evening, a very Happy Christmas."
"I would thank you all and wish you a really merry Christmas and a happy New Year."
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"(The sitting was closed at 5.25 p.m.)"
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 19 December 2002."
"I must apologise for the late arrival of Mr Pat Cox, our President, but he is currently on his way rather slowly from Frankfurt."
"We expect him sometime soon."
"The House learnt with great sadness of the death last weekend of Roy Jenkins, a distinguished political leader, and a former Minister in the United Kingdom."
"The House will recall his four years as President of the European Commission."
"During his stewardship he launched the European Monetary System, the forerunner of the single currency."
"He was an outstanding and committed European and statesman, and I invite the House to observe one minute's silence in his memory."
"(The House rose and observed one minute's silence)"
"The final draft agenda as drawn up pursuant to Rules 110 and 110a of the Rules of Procedure by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday, 9 January 2003 has been distributed."
"Monday"
"You are too late to change today's agenda."
"That should have been notified by 4 p.m. today."
"Thursday"
"I have received from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance a request to remove the item 'Humanitarian crisis in North Korea' from the debate on breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law."
"Mr President, I would just like to explain why we are asking for this item to be removed from the agenda - moreover, we would then be in favour of the item on Illinois being included - and we would like to ask whether a statement on North Korea might be included on the agenda of the Brussels part-session at an appropriate time, given the country's announcement that it intends to withdraw from the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons."
"We feel it would be more appropriate for this item to be addressed in a more formal, more in-depth manner than will be possible in a last-minute topical and urgent debate."
"I will just clarify for the House that you are proposing that North Korea be taken in the second part-session this month."
"Mr President, our group has just been discussing this issue, and it is our opinion that the topicality and urgency of developments in North Korea make it imperative that this issue be dealt with this week."
"In the event of further discussion of this issue becoming necessary, we will sort that out at a future date."
"We are therefore against the topic of North Korea being removed from the list of topical and urgent matters for debate."
"Mr President, I would like to make a proposal to the Liberal Group that they withdraw this proposal and that the whole House should ask the President to make a statement on its behalf, addressed to the speakers of both Houses of the US Congress, expressing our pleasure at the decision of the Governor of Illinois."
"The reason is very simple: in Europe we are abolitionists and this is an issue which is even proposed as one of the Copenhagen conditions."
"Our colleagues in the US Congress are aware of our position, and it would be very difficult for my group to vote against the Liberal Group's proposal for procedural reasons, since we agree with it."
"We believe it would be more forceful and more helpful to the abolitionist campaign in the United States if we were to express our complete agreement and support for this decision by means of a statement by the President than to invoke urgency, which may seem somewhat polemical."
"Since we are in complete agreement, we could maintain the urgency and, at the same time, send a constructive and positive message to the US Congress, which is a partner of ours."
"Mr President, I am delighted with the support we have received from Mr Barón Crespo and the PSE Group."
"I can assure you that my group is deeply concerned about the situation in Chechnya and it is something which must command the attention of this House."
"However, it is something on which we have frequently expressed ourselves and there is no particular urgency."
"The action of the Governor of the State of Illinois in the United States is something we very much welcome."
"The position of this House, over many years, on this issue has been so consistent that we should take this opportunity to welcome what has happened, and indeed we should call on the 38 remaining states in the United States of America which still apply the death penalty to follow the example set in Illinois."
"It is for that reason that we maintain our request for an urgency on this subject."
"Mr President, I do not need at this present moment to say anything more about whether the motion from the Group of the European Liberals and Democrats should stand, or whether we are opposed to it."
"As Mr Barón Crespo has already expressed his opposition to the deletion of Chechnya from the agenda, I will not speak further on the subject."
"I am very much in favour of our also discussing Chechnya."
"Speaking on behalf of my group, though, I wish to associate myself with Mr Barón Crespo's proposal that we should - in view of the Liberals' inability to gain a majority on the subject - mandate the President to issue a statement in which, without risking our position being misunderstood, and without the statement being tinged with any sort of anti-Americanism, we express our opposition to capital punishment."
"Whilst being friendly towards America, we very definitely oppose the death penalty."
"That is hardly a matter for the agenda."
"It should be raised at another time."
"We will, however, take note of your comments."
"Mr President, I wanted simply to point out to Mrs Frassoni that we could still have added the subject of capital punishment in the Congo to the list of matters for topical and urgent debate without further ado if her group had not, at that time, needlessly voted to restrict the list of matters for topical and urgent debate to three topics on each occasion, which is of no use to anybody, and does not help matters."
"Thank you Mr Gollnisch."
"You are beginning to get into a very political matter."
"We are dealing with the agenda."
"I will inform you, if you listen, that the Iraq question will be debated at the Brussels part-session, at the end of January."
"You will have the opportunity to raise the matter then."
"Brussels part-session, January 2003"
"Wednesday:"
"I have received from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance a request for the inclusion of a Council and Commission statement on North Korea's withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty."
"The information brochure from our very own Parliament is being attacked by the chemical industry, by CEFIC."
"I have heard that our own President, Mr Cox, has decided to stop distributing this brochure, which is called Troubled Waters."
"I would like to ask you to make this brochure, which is presently only available in English and French, available to all representatives so that they can see for themselves that it does not mention any chemical companies at all by name."
"I think that Mr Cox's compromise of inserting a sticker or a sheet stating that the story is fictional, is unnecessary; to do so would be to bow to pressure from the chemical industry."
"That is something we must not do."
"It is an information brochure and a comic strip."
"I have the brochure here, and everyone can see that it is a comic strip and therefore fictional."
"In any event, I would ask that all representatives be given a copy of this comic strip, and I also think that it should be translated into all European languages."
"I understand that the document has not been withdrawn."
"It will be made available in all languages to colleagues in the House."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, while we were on our Christmas holidays, Touria Tiouli, a Frenchwoman and a citizen of the European Union, was in prison in Dubai."
"Having accused three men of rape, she was taken into custody as long ago as October, accused of relations sexuelles adulterines - extra-marital sexual intercourse - a bizarre interpretation of the law that degrades the victim still further and gets her jailed into the bargain."
"We have enshrined European human rights in the Treaties, and human dignity in the Charter, and regard these things as binding throughout the world."
"This scandal in Dubai, Mr President, makes it necessary that this be pointed out."
"I ask you to write on behalf of the European Parliament a letter that will get Touria Tiouli set at liberty and make it clear that we want nothing to do with states that treat human dignity with such contempt."
"I will make sure that is passed on to the President."
"Mr President, the news in recent weeks that initiatives to clone human beings are taking place in different parts of the world is very disturbing indeed."
"I very much welcome the support that has been given by the European Parliament and the European Commission to promote a worldwide ban on human cloning."
"We need to implement the necessary measures to stop those seeking to clone human beings in their tracks."
"It is an abhorrent and unethical practice which is totally irresponsible from a scientific point of view."
"We need to implement a worldwide convention which will ban human cloning within the next few months."
"The international community must act on this issue immediately."
"Only last November the European Parliament voted in favour of a proposal which I tabled calling for a universal ban on the cloning of human beings."
"We must work now towards achieving this objective via the structures of the United Nations."
"I would call on this Parliament and on your good offices, Mr President, to forward that immediately as a matter of urgency."
"Mr President, you did not draw attention to the fact that this month we are celebrating the 30th anniversary of the accession of the United Kingdom, Denmark and Ireland to the European Union."
"In the case of the United Kingdom, this accession has brought tremendous benefits to the citizens of the United Kingdom, creating jobs through increased trade, bringing in considerable investment, creating jobs, and benefiting our citizens through increased travel opportunities and education and employment."
"It has also particularly benefited the United Kingdom in relation to the social agenda, in particular the role of women, where the women's cause has been furthered in the United Kingdom, largely due to European legislation."
"This should therefore be an occasion to celebrate."
"You mentioned Roy Jenkins in your opening remarks."
"He, with the late John Smith, was responsible on the Labour side for ensuring that Britain became and remained a member of the European Union."
"Mr Titley, I am sure you are much more eloquent in these matters than I would be."
"Mr President, I would like to point out that the dialogue between the governments of the different Member States must be the main tool for resolving problems, especially in the case of neighbouring States."
"I am referring here specifically to the attitude of the Portuguese Government to the Andalusian fishermen."
"Simple violations, such as entering Portuguese waters, have recently, on two occasions, been responded to with machine-guns which, thanks to Providence, have not injured anybody."
"I would appeal for sanity and responsibility in order to find a solution to a problem we have had for decades."
"That matter should and will be referred to the Conference of Presidents."
"Mr President, I wish to bring what might appear at first sight to be a more prosaic matter to the House's attention but which relates, I think, to the way in which Parliament conducts its public relations and tells European citizens about how it works."
"We were told just a few days ago that the Bureau had approved the Quaestors' proposed decision on planned and approved per capita expenditure by the European Parliament which, contrary to all expectations, has been cut."
"And as far as I know, for my country and region at least, these are swathing cuts."
"For example, the week after next I shall be inviting a group of fifty people from Crete and, as far as I can see, the money approved so far will not even cover their tickets."
"As far as I am concerned, this is not just out of order; there is also a moral dimension to this issue."
"If the Bureau and the Quaestors wish to reduce planned expenditure, they should not tell us at the eleventh hour because we have already made other plans."
"I suggest that, if we want a serious decision here, this - to my mind, and I know others agree - unacceptable decision on the part of the Bureau to approve this proposal should be postponed until further notice."
"I am sure a number of colleagues would express similar concerns."
"I can assure you that the College of Quaestors will look into the matter and will possibly come forward with new proposals."
"The existing arrangements, however, will stay in place until that change is actually made."
"Your visitors from Greece will be adequately covered."
"Mr President, I would like to inform the House of an extremely serious incident which took place last Friday in Italy, in the town of Verona to be precise."
"Thirty or so members of a neo-nazi organisation burst into a local television studio where a debate was being held and brutally attacked a representative of an Islamic community."
"The fact that this person was expressing very dubious, extremely provocative views did not, of course, prevent all the democratic groupings from condemning this very disturbing incident."
"The most worrying thing of all, however, Mr President, is that a Member of this House, Mr Borghezio, a member of the Lega Nord, not only justified the act but said that he was in favour of this kind of behaviour."
"You will understand, Mr President, that, henceforth, it will be extremely difficult for me to stay in this House if Mr Borghezio takes the floor."
"Mr President, in response to the comments by Mr Titley, I would like to say that I raised the issue of the 30th anniversary of Britain, Ireland and Denmark's membership of the European Union at the last part-session in December and asked our President, Mr Cox, what was going to be done to mark this."
"I am delighted to say that Mr Cox is hosting a reception tomorrow evening for Members of Parliament and I hope that Mr Titley, among his other invitations for this week, will find the opportunity to attend that reception being offered by the President."
"I certainly intend to be there myself."
"Mr President, I would like you to ask the Commission what measures it intends to take to demand the reimbursement of the subsidies granted to the Daewoo corporation."
"It is scandalous for this corporation to keep the monies received, while closing down the three factories it has in Lorraine, France, as well as many other factories world-wide."
"I believe that granting subsidies to capitalist companies on the pretext of promoting employment equates to misappropriation of taxpayers' money, where these companies simply add the sums received to their profits and shareholders' dividends."
"Once the money has been received, how many of these companies cut jobs, or even close factories, thereby ruining whole towns and even regions."
"This is fraud, to the detriment of both workers and taxpayers, and it takes place with the complicity of the European institutions or other bodies, which continue to grant these subsidies."
"Mr President, we were talking a short while ago about the death penalty, and Iran is one of the countries in which many death sentences, especially by means of stoning, are pronounced."
"Certainly, there has been a moratorium on stonings, but everyone knows of course that, in the autumn of 2002, there was a series of large-scale demonstrations in Iran in favour of human rights and democracy and against executions and stonings."
"In particular, there were a number of students at the head of the demonstrations and, if I raise the issue now, it is because four of these students were sentenced at a court in Shiraz to have their arms and legs cut off."
"They are all under 25 years of age."
"None have criminal records."
"This is one more example of the mediaeval methods used by Iran."
"I would ask you to approach the Iranian Government and, if appropriate, break off the critical dialogue until such methods are no longer used."
"This is a matter of great urgency."
"Mr President, please allow me to add something to what Mrs Gebhardt has said."
"The things she has described have made a deep impression on me, but, Mrs Gebhardt, there was just one thing missing."
"The reason why these violations of human rights outrage us is that a European woman is involved."
"We should, though, be aware that Muslim women - and not only in Dubai - are exposed to the same violations of human rights on a daily basis."
"Mr President, following on from what Mrs Frahm said, I should like to express my great disappointment at the fact that the Iranian regime, which distinguished itself in 2002 as being one of the world's most repressive towards its own people, which breached human rights more than any other, has not been condemned by the United Nations because the European Union decided not to propose this condemnation."
"Such action makes no sense and makes me think that what we are seeing is opportunism in the EU's human rights policy, which I can neither accept nor understand."
"We will make sure the President draws the correct conclusions from that and takes appropriate action."
"Mr President, as you may recall, last month I raised the issue of the extreme right-wing British National Party claiming that sympathetic serving police officers in Oldham have provided confidential police videos of the riots in that town, obviously calling into question evidence given by such biased officers in the ongoing trials."
"It turns out that, instead of investigating the claims that the BNP had received such material, the police have obtained an injunction imposing a ban on the showing of the videos, which I understand, but also on the reporting of the fact that BNP is making such claims and even on the fact that an injunction has been obtained."
"Will you write to the appropriate authorities expressing Parliament's concern that this attempt to bury a problem, rather than to investigate it, is not the way to deal with these issues?"
"We will refer that matter to the President."
"Mr President, a while ago, one Member quite rightly condemned cloning in this plenary and called for it to be universally rejected."
"What he failed to do, however, was to make a proper distinction between reproductive cloning and therapeutic cloning."
"With regard to reproductive cloning, I am sure we all agree that this is an inhuman or dehumanising technique that must be rejected."
"The same cannot be said, however, for therapeutic cloning."
"A way must be left open for science, scientists and the scientific community to experiment in innovative fields that have enormous potential for medicine."
"The dogmatic individuals who are opposed to any type of cloning are the staunchest allies of those who would allow secrecy, charlatanism and trafficking to flourish in this field."
"We must agree on this fundamental point: if we want to obstruct science and research in the field of cloning, there will always be chancers and unscrupulous individuals who are willing to exploit this area of knowledge."
"That concludes the item."
"The next item is the report (A5-0427/2002) by Giorgio Napolitano, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the role of regional and local authorities in European integration (2002/141(INI))."
"Mr President, it is on the initiative of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs that the European Parliament is, for the first time, addressing the issue of the role of regional and local authorities in European integration with a specific report and a motion for a resolution."
"The reasons for this initiative and its goals are not difficult to understand."
"Indeed, particularly over the last decade, a widespread trend towards decentralisation, regionalisation and increasing autonomy of local authorities has become apparent in the Member States of the Union, and it is right to recognise the importance of this trend when reflecting on and discussing the state of the European Union and its future."
"The regional and local authorities have taken on a more important role in transposing Community legislation within the individual States and in running Community programmes."
"They should therefore feel involved in the preparatory work on the Union's policies and acts too."
"To this end, the motion for a resolution which is now to be put to the vote in the plenary session of this House contains important proposals: the inclusion in the new constitutional framework of the principles of respect for regional and local identity and, therefore, of the application of subsidiarity, not just in relations between the Union and the Member States but where regional and local authorities are concerned too; committing the Commission, not least on the basis of its White Paper on Governance, to involving the representatives of regional and local authorities in the preparatory work on its proposals; calling upon the Member States to promote and enhance - each in accordance with its own constitutional system - the participation of regional and local authorities in the Union's decision-making process."
"With the resolution we have drawn up, which, if adopted by broad consensus, will be an important point of reference for the subsequent debate at the Brussels Convention in early February, the cause of recognising the role of the regional and local authorities in European integration will receive a considerable boost."
"I hope that due consideration will be given to certain concerns expressed in committee by myself and other colleagues and that a number of amendments correcting and clarifying the text adopted by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs will be adopted, so that misapplication and unilateral measures which would harm our cause are avoided."
"In this regard, I would like to stress the criteria I adopted as rapporteur."
"Firstly, we need to consider all the autonomous territorial entities which operate within the Member States as a single unit."
"As we are all aware, they vary greatly in size and nature but they all, from the largest to the smallest, whatever their role or powers, represent certain shared values - the value of proximity, of the closest possible adherence to the views, opinions and needs of the citizens, the value of the most immediate and widespread democratic participation possible - and the European Constitution must recognise that they all have a key role to play in the achievement of the goal set for the Convention on the Future of Europe: the goal of bringing Europe considerably closer to the citizens, of making the Union more democratic as well as more effective."
"I have therefore not proposed in my draft report to subdivide regions or local authorities into different categories."
"Giving a specific category of autonomous territorial entity special status or exclusive rights within the Union would lead to difficult, counterproductive disputes, even as regards defining and establishing the boundaries of a particular category - the category of regions with legislative powers, for instance - and would conceal the value of recognising all the regional and local authorities together as one whole, as one overall entity."
"Secondly, we need to ensure that we do not create a more cumbersome institutional system and procedures which we all agree actually need to be simplified, and in this 'institutional system' I include the Court of Justice and its procedures too."
"As a general rule, we need to take care not to reduce the effectiveness of a decision-making process which is already subject to a large number of constraints by applying a set of checks and balances of varying degrees of rigidity."
"In conclusion, I trust that the Members will reflect on the points I have made and that there will be broad consensus in tomorrow's votes."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the united Europe, which was embarked on in Copenhagen will be an extremely diverse Europe, first of all in terms of economic and social diversity."
"Never before has there been such great economic disparity within the European Union and, at the same time, furthermore, never before has a genuine cohesion policy been so crucial."
"There will be cultural and political diversity, but also territorial diversity."
"In fact, I used this exact expression - territorial diversity - as one of the three themes of the Second Report on economic and social cohesion entitled 'Unity, solidarity, diversity for Europe, its people and its territory', just over one year ago."
"It is this diversity that explains why the task given to your rapporteur, Mr Napolitano, on this matter, was extremely difficult as regards defining the role of regional and local authorities in the European Union."
"As he said, we shall hold a sitting specifically devoted to this subject within the Convention on 6 and 7 February."
"Mr Napolitano, you have completed this task with your usual talent and wisdom and, ladies and gentlemen, it will not surprise you to learn that I agree with the rapporteur on many of the points in his report."
"Mr Napolitano was wise enough to point out that if the European Union wishes to function without becoming a super-State, it must respect the right of each State to organise itself as it sees fit."
"It is not, therefore, the role of the European institutions or the Commission to propose, or even less, to decide, in Brussels, how competences are to be divided within each country, or how relations between territories should be organised within each Member State."
"It is therefore with this restriction in mind that the Commission is able to approve the main points of the report presented."
"We are in favour of a more prominent role for the Committee of the Regions provided that the interinstitutional balance remains as it is today."
"The Committee's right to recourse to the Court of Justice deserves consideration, if necessary, in order to defend respect for the principle of subsidiarity."
"We are in favour of what your report calls 'new participatory methods' so that regional and local authorities might be more directly involved in Community procedures."
"In its White Paper on governance, the Commission advocated systematic dialogue with the associations representing these authorities, and we are currently finalising arrangements for this dialogue which, following extensive consultation, will be operational at the end of the first half of 2003."
"We are in favour of adapting the implementation of EU legislation to take account of individual local circumstances and needs."
"The Commission will thus try out a pilot scheme of tripartite contracts, involving Brussels, the national capital and the region."
"Above and beyond this, generally speaking, the Treaty already provides us with plenty of room for manoeuvre through framework legislation."
"The three institutions responsible for legislative activity share responsibility for preventing these framework laws from entering into too much detail."
"We must, however, take care to preserve the uniform, and therefore equal or fair, application of European law."
"We must not weaken the rules we adopt here, through democratic debate, by allowing the territorial authorities variable-geometry application, even on an exceptional basis."
"I have talked about what happens initially, when drawing up Community texts, and what happens downstream, when they are implemented."
"In its contribution to the work of the Convention before the end of last year, the Commission prepared the ground in this area while expressing its desire to find the means to increase the involvement of the regional authorities throughout the process of European integration, while respecting the institutional system of each country."
"Lastly - and this is my fourth point of agreement with your report, Mr Napolitano - we are in favour of a strong European and territorial cohesion policy, which means something real for each region of the Union and the citizens of the Union."
"In this area, which I am familiar with because it is my responsibility within the Commission, both the Commission and Parliament will have a great deal of work to accomplish together in the months ahead, before I present, at the end of this year, the Commission proposals for future regional policy after 2006."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is precisely because, as I have just said, we agree on the broad lines of this report that I would like to express the Commission's concern on a point that I know has also been the subject of debates and questions here in Parliament."
"It concerns the opportunity for certain regions alone, those with legislative powers, to defend their rights before the Court of Justice."
"Furthermore, I spoke very frankly to these regions with legislative powers a few weeks ago in Florence, at one of their meetings."
"I believe it is neither realistic nor desirable to establish this kind of distinction between European territorial authorities."
"For example, how can we confer important, individual rights on these regions, while not all the current and future Member States are organised in this way?"
"Our institutional system must not favour one system over another."
"It must, I repeat, be neutral, fair and impartial."
"Regions with legislative powers, however, which have their own responsibilities, are facing difficulties that we do not want to ignore."
"Why, therefore, to respond to one of their requests - and this is an option I raised with their president - do we not take inspiration from the positive experience of Article 203 of the Treaty, as intelligent use of this article enabled us to facilitate the participation of these regions in the Council itself?"
"Why should access to Community justice not follow this example, or at least its spirit?"
"That is why I find it interesting that some of you - in particular Mr Corbett, and also Mr Méndez de Vigo, I am told - have made progress in finding a way out of this dead end."
"This would consist of giving each State clear responsibility for taking cases to the Court of Justice on behalf of these territorial authorities."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we are not trying to pit the regions against the States or against Europe, or even less so the States against Europe."
"We are trying to choose a culture of cooperation rather than maintaining a culture of confrontation."
"The regions must be able to count on the Member States to obtain genuine political and legal representation within the Union."
"The regions must be able to count on the European Union to involve them systematically in all stages of the European decision-making process."
"The European Union, for its part, must be able to continue to count on the constructive, loyal cooperation of all the territorial authorities: the regions, of course, but also towns, cities and subregional territorial structures."
"It must be able to count on their contributions to the debate on European democracy."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the regions are the very foundation of the European Union, and it is not without reason that we increasingly speak in terms of a Europe of the Regions."
"Recent years have seen an increased awareness of what the Member States' various regional and local authorities do, and of their autonomous nature."
"These authorities have an important part to play in bringing the European Union closer to its citizens, and it is the regional authorities in particular that make a decisive contribution to the success of cross-border cooperation and of the ever closer union of the individual Member States."
"As it is in the regions that the EU's grass-roots democracy does its work, it is obvious that the regions have to be involved in European policies."
"In its opinion on the Napolitano report, 'The role of regional and local authorities in European integration', the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities devoted special attention to gender mainstreaming."
"Democracy works only when everyone is involved, and that means women and men equally."
"We point out the democratic deficit arising from the under-representation of women in decision-making bodies and administrations in all areas of political, economic, social and - not least - professional life."
"The European Union's regions are significantly handicapped in their cohesion and in their development as democracies by the continuing under-representation of women in decision-making processes."
"Regional and local bodies play an important part in the labour market, among other areas, in that their superior grasp of local needs and obstacles gives them better proximity to jobseekers, and it is through them that the best ways of removing these obstacles may be found."
"It is vital to work towards the development of new social policies, and this includes, in particular, assessing support for equal treatment and its implementation."
"According to a Chinese proverb, women carry half of heaven on their shoulders; we are striving to open up the whole horizon as a means of shaping a Europe belonging to the regions' citizens."
"We are well aware, Commissioner, of this Parliament's inability to act in this area, but constant dripping wears the rock away, and the highlighting of deficits is for us both a task and an obligation."
"Mr President, this is an important issue, as Commissioner Barnier has pointed out, since the European Convention is going to hold a debate on this issue on 6 and 7 February."
"This report must therefore form the basis of that debate."
"I would like to congratulate the Chairman, Mr Napolitano, on the good sense, which is the least common of the senses, of his proposal."
"Mr President, in this case you have done justice to your talent and reputation."
"This resolution is clearly regionalist, because what we are asking the Convention is that it recognise the objective of territorial cohesion in Article 2; because we are asking for recognition of regional and local autonomy in Article 6; because we are asking for inclusion of linguistic diversity in Europe and the protection of minority languages in Article 151; because we are asking for recognition of cross-border cooperation in Article 158; because we are asking that the Committee of the Regions, within the context of subsidiarity, should be able to bring cases before the Court of Justice - in this regard we cooperate with the working group on subsidiarity which it is my honour to chair in the Convention; finally, because in paragraph 2 of Article 299 we ask for the situation of the outermost regions to be consolidated."
"You may ask me, why has the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats voted by a majority against in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, if it is so positive?"
"Well, I will tell you; because there are two issues which concern us and we believe that they have not been properly resolved in committee:"
"The first issue is Recital 2, into which an amendment was introduced empowering regional and local authorities to adapt the way in which they apply the legislation of the European Union, in order to take account, it says, of exceptional local circumstances and needs."
"I know that it then adds a paragraph saying 'while respecting the integrity of EU law', but I believe that, as it stands, this paragraph is detrimental to the common internal market and that led the Group of the European People's Party, which has always defended the four freedoms of the internal market, to vote against."
"We have therefore presented an amendment, No 21 - I believe we have reached an agreement with the Socialists - to bring together our Amendment No 21 with the Socialist No 5 in a compromise amendment, which I believe takes us in the right direction."
"Finally, another issue which concerns us, Mr President, is the current wording of Article 8, which, along the same lines mentioned by Commissioner Barnier, grants all regional and local corporations with legislative powers the right to bring cases before the Court of Justice of the European Communities."
"We believe this is over the top, we believe this is not the way to build Europe, and we have therefore presented an amendment, No 24, which allows the regions, under the authority of the State, to defend its prerogatives before the Court in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity."
"We would ask the Members to examine these amendments, and if we reach an agreement on them, the Group of the European People's Party, in accordance with the reasoning we have given, will be able to vote in favour of this extremely important report on which it is my honour to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Napolitano."
"Mr President, I too would like to congratulate our rapporteur, the chairman of the committee, for having dealt with such a complex issue and brought us together around a compromise position which, on all but one or two little details which still need to be settled, can command the overwhelming majority of this House."
"Our European Union is not just a union of states, it is a union of citizens."
"The Treaties have always conferred certain rights directly on citizens and therefore on the way that citizens are governed within Member States."
"Subnational authorities therefore already have an important role to play, both in the application of European legislation - for instance much of our environmental legislation imposes requirements on local authorities to deal with packaging and waste - and even, in some cases, in the transposition of directives into domestic legislation, as is the situation in Belgium, for example."
"It is right that we should look at how our regions are involved in the running of this Union."
"What rights should we give to our regions?"
"What responsibilities should we give them in the Treaties?"
"The principle of subsidiarity does not stop with national governments, but nonetheless, by virtue of that principle of subsidiarity, it is not up to the Union itself to tell the Member States how to organise themselves internally."
"Nonetheless the Union must recognise the fact that many of our Member States are organised internally in a way that gives substantial responsibilities to regions and other subnational authorities."
"It is therefore right that we should look, as this report does, at how we should adapt to that reality, that we should recognise it in the Treaty, that we should provide for better consultation and information of the regions, that we should make fuller use of Article 203 of the Treaty where appropriate, and that we should give proper consideration to the views of the Committee of the Regions."
"On all these issues there is consensus."
"But one issue leaves us divided: should regions be able to appeal to the Court of Justice against acts which they dislike, notably because they feel they violate their own responsibilities or the principle of subsidiarity?"
"On the one hand there is an argument to say that they too should be able to defend their prerogatives."
"On the other hand there is an argument that we would be overloading our Court, which is already facing the challenge of enlargement, with a whole raft of cases which may be brought sometimes for dubious political, rather than real legal, reasons."
"My group is offering a compromise on this question."
"Regions should be able to bring a case either via their national governments or via the Committee of the Regions."
"The committee would therefore be a sort of filter."
"It would check what level of support there would be for a court case."
"A case would not necessarily be brought if only one region were interested, but if several regions felt there was a real violation of their rights, then the Committee of the Regions would proceed and bring a case."
"That is a reasonable compromise: to allow regions the right to go to court, not individually, but to raise the matter and check, either via their national government or via the Committee of the Regions, whether there is a wider feeling that subsidiarity has been violated; if so, then a court case could be brought."
"I commend our amendment on this point to the House."
"I hope that other groups, even those for whom it is not their preferred amendment, will nonetheless rally behind this as an acceptable compromise and a workable one, which our Union would be wise to take on in its new Constitution."
"Mr President, as previous speakers have said, precisely what to do to give regional and local authorities a higher profile and standing is proving to be controversial under the Convention."
"Many of us would want the Union to enjoy more direct interaction with regional and local authorities, because they are frequently more sensible intermediaries between the citizen and the Union than the more remote and centralised national governments."
"We appreciate that such a direct relationship postulates the federal nature of the integration process in a fairly dramatic form."
"It is appropriate that the treaty provisions on subsidiarity should be reformulated to reflect this."
"Liberals believe decentralisation is essential if the Union is to manage its common policies more effectively."
"More of a relationship with provincial politics will improve the quality of our supranational democracy."
"This report provides many of the answers, but the issue of the approach to the Court of Justice is still controversial."
"The Liberal Group wishes to improve access across the board for the citizen, to improve citizens' approach to their constitutional court."
"This implies clear lines of approach for all democratic representative bodies, especially regional authorities with parliamentary powers of law-making independent of their Member States."
"Mr President, I also want to express my gratitude and satisfaction that the Parliament is today debating this report on an initiative which came from Mr Napolitano himself."
"Of course my group prefers the report in what we regard as the strengthened form in which it emerged from the committee, but which on some points Mr Napolitano thinks was pushed too far."
"No doubt that will be where the votes will be concentrated on Wednesday."
"However, it is a matter of common consensus that democracy in the European Union is necessarily democracy at many levels."
"The principle of subsidiarity is an iterative principle which works down the line and which should, as far as possible, enable people with local knowledge to apply that local knowledge, with common sense, to local circumstances, taking account of the purposes of the European legislation in question."
"It is often said that a characteristic of the European method of legal interpretation is its purposive quality, and I feel that to some extent the local enforcers of European law should act with regard to the purpose not only to the letter of the law."
"That is not to say that I wish to see a different law operating in different parts of Europe, but it is difficult to have the same law operating identically where there are very different circumstances."
"For example, very arid countries will necessarily apply the same water law in a somewhat different way than very wet countries because the circumstances that lead to the application of the law vary and these need to be taken into account."
"That surely is important."
"Another important matter is that the transposition of the directive should take account of the local circumstances; it is yet more important that the protocol on subsidiarity should encourage local and regional authorities to exercise a constructive discretion in enabling the directive to make the most possible sense at local level."
"There are other points that have been raised which we think are vital as well."
"The regional authorities should on occasion be able to take matters to the Court of Justice."
"Just at the moment, in Scotland, the government, the Scottish Executive, the opposition parties, are all of the view for example that a recent compromise reached at the Fisheries Council violates the principle of proportionality."
"Why should it be left to the fishing people to test that?"
"Why cannot the regional authority responsible for enforcing the law test it itself?"
"Many other such examples sprint to mind."
"There should also be opportunities to take things into account during the legislative process and before it."
"The EFA parties which I represent here do not just represent regions."
"Of course the countries we represent are regions in the technical constitutional sense."
"However it should not be forgotten - and Mr Lamassoure in his famous remarks about partner regions was not forgetting it - they are also among the ancient nations of Europe which deserve to be taken seriously."
"If it comes out of this Parliament, or out of the Convention, that there is nothing for a region between being a Member State and being nothing, then you know what answer you will get."
"Mr President, As someone who has spent many years serving on a local and regional authority in Ireland, I broadly welcome this report and I wish to thank Mr Napolitano for his work."
"Often we forget the role and relevance of local and regional government."
"It is the closest level of governance to the people of the regions."
"It implements many of the policies and legislative processes agreed by the European Union."
"A prime example of this, in the Irish context, is environmental legislation."
"We should therefore enhance the role of regional and local government in responding to and developing European policy."
"It is my belief that the European Charter for Local Self-Government has many merits."
"It commits the parties to applying basic rules guaranteeing the political, administrative and financial independence of local authorities."
"Consequently, the Charter considers that public responsibilities should be exercised by the authorities closest to the citizens."
"In many cases these are the local and regional authorities."
"As a person who has always encouraged the promotion and safeguarding of lesser-used regional languages, I am pleased that this has been included in the report as a proposed amendment to Article 151 of the Treaty."
"It is by embracing our cultural and linguistic diversity that we enhance the understanding of Europe, its diverse peoples and its many different regions."
"Linguistic and cultural diversity is not about defining or redefining boundaries; it underpins the cultural strength of our enlarging European Union."
"It is my belief that the work of the European Committee of the Regions is important."
"It has become more focused in its opinions and it has to be further recognised."
"A region is not about its boundaries, it is about its cultures and its languages, and, even more so, it is about its people."
"The citizens of Europe are always reaffirming their demands for a Europe that is much closer to them and this should not exclude the level of governance closest to the people."
"Mr President, if I ax my mates back home where they come from, they would say Devon."
"Not Cornwall, across the river Tamar, which is foreign parts, nor Zummerzet where all they toffs live."
"That's too close to Lunnon for my liking."
"As for Lunnon, well that used to be three days on the fast stage coach, and there are many of us folks who never did get used to they newfangled things like horseless carriages and they motorway things that bring all those foreigners to our neck of the woods."
"So when I tell them that they bureaucrats over the water have made us citizens of Europe, most of my mates say 'thank 'e very much guvnor, but we'm Devon folk and we'm British, we don't need that Europe over here, thank 'e kindly'."
"'But,' I says to them, 'they want to bring that Europe much closer to our citizens, so that's all right, isn't it?'"
"My mate says 'what be'm going to do about it then, dig it up and put it in trucks and pile it up on Dartymoor so we can go and have a looky at 'n?'"
"'No,' I says, 'they'm going to make us into regions, they'm going to take away our counties and they'm going to make us all one big happy family, along with they foreigners to Cornwall and they toffs to Somerset."
"They'm even going to throw in they folks up to Gloucestershire and other foreign parts. We'm are all going to be part of the south west region."
"That is going to bring Europe much closer to our citizens, so we will be all right then, won't us?'"
"When my mates looked a bit mazed, I said ''tis obvious really, by making us big happy families in regions, with fifteen times more votes than those Luxembourgers, we will really feel part of the European culture."
"This chap Giorgio Napolitano says we can then be an autonomous territorial entity."
"Then the likes of me can be on the Committee of the Regions which has recently affirmed its exclusive legitimacy as an institutional discussion partner."
"With one of they regions, we will be off like a long dog, and then our citizens can all take a fuller part in the integration of Europe'."
"'What's a Luxembourger?' says my mate."
"That is the reality of bringing Europe closer to the people."
"The only people who want it are the political elites, but the price in the United Kingdom is losing our long-established county structure and with it the rich local dialects that abound."
"It is a price not worth paying."
"Mr President, the Napolitano report on the role of regional and local authorities in European integration has a number of good points - and one major fault: it should not exist."
"According to the principle stated in the report itself, which the Community has obeyed since its beginnings, the European institutions are based on a Union of States; they respect the internal structure of the States; their only interlocutors are the States and, where regions are involved in certain European policies, it is because the States, and behind them their national democracy, wanted this and because they are in charge, and must remain in charge, of the process."
"In any case, it is not the place of the Community to decide - or even suggest - that regional and local authorities should play a greater part or participate otherwise in a given European decision-making process, as indicated in the Napolitano report."
"Quite the opposite. As I explained in a minority opinion annexed to the report, the increased number of Member States following enlargement makes the role played by the Member States as coordinators and intermediaries more crucial than ever."
"It is difficult to imagine the European Union maintaining direct relations with 250 regions or more, or listening to all their opinions."
"That would be impossible to manage. In any case, national identity and the peoples' right to organise themselves as they see fit must be respected completely."
"The European Union has no supreme power to intervene in these matters."
"If, however, it did manage to worm its way in, it would open up a Pandora's box which would eventually lead to dislocated nations and a Europe that would be impossible to govern."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we owe a debt of gratitude to Mr Napolitano for taking on the difficult subject of the role of regional and local bodies in European integration, on which he has shed light in his meticulous and comprehensive report."
"The many amendments tabled here and in committee testify to the topic's capacity to engage our emotions."
"Whilst the EU is being enlarged, that process also demands internal integration."
"People may well move around, but they think of themselves primarily as citizens of their region and of the places where they have their abodes and domiciles, long before they start describing themselves as Italian, English, German, Spanish or even European."
"This gives these local structures crucial importance when it comes to imparting the tradition of European thought and implementing European legislation in practice and on a day-to-day basis."
"The fact is, though, that the Member States' constitutional arrangements also differ to an extremely wide degree."
"Our rapporteur has distinguished himself with the survey he has compiled and included in his working paper on the relationships between the central and local levels in the EU's Member States and in the candidate countries, which reveals that, below the level of a Member State's central government, the regions or federal states possess the most diverse legislative competences."
"It is not intended that Europe should tamper with this autonomous approach to national structures, which has the deepest of roots in the nation state."
"Let us not, though, delude ourselves; discussion of this topic brings the Member States, those with centralised constitutions and those constituted on federal lines, with their own conceptions, head to head with each other."
"This alone explains why so much emotion is called forth by the idea of the regions having an independent right of appeal to the ECJ when their own legislative rights are directly affected."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is the European Parliament that, alone, possesses the power to integrate Europe."
"We, its Members, represent the people for whom 'home' means their regions and their communities."
"If we are now to work on the even greater Europe that we all - for a diversity of reasons - desire, we have to take care to stand on a secure foundation; what we must also give this Europe is a soul - and we must do it with popular consent."
"Our regions are that foundation, and it is for that reason that we have to treat them with respect rather than passing their concerns through a filter, as Mr Corbett suggested."
"Mr President, the future European Constitution must lead to a more democratic and effective Union, that is, one that is closer to the citizens and their concerns."
"In this regard, the role of the regions is quite simply essential."
"What the Convention must do is formalise something which is already a reality."
"How is it possible that the regions are applying Community legislation and that this is not formally recognised in terms of rights within the institutional framework of the Union?"
"How is it possible that these regions transpose Community legislation but their situation is clearly undervalued in the Treaties in force?"
"We must correct this in the following way: firstly, the regions must be consulted at every stage of the legislative procedure in the European Union; secondly, we must urge the Member States to allow them the greatest possible participation throughout the European decision-making process in each of the States, including at the level of representation within the Council of Ministers; we must also increase the role of the Committee of the Regions and allow the regions to be able to act within the framework of the principle of subsidiarity."
"If somebody has to apply and transpose legislation in accordance with this principle, then logically they must also be able to defend their prerogatives and rights."
"Also in the European Union the courts are there to ensure the better legal operation of the institutions and policies we have decided on jointly."
"By whatever means, the important thing is that the Napolitano report, in the form it is in today or the form it will be in, probably, after the vote in the plenum, will recognise the right of the regions to defend their prerogatives before the Court of Justice - this is the fundamental thing - and also to apply the policies of the Union, in a more effective manner, within the framework of Community law, as the Socialist Group's Amendment No 5 states."
"The Spanish Socialists voted in favour of the Napolitano report in committee and we will do so again tomorrow because it represents a step forward."
"What will be approved will probably be somewhere in the middle."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I feel that we must take the opportunity afforded by Mr Napolitano's report - and all credit is due to him for succeeding in this difficult, complex task - to stress, with all the institutional weight of the European Parliament, the need for the new Europe, which will be founded on the Constitutional Treaty on which the Convention is working, to apply the principle of subsidiarity completely and transparently."
"This means that the result will only be achieved if subsidiarity is not just applied to relations between the Union and the national States but is extended to the territorial authorities - the regional and local authorities - with all due respect for the constitutional systems of the respective countries, of course."
"Indeed, it is the territorial authorities - the regional and local authorities - alone which give substance to the democracy of proximity. It is they that make it possible to strengthen the roots of genuine democracy and to bring the citizens closer to the institutions, including the European institutions."
"The Convention is the forum which has been assigned the task of resolving this thorny issue."
"It started off focusing its attention solely on the first level of subsidiarity, the subsidiarity between the Union and the States."
"We need to free ourselves from this trap because, if we endorse this system of two levels of subsidiarity - subsidiarity between the Union and the States and between the States and the territorial authorities - we prevent - and I feel that this is the crux of the matter - recognition of that direct connection between the European institutions and the territorial authorities which now exists and which is yielding promising fruit, where it is not misinterpreted or destroyed at birth."
"We must resist this temptation at all costs and, to this end, I hope that the Convention will take on board the lengthy debate which has taken place in Europe, particularly in the Council of Europe, on the matter."
"My hope is that the Convention will succeed in recognising and endorsing the right to local and regional autonomy."
"This right will then be regulated within the respective legal systems of the individual countries but will have to comprise the single level of subsidiarity, the equal dignity of levels of government, the right of local autonomies to their own financial resources and the right to have access to justice, which can balance the technical needs to prevent this getting out of control against the needs of the territorial authorities, but which cannot stop it happening."
"It may be that the idea of strengthening the link through the Committee of the Regions is the solution we all need."
"Mr President, it is not only dictatorships that traditionally evoke resistance from many of their inhabitants; centralised states and multiethnic states do so as well."
"Centralisation means arrogant governments that think they know better than the people who are experiencing the regional problems and who choose solutions for them themselves."
"Furthermore, if the national language is not the language widely used in education, government and the economy, there will be a split between first-class citizens who have grown up with the dominant language from birth and second-class citizens who have merely acquired it."
"Democratic government in Europe cannot exist if cultural diversity and regional differences are not taken into account."
"The existence of the European Union is resulting in the power of the governments of the Member States growing in comparison with their national parliaments and their regions."
"This expansion is at the expense of the positions that Scotland, Catalonia, Friesland, Corsica, Flanders or the Valle d'Aosta have now acquired, while in these areas in particular the people yearn to be put on a more equal footing with the Member States."
"The Napolitano report, in which the regional and regional governments [sic] are protected against large-scale centralist thinking and actions, is therefore an indispensable contribution to democracy and peaceful coexistence in Europe."
"Mr President, I too would like to thank Mr Napolitano for his excellent work and focus on what has been the most controversial point of his report, paragraph 8(I)."
"I believe that, as a clear, natural consequence of the European Union changing from a system based on an international Treaty negotiated by diplomats to a political Union which is of a federal nature, that is a Union based on a Constitution, the instruments of constitutional control will have to be overhauled and consolidated."
"The argument that giving some regions with constitutionally recognised powers - legislative powers - direct access would result in congestion at the Court of Justice would appear to be really very weak, for, if this were the case, then we would have to find a way to strengthen the Court of Justice and make the system more robust and better able to cope with the demand."
"Moreover, as Mr Duff has already said, it would appear necessary to make it easier for the citizens to approach the constitutional court and to identify the channels open to them, and not just where the regions are concerned but in cases of violations of the citizens' fundamental rights too."
"I feel that this is an important aspect of the future European Constitution, and it is why I believe that it is, quite frankly, going too far to paint such a negative picture of the opportunity presented by this report, which I see as the more innovative, original part, treating it as some kind of impending disaster which we will not subsequently be able to control."
"Moreover, I feel that the compromise put forward has two major shortcomings, for it proposes two filters, two filters which are themselves inadequate."
"The state cannot act as a filter for the regions because, in many cases, it is in a position of opposition to a region and its powers, and the Committee of the Regions, which was created to be weak on purpose, cannot be another filter for the powers of the regions because, not least, that would introduce and preserve the idea of a false neutrality, as Commissioner Barnier said, and a false equality between the regions."
"This equality cannot exist because the regions have different powers, and that is just as it should be."
"Mr President, all candidate countries except Turkey have adopted during the last two decades special policies to improve the situation of minorities, in some cases even through the implementation of self-determination to the benefit of several stateless nations."
"Serbia and Montenegro are using the principle of self-determination to try to reach a definitive settlement of the conflict in the former Yugoslavia."
"The European Union itself, on the contrary, lacks a comprehensive approach to the issue of stateless nations."
"This is very regrettable."
"But it is much more regrettable to read in the explanatory statement of Mr Napolitano's report that it is unacceptable to suggest the recognition of the right to self-determination, because that falls within the sovereign and exclusive competence of the Member States."
"That means that those stateless nations cannot claim the right of their peoples to exist as such."
"How can the European Union ignore the principles of universality, indivisibility and interdependence of human rights proclaimed in 1993 by the Vienna Declaration?"
"Could that be possible in an area of freedom, security and justice?"
"Self-determination is the key to peaceful relations between nations because self-determination equals democracy."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Napolitano report addresses one of the most controversial issues facing the Convention. It is an issue which puts to the test the principle of subsidiarity and the very ideal of Europe as a community of diversities, and it involves different national historical traditions and systems whose attitudes towards regional power vary."
"I believe it is right for the proposal on the Union's powers not to interfere with the systems of the individual States."
"We cannot, however, disregard the fact that some national Constitutions confer major legislative powers on the regions, and the Convention will have to recognise this, although without creating privileges, without upsetting the internal market and without removing the need for a political Europe."
"For all these reasons, I feel it is right to give the regions with legislative powers the right to approach the Court of Justice directly when their prerogatives are affected by European measures."
"I believe that it would be a mistake to overlook the fact that some Länder or regions - in Germany, Italy or Spain - are territorial authorities which are much larger than some of the entities established in the national States."
"Widespread consensus on this report, which Mr Napolitano has rightly called for - is necessary to the constitutional process, which must facilitate the participation of regional and local authorities in Europe's future as a community."
"Having previously served in local government, I regard the Napolitano report on the role of local and regional entities in European integration as a significant step towards getting Europe's feet firmly back on the ground."
"After all, the officials and politicians in the European Union are spending much too much time in the corridors of supranational power and are forgetting that Europe is really made up of four governmental levels: local, regional, national and European."
"Europe's roots lie at local and regional level."
"That is where the European lives and works; that is where most of the policies that we make in Europe are carried out."
"The Napolitano report recognises the importance of the local and regional entity for the continued existence and consolidation of European integration, and not only the formal regions with constitutional powers, but all regions, from Dutch provincies to English counties to German Länder and Spanish comunidades autónomas."
"That is because, in a Europe in which all citizens are equal and therefore have equal rights, it is not possible to differentiate between territorial entities and to grant one region more rights than another."
"Of course, every Member State can determine for itself how its own constitutional system should be organised, however, and that naturally means that decentralisation in one country is organised differently from decentralisation in another."
"I think that Mr Napolitano has made a number of very good proposals for improving the involvement of regional and local entities in the European policy process."
"I am referring here to the participation of the regions involved - both in the draft phase and in the execution phase of the policy - the appropriate application of Article 203, the possibility for the region to ask the Committee of the Regions or their own government to go to the Court if they think that the principle of subsidiarity has been violated, or to take action, and finally to develop a statute for border regions."
"A statute of this kind for border regions could make the lives of many Europeans who live on both sides of the borders every day quite a bit easier and more pleasant."
"I hope that as a result of this report, the Convention will actually bring Europe and the regions closer to the people and we will anchor the region firmly in a new European constitution."
"Mr President, by local powers, we all understand the same thing, but when it comes to regional powers, there are different types of regional powers in Europe, some with recognised legislative powers."
"And it is these legislative powers which must allow these regions, these territories, to have the right to bring cases before the Court of Justice when their competences are encroached upon."
"The rapporteur says that there is no need to establish differences between the various regions."
"But in his country there are still regions a statuto speciale, which have different prerogatives."
"We also believe that the principle of subsidiarity should not be restricted to relations between the European Union and the Member States, but that it should also apply to other tiers of government."
"Today in Europe there are certain regions with legislative powers which are genuinely Stateless nations, such as Catalonia, or, as the next speaker will surely say..."
"Finally, cross-border cooperation is also an essential element in European construction, and we are pleased that the Napolitano report recognises this."
"Mr President, if the principle of subsidiarity is one of the basic pillars of Europe, if we want to bring the European institutions closer to the citizens and improve the democracy and transparency of Community policies, it largely falls to sub-State regions to apply Community decisions and if, furthermore, there are regions with legislative powers whose competences are directly affected by the policies of the Union, we cannot continue to deny those regions the opportunity to participate in the process of European construction."
"I do not agree with those people who have said that this is a responsibility of each Member State, which is contrary to the principle of subsidiarity."
"Because the possibility of participation by the regions in the taking of decisions which affect them is the result, and not the cause, of the internal organisation which each State has laid down."
"The Napolitano report attempts to define the role of local and regional powers in the Union's decision-making process."
"But it is too timid an approach, which does not respond to the needs of the regions with legislative powers, which - on the basis of their democratic legitimacy - have the right to be active members in the process of European construction."
"The regions with legislative powers, Mr Napolitano, Commissioner Barnier, wish to participate in the Council of Ministers when it is dealing with issues which fall within their competence and, contrary to what has been said here, they want to be able to bring cases before the Court of Justice in the event of violations of the principle of subsidiarity."
"This participation and will, if recognised by the future Constitution, would not represent a free concession, but a right of the regions, such as Catalonia, which the European Union, and this Parliament in particular, as the representative of the European people, must respect if it really wants to listen to the citizens."
"Mr President, there are many areas in which the Convention is meant to move European policy into a new stage."
"This topic, the position of the municipalities and regions and their involvement in European policy, is one of them."
"It is my belief that both local self-government and regional identity are fundamental principles, and must be reflected as such in the European constitution."
"I also wish to thank Mr Napolitano, whose task was a difficult one in view of the concepts involved being very much a matter of dispute."
"In many respects, this report advances the position of the municipalities and regions and their involvement in European policy, but I am surprised that such impassioned controversy has been unleashed by the right of municipalities and regions to go to the Court of Justice."
"I do think that the constitution has to give everyone who possesses a right, the additional right to approach the ECJ in Luxembourg, a right that 380 million Europeans are meant to be given by the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"To that, we all say 'yes', yet there is division in this House when it comes to the regions."
"I think that further thought needs to be given to this."
"No attempt whatever is made to tamper with the way states are organised internally, something that does, indeed, vary a very great deal, in that many regions possess competences, while others have merely administrative responsibilities or simply the name of 'region'."
"This diversity must also be reflected when it comes to the right to appeal to the Court of Justice."
"Commissioner Barnier has proposed the application of Article 203 in the event of us not succeeding in this."
"That may perhaps be a way ahead, albeit only the second best."
"It may be that a further stage is needed to enable us to find the best way forward."
"There is something else of great importance that I would like to mention."
"Commissioner Barnier, you have been to the border region that is my home."
"The lives of those of us who live on the borders are still made more difficult by bureaucratic and legal obstacles, and a European statute on cross-border cooperation would be a help to many millions of people."
"Reality has already burst the bounds of the legal framework, and to a substantial extent."
"That is what European added value actually amounts to."
"There must be room in the constitution for this sort of statute on cross-border cooperation, which will then benefit many millions of people."
"I hope that a large majority will endorse the Napolitano report."
"Rather than being in competition with them, Parliament exists to be the regions' and municipalities' natural partner."
"Mr President, 'The states are the skeleton of Europe, and the regions its flesh and blood'."
"That is the view expressed by the Catalonian President, Mr Pujol."
"Certainly, it is the case that, for many citizens, not only regions but also districts - that is to say, the local administrative units - feel closer and perhaps more natural than, in particular, the European institutions."
"Moreover, it is regional and local authorities that implement a large portion of EU decisions."
"It is therefore only fair that they should be given a strengthened role to play now that we are reviewing European forms of governance."
"These bodies must be involved at an early stage in some form of consultation procedure when proposals are formulated."
"As proposed, for example, in the report, they can play an important role in terms of evaluation and follow-up, as well as seeing to it that the principle of subsidiarity is applied."
"We cannot solve internal constitutional conflicts in this Chamber, but we must give a clear signal that we attach great importance to local and regional levels and specify this in the treaty."
"It would therefore be excellent to incorporate, for example, the statute on local and regional authorities."
"I should like there to be as few changes as possible to this report."
"I am convinced that it will form an excellent basis for discussion in, for example, the Convention."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the core of this debate on the role of the regions in the European structure is the necessary acknowledgement in the European constitution that the European Union does not only comprise states but has a more complex composition."
"Ten years ago, when the Maastricht Treaty was negotiated, there seemed, in my view, to be a more favourable climate for the regional package of requirements than there is today."
"There are even signs of a countermove in the European Convention now."
"The draft constitutional treaty put forward by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing causes me great concern in this regard."
"It does not contain any references at all to sub-state governments and is a step backwards in many respects."
"All this is happening against the background of enlargement."
"Many of the states that will soon be acceding are smaller than the existing regions and nations with legislative powers."
"The candidate Member States will soon be participating fully in the European structure."
"It is therefore only fair that nations such as Flanders, the Walloon provinces, the Basque country, Catalonia, Wales, Scotland and Galicia can do that too."
"The report by Mr Napolitano has arrived at an opportune moment, a few weeks before the debate on this in the Convention on 6 and 7 February."
"I fully support the strengthened version of the Napolitano report that Mr MacCormick mentioned."
"Commissioner Barnier and Mr Méndez de Vigo have just commented on the proposal to offer constitutional regions direct access to the Court of Justice."
"If I understand correctly, they are arguing for controlled access under the authority of the Member State in question."
"This little trick, however, is rather too transparent."
"It means in practice that, for example, the three historic nations of the Basque country, Catalonia and Galicia, would more or less be denied access to the Court of Justice by the centralist powers in Madrid."
"As a representative of Flanders, one of the historic regions that acquired quasi-autonomy without the use of force, I would like to ask you not to go down the route proposed by Mr Méndez de Vigo at all."
"Mr President, Commissioner Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, with this report, Parliament is getting the new year off to a good start - such a good start, that I have almost forgotten that I have forgotten to wear a tie."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this report's political message is that Europe's Parliament is drawing much closer to its regions, thus abandoning its former attitude, which was somewhat aloof."
"As far as the regions' right of appeal is concerned, I am glad that we have already come to an understanding about so much."
"We have agreed that the situation demands that the regions should have the option of laying claims before the European Court of Justice."
"We are also as one in believing that, on the other hand, the Member States must have some sort of monitoring role in this."
"In practice, this means that all that remains to be decided is what the role of the Member States is to be."
"Mr Corbett, your compromise proposes that it is only to the Member States that the regions should be able to make some sort of application, but that, unfortunately, gets us no further and is no sort of compromise."
"The fact is that the regions can of course do that already."
"Furthermore, it labours under the great disadvantage that we would be doing precisely what you advise us not to do, in that we would be interfering in the relationship between the regions and the Member States, and prescribing what that relationship should be."
"That is why I wish, again, to commend to you the compromise motion No 24, which would enable the regions to appeal under the Member States' supervision, as it were."
"This would leave room for flexible solutions in all the Member States, solutions that might be different in Germany from what they are in Great Britain."
"For this reason, I really do beg you to reconsider this."
"This is a sensitive issue for the regions, who are awaiting a signal from us, and I would be glad if we could join in sending that signal tomorrow."
"Mr President, in his original draft report, our rapporteur, Mr Napolitano, quite rightly described the dual challenge of taking account of the citizens' attachment to their regional and local roots and, in moving from fifteen to twenty-five Member States, avoiding any weakening of the institutions' operation."
"Regional and local authorities should therefore be offered the opportunity to contribute to the creation of Community policies and, where appropriate, to promote them, without ever replacing the Member States and the peoples of the Union, upon whom alone political and legal legitimacy rest."
"The European Union should not interfere in any way with the territorial organisation of its Member States."
"Furthermore, the Member States are completely free to organise, each for their own part, the participation of the regions in their decision-making processes."
"It should be the role of the Committee of the Regions to consult the regions at Community level and defend their interests."
"This process should also apply to monitoring the principle of subsidiarity."
"Contrary to what Mr Wuermeling has just said, the Committee of the Regions did not until now have the right to involve the Court."
"Any other solution would inevitably lead to an inactive and ineffective Union."
"Since a close vote in committee has altered the delicate balance secured by our rapporteur, it now falls to Parliament to reestablish this by voting for Amendment No 17 by Mr Corbett, intended to replace the controversial paragraphs 8 and 9 of the motion for a resolution."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we must recognise that we are talking about a report on regional policy of great importance and scope, which advocates that the regions should play an active role in their European future."
"We must therefore continue to insist that this House maintains Mr Napolitano's report, produced by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, which included, amongst other things, increasing the participation of the regions in decision making, the adaptation of Community legislation and the right to bring cases before the Court of Justice of the European Communities."
"It would be a good idea - as I pointed out in an amendment to the Napolitano report - to ask the Convention to guarantee the inclusion in the European Constitution of the famous paragraph 2 of Article 299 of the EC Treaty, which deals with the special application of Community provisions in the outermost regions of the European Union."
"Mr President, the question addressed by the Napolitano report is not simple, particularly when seen against the backdrop of the process of integrating the European Union which is currently underway."
"Yet, although it is not an easy issue to resolve, the rapporteur addresses it in a commendably balanced, not to say quite pragmatic way."
"There is, in fact, undeniable tension between the supranational and regional dimensions: tension which is historical, for the more European development has tended towards the supranational, the more - I regret to say - we have lost sight of the fact that, within many States, regionalisation processes were developing with characteristics and approaches to decentralisation which were different from what we were developing in the European Union."
"Thus, a sort of grey area has been created, there have been injustices, if we consider what has happened in recent years. We have witnessed a process of Europeanisation of powers conferred on the regions by Constitutions."
"We have witnessed a complete lack or only relative participation of the regions in the Community decision-making processes. We have witnessed the transfer of responsibilities from the States to the Community and thus the loss of the interactive powers conferred on the regions by national Constitutions."
"The Länder participate in the federal legislative process through the Bundesrat and the Italian regions have powers of initiative at national level. Then the regions are further penalised in that they no longer have any guarantees as regards jurisdictional protection in the event of encroachment on their competences."
"I feel that the Napolitano report endeavours to provide a very interesting legal response to all these concerns."
"It is the basis for a debate which will take place formally in the Convention, probably at the beginning of February. The report and the amendments tabled - further reflection may be necessary on some amendments where too much emphasis is placed on access to a Constitutional Court - will enable Parliament to provide the Convention with a plan for the construction of the Europe of the citizens which we want."
"Commissioner, Mr President, I would like to speak out in favour of the equality of the regions with each other."
"Even if some have legislative competence, this would not give them greater or additional rights in relation to other regions."
"Otherwise, we would be establishing two-speed citizenship with first- and second-class Europeans."
"It falls to each State to give power to its regions if it wishes to do so."
"The matter is being debated in many of our countries, and in particular in my country, France, but not only there."
"It falls to each State to consult its local authorities and its regions within the context of European policies and their transposal."
"The Member States do not necessarily do this well, and could do better, but this is a good start."
"I would point out that the European Union is not the sum of its regions."
"It is a Union of States and peoples."
"Each State must remain master of its internal organisation, both at institutional and territorial level."
"That is laid down in the Treaties in their current wording and we must retain both the spirit and the letter of the Treaties."
"No country can claim to have a better system than another."
"No country can impose its system on another."
"Europe is a contract, not a constraint."
"If I had to summarise, I would say: yes to strong, fraternal regions within the European Union, yes to regions that cooperate outside their borders, but no to a Europe of regions which would be an unfair, variable-geometry Europe."
"Mr President, I would like to ask you if you would be so kind as to ensure that our Amendment No 24, which has not been distributed with the other amendments to the Napolitano report, is made available to all the Members of this House for tomorrow's vote."
"Mr Méndez de Vigo, I share your opinion, and if the amendment has not been distributed, we will give instructions that it is and that it has the same opportunities as the other 23 amendments."
"Mr MacCormick has the floor for a point of order."
"Just for confirmation, according to the final draft agenda, the vote is not tomorrow as Mr Méndez de Vigo implied, but on Wednesday."
"It has been changed back to tomorrow?"
"Right, we need Amendment No 24 very quickly then."
"Yes, Mr MacCormick, because according to my information, the plenum of this Parliament has decided that the vote will take place tomorrow."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0451/2002) by Mrs Swiebel, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the human rights situation in the European Union (2001) (2001/2014(INI))."
"The annual report on human rights in the European Union engenders many differences of opinion and much confusion every year."
"There are two problems causing this."
"Firstly, it is not easy for any Member of this Parliament who has been elected on a national list, but who wants to be re-elected, to agree with criticism about his or her own country."
"If they wanted to act in accordance with their own consciences, they would have to distance themselves somewhat from national and party political loyalties, and that is sometimes expecting too much."
"Secondly, until recently it was unclear which human rights these reports were actually supposed to be about."
"What is the yardstick; what are the terms of reference?"
"In the past, various rapporteurs have made their own selections from the problems, and that has not always benefited continuity and credibility."
"The decision by the committee mainly responsible and by Parliament as a whole to make the Community Charter of Fundamental Rights the starting point for these reports was therefore a good one."
"The European Parliament's control function is of a political and not a legal nature, however."
"For the purpose of these annual reports, therefore, we must view the Charter as a political reference framework, a sort of table of contents."
"That gives us the scope to use this Charter to check whether the Member States are observing the provisions relating to human rights, which are in fact binding and which are included in innumerable conventions of the United Nations, the Council of Europe, the ILO etc."
"Human rights are universal, indivisible and interrelated."
"The human rights discourse is by definition global."
"The European Union's human rights policy is therefore only credible if human rights violations at home are measured against the same yardsticks as failings elsewhere in the world."
"The European Parliament speaks out against specific human rights problems elsewhere at every session, and correctly places great store on human rights in discussions about the candidate countries."
"We must, however, take an honest look at ourselves as well."
"That is why I have consciously chosen the naming and shaming approach in my report."
"It may not be pleasant but it is certainly honest."
"The European Union is a community of values."
"We hear that ad nauseam."
"We must also be willing, however, to regard serious human rights violations in one or more Member States as a European matter and to ask ourselves what the European Union as such can contribute towards improving the situation."
"That is why the recommendations in my report are not only aimed at one, several or all the Member States; they are also aimed at the Commission and the Council where applicable."
"I am delighted, as usual, to see Commissioner Vitorino sitting here again, but I am naturally disappointed that the Council is conspicuous by its absence - or perhaps there is an official hidden under the seat."
"What are the main human rights problems in the European Union?"
"I name some of them and I pose a number of specific questions relating to them."
"First and foremost, there is the risk of civil rights being compromised in the regrettably necessary fight against terrorism."
"It is therefore important to couple specific legislation with a sunset clause and to list and evaluate these anti-terrorism measures."
"My question is: are the Commission and the Council willing to list and evaluate them in this way?"
"Secondly, misconduct on the part of police and prison staff, which we observe year in, year out and in which the most vulnerable groups are often the victims, happens in all EU countries to a greater or lesser degree."
"Internal correction mechanisms are not particularly effective."
"In my opinion, the time has now come for this problem to be placed on the agenda of the European Union and for an extensive investigation into these abuses to be carried out at the very least."
"My question is: will the Commission investigate the opportunities for doing so?"
"Thirdly, racism, xenophobia and other forms of discrimination are on the increase, but protection against them is a patchwork quilt which suggests a hierarchy of forms of discrimination rather than a coherent approach."
"I would like to see a coherent and uniform European strategy of equal treatment."
"My question is: will the Commission take the lead in this?"
"Fourthly, partly thanks to my colleagues in the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment, I have observed a significant lack of compliance with the European Social Charter, the ILO treaties and so on by all the Member States. We need to clarify how these treaty obligations in the social sphere relate to the same Member States' obligations under secondary Community legislation."
"My question is: will the Commission take the lead in this as well?"
"Finally I would like to ask the representative of the Council - who is not here, but perhaps the official who is hidden away somewhere can pass this on - what has become of the decision by the General Affairs Council in June 2001 to coordinate our internal and external human rights policies better?"
"The Commission and Parliament itself should in fact also be able to answer this question."
"If you would allow me to make a final comment on Mr Ribeiro e Castro's alternative draft proposal, I must say that I find it rather funny."
"You would have to be a true optimist to put forward that proposal."
"Anyone who supports this resolution obviously wants to shut their eyes to reality."
"It is a nice example of wishful thinking, but it is too good to be true."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to begin by thanking the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs and Mrs Joke Swiebel for this opportunity to discuss the situation of fundamental rights in the European Union in 2001 in plenary today."
"The report that has been presented to you today is a document that is both vast and ambitious, because it attempts to provide an overview of the situation of fundamental rights in the European Union and its Member States and because it calls on the national authorities and the European institutions to adopt practical measures."
"By way of example, I might mention the need to pursue a consistent policy of combating discrimination - all forms of discrimination - and of promoting integration in European societies in order to prevent demonstrations of racism and xenophobia and to protect the rights that underpin European citizenship."
"The European Parliament's Annual Report on the situation of fundamental rights in the Union is an important instrument in terms of due regard being given to these rights, both at European level and at the level of every Member State, either within the current Union or in a Union of 25 Member States."
"The Commission, for its part, has a direct interest in the report that Parliament will be voting on, since, as Mrs Swiebel has just stated, we are also required to adopt a set of practical actions."
"For my own part, I give a commitment carefully to study whatever recommendations Parliament wishes to make to us, and we shall, of course, adopt the appropriate measures to ensure that these are followed up."
"The Commission has always been equal to the challenges Parliament has set for it and I believe that we have together taken up these challenges in a positive way, in order to develop fruitful cooperation between the two institutions in this field."
"An excellent example of this cooperation is surely the Commission's creation, following Parliament's resolution of July 2001, of a network of experts in the field of fundamental rights."
"In this resolution, based on Parliament's report for the year 2000, drawn up by Mr Cornillet, Parliament clearly expressed its commitment to adopting a serious and practical approach to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, calling for an appropriate control instrument to be set in place and for an assessment to be made of the situation of fundamental rights, both at Member State and European Union level."
"The Commission, like Parliament, is convinced that being well-informed about the state of protection of fundamental rights is crucial to our being able to assess the quality of this protection, and this assessment must always be rigorous and efficient."
"This is the task of the Network of Experts on Fundamental Rights."
"This network will enable both Parliament and the Commission to remain vigilant and to ensure that the Charter of Fundamental Rights is complied with and given due consideration."
"We are of the opinion that the network must be allowed to work and to start publishing its findings before we move ahead with more complex institutional solutions, such as setting up a monitoring centre."
"By the same token, this network will be obliged to provide Parliament and the Commission with information on the sensitive issue of the balance between security and freedom in the context of the fight against terrorism, an area that will receive particular attention in the report that is currently being drawn up as part of the network's work."
"This network of experts in the field of fundamental rights became operational in October 2002, and the report that it is drafting must take account of changes in national law, the case law of the Luxembourg and Strasbourg courts and significant case law of the constitutional and other courts of the Member States."
"In this context, the importance of the role that Parliament and the Commission are called on to play has two strands: on the one hand, to have an even clearer view of the situation in the field of fundamental rights in the Member States in order to adopt the actions and decisions necessary in this area in a targeted and precise way by virtue of the powers conferred on the European institutions by the Treaties; and, on the other, to show Europe's citizens that the protection of fundamental rights is more than just a political declaration; it is a real concern of the European institutions."
"To this end, I should like to recall that placing fundamental rights at the heart of European integration means defending the thesis that the Convention on the Future of Europe and the subsequent Intergovernmental Conference must include the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the Constitutional Treaty of the Union and give it binding legal force."
"The European Union is an area of freedom, security and justice which fails to provide a rigorous protection of fundamental rights."
"Drafting a Treaty of a constitutional nature, an authentic European Constitution, of which the Charter of Fundamental Rights is an integral part, and which at the same time and in parallel authorises the European Union to sign up to the European Convention on Human Rights, is a major challenge facing us and one that we must overcome."
"At the same time, however, a pragmatic and effective assessment must be made of the quality of protection of fundamental rights."
"This report, the debate in this plenary and Parliament's final resolution will certainly make a major contribution to the Commission's actions over the next year in the field of fundamental rights."
"Mr President. Without wishing to deny that the work carried out by Mrs Swiebel is indeed considerable, I would nonetheless like to be slightly critical of this report, as I feel it has missed its opportunity and might even serve no purpose at all."
"As Commissioner Vitorino pointed out, last year, Parliament clearly established a number of points based on the new fact of the adoption of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which we hope and pray for, to make them the preamble to a constitution."
"There are three points therefore: drawing up a procedure, which I shall come back to; establishing resources, either parliamentary resources or external resources which could help us, without replacing us, however, which would be available to the network of experts; and the call for joint action, in other words, in fact, to work with the three rapporteurs, namely those from the year underway, the previous year and the following year, so that a consensus might be established, provided that this work concerns facts and is therefore not, a priori, too controversial."
"Unfortunately, the idea was not followed up and I feel that this report is more a reflection of the rapporteur's views than the extensive analysis that would have been desirable."
"The methodology could be summarised as follows: the whole Charter and nothing but the Charter."
"The whole Charter, meaning that we therefore need, first of all, an analysis carried out article by article, State by State, of which there are fifteen this year, and of which there will soon be twenty-five, providing an opportunity to check whether or not they were respecting the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and then value by value, on the solidarity and justice chapters, making it possible to provide an overall view of these great values, to find out whether they are observed within the European Union."
"This is an opportunity to go beyond the strict application of the Charter with regard to the legislation of the Union of States derogating from the legislation of the Union, and Parliament had an opportunity there to acquire the power to control the actions of the States, which nobody can challenge in a Parliament, with regard to public freedom."
"I therefore believe some humility was needed to accomplish this painstaking task."
"Naturally this did not prevent the emphasis being placed on a number of subjects dear to the rapporteurs, which terrorism allowed this year, following the events of September 2001."
"The whole Charter, therefore, and nothing but the Charter, in other words the articles as they are and not as we might like them to be; this Charter was subject to a consensus and I should point out that the report upon which we are going to vote tomorrow has absolutely no effect on the Charter, since only a new Convention, which would have to be convened, is able to change the articles of the Charter."
"There are other means of action, resolutions, on occasion, directives, etc. We can also call a new Convention, as I have just said."
"We can also protest in our own countries since each Member State is free to go beyond the minimum standard constituted by the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"I would like to take this opportunity to criticise very briefly a certain attitude that I consider to be irresponsible and populist, and which has enabled some amendments tabled by the far left and the Verts/ALE to be reconsidered, thanks, I would say, to the complicity of the Group of the Party of European Socialists."
"I abhor this, because by acting in this way, it has accepted things that are not found in any programme of any socialist party in any country."
"Mr President, in brief conclusion, I would like to express my regret."
"Here we have a report which could have been much anticipated by the press and feared by the Member States, which could have served as a beacon to mark our position."
"Sadly, I am afraid that the 2001 report, which, moreover, was adopted too late, might be buried with other useless reports; as the PPE-DE does not intend to join in this burial, it will vote against it."
"(Applause from the right)"
"Mr President, I would firstly like to welcome this report and thank the rapporteur for her work and I would also like to welcome what Commissioner Vitorino said in relation to the procedure to be followed in order to be able to hold a genuine annual debate on human rights in the European Union."
"This has historically been a conflictive report, to the shame of this Parliament."
"In this house we are capable of deciding on a weekly basis what the human rights problems are in any corner of the world, but we are not capable of agreeing once a year on what standards should be complied with within the European Union in relation to fundamental rights."
"The charter should be a good instrument for measuring them."
"We are moving in the right direction, formulas are developing so that we can work jointly with the Commission."
"This work involves the political control, as the rapporteur said, of the degree of compliance, in each of the Member States, with the fundamental rights in the Union."
"While this is happening, while we are evolving, we should have the generosity to do it together and to do it well."
"I believe Mrs Swiebel's report is a balanced report, because it is sincere and transparent, it mentions sources, without judging them, it does not oblige us to vote against or in favour of certain facts, but it draws attention to existing complaints which the executives must investigate and assess."
"I would point out to Mr Cornillet that this report has always been controversial."
"Just last year, Mr Cornillet, your report, which, according to you, moved in the right direction, was approved unanimously by the Socialists and with more than one hundred votes from your own group against and only 38 in favour."
"I believe that amongst all of us we can make an effort to find the main route to the positive development of the control of human rights within the European Union."
"Mr President, in her intervention the rapporteur begins by saying that the right to life and human dignity are essential rights, and I entirely agree with her, and in order for that life to be dignified, the right to work, to health, to education and to housing are essential."
"The report points out quite correctly that seven Member States are failing to comply with the principles of the European Social Charter, for example in relation to access for foreigners to employment, their rights of assembly and trade union rights."
"As the rapporteur for the Committee on Social Affairs also says, there is a tendency to restrict social and economic rights within the context of reforms of the labour market."
"I will only comment on certain aspects, Mr President, given the time available."
"The UNHCR also expresses its concern at the increasing tendency to link asylum seekers to possible crime and terrorism, particularly following 11 September."
"I believe that a common asylum and immigration policy that respects human rights is essential, as the rapporteur also points out."
"The repercussions of anti-terrorist measures on the Rule of Law and human rights should be assessed, above all in terms of the rights of asylum seekers and immigrants."
"Mr President, every day in Spain we see a horrendous tragedy involving people who come looking for a better life."
"Finally, Mr President, the Committee on Petitions, by means of the report by its rapporteur, points out that family grouping, the right to asylum and free movement are daily problems in the European Union."
"I do not understand the proposals of some Members of this house which discredit the essential nature of this report."
"Mr President, my group certainly welcomes this report and will not be supporting the alternative resolution."
"We consider it to be a thorough and wide-ranging piece of work that highlights many positive points about the state of human rights within the European Union, even if many parts of it make extremely uncomfortable reading."
"As others have said, it is essential that we look at ourselves very critically, at least as carefully as we have been looking at accession countries and indeed third countries."
"We are critical about the human rights records of other governments, but seem very unwilling to criticise when it comes to the European Union itself."
"I want to pick out some examples, such as the treatment of the Roma people."
"My country sees no problem in sending the Roma back to their countries of origin."
"It threatens to break up families."
"It lays on special chartered aircraft in order to deport them en masse and there is no follow-up to see what happens to them when they get back to their countries of origin."
"And yet we have criticised accession countries heavily for their treatment of the Roma people."
"Mention has already been made of the asylum issue."
"When you read the comments in the explanatory statement, about my own Member State and others, many of them are critical."
"The UK Government, for example, recently introduced a human rights act."
"All proposed legislation is to be benchmarked against that act."
"Yet virtually everything that comes through is stamped as being fully compatible, even though it is obviously not."
"I hope that in Conclusion 9, where we refer to the Commission's decision to review its own legislative proposals against the criteria of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the Commission will be more rigorous in this than some Member States."
"The comments about the accountability of police services make very uncomfortable reading, particularly when we are concerned with the core standards that people should expect across the European Union in, for example, the implementation of the European arrest warrant."
"I know that this report will be at least a recognition of some of the battles being fought in my own country by organisations such as INQUEST, where families are still trying to find out after many years what exactly happened when family members died in police custody, yet nothing is being made public and there is no proper retribution."
"We welcome many of the recommendations in this report, particularly Conclusion 5, where we are looking at this report being incorporated in future into an early warning system on Articles 6 and 7 of the European Union Treaties, picking up petitions we have also had in the Committee on Petitions."
"Mr President, as Mrs Swiebel said in a Dutch newspaper, if Europe imposes stricter standards on others than it does on itself it will lose credibility."
"Indeed, we should take a good look at ourselves before we point a finger at others."
"In the light of the situation the world is in, however, this statement is a long way from reality."
"I do not want to play down the violations of human rights in EU Member States."
"We need to remain vigilant so that the relatively good human rights situation in the EU does not deteriorate."
"Any layperson can, however, see that the violations of human rights that take place here and also the human rights themselves that have been violated are of a different order from those taking place elsewhere."
"In Pakistan people are being sentenced to death for belonging to a religion."
"Mrs Swiebel mentions a political party in the Netherlands that does not admit women as members as a serious case of violation, along with the fact that it takes too long to take legal action in some states."
"This kind of occurrence cannot be compared with the others."
"At present, the reality is that Europe is imposing stricter standards on itself than on others."
"The very suggestion that it might be the other way round makes us lose credibility in the eyes of the outside world."
"The Swiebel report pleads for a clear framework, preferably a constitution, as we would otherwise not be able to arrive at an independent, unambiguous assessment."
"In fact, this report reveals a clear political colour and the 'values and standards' tag that goes with it. That these standards and values are obviously not universal is demonstrated not least by the number of opponents in the committee responsible and by the alternative proposal put forward by the UEN."
"A constitution of our own would be undesirable and unnecessary."
"The EU consists of solid nation states with their own perfectly good constitutions."
"These are contained in an existing democratic order with a process of judicial review and an involved civilian population."
"If the European Union were to get a constitution of its own, this would at most be able to supplement the national Member States' own constitutions."
"What is more, in Europe we have the excellent ECHR and the Court associated with it."
"So now we are supposed to go and review ourselves when the need arises?"
"Europe is a community of values, not only an economic community, as Mrs Swiebel rightly says."
"Our Member States' constitutions and the ECHR prove that."
"The review framework and the review process already exist."
"We do not need a politically tinted report from the European Parliament or a European constitution for that."
"Mr President, the protection of fundamental rights is undoubtedly one of the driving forces of the current evolution of the European Union."
"Therefore the proclamation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, in December 2000, was an unprecedented event in terms of the recognition of a Union which is increasingly close to the citizens and sensitive to their needs."
"The European Parliament, an institution which is particularly sensitive to the issue of protecting our citizens, had no hesitation in making it the key element of its annual report on respect for fundamental rights in the Union, the aim of which is to assess the degree of compliance with the rights contained in the Charter in any particular year."
"In this context, I believe that this annual resolution is a wonderful opportunity for the European Parliament to demonstrate its interest in safeguarding fundamental rights, as well as controlling their application, especially with the invaluable support of the network of experts which the Commissioner referred to and whose work I had the honour of inaugurating together with him."
"Furthermore, so that we are not hindered in this task, I believe it essential that the European Parliament tries to achieve the greatest possible degree of consensus, seeking to bring together the positions of the political groups and thereby becoming a genuine institution for controlling compliance with the fundamental rights of the Union."
"Nevertheless, I must unfortunately acknowledge that this has not been the situation, quite the opposite."
"Opting to include party-oriented versions on issues such as the family or the treatment foreigners must receive within European territory simply overshadow the other extremely important issues referred to in the text, such as the fight against terrorism or against torture."
"In fact, the report which we are to vote on in the plenary goes much further than its own objective and diverts attention from the important thing - assessing whether or not rights have been respected - towards party political issues, which consists of adopting positions on certain issues which are still under discussion within the framework of other reports and which also reflect positions which are different from that which the government of the colour of the rapporteur maintains in the Council."
"I must therefore unfortunately say that my group will be obliged to vote against the report, since it is impossible to support a text which is not suited to its purpose or the continuity set by its predecessors."
"Mr President, first of all I would like to apologise to the rapporteur that I was unable to be here at the beginning."
"I have only just arrived in the Parliament because of delays."
"I welcome the fact that we are able to have a debate on the fundamental rights within the European Union."
"It is very important, particularly when we are urging the applicant countries - and indeed countries which are not yet applicant countries - to address certain issues, that we should be prepared to look openly at ourselves."
"Having said that, I regret some of the statements made in the report criticising the United Kingdom and other countries, on matters to which there are no easy answers."
"I refer particularly to the points about asylum and immigration with regard to the United Kingdom, which is not perfect on these issues, but which is faced with a real challenge."
"This is not an easy situation."
"The United Kingdom, along with many other countries within Europe, has many applicants for asylum, and there are large numbers of people on the move, seeking to migrate from one country to the other."
"We need to work towards a common European asylum policy."
"When this is in place, we will be able to make certain that not just the fifteen Member States, but twenty-five countries, have policies that are working and are fair to the countries themselves and to applicants."
"The report contains references (at second hand) to prison facilities in the United Kingdom and indeed in other Member States."
"However, it is very difficult to spend huge amounts of money on prisons when there are demands from other areas."
"It is indeed a mark of a civilised country that it takes its prison service seriously, and all allegations in the United Kingdom, and I imagine in other countries, against malpractice or cruelty in prisons are properly investigated."
"The same is true of the police service, and the British police take seriously any allegations of malpractice or racism by police officers."
"It is right that we are able to have this debate, it is right that these issues are being brought to our attention, but I do not believe that the United Kingdom should be singled out any more than other countries."
"Mr President, Mrs Swiebel has done good work in her survey of human rights breaches in Member States and I am sad that the Christian Democrats and Conservatives are so opposed to it."
"Mr Cornillet was himself a distinguished previous rapporteur."
"Human rights issues are intensely political but it is a pity when they become the subject of partisan divisions."
"I hope we can get back to working together on the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, because the years ahead will see intensified challenges to, and dilemmas regarding, fundamental rights and we have to be even more systematic in our work."
"Briefly, I just want to mention and explain why the Liberal Group is seeking to remove the wording in paragraphs 83 and 84 which urges the Member States and the EU to ensure marriage is open to same-sex couples."
"We are certainly not opposed to this in principle, but this really is a matter for national decision, as in the Netherlands."
"Introducing the marriage issue distracts from the real priority, to which Liberals are absolutely committed, which is to give legal recognition to same-sex and unmarried partnerships: that really is a matter of fundamental rights."
"Mr President, I would like to start by thanking Mrs Swiebel for her excellent work or, at least, what we believe to be excellent work."
"We endorse the content of the report and, above all, the courageous approach the rapporteur has adopted in naming, giving specific, practical details, the States which have violated human rights or have not signed or ratified international conventions on the protection and safeguarding of human rights."
"Of the many issues raised in the report, as this debate shows, there are two which are particularly important and sensitive."
"Firstly, the concern that blindly waging war on terrorism might lead, if this has not already happened, to less care being taken to promote, protect and safeguard sacrosanct civil and human rights."
"In this regard, there are already people in the United States who would like to see torture legally introduced."
"This is a debate which greatly concerns us and which we must vigorously oppose, using the weapons of the law and legislation to oppose the weapons of violence, insofar as this can be deemed lawful."
"The other issue which the rapporteur has courageously highlighted is the recognition of same-sex marriages."
"In our opinion, we also need to enshrine in legislation the individual's right to freedom in a broad sense, which is true freedom."
"As other Members have pointed out, it will be necessary to pay greater attention to the Commission and the Council's work in the area of human rights."
"We radical Members condemn the fact that, all too often, the failure of the European institutions to take action in the field of respect for human rights, both in third countries and the countries of the Union, has serious, catastrophic implications for the citizens and for the institutions themselves."
"Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty on European Union, and what is known as the democratic clause too, are now completely devoid of meaning, thanks, primarily, to the Council and the Commission."
"To put it more simply, the principle of respect for human rights and the safeguarding of human rights are wholly theoretical."
"Once again, as regards Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty, the European Parliament has, for the first time, used the procedure laid down in Rule 108 of the Rules of Procedure to call for Community measures to be taken against Italy for the serious, ongoing violation of human rights and the rule of law with reference to the ongoing, unlawful failure to establish the plenum required by the Constitution, by the Italian Parliament and by the Constitutional Court."
"Violations in Italy continue to be very frequent."
"A few days ago, the Italian Parliament established what is known as ' 41 bis', the special incarceration regime, whose application we have documented evidence consists of genuine torture within a democracy."
"The Italian Prime Minister himself, Silvio Berlusconi, has declared this law to be illiberal but necessary."
"We will discuss this matter another time, however."
"Meanwhile, the radical Members will vote wholeheartedly for Mrs Swiebel's report."
"Commissioner, you described this report as very wide-ranging and ambitious."
"I will take these two adjectives as the basis for a number of minor points for reflection."
"It is certainly wide-ranging - too wide-ranging in terms of the issues addressed."
"Is it ambitious?"
"It is not ambitious enough in its conclusions, which are limited to a few political objectives - the same objectives as always."
"Indeed, the rapporteur puts ingredients that are too different and too unrelated into a cocktail shaker in the hope that the result will be a digestible, well-balanced cocktail with an approach that can be submitted for the approval of all the Member States, an approach including shared, common principles on which legislation and positions can be based in the endeavour to guarantee the fundamental rights of all the citizens."
"Alongside a few principles which we support, for example in the field of combating discrimination and xenophobia, the rapporteur actually includes an undertaking which is too partisan in the section on freedom, going so far as to place in the stocks the police, the legal systems and the media of some - only some, take note - Member States for events connected with street riots caused by the Black Blocks and their supporters in white overalls."
"The rapporteur has been influenced by bad counsel of the sort we can easily imagine - by partisan and party interests - and has wasted and bungled the opportunity she had to present a serious discussion on human rights, losing herself in empty tirades and gratuitous accusations worthy of a low-profile debate."
"The judges and police officers of some of the Member States are described as torturers, accused of beating up innocent people."
"This is a line which is unacceptable as well as out of place in such an important report as this one, just as the family model the rapporteur proposes is entirely unacceptable. It is in line with her own personal beliefs, but it contrasts with the attitude of the vast majority of Europe's citizens, who certainly do not see homosexual unions and the right to adopt as the ideal formula on which to build the European society of tomorrow."
"Mr President, in drafting her report, my colleague, Mrs Joke Swiebel, has chosen a very exacting working method."
"She levels her criticisms regarding failures in the area of human rights directly at countries that are mentioned by name."
"The method provides a specific context for any evaluation of the human rights situation in Europe but anyone who employs such a method has an enormous responsibility for ensuring that the picture presented is an accurate one."
"Unfortunately, this has not entirely been the case here."
"Item 27 gives the reader the idea that there is no viable alternative to military service in Finland."
"In it, Finland and Greece are called on to recognise the right of conscientious objection to military service without restriction and without reference to any religious grounds."
"There has been such a right in existence in Finland, however, since 1931."
"Under the law at present anyone obliged to do military service can in practice choose a non-military form of service."
"Every year approximately 2 500 people exercise this right, which is 7% of those liable."
"Around 80% do their military service and a little over 10% are excused."
"The concern expressed in the report presumably refers to the fact that in Finland the period of time spent doing alternative, non-military service is twice as long as the minimum period of service."
"There is also concern regarding the fact that there is a total of 20 people in prison who refuse and are unwilling to fulfil their civic duties in any way."
"The reason why in Finland the period of time spent doing non-military service is longer is that those concerned are obliged to work eight hours a day, during a normal working week, whilst those doing military service are on duty 24 hours a day."
"I think that in the future it will be the task of the Finnish Parliament to get the balance right."
"The fact that the vast majority of young men in Finland do military service is not because there are no alternatives to it."
"In Finland we still remember all too well how important a conscripted army is for the country's independence."
"During the Second World War, apart from London and Moscow, Helsinki was the only capital city of a country at war that was not occupied."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in making out that it is a champion of human rights, the European Union tailors them to its needs."
"It has no problem, for example, defending the rights of homosexuals, but has nothing to say about the right to a job, to health care, to an education, to culture or to sport."
"At the same time, it systematically encourages existing democratic rights to be undermined or abolished, using terrorism and illegal immigration as its pretext."
"The European Union's version of human rights is set out in the so-called Charter of Fundamental Rights which the Communist Party of Greece has denounced as inadequate and misleading."
"The report measures human rights against this charter, which is why there is not the slightest reference to the slavery introduced with new forms of work and to the decimation and commercialisation of social benefits."
"It has no objection to the plethora of new terrorist laws and it ignores the personal electronic files kept by the Schengen system and the fact that ideas which upset the system are passed over, distorted or even expelled and persecuted."
"The good thing about the report, however, is that it identifies a whole series of infringements, such as the torture of prisoners, trafficking in human beings and the suppression of rights in Genoa."
"Another good thing is that it calls for church and state to be separated, criticises child labour, highlights the adverse impact of measures to combat terrorism and asylum and immigration laws and discusses the social emancipation of women."
"Neither the situation on the ground nor the report, however, are of any benefit to the European Union and improvements will only come about if the grass-roots movement steps up its fight."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the importance of today's debate lies in Article 6º of the Treaty of European Union itself, which states that the Union is founded on the principles of freedom, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law, principles which are common to the Member States. In other words, European integration has been achieved on the basis of fully respecting, guaranteeing and promoting fundamental and human rights, in which the well-being and dignity of its citizens must be the inspiration and goal for every and any action taken by any Member State and by the Community institutions."
"Hence the importance of the European Parliament's Annual Report on Human Rights, which has provided the ideal opportunity to take a close look at the EU's human rights policy, within the Union and beyond it, and at the role that the European Parliament has played, of which we can be proud."
"Hence my disappointment with the report that has been presented; with its lack of balance and rigor."
"The report presented to us last year by Mr Cornillet was rich in ideas and analysis and constituted a milestone and an extremely positive step towards defining a methodology for monitoring and evaluation, which should underpin any human rights policy, based of course on the European Charter covering these rights."
"Whilst containing aspects that deserve our support, such as the issues of terrorism, trafficking in human beings and human rights and the highly topical problem of achieving the necessary balance between security and human rights, the report we have been presented with this year , however, gives way in some points to demagogy and generally shies away from the rigorous principles which a resolution adopted by the European Parliament should uphold."
"This is why, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree more with the text of the alternative resolution tabled by Mr Ribeiro Castro, which shall have my vote."
"Madam President, I personally am very happy that Mrs Swiebel's report sums up the human rights situation in the European Union and even within the Member States."
"I believe it to be a cornerstone of the work of this Parliament because it enables us to take a step back, which is so unusual here, and consider a clear, coherent policy with specific actions to achieve the goals we proclaim so often."
"I shall not insult you by citing the various conventions and treaties that we must observe or by restating our will to anchor the Charter of Fundamental Rights unconditionally in European consciousness in order to establish the rights and freedoms of these European citizens."
"Each year, however, when we draw up a report on human rights, when we lament the violations that have taken place, when we adopt resolutions, we only talk about third countries."
"How can we have credibility and impose these rights in our relations with these countries, if we ourselves do not respect them?"
"Some Members here will be horrified at the thought of naming certain countries in this report."
"We must not, however, shy away from this."
"As democrats, we are representatives of our citizens; we are not protectors of the policies of our national governments."
"We must confirm, here in Parliament, that the defence of fundamental rights and freedoms in the European Union is more than just words; it affects every aspect of life, for all human beings, wherever they may be, whether or not they live in an area of freedom."
"Defending human rights is a duty and a right which must not be hampered by the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of the Member States."
"The purpose of this report is therefore to assess the situation."
"It is our role to act if this situation does not satisfy us, so that these fundamental rights might be a fact of everyday life in our own Member States."
"I shall end on two points: first, I am very happy that economic and social rights are assessed at European level and I believe this Convention should take inspiration from that."
"I would then ask our Member States to do what it takes to establish clear statistics, sorted by gender, in every area, and provide them to our next rapporteurs."
"There are many very good points in Mrs Swiebel's report and a huge amount of hard work has gone into its preparation."
"Inevitably, it makes many of us feel uncomfortable when we find our own countries being referred to as not having ratified many of the human rights conventions."
"On a day in which we celebrate the action of the governor of Illinois on the death penalty, I am glad to see that Mrs Swiebel congratulates the Irish Government on having finally abolished the death penalty."
"Of course, it has not been used for a great many years and was maintained on our statute books only for the killing of policemen."
"But I would particularly like to welcome her section on the rights of children."
"I have been a Member of this Parliament probably longer than most people here at the moment."
"Until the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child was drawn up, the rights of children, the intrinsic rights of children, were not recognised, discussed or seen as part of fundamental human rights."
"However, the UN optional protocol on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography is also referred to."
"We did not consider any of these issues when we started discussing human rights and holding the annual discussion on human rights."
"For example, the issue of the exploitation of children on the Internet was not even a twinkle in the Commission's eye until relatively recently."
"It was not an area about which we actually had a great deal of knowledge or information."
"The section recognising these as important rights for children that have to be protected is to be warmly welcomed."
"I hope we will see this section enlarged as the years go by and as we discover, unfortunately, just what a dangerous world it is for many of our children."
"I would like to thank Mrs Swiebel for making this such an important part of the report."
"Mr President, Mrs Swiebel's report contains a couple of interesting points."
"I endorse what Mrs Banotti has just said about children's rights."
"Examining this in detail in a parliamentary report is an excellent idea."
"I would like to add something to Mrs Swiebel's wish to see such reports play a role in criticising and possibly punishing Member States who fail in their duties when it comes to enforcing the constitutional state and democracy."
"Since the Treaty of Amsterdam, then the Treaty of Nice and possibly as part of the Convention, we do in fact have more opportunities to give Member States a good ticking off if they make mistakes, and even to kick them out of the Community."
"It would be excellent if Parliament had a role to play in this."
"Her suggestion that the European Social Charter be compared with the European Charter of Fundamental Rights is also a very good one."
"I think that the Charter of Human Rights should be given priority, but it is a good idea to measure everything we do against both of these charters."
"That must be an absolutely basic requirement."
"The European Parliament would then win the confidence of the Council, for example, with a view to communitisation."
"The Council, the people, the Member States and the parliaments of the Member States must know that we are using our powers in the proper manner."
"In the event of a procedural opportunity - in other words if we were to play a role in criticising Member States - I would be in favour of personally coming clean if we make a mistake."
"The report does, however, fall short when it comes to the severity of the treatment, and could thus become a millstone in the struggle for the communitisation of the third pillar."
"There is, after all, no real consistency in the application of the Charter of Human Rights."
"You could much rather regard Mrs Swiebel's ideology and views as a guide for assessing Member States."
"A country can easily be respectable even if it is criticised by Mrs Swiebel."
"Certainly if I read paragraph 133."
"If you tell the public that a climate of immunity from punishment is developing in Austria, Belgium, France, Italy, Portugal, Sweden and the United Kingdom, they will laugh their heads off."
"That really is too ridiculous for words."
"Nevertheless, you also cannot say - to give you yet another example of sloppiness - that unmarried couples should have the same rights as married couples. That is idiotic; it will not make you popular with unmarried couples."
"The fact is they do not want all these rights. I am very much in favour of promoting gay rights, but not by saying that you will also get the rights you do not want."
"The report is thus riddled with all sorts of examples that are also impossible from a legal point of view."
"Mr President, the major split in the vote on this report in the relevant committee must mean that Mrs Swiebel has not sought a unifying solution."
"She has selectively presented a list of areas which are not only deeply controversial politically - for example, in their view of the family and of family legislation - but also demonstrably do not belong among the European Union's areas of competence."
"Mrs Swiebel would have to search high and low in the UN Charter on Fundamental Rights, the European Convention's Charter of Human Rights and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights for a reason why these issues should be included in a report on fundamental rights."
"Mrs Swiebel, does, for example, the fact that polygamy is not accepted in the European Union mean that Muslims resident in Europe are discriminated against?"
"Is this a crime against human rights?"
"The question no doubt needs to be answered when so many new subjects have been added to the topic of human rights."
"I would also ask Mrs Swiebel why, in addressing so many new subject areas, she makes no mention, for example, of the fact that the Netherlands has legalised prostitution."
"There is therefore a need to 'import' women into a country in which prostitution is, strangely enough, considered to be a lawful and approved activity."
"Why does Mrs Swiebel make no mention of her own country's assisted euthanasia policy, which is abused by some doctors and which leads to people ending their lives without dignity?"
"There are instances in which so-called assisted euthanasia is abused."
"Why is no mention made of parents' right to allow their children to grow up in a drug-free society in which parents know that the law is on their side?"
"Mrs Swiebel has been very selective."
"We Christian Democrats will of course vote against this report, because Mrs Swiebel has failed in an important task of the European Parliament."
"Mr President, I subscribe to the general comments made by my honourable friends in the Europe People's Party and shall confine myself to commenting on two criticisms levied against Greece which, because they go too far, undermine the credibility of the report and real fundamental rights."
"The first concerns the ban on women pilgrims entering Mount Athos in Greece."
"This ban has been in place for 1200 years and is enshrined in the Treaty of the European Union and the Greek constitution."
"It cannot therefore be changed, nor should it, because to do so would be to accept that the home is not inviolable."
"Mount Athos is home to 5 000 monks and it is their right to receive whomsoever they please in their home, just as it is our right, as simple citizens, to receive and offer hospitality to whomsoever we want in our home and keep out anyone we do not."
"This is not a tourist area and any women interested in how Orthodox monks live need only visit the hundreds of other monasteries in Greece and other Orthodox countries in order to satisfy their curiosity."
"My second comment concerns conscientious objectors."
"Unfortunately, religious convictions or an aversion to the violence which the army may stand for are used as a pretext by a number of people to avoid military service and while away their days in the civil service at the state's expense, even though some of them have no hesitation in using violence if it serves their ideological purpose."
"May I inform you, my honourable friends, that some of the November 17 terrorists who were recently arrested in Greece, whose much-publicised trial is due to start in a few days' time, and who have so far murdered some 50 foreign diplomats, ministers, politicians, journalists and judges, have stated that they are conscientious objectors and have been exempted from military service, while another conscientious objector serving in a mental institution has been getting his kicks out of torturing the inmates."
"It is a pity that we always go too far and end up ridiculing fundamental rights."
"Mr President, the weaknesses of this report do not lie in the fact that it condemns breaches of human rights where they exist but, in my opinion, in the way in which it has been drafted and in the methodology used to present these condemnations."
"In choosing to give, in the explanatory statement, a lengthy and detailed description of possible breaches of fundamental rights by some Member States, this report has led to claims and accusations against these Member States that cannot be refuted and have not even been submitted to a democratic vote because they are not included in the text of the motion for a resolution."
"These claims are therefore unfair, because they do not allow for any response, even though they clearly have no validity in plenary since they are not included in the motion for a resolution."
"Furthermore, with regard to the sources the report has used, and without wishing in any way to call into question the credibility of many NGOs, I must point out that a report drawn up by the European Parliament ought to distance itself from and even reject the conclusions of each of these organisations, and avoid including, sometimes inaccurately, aspects of these studies."
"For example, regarding Portugal, it is claimed that discrimination exists on the grounds of sexual orientation, on the basis of the conclusions and observations of one NGO, which I shall not name as it appears in the text, and the rapporteur states that the Portuguese Penal Code contains legislation that discriminates in this field, an assertion that I reject on the grounds of a simple reading of the law."
"In fact, the Portuguese Penal Code makes no distinction in the field of sexual orientation with regard to the age of consent."
"Mr President, I believe that the European Parliament must responsibly assume its powers for safeguarding human rights and should never confine itself to simply transcribing the opinions of third parties."
"This will clearly always be the case until we have a legally applicable Charter of Fundamental Rights; only then will things be done differently."
"We all want to ban breaches, but there are no political breaches of rights - there are legal breaches or practical breaches and these either exist or they do not."
"No amount of political flexibility, no interpretative criteria will enable us to uncover breaches of rights where these are not considered to be breaches under the law."
"Nor, on the other hand, can we allow any breach of rights to be justified by political criteria."
"This is why I shall not be voting in favour of this report: the fundamental balance that is needed for delivering an opinion on such sensitive matters is absent from this text and it has therefore failed to win my support."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0449/2002) by Mr Pirker, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament entitled 'Towards integrated management of the external borders of the Member States of the European Union' (COM(2002) 233 - C5-0505/2002 - 2002/2212(INI))."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what we are dealing with here is the integrated management of our external borders, which is where, I am sure that we are all agreed, security, for the European Union, begins."
"They are also the starting point for defence against such menaces as organised crime, terrorism, smugglers, and illegal immigration."
"We know, though, that our external borders continue to be the weakest link in our internal security system as a whole, and the reasons for this are well known."
"They have to do with the different ways in which Schengen is interpreted, with differences in technical standards, and with the various agencies engaged in border control, with differences in training and, in general terms, with the lack of any Community, or even joint, action in matters concerning border control."
"If, however, we want to improve border security and hence make the EU more secure, we need equally high standards on all our external borders, both as they are at present and as they will be in the future, all of us being aware that the EU is about to be enlarged and that this demands that action be taken."
"The security that we are aiming for is something on which our internal security as a whole depends, as also does our ability to make a reality of the fundamental principle of freedom of movement."
"I welcome the initiatives taken by the Laeken European Council in December 2001, when it mandated the Commission and the Council to take appropriate steps to deal with this."
"I certainly welcome the Commission proposal, congratulate the Commissioner on the excellence of his preparatory work, and welcome the Council's plan of action."
"On these things there is broad agreement."
"I can also tell you - and I am glad to be able to do so - that these proposals met with broad consensus in the committee."
"I want, therefore, to express my gratitude for the close cooperation, which has seen all parties united in a concern for security."
"I believe that, in going ahead in this way, we have set a very good example, and I would be delighted if the same broad support and consensus were to be demonstrated tomorrow."
"What, then, are the crucial points in my report, on which there is such agreement?"
"I would like to single out five of them."
"The first is that we need to analyse and redefine the tasks involved and establish a common set of legal regulations."
"In order to do this, we also need to analyse the operational practice involved in the transposition of the Schengen acquis, which we know varies to a large extent."
"The Common Manual on border control should be revised to include the common standards and to take account of best practice."
"It strikes me as particularly important that we should have not merely a Common Manual, but should also establish a monitoring body to verify, at regular intervals, that the provisions are being implemented and adhered to, which is what common standards and high quality are all about."
"Leading on from that, the second priority is joint training and re-training."
"We must at long last give tangible effect to Article 7 of the Convention applying the Schengen Agreement."
"We are already engaged in drawing up a common core curriculum for border guards."
"What we need, however, in order to create a multiplier effect so that high standards may be guaranteed in the long term, is the establishment of a European Staff College for the training of senior officials, which should be supported through the ARGO programme, thus enabling the standard of training, as well as the common operating standards, to be maintained in the long term."
"The third priority is that the equipment used should be interchangeable."
"In this area, there is a lack of compatibility within the Member States, and practical cross-border cooperation is made utterly impossible by the completely incompatible technical standards involved."
"If we go over to using shared satellite or radar systems or start cooperating across borders, then compatible equipment becomes an absolute necessity."
"It would, moreover, make sense in the future - for reasons of economics as much as any other reason - to have these standards in the joint procurement of technical systems, which can be very expensive."
"Fourthly, we should carry out an ongoing risk analysis."
"As Europol also has systems for analysing organised crime, we should have them carry out a risk analysis, the results of which - reporting on situations and outlining any assistance needed - would be communicated to the Member States and made available in order to make the common standards a reality here."
"It would be desirable - and, in terms of increased efficiency, an overall objective - for data to be exchanged between the Schengen, Europol and Eurodac systems, with, of course, all necessary data protection provisions being adhered to."
"There is no doubt that this could achieve certain synergies."
"The fifth priority is that a European Corps of Border Guards should be established, made up of specialist units and with Community funding, which would, in an emergency and at the request of the Member States, support the national authorities at vulnerable border points for limited periods."
"This would enable us not only to achieve an optimum standard of security at particularly vulnerable sections of our external borders, but also to share the burden of dealing with a specific situation on the external border, which the country involved cannot be expected to bear alone."
"By doing this, we would be providing assistance and sharing a burden, although it has to be said that, in principle, general competence in matters of control of the external borders should remain at national level."
"It is my hope that all this agreement will give us the necessary stimulus to at last bring about in reality what we owe to the public - a greater degree of security even when enlargement has taken place."
"We can get down to work."
"Parliament will give its full support to the endeavours of the Commission and the Council if they go down this road."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first of all to thank Mr Hubert Pirker for his report, which has focused not only on the Commission communication on the management of the EU's external borders, but also on the action plan adopted by the Council."
"We might also say that the two documents, the Commission proposal and the Council action plan, contain a great deal of common ground."
"I believe that, in fact, the four fundamental objectives that were set for us at Laeken form part of this action plan: increasing mutual trust between the Member States with regard to controlling our external border, which is a common border, which means that poor control over the border in one State has inevitable knock-on effects on the security of all the other Member States of the European Union, the effectiveness of the fight against illegal immigration, the particular priority that must be given to controlling the external borders to prevent the entry of terrorist groups or agents and, finally, to safeguard the high level of internal security in the European Union, without which we cannot preserve freedom of movement and the abolition of controls at our external borders."
"As Mr Pirker emphasised, the objectives of this action plan are clear; and I believe that, rather than talking about objectives, we must define targets and work out what actually needs to be done."
"Firstly, in the legislative field. We have the Schengen acquis, that, as Mr Pirker quite rightly underlined, is implemented very differently in the various States."
"We need to harmonise the way in which the Schengen acquis is implemented and we are doing so in two ways: firstly by revising the Common Schengen Manual, and the Commission will, in the first six months of this year, be submitting a proposal for this revision."
"The second objective is the training of border guards."
"I believe that, at this very moment, a meeting is taking place in Vienna, in which the Commission is participating, to define a proposal for a common curriculum for the training of border guards. This project is being led by Austria and by Sweden."
"The third objective is to use modern information technologies to improve the control of our external borders."
"In this field, the Commission plans at the Salonika European Council, this coming July, to present a viability study into the launching of the on-line visa system at European level."
"We will similarly be presenting the first proposals on the control of the European Union's external sea borders."
"The fourth objective is to define a common risk analysis model for controlling our external borders."
"In this field we already have a model, defined on the basis of a proposal presented by the Government of Finland, and a first meeting was held under the Danish Presidency of the so-called 'SCIFA+', which is the body that coordinates the border control services of all the Member States of the European Union."
"As a result of the functioning of this new body at European level it has been possible to develop, as early as in 2002, two practical operations."
"The first was the operation 'Ulysses', which was coordinated by Spain and involved joint teams from various Member States on controlling the Mediterranean; and the second was the operation of a joint team led by Germany to control its land borders."
"These two operations were, in 2002, funded by the ARGO Programme and new actions for operational cooperation have already been presented for 2003."
"Finally, the Seville European Council supported the principle of sharing responsibilities for controlling the external borders."
"This is a sharing of responsibilities in financial terms, in terms of sharing equipment and also with a view to creating, eventually, a common border guard force."
"The Commission presented an initial evaluation of the financial situation."
"We must acknowledge that the data that the Member States provided us with on the real expenditure of each of them on controlling the external borders were very different and were hard to compare."
"The Commission therefore requested further clarification and intends, during the Greek Presidency, to propose criteria for sharing financial responsibility for controlling the external border of the European Union."
"I hope that, with the motion for a resolution tabled by Mr Pirker, which will be voted on here tomorrow, Parliament will be able to give a decisive boost to this ambitious, demanding and crucial programme of action to control the external border of the European Union in order to enhance the domestic security of all Member States."
"Mr President, I would also like to congratulate Mr Coelho."
"Free movement within the Union is one of the most cherished achievements for this House and for many citizens in the European Union."
"The rules which regulate the free movement of persons within the Union are Community rules."
"Many of the measures it has been necessary to establish in order to guarantee it are scattered around our legislation."
"To guarantee this free movement requires a high degree of trust and cooperation between the Member States, particularly in the management of external borders."
"There is plenty of information on the reality of the situation to demonstrate that we have difficulties here, including the arrival on the coasts of the south of the European Union of people who hope that this will be the first stage of a journey but for whom it is often dramatically the last, the women rescued on a daily basis from their captors and exploiters, who offer them to Europeans who ask no questions about their origin, or the tragic spectacle we have witnessed for months in relation to the Sangatte centre."
"We believe that the European Commission has raised the need to deal with this issue correctly and in a timely manner."
"Firstly, because the enlargement of the European Union obliges us to do so."
"Secondly, because their proposal is a good signal to the Convention that it should resolve the legislative mess involving one of the Union's fundamental distinguishing marks; internal free movement."
"Thirdly, because it presents today, with the legal framework we have - and perhaps also the financial framework - the possibility of making progress on this objective."
"I agree with the notion that there is room to better guarantee both the freedom of security of those people who are in Community territory and the situation of those who wish to pass through it."
"Therefore, and despite our extremist tendencies, the Socialist Group will vote in favour of the Pirker report."
"I hope that the enthusiasm and broad support of this House are contagious and that the Council will go beyond its political declarations and actively and enthusiastically support this proposal."
"As the Commission itself says, the topic in this case is integrated management of the Member States' external borders."
"Even if the motion for a resolution in this report is adopted, moreover, it will, of course, in itself have no direct legal effects. Rather, the motion and the Commission's communication will acquire significance in the light of a series of other decisions concerning the development of police cooperation."
"In this context, the proposal signifies a development that, in my view, is a threat to democratic control and the rule of law."
"This is a policy that would considerably weaken the national authorities in favour of the EU authorities."
"The unmistakeable ambition is to develop a supranational border police force in the longer term, one of several steps on the road towards an actual federal police force."
"This expansion of the police service is, at one and the same time, about unthinking EU integration and the securing of Fortress Europe."
"The latter is an obvious consequence of that outside pressure that is due to the prosperity of the EU countries as compared with the wretched social conditions endured by our neighbours, a contrast basically due to the EU countries' policy, pursued for many years, of exploiting our neighbours."
"So much for the motion's real background."
"The content of the motion is no less alarming."
"The common legislative body, the system of coordination and operational cooperation, the interoperational facilities and the permanent exchange of information and data, in short the overall development of the police service, does nothing less than dismember that rule of law which, on the basis of experience in the Nordic countries, I see democratic activists as having sought to establish over the years."
"What does the Commission have to say about democratic and judicial control?"
"What we have is a non-binding and ill thought-out policy to the effect that control must be ensured."
"How?"
"No answer."
"What does the report have to say?"
"Not a word."
"EU border police and a common body for external borders?"
"No thank you."
"Mr President, here, at last, is a report which is genuinely Community-focused, although it takes as a starting point the specific, technical issue of the management of the Union's external borders."
"It is a very topical subject, as has been pointed out, if you consider that the Union's current external borders will be radically changed and extended in May 2004 when the 12 new Member States become part of the political and geographical structure of the current European Union. It is therefore more than appropriate that we should now be proposing the model used thus far on the basis of the consolidated experience of the 15 current Member States before the entry of the new candidates."
"The Pirker report drops into this wide-ranging framework a number of practical proposals on how to achieve integrated management of our external borders, without interfering in the territorial sovereignty of the individual States but rather defining the ideal formulae for harmonious cooperation."
"This is an acceptable approach which will involve the creation of a Community corps of border guards in the coming years - not straightaway but after we have fine-tuned techniques and procedures with appropriate measures for training staff and achieving cooperation between the different current corps of border guards."
"Hitherto impromptu experiments with mixed patrols have yielded excellent results. As far as my country, Italy, is concerned, these have been developed on borders with Member States such as France and Austria and on borders with third countries such as Switzerland too, and with a candidate country, Slovenia."
"The section which addresses the issue of combating illegal immigration is extremely innovative."
"This involves a difficult, daily undertaking, particularly on the part of border States such as Spain, Portugal, Italy and Greece."
"However, the problem is everybody's problem, not just the problem of these States, for, thanks to Schengen, an illegal immigrant who succeeds in penetrating the Adriatic coast has automatic access to many other Member States, at least those in the Schengen Area, which therefore have a major responsibility as well as a great opportunity."
"Therefore, the rapporteur is right to propose to call upon all the countries to work together to contribute to and bear the costs of external border controls, whether they have external borders or not."
"Indeed, it would appear to be clear that it is appropriate for all the countries to contribute if we are to achieve an effective control and monitoring service, particularly in the places where the flow of illegal immigrants is currently greatest - a genuine flood of new illegal immigrants is, even as we speak, pouring into the Union - for this is not just a problem for those who are directly involved in the daily fight against illegal immigration: it is also a problem for all those countries which are the automatic destinations of these illegal flows."
"Mr President, I echo the thanks of others to the rapporteur, the Commission and the Council for bringing this forward and recognising the need for further cooperation in this field, a very difficult area."
"I disagree, to an extent, with Mr Krarup, in that this is an issue that no one country can address on its own."
"It is vital that there are common policies, agreements and understandings between the 15 Member States."
"Having said that, we recognise the different situations in each Member State."
"Mrs Terrón i Cusí spoke earlier about the situation on the southern border of Spain."
"My own country, the United Kingdom, consists of one large island plus the north of Ireland."
"Other countries each have their own circumstances that need to be addressed: Greece, for example, has some 400 islands, and Luxembourg is land-locked."
"We all have very different situations and, in their own ways, these are very difficult to monitor and manage."
"But we do not manage very well with 15 countries at the moment."
"Mr Coelho quite rightly drew attention to the fact that when we are 25 countries in the EU - and later on 27 or 28 - it will be even more challenging."
"It is very important that we at least make the effort to get into position now something that is trying to address the issue, trying to face up to the challenge."
"We must make certain that we respect the rights of the individual."
"I agree with Mr Krarup on that."
"We can only do this if Member States work together, if we copy good practice from one country to another, if we do not repeat the mistakes that have been made in the past."
"Effectively, this means border management, hand-in-hand with common policies on asylum and immigration."
"It means being prepared to constantly update and upgrade, and it means border management which takes account of citizens' rights of movement."
"If we put those together we will address the issues for the years ahead in an enlarged European Union."
"Mr President, when Commissioner Verheugen reported to the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on the subject of eastward enlargement, I put two questions to him."
"The first was whether the Commission regarded a common framework for border control as necessary; and the second was whether the Commission believed that the candidate countries would be in a position to secure their borders with countries outside the EU to the same high standard of protection as the existing Member States already did."
"The Commissioner's reply was that the candidate countries would have no problem with guaranteeing a satisfactory level of protection on their own, and that there was no need for a European approach."
"The Commission has now changed its mind and presented a sensible proposal for a common framework for control of our external borders."
"Mr Pirker's report supports it and adds to it at various points, and Mr Coelho is unfortunately no longer here to hear me say that it goes without saying that I wholeheartedly support it too."
"It is to be regretted that Commissioner Verheugen has wasted a lot of valuable time by talking rubbish."
"One example of why this is a matter of urgency is the border between Germany and Poland, 456 kilometres long and formed by a river, where traffic across it is at present monitored by some 10 000 border guards."
"Poland's border with its non-EU neighbours is over 1 200 kilometres long and runs across fields for the whole of its length."
"The belief that, within the next few years, Poland will be able to secure this border on its own in anything like the same way as external borders used to be secured, is utterly illusory."
"This is where European solidarity is needed, as the defence of the external borders by a number of Member States is to the ultimate benefit of all Member States."
"Denmark, Sweden, Belgium, and the Netherlands reap the benefits of a high level of external border control."
"Any European concept of external border control must, at the end of the day, be enshrined in the Treaties, both by the allocation of combined powers to the EU and, on the other hand, by giving it institutional form as a European body in parallel with Europol and Eurojust."
"And, in these present times, as Cato did in the senate of ancient Rome, I will end all my speeches with the same words: Commissioner Vitorino, I wish that the Convention would demonstrate greater courage in this area."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I feel myself honoured to be allowed to say the last word here today."
"Before wishing you good-night, I would of course like to avail myself of the opportunity to tell you what I think and, as one who comes from Germany, to set out in clear terms the importance of external border control, Germany being, as Mr von Boetticher has just said, a country with a vast external border."
"So, Commissioner, we are very glad that you have presented this communication, and also that the report by the PPE-DE Group's Mr Pirker has proposed the right thing and enjoys our support for that reason."
"I assume that Parliament's united manifestation of agreement with the Commission in this area will, perhaps with the Greek Presidency's help, make it possible to win the Council over, as the Greek Presidency has already signalled the importance it attaches to combating illegal immigration and smugglers of any kind."
"I have high hopes of them."
"This Parliament does of course have Members who persist in regarding the reinforcement of police or border control units as problematic, and who tell us how much better all these things should be done."
"Over and over again, they ask why we need the police so much."
"I can tell them in all frankness that I should prefer to deploy as many police officers as possible and have a secure border that prevents refugees escaping to their deaths."
"I become really fed up with it all and find myself thinking that the responsibility must be shouldered by us all together."
"We cannot keep on standing idly by while people die, and the only way we can prevent people dying is if our borders are secure and illegal immigrants are no longer exploited or abused by gangs of smugglers."
"It is for that reason that I hope we can all reach our objective together."
"Good night."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"(The sitting was closed at 9 p.m.)"
"The strange thing about the Swiebel report is that it contains a detailed account of the reasons why the Resolution that it is proposing should be rejected."
"The rapporteur invokes the 'decision taken last year by Parliament's Committee on Citizens' Freedoms, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) to use the Charter as a guideline for the annual report on the human rights situation in the EU', and adds that 'Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (?) has given [this work] greater focus and direction'."
"Now, if this is the case, we should stick to this particular guideline very closely, not going too far, exceeding the rights set out in the Charter; not allowing ourselves to be side-tracked into an endless course of nit-picking, taking the report away from its aim and from what it should confine itself to and seeking to make the resolution on which we are voting an instrument for abuse - something truly insane - for passing endless judgments on the Member States."
"The European Parliament does not, in fact, have the power to do this, except in very specific situations; situations so serious that they could be seen as potentially having the punitive effects of Article 7 of the EU Treaty apply to them."
"Furthermore, we all know that it is the Charter itself that sets out its own scope: 'The provisions of this Charter are addressed to the institutions and bodies of the Union with due regard for the principle of subsidiarity and to the Member States only when they are implementing Union law (Article 51)."
"Consequently, both the report and the resolution should directly consider the institutions and bodies of the Union; and, with the exception of the specific comment relating to Articles 6 and 7 of the EU Treaty, should consider the Member States only indirectly, when they are implementing Union law and only in these circumstances."
"We were therefore all quite astonished, when the rapporteur finally said that exactly the opposite was true: that, on the one hand, the 'report deliberately addresses only the human rights situation in the EU's current Member States'- which is exactly what it should not be doing, and on the other, that the report 'does not include any detailed list or assessment of the actions of the Council, the Commission or Parliament' - which is what it should be doing."
"If we add to this flagrant methodological deviation the regrettable inconstancy with which many of the comments about these Member States are made without sufficient objective and appropriate grounds (as the rapporteur herself admits), we have a set of basic reasons why in accordance with its own premises, the Swiebel report must be rejected."
"In its place, the alternative resolution that I tabled should be adopted, setting things back on a proper footing and enabling this Parliament to fulfil the recommendations that we ourselves defined."
"I would like to congratulate Mrs Swiebel on the fruitful work she has done this year (particularly in recognising the rights of third-country nationals and in introducing the rejection of double punishment), but I regret the fact that the time limit for the drawing up of the report has been exceeded to such a great extent, hindering my work and that of my future colleagues."
"As successor to Mrs Swiebel for 2002, I wish to work within the spirit of this Charter, to work in a spirit of continuity and to make the Charter as fully visible as possible."
"To this end, two public hearings are scheduled, with the innovation that young people will be involved, by means of delegations of secondary school children, as will the media, with the participation of representatives from prominent sections of the media."
"It is our duty to ensure participation by young people, to increase their awareness and provide them with information, and also to involve and mobilise opinion formers, since they are our best vehicle for coming closer to the citizens and for allowing Europe to become more closely involved in the daily lives of Europeans."
"Specifically, in relation to its examination of the human rights situation, my report, like previous ones, will be based on the structure of the Charter and will highlight certain points which I will treat as my political priorities."
"In general, I wish my report to be a progressive one."
"(Statement abbreviated in accordance with Rule 120(7) of the Rules of Procedure)"
"Community railways"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following four reports, drawn up on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism:"
"A5-0417/2002 by Mr Jarzembowski on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 91/440/EEC on the development of the Community's railways (COM(2002) 25 - C5-0038/2002 - 2002/25(COD));"
"A5-0424/2002 by Mr Sterckx on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on safety on the Community's railways and amending Council Directive 95/18/EC on the licensing of railway undertakings and Directive 2001/14/EC on the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity and the levying of charges for the use of railway infrastructure and safety certification (COM(2002) 21 - C5-0039/2002 - 2002/0022(COD));"
"A5-0418/2002 by Mrs Ainardi on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 96/48/EC and Directive 2001/16/EC on the interoperability of the trans-European rail system (COM(2002) 2- C5-0045/2002 - 2002/0023(COD)) and"
"A5-0441/2002 by Mr Savary on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on establishing a European Railway Agency (COM(2002) 23 - C5-0046/2002 - 2002/0024(COD))."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to warmly thank the four rapporteurs for the excellent work they have done, which means that the plenum is being presented with some generally positive reports, which move in the same direction as the Commission's proposal and support the Commission's approach."
"I would like to thank Parliament, which, furthermore, has dealt with these reports as a global package, resisting the temptation to divide it up, which would undoubtedly have hindered our common objective of finally creating a genuine European rail area."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this is the second stage of a prolonged process."
"Following the entry into force on 15 March 2001 of the three directives of the infrastructures package, which will have to be incorporated into the Member States' legislations from 15 March 2003, we must now complete the legislative framework in order to speed up the creation of a genuine European rail area."
"The four proposals we are going to debate today fall within the framework of this process."
"I will firstly comment on the proposed amendment to Directive 91/440/EEC, extending access rights to infrastructure and freight services within the Member States, and to speed up the opening up of the market."
"The rapporteur is Mr Jarzembowski, who has done a wonderful job."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the White Paper on European transport policy provides an alarming description of the development of rail freight transport."
"Over the last twenty years, the quota corresponding to this sector - within the overall distribution of goods transport in the Union - has been reduced by half, from 15% in 1980 to 8% in 1999."
"Over this period, the quality of services provided to clients has not improved and in certain Member States it has worsened."
"This is therefore an extremely pressing issue. I do not believe we can wait until 2008 to open up international goods transport to competition throughout the European network."
"We must also deal with domestic transport."
"That is why certain modifications are proposed to replace the timetable and methods for opening up laid down in Directive 2001/12/EC, without waiting any longer for the opening up of freight transport, both national and international, to the whole of the network."
"In practice, this total opening up of access rights in the field of freight would be effective by 2006, which would mean bringing forward this opening up to the whole network by two years."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the second proposed directive relates, of course, to rail safety."
"I believe that the issue of safety in transport is something which occupies and preoccupies all of us, especially at the moment."
"I would also like to thank Mr Sterckx for his work."
"We must guarantee that the integration of the European rail network does not mean a reduction in the maximum levels of the safety standards in the various Member States of the Union."
"But at the same time we must guarantee that the establishment of common rules prevents any possibility that, as a result of safety issues, the market may be harmed or there may be any discrimination in access to the networks."
"The creation of an internal market in rail services would not be possible without the establishment of common safety rules."
"Furthermore, the opening up of the markets and the end of the monopolies considerably modify such an important factor as the system of responsibilities in the field of safety, and it is therefore necessary to establish a coherent, transparent and clear framework which prevents any doubt in this area."
"The safety directive focuses on four areas: the designation of national safety authorities, separate from the operators, with clearly defined responsibilities; the determination of the essential elements of safety systems in relation to the operator of infrastructures and rail companies and the establishment of a mechanism for determining and adopting common safety objectives and methods - a role to be played by the rail Agency; the establishment of a common system for the issuing, content and validity of safety certificates; finally, the introduction, as in other sectors, of the principle of independent technical investigations in the event of accidents."
"We now come to the third proposed directive."
"If we establish the network, if we guarantee a common level of safety, with clearly defined responsibilities, it is also necessary to establish an interoperable system."
"Hence the amendment of Directives 96/48/EC and 2001/16/EC on interoperability, whose rapporteur is Mrs Ainardi."
"As well as the modifications which experience suggests we should make, it is essentially a question of guaranteeing coherence in the scope of the network in which opening up of access is carried out and the network in which the interoperability standards must be applied."
"It is also a question of sending a very clear message about the need to standardise equipment, with a view to reducing costs."
"We cannot just remove administrative borders, but we must also remove technological borders in order to create this European rail network."
"I would like to express my gratitude for the work done on an enormously technical and arduous subject, but on which the work of Parliament and the rapporteur have once again been of the highest quality."
"I will finally comment on the fourth proposal, to create a European Railways Agency, on which Mr Savary has done some very considerable work."
"The Agency is the cornerstone, it will complete the circle and will be the instrument which will allow us to make progress in the field of the interoperability of rail safety and therefore to guarantee the integration of the European rail network."
"This Agency will provide technical support for decision making, without autonomous competences, and will provide the Commission with opinions and recommendations."
"The texts in question will be adopted by the Commission in accordance with a comitology procedure, as is currently the case in relation to interoperability."
"Its main fields of activity will be as follows: the technical drawing up of texts planned for the directive on safety - common safety objectives and common safety methods - and for the directives on interoperability; the creation of a network of national safety and interoperability authorities; technical advice to the Commission and the national authorities on specific cases in the field of safety rules."
"This Agency, which will be made up of some 100 people, will be responsible for promoting the work of the technical approximation of rail systems and will be independent, although it will work in close cooperation with experts in the sector."
"Mr President, to conclude, the texts proposed intend, on the one hand, to ensure that 15 incompatible national systems develop technically towards an integrated and competitive European rail area and, on the other, to speed up the opening up of the market in freight transport, so that operators can provide effective services in any part of the Union."
"Let us finally opt for a modern railway, worthy of the twenty-first century, which is able to compete effectively with other modes of transport."
"Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that this is a good day, even if there are not so many people listening at the moment - and I hope that the press will report on this important debate - because we are finally on the way towards also establishing an internal market in the rail sector."
"This is an absolutely crucial point, because this is the only internal market that is actually still lacking in the transport sector."
"That is why, Commissioner, our four reports express our full agreement, in principle, with the Commission's basic ideas."
"However, being a self-assured Parliament and co-legislator, we have also tabled some substantial amendments to the four Commission proposals."
"I hope that the Commissioner will support all of them."
"Why have we tabled amendments?"
"By tabling these amendments we are seeking to hasten the revitalisation of the rail sector in the European Union."
"We must create the necessary framework conditions sooner, because if we do not manage to revitalise the railways, we will not meet our European transport policy objective - laid down in the White Paper - by 2010 either."
"By 2010 we want to bring the different modes of transport back into balance, which in practice means that we want to carry more freight by rail instead of by road and more passengers by rail instead of by air or road."
"To achieve this objective of putting a larger proportion of the overall volume of traffic back onto the railways, we need to create appropriate framework conditions."
"These must be such that the rail networks really are opened up throughout the Union to existing and new railway undertakings, that is that network access is liberalised."
"In addition, by adopting European standards we must also physically cross internal borders, meaning that trains must be able to cross borders without stopping or slowing down, so that we can also make the advantages offered by the internal market a reality from the technical point of view."
"And we need a high level of safety."
"Since in the future we will not only have the national railway companies in the Member States but also increasing numbers of private railway undertakings, operating across the Union, it is no longer sufficient for the national authorities to be responsible for safety standards. Instead we need common, high European standards of safety for the benefit of passengers and railway staff."
"Finally, we need a European railway agency to energetically push forward all of these measures and monitor them."
"We have made progress on interoperability, but too slowly."
"At a conference, technical experts informed us that it would take 30 years to achieve interoperability, that is for trains to be able to use different networks without stopping."
"Ladies and gentlemen, if we wait that long there will not be any railways left in Europe that are operated on a commercial basis."
"However, we want the railways, and so all of us here need to energetically drive these measures forward, and that is why we need a European railway agency."
"In an internal market for railways designed in this way, it will be crucial for modern, forward-looking railway undertakings to attract more freight and more passengers onto rail by providing services that customers want and that run on time."
"If we continue to have the kind of planning system that we have today, which means that a railway undertaking cannot guarantee when a train travelling from Germany to Italy is going to arrive - there are hour- and even day-long delays - then rail is not going to be able to compete with HGVs."
"But we want to create the framework conditions to ensure that trains can compete with HGVs."
"I should like to make four brief comments on my report."
"The first, Commissioner, is one on which I think we now agree."
"The Commission wanted to postpone the introduction of the special rail network for freight services in Europe, the so-called Trans-European Rail Freight Network, which the first railway package already states will come into being on 15 March 2003."
"We are against this and think that we need this special rail network on 15 March of this year so as to gain experience of cross-border freight transport."
"I hope that the Commission agrees."
"Secondly, we think that the aim set by the Commission of opening up the whole network to freight - both cross-border and national services - by 1 January 2006, as the Commissioner also indicated, should be clearly stated as from now, and not expressed as one-and-a-half years or two years after entry into force. We want everyone to know that on 1 January 2006 they can be prepared for the networks actually to be opened up to freight services."
"Thirdly, it is our view, Commissioner, that we also need to extend these rights to use rail for freight transport to other transport operators, not only the traditional railway undertakings or the new railway undertakings, but also the shippers and carriers."
"Because only if all the players in the sector are on board - and that includes the shippers and carriers - will we be able to transfer freight from road to rail."
"I therefore hope that you will also agree to the independent rights that we want to grant them."
"My final point, Commissioner, relates to something that you did not address just now, but I should in any case like to make this request."
"You said that the Commission did not want to table proposals to open up the networks to passenger services as well until 2003."
"We in Parliament are one step ahead of you and have said: no, we do not want there to be so much domestic air traffic in Europe and would prefer passengers to take cross-border passenger train services."
"We are proposing making it possible for cross-border passenger services to operate from 1 January 2006, like freight services, and national passenger services at a later date, from 1 January 2008."
"Commissioner, it is precisely if we want to ensure that airspace is used sensibly that we need to attract more passengers onto the railways."
"I hope that you will support us in this."
"Two final comments on the Sterckx report: I think that this report on safety standards is so magnificent that all I can say is that its main points go to the heart of the matter, in that it makes the provisions more precise and advocates a high level of safety in the interests of passengers and staff."
"That is why we will be fully supporting this report."
"Finally, Commissioner, I hope that you agree with us that we should encourage the Greek Presidency actually to adopt the common positions in March so that we can move the procedure forward and perhaps conclude this chapter, on opening up the railways in the European Community, by the end of the year."
"Even if one or two Member States should have problems, the Community Treaty allows a decision to be taken by a majority in the Council of Ministers, and we should encourage the Greeks to take advantage of this possibility."
"- (NL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that most of us in Parliament agree that we need a European approach and that national monopolies have no future."
"It is, however, clear that in a European market such as this, where more players are entering the arena, there must be proper safety arrangements."
"The safety situation is satisfactory at the moment."
"Rail is a safe means of transport, it must remain at least as good and we must try to improve safety levels wherever possible."
"The directive we are now producing is an initial step towards European safety policy."
"At the moment there are still too many different rules and regulations which make this railway market in Europe too complex in many cases."
"We must therefore develop a standard procedure for the different Member States in this directive."
"Firstly, a structure."
"Who is responsible for what?"
"The railway companies are naturally responsible for what they do, and as a Parliament we are adding the infrastructure managers to this."
"Every Member State should therefore have a safety body which operates independently and openly and is transparent."
"Everyone must know how things stand."
"With regard to the operational side of things, however, I think that the safety bodies must be able to make use of the existing railway companies' know-how, knowledge and experience."
"Secondly, we must have a common approach to safety, a common safety goal."
"As a Parliament, we think that, once established, this goal must be put before the Council and Parliament again and must not only be assessed by a committee of national experts."
"We must not only have a common goal but also a common working method, and I am somewhat stricter than you are when it comes to discouraging new national rules."
"We will have to be as strict as possible in this regard, and the Commission must have the last word."
"We must also - and I am somewhat more ambitious than the Commission in this regard too - establish a European objective, and we must state that our objective is to achieve one single set of European regulations."
"We do not necessarily have to achieve this tomorrow, but we must at least be able to say what we are aiming for."
"All players must have a management system, and there must be common safety certificates for staff, for rolling stock and also for the infrastructure manager."
"As far as staff are concerned, I think that a European driving licence for train drivers is important."
"We must work on this."
"Communication is also important; that is something I have added to my report."
"If you cross language boundaries you must also make sure that you solve language problems."
"The agency must have its say about how this is to be done."
"It is an important point, however."
"Thirdly, we must develop a common method of investigating accidents, investigating incidents, an independent investigative body and criteria that must be respected in these investigations."
"I think that we have achieved a balance between making our approach as European as possible with supervisors who are as independent as possible, and achieving a theoretical model that is also workable in practice."
"So you must not simply dismiss the knowledge that the old monopolies have at their disposal; you must use it to create a workable system."
"I am convinced that where we are now is an initial phase, that this is an initial step."
"We will have to discuss safety a few times more and amend and adapt directives over the next 10, 15 and 20 years."
"The structure we are now setting up will also have to prove its soundness in practice, and we must ensure that we are flexible enough to acknowledge our mistakes and to do something about them if necessary."
"I also think that we have achieved a good balance when it comes to the involvement of the staff concerned."
"It is important for the people who work on the railways to be involved in the things that concern them."
"Safety is also the work of man, and the people who are responsible for this work must be involved in the decision making."
"I think that this is in fact clearly stated in the directive."
"With Mrs Ainardi's report on the technical obstacles and Mr Savary's report on the Railways Agency, which will be very important in the future as it will have to do a great deal of the work, we are thus taking a significant step towards a European railway environment."
"Mr Jarzembowski's report is also a significant step forward."
"What we need are open, dynamic, commercially-oriented railway companies that think European, not just nationally or locally."
"The culture of the national monopoly is still very much in evidence and too often prevents Europe's railways from operating efficiently."
"As Mr Jarzembowski and the Commissioner have also said, we need a dynamic rail industry."
"When you see how the transport economy has developed, you cannot do without railway companies."
"I get terror-stricken whenever I hear people from railway companies saying that if we do not adapt quickly we will have no more goods traffic on the railways, and we will be priced out of the market - not by the prices themselves but by bad working practices."
"Rail is a sustainable means of transport and we must look after it."
"With our reports and your proposals, Commissioner, I think that we are taking a significant step forward, for we need to progress towards a European transport market."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, given that the European Union has published a White Paper explaining the need to revitalise rail transport, it is essential to ensure interoperability within the European rail system if it is to be developed. This is crucial to the future of European railways in the twenty-first century."
"Rail is a more sustainable means of transport, entailing fewer external costs than road transport."
"It is also more environmentally friendly and safer. Despite all this, rail freight has declined over the last twenty years."
"It is my view that there are three main reasons for this decline."
"Firstly, we have industrial strategies favouring road transport and 'just-in-time' management, resulting in a greater number of journeys and greater dispersal and fragmentation."
"Furthermore, there is distortion of competition between road and rail transport. The level of social regulation relating to road transport is notably low when compared to that for rail."
"I am thinking, in particular, of the fact that the regulation outlined in the Markov report to be discussed this morning does not address the question of a limit on driving time adequately."
"Despite the fact that Mr Markov and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs proposed reducing driving time to 45 hours, the limit remains at 56 hours, which is clearly still far too long."
"Lastly, I share the view that the development of different networks according to national specifications has limited trade and has lead to inadequate cooperation and incompatible standards."
"My report on the high-speed network and the conventional network respectively, therefore seeks to make standards more compatible by bringing the two existing directives into line with each other. The report also includes a series of proposals to speed up harmonisation and to extend its scope."
"I would like to point out that my report is closely linked to the report on establishing a European Railway Agency."
"Consequently, a number of decisions on points concerning the Agency are included in my report as they stand in order to ensure that the package is coherent."
"While preparing my report, I met with operators, experts, the Commission, trade unions and public authorities on many occasions. As a result of the meetings, I identified a number of issues to which I would like to draw your attention."
"Firstly, in order to achieve interoperability, I think it is absolutely essential to take full account of the skills and know-how of the professionals working within the sector."
"The European Union must ensure the involvement of the sector if it is to harmonise the rail system."
"For example, during one of the meetings I had with railway staff, they proposed a recording device."
"I took this on board, as I believed it to be relevant."
"The introduction of a recording device now has universal support and is included in my report."
"Secondly, further to all these meetings, it has become clear to me that harmonisation and safety rules are inextricably linked."
"Harmonisation in this area cannot be carried out at a minimum level."
"Safety standards vary across the European Union."
"Lowering safety standards to facilitate access to infrastructure would be counter-productive and even dangerous."
"Reducing safety would not be in the interests of harmonisation."
"One question remains unresolved, namely funding."
"Enormous investment is needed to achieve this new stage of development."
"No specific budgetary provision is envisaged, though this is certainly called for."
"I am delighted that agreement has been reached on Article 29 of the Sterckx report, which promotes social dialogue."
"I also consider the agreement reached on the Savary report to be very important. This concerns the participation of staff representatives in drawing up technical specifications on interoperability (TSIs) which are of direct concern to them."
"To ensure consistency between the various reports and the unity of the package, I would like to propose three oral amendments which take account of the agreements reached on the Sterckx and Savary reports."
"I would also like to propose an amendment on the financial questions. Whilst I am aware that not everyone will share my point of view, I hope you will all understand the importance of the issue."
"The package as a whole is extremely important, given what is at stake."
"We bear an enormous responsibility for the future, as we are planning the European rail system for the twenty-first century."
"I would in addition like to express my opinion on the package as a whole."
"The Jarzembowski report proposes the complete liberalisation of rail freight services by 2003, and of national passenger services by 2008."
"I must say that I am concerned about the proposals aimed at speeding up liberalisation, following up those proposed by the Commission."
"The transposition of the first package is only just taking place in Member States, and an assessment of the consequences has therefore yet to be undertaken."
"I am still concerned at the conclusions of the Barcelona Council, which sensibly called for a report to be drawn up and an assessment to be made before any new proposal is presented."
"I agree that we need to revitalise the rail system."
"It is my view that the harmonisation of standards is a very relevant issue, as is the need for an Agency and strict safety rules."
"I do not however see why and how it should be deemed necessary to undertake the development of the rail network and opening it up to competition at the same time."
"The Sterckx report on safety is also very important since, like the Commission, it is concerned in particular about the harmonisation of safety standards."
"The harmonisation of safety standards should, however, take account of the real situation of the sector, especially as regards implementation time."
"It would be useless, or even detrimental, to attempt to apply European standards too quickly."
"In conclusion, I would like to reiterate my conviction that both the long-term development and the revitalisation of the sector are at stake. The players in this sector count, be they operators or railway staff."
"Their skills and knowledge are valuable. The European Union can and must show that it intends to involve them in the development of the rail system."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for a long time transport policy was a poor relation in European policy."
"In plain language, for a long time nothing happened at all."
"It required a judgment by default from the European Court of Justice for things slowly to start inching forward, step by step."
"Admittedly, we have seen some movement on air and maritime transport in recent years - this is pleasing, and we are grateful for this, not least to the Commissioner - but the tragic events off the Spanish coast have shown that we are still a long way from where we actually should be."
"It is above all in the sector that is being discussed here and now that we are still a long way from where we should be, namely in the rail sector."
"Much ought to have been done here in the last few years and it still has not been done, including establishing genuine coordination between the Member States."
"Mr Jarzembowski has already pointed out that the rail sector is the only one in which the internal market is not a reality."
"I would perhaps express this in even stronger terms: where rail is concerned we have probably not even started to make it a reality."
"That is why the necessary balance between the individual modes of transport is still lacking."
"This has also been mentioned once already today."
"It cannot be stressed often enough."
"The results are as bad as you would expect, particularly between road and rail where the gulf is tending to widen in the absence of sensible joint solutions."
"The European rail system and its connection to the system in the candidate countries, which will soon be members of this Union, needs to be revitalised and made to work; otherwise a lot more will go wrong on our railways and we will have even more problems than we do now."
"As an Austrian I am not only referring to transit across the Brenner Pass and the Alps; essentially this applies to all regions of Europe, all of which are sensitive to a greater or lesser degree, not only those that have been under intensive discussion over the last few days."
"In this context, I should like, en passant, to apprise you of one fact, which is not without interest, because unfortunately it is never adequately taken into consideration in the discussion: the Austrian railways are the only ones to have increased their share of the freight market in the last few years."
"All of our other neighbouring countries have continued to let road strengthen its lead over rail."
"Now what is at issue specifically in the Ainardi report, for which I was also responsible as shadow rapporteur?"
"Interoperability should and must be made a reality across the entire network."
"We cannot concentrate, as we did originally, on individual parts of the network - high-speed lines and so forth - and treat them separately."
"We have to try actually to find one single structure, obviously with the necessary exemptions for regional railways - if they really are regional railways - for heritage railways and others."
"When it comes to drafting and adopting these technical specifications we must firstly bear in mind that this is not the job of the European legislator, but that specialists must set to work on these, and European politicians are only called on to monitor progress."
"What is important here are reasonable costs and a high degree of safety."
"Both aspects have been addressed often enough here today."
"I do not need to emphasise this particularly, but I do think that we should take them seriously."
"Where safety is concerned, I would specifically point out that we have now tabled a proposal to extend the black box system to the railways."
"This means that we also want to make progress on research, so as to ensure that in the long term we arrive where we need to arrive, at a functioning European transport system."
"Mr President, firstly I would like to thank all the rapporteurs for their work in this very important area."
"This is a difficult and complex subject not made any easier by the position that the whole railway industry finds itself in."
"If you look at rail freight in Europe, for example, the drop in traffic is quite alarming."
"If nothing is done, then within the next 15 years rail freight will not exist."
"There has to be change in how railways work, both in the passenger and freight sectors."
"The industry itself has to recognise that its service levels have been unacceptable and Member States must also recognise that investment levels have been in decline for many years."
"This is nowhere more apparent than in the field of interoperability: 15 different systems, different signalling systems, different power currents and an obsession at national level with working their own system to the detriment of international cooperation and to the detriment of interoperability."
"It is the inability of a train to cross borders without changing locomotives, changing drivers or even changing bogeys that is the problem for our railways."
"A 40-tonne heavy goods lorry is fully interoperable."
"A freight train is not."
"That is the difficulty that faces the industry. It is not an easy problem to overcome."
"We need to give the railways time to improve their interoperability, but we must also remind them that time is running out and frankly with regard to freight the industry is now drinking in the last chance saloon."
"I, on behalf of my group, have followed the report by Mr Sterckx with regard to safety more closely than the others."
"It is our belief that in any work in the area of safety those who work in the sector must be involved."
"In this regard a difference exists between us and the PPE-DE Group."
"Our main goals are to ensure higher levels of safety whilst fully integrating our European rail system."
"We must get away from the 15 different systems I mentioned earlier; however, we must ensure that Member States have an input, and in those areas where higher standards exist we must insist that they are maintained."
"Dilution of safety standards is not an option."
"That is why, as a group, we have submitted a number of amendments to Mr Sterckx's report."
"All of us here are supporters of railways."
"Indeed some of us are somewhat fanatical and are often called anoraks by our colleagues."
"I hope the Commission proposals and Parliament's response are seen by those in the railway industry as an honest attempt to ensure that Europe's railway industry has a future."
"In order to reach that goal we need politicians, we need governments, we need the Commission, but most of all we also need all sides in the railway industry working together."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my group I should firstly like to thank all the rapporteurs involved in the railway package."
"They have done some excellent work."
"Development of the railways, however, was far too late in getting started."
"Now such areas as the promotion of competition in both freight and passenger transport services, increased interoperability and improvements in safety are huge challenges which really do require swift action to be taken."
"The competitiveness of the railways has seriously decreased."
"There has been a shift to transportation along congested roads as well as by air, because the railways have not been able to improve their services quickly enough."
"This railway package will enable us to promote the competitiveness of the European railways, and improved competitiveness will mean that companies and the public will have the chance to utilise a more environment-friendly form of transport."
"At the same time congestion can be relieved and short flights replaced by railway transport services, which will result in a better balance between transport operators."
"Development of the railways will also clear the way for increased use of intermodal transport, as at the same time attention will be paid to improved interoperability of the ports and railways."
"As shadow rapporteur, I have followed Mr Savary's drafting of the report closely. Mr Savary has also done good work."
"A properly established Railway Agency would boost development of the railways and monitor and promote innovation and good practice."
"Our group believes, however, that the same principle should be followed regarding the composition of the Agency's administrative board as that which applies to the Maritime Safety Agency."
"We have tabled an amendment on this for which we hope there is support."
"These days, people and goods are travelling ever longer distances."
"Much too much of this travelling is taking place on the motorway or by air."
"Travelling by rail is more environmentally friendly, but most of our railway networks date back to an era when we stayed within our own state boundaries much more than we do now."
"Virtually everyone now agrees on the need for modernisation with trains that can travel on the other side of the border with the same carriages, the same crew, the same voltage and the same safety requirements."
"This can be achieved quickly by improving cooperation between national railway companies or by merging large-scale and cross-border activities into one single European operation."
"Regrettably this increase in scale is now being misused to force all the Member States of the European Union to allow other companies with private capital to access the railway network."
"Liberalisation means that we will only be able to travel where entrepreneurs can expect to make a profit."
"The additional costs for planning, supervision, safety and infrastructure are being paid by the government, in other words the taxpayer, and the financial benefits go to international companies."
"This compulsion to liberalise will make it more difficult to guarantee continuity and safety."
"Despite the European unity that has been achieved, there is currently less cross-border rail traffic in many places than there was in the time before the EU was created."
"International night trains are being cancelled, long-distance connections are being severed, railway timetables for 'abroad' are no longer being issued, boarding bans are being introduced and there will be no railway facilities for the rapid transportation of perishable goods."
"Even before the compromise of the end of 2000 concerning corridors for goods transportation by other companies comes into effect, attempts are already being made to push through even more far-reaching liberalisation with the aim of putting international goods traffic first, then domestic goods traffic, then international passenger traffic and finally all traffic in the hands of companies that have fewer obligations to society as a whole."
"In the Netherlands, which wanted to take the lead, liberalisation has resulted in a significant reduction in the quality of train services."
"Part of the package of four reports that have just been presented will have a detrimental effect on the railway company's duty of service."
"If we do not accept that part, the future will look a great deal better."
"Mr President, I would first like to thank all fellow MEPs and rapporteurs."
"The aim of all reforms must be to create a sustainable transport policy in Europe."
"Liberalisation can sometimes be a means to achieving this, but never an end in itself."
"The extremely poor situation in respect of maritime transport must indeed be a warning to us."
"Freight traffic in Europe has become a problem due to the enormous increase in the number of lorries on our roads."
"I myself regard early liberalisation of goods transport by rail as a sure fire way of quickly reducing the number of lorries on the road, provided that it is given sufficient support."
"Indeed, we do not view liberalisation as an end in itself, and we are therefore not in favour of liberalising passenger transport."
"Passenger transport by rail is a public service and must remain so."
"Transport must also remain affordable for everyone, so it should not only be the profitable lines that are allowed to be leased or sold."
"The negative consequences of liberalisation are already being felt by travellers."
"International lines outside of the high-speed network are being cut back."
"One example is the fast overnight connection between Brussels and Milan which, as my Italian colleagues know, has been scrapped as a result of competition from air travel, a mode of transport in which the environmental costs are not calculated into the ticket price."
"That there is a problem is, however, demonstrated by the poor rail connection between Brussels and Strasbourg I got a taste of yesterday."
"The European Commission has done too little research into the consequences of liberalisation for rail transport."
"We think that an assessment is urgently needed before we go any further down the road towards liberalisation."
"We cannot make decisions on accelerating the pace of liberalisation of rail transport until such time as we have a clear picture of the impact this liberalisation will have on working conditions, safety, the environment, the effective improvement of consumer choice and the growth of the sector."
"With this in mind, we have therefore submitted an amendment to Mr Jarzembowski's report."
"The three other reports closely reflect the problems and issues of the sector."
"Firstly that of safety in the Sterckx report."
"Then coming up with practical ways of cooperating effectively in the Ainardi report."
"Finally, a Railways Agency to support the entire harmonisation process and to get it on track in the Savary report."
"The era of containers being transported from the North Sea port to Northern Italy on trains crawling along at 18 km per hour must be consigned to history as soon as possible."
"The Sterckx, Savary and Ainardi reports place the emphasis on cooperation and consultation between different companies."
"These companies could naturally have done this themselves, but they seem to only spring into action when competition is imminent."
"Europe should naturally have organised this internal rail market much earlier."
"This Railways Agency should have been in place thirteen years ago."
"The free movement of goods was not organised in a sustainable way in the twentieth century."
"The twenty-first century must bring the changes we so urgently need."
"The establishment of the European Agency for the harmonisation of safety and for accelerating interoperability as part of the second railways package must contribute to the process of liberalising and modernising rail transport in Europe."
"This process was set in motion with the introduction of the first railways package, but it has not been completed by a long chalk, despite the fact that the Transport White Paper places so much emphasis on rail being practically the most important means of transport in the future."
"If rail really wants to play a role in solving the problem of congestion in Europe, however, it is of vital importance that we not only open up international and national goods markets but cross-border passenger traffic as well."
"We must revitalise and liberalise the entire sector if we really want rail traffic to take over part of the constantly growing demand for transport."
"The sector has suffered years of neglect in the hands of the various governments who controlled the railways - not the big international companies, Mr Meijer."
"Furthermore, the sector was and still is a bastion of national interests whose main aim is to promote its own interests and not to become involved in cross-border interests."
"If we view the railway sector in the context of the agreements in the Lisbon Declaration which call upon us to become the most competitive region in the world by 2010, we have to achieve this, otherwise our hearts will be in our boots."
"Everywhere there are different mains voltages, different railway gauges, big differences in signalling, different languages and safety requirements, locomotives that are not suitable for operating the other side of borders and that are twice as expensive because they have to overcome all these differences."
"Furthermore, the rail freight sector only discovered the concept of profit about a year ago."
"The only thing that was important was volume."
"Now billions will have to be invested throughout Europe in order to get the infrastructure and rolling stock up to standard."
"That can only really happen if there is a true sea change and the railway sector discovers the customer and the concepts of punctuality, flexibility and service orientation besides that of profit."
"Interoperability and the harmonisation of safety regulations have often been an uphill battle up until now."
"Every railway company is sticking to its own practices and systems."
"It will therefore be important for the Railways Agency to set a good example, play a pioneering role and at the same time act in a supervisory capacity."
"The Railways Agency's expertise and clear responsibilities are therefore very important."
"Another condition that must be met if the Agency is to operate efficiently is that it must remain independent and that it has independent experts chosen for their abilities and not as representatives of a particular organisation at its helm."
"If we are to avoid reverting to traditional national differences, these experts from the industry must therefore not express the viewpoint of their previous employers."
"It is therefore essential for the Agency to be able to operate completely independently and transparently."
"The new predominance of historically big companies will result in few newcomers having access to the Agency."
"The Railways Agency must also have enough powers to be able to execute its tasks properly."
"I have submitted an amendment in this regard stating that the Agency should establish the preconditions for the uniform issue of safety certificates independently of the national railway companies within which the national safety bodies have to operate."
"Naturally, train drivers must receive on-the-spot training to enable them to drive on routes in neighbouring countries, but competences with regard to safety certificates must be clear and unambiguous to all concerned."
"In general, harmonisation of the safety regulations in Europe is very important for an efficient railway sector."
"Bureaucratic obstacles must be eliminated as far as possible."
"I am also pleased with the compromise on Article 3 that we were able to reach with the Group of the Party of European Socialists, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party and the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, concerning the participation of employers' representatives from the sector in the working parties."
"On this point I am still of the opinion that it is not desirable to permit worker involvement in purely technical matters."
"When there are direct consequences for workers' working conditions, health or safety, however, their voices will naturally be heard and indeed listened to, as the compromise specifies."
"In conclusion, therefore, I hope that the Railways Agency will make a positive contribution to the harmonisation of safety and the process of interoperability in Europe, so that it can make an important contribution towards improving rail transport in Europe."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to congratulate the rapporteurs, who have done a magnificent job."
"Although there are some differences of opinion on the detail, we are in very substantial agreement with the reports and will - at least I assume we will - be adopting them today, because, as Mrs Peijs has just said, it has been possible to reach some important compromises."
"This package, building on earlier decisions, will actually take us an important step closer to establishing a European railway."
"The restrictions imposed by the nation-states, and the fears that they still have, will - I hope - soon be consigned to the past."
"I dealt personally with Mr Jarzembowski's and Mrs Ainardi's reports."
"Mr Jarzembowski's report - and once again Mr Jarzembowski has disappeared off somewhere; he is a real European high-speed train and is never where he actually should be, but be that as it may - proposes extensive liberalisation."
"Obviously for us Social Democrats - let me be quite open about it - this is a tricky business."
"Today, for various reasons, a large majority of us will go along with these proposals: firstly, because they are part of an overall agreement, as part of which we have also, particularly in the Savary report, obtained a series of provisions guaranteeing workers' rights and opportunities."
"I have no fears in this regard, Mrs Peijs, but we certainly must focus on the working conditions and health and safety in the sector for the sake of those employed there."
"Secondly, there are unfortunately a number of countries that are still very restrictive where market opening is concerned."
"I therefore assume that a more constructive and reasonable compromise proposal will emerge from the conciliation procedure."
"Thirdly, it is my view that we need to put pressure on the national railway undertakings, be they public or private."
"Many of these railway undertakings have not read the signs of the times; they have entered into cooperation with each other only to a very limited extent and only in some areas, for example high-speed trains. The railway companies have either not recognised that nowadays transport services at least have to be European - which has of course long been the case for HGVs - or they have not done anything about it."
"A certain amount of pressure to liberalise and move towards market opening is therefore certainly very important for the national railway companies."
"Turning now to Mrs Ainardi's report, this is also a very good piece of work."
"We regret the fact that, particularly in this report, too little account has been taken of some aspects of social harmonisation, because there are understandably fears on the part of workers that this will lead to a kind of social dumping."
"I believe that it is particularly important for the workers to be included in the process of reforming the railways."
"The civil servants and others employed in the railway sector also need to know that the times of national, restricted, controlled railway undertakings are over, and that this is about creating a European railway."
"Once again, I believe that the essential point here is that, hopefully, today's decision will send out a signal to the railway undertakings, so that they will make it their own business to create a real European railway."
"Mr President, Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteurs, in particular on their close cooperation, because the interrelated nature of the package requires the reports to be relatively interdependent."
"I would also like to mention that the committee of which I am chairman has worked well on this matter, as always."
"It is no coincidence that, during 2002, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism initiated 34 reports in the transport sector, seven of which focused precisely on the modernisation of the railways."
"It is quite clear, however, that the committee is concerned by certain delays in the Council and has made this clear in more or less formal terms."
"I, personally, have even written a letter to the Danish Presidency, and I will reiterate these same points to the Greek Transport Minister, Mr Verelis, who is coming to visit the committee and attend a hearing next week."
"The first railway package is closely related to the second railway package and, just like the carriages of a train, they must move forward, or else there will be a real danger of a kind of rail traffic jam."
"The second railway package is important, and I would like to say that our approach is not an ideological promotion of the railways, of which we are sometimes accused."
"I believe that the case of freight transport is extremely significant: the use of the railways is continuing to decline, despite all the good intentions expressed."
"When I consider specific cases which are particularly important to me such as the trans-Alpine routes, I find this totally unacceptable."
"I regret to say that there is no genuine European rail network. We are building it with these directives."
"It is strange that, with all their areas of sovereignty taken away from them, the only one remaining for the States in Europe is a kind of railway sovereignty, which we have got to break up and reshape in a European mould."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to thank the rapporteurs."
"Heavy words indeed: the railway industry drinking in the last chance saloon and ceasing to exist after a certain time."
"Mr Jarzembowski was also talking about a balanced relationship."
"We endorse that."
"We also think that it is absolutely necessary to revitalise the railways, for environmental and other reasons."
"Interoperability must be changed, safety must be improved, we must set up a Railways Agency, and so on."
"Let us go back briefly to the core of the matter, however."
"We actually disagree strongly with regard to the package that Mr Jarzembowski is talking about."
"We have already had some experience with liberalisation in Europe - in the UK and in the Netherlands as well."
"I would like to talk about the Dutch example briefly."
"An article in this morning's newspaper. Mr Zalm, the Liberal front runner in the elections and a former Dutch minister, is now saying that it was a mistake to split up NS and ProRail."
"In other words, Railway Directive 91/440/EC, the original separation of infrastructure and operation, is seen as being wrong."
"The Dutch Minister of Transport, Mr de Boer, also came to this conclusion recently and is asking for an inquiry for this very reason."
"Back to square one."
"In other words, we think that liberalisation is an excellent opportunity for goods transport."
"We think, however, that we will have to take a good look at what this liberalisation of passenger transport is going to deliver, because it is not going well."
"For this reason we are asking most emphatically for an evaluation proposal and we hope that you will support the amendment."
"How it is possible that the socialists in the UK, who after all have had the same miserable experiences with liberalisation and the other aspects of privatisation of the railways, can still be in favour of Mr Jarzembowski's proposals is completely beyond my comprehension."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a Liberal, I am very satisfied with the railways package and our four rapporteurs' reports."
"Particularly with the fact that Mr Jarzembowski has included passenger transport in his report and has outlined a plan for it."
"The further liberalisation of Europe's oldest mechanised infrastructure, the railways, is an essential stimulus for a sector that is quickly losing ground in the European goods traffic market."
"I cannot emphasis often enough that liberalisation is somewhat different from independence or uncontrolled privatisation, as was tried in the UK."
"It is of vital importance - including for the sector itself - that we have more providers on the European railways."
"Only then can we achieve a healthy railway market through genuine competition."
"Why not let the NS-cargo/DB-cargo combination compete directly with SNCF."
"There is nothing wrong with that."
"It must all be safe, so we, the legislators, must assume our responsibility for this."
"Mrs Ainardi's report is based on interoperability, acknowledging each other, the international recognition of regulations, the recognition of signals and the recognition of safety standards."
"That is also why it is so important to pay attention to this."
"That is why the European Railways Agency, proposed the Savary report, is so important."
"From an organisational point of view, I would like the European Railways Agency to be coordinated with the European Maritime Safety Agency so that all these matters are organised independently, transparently, unambiguously and logically for all parties concerned."
"Foresight is the essence of government."
"In order to achieve efficiency, perhaps we can combine everything in the European safety agencies for the various modes of transport at some stage in the distant future and in this way integrate the sector fully with other modes."
"After all, this is all about railway transport being integrated with society, integrated with roads and integrated with water in order to get products and goods from A to B more easily."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we are today dealing at first reading with both the development strategy and the interoperability of the trans-European rail system, including its safety, and the creation of a European agency responsible for its monitoring and which I believe should also be responsible for its control."
"In my opinion, and since I am in favour of the liberalisation of rail transport, I am not sure that it is right to liberalise the infrastructures, that is, the railway lines."
"I believe it would be better, as is the case with motorways, to only liberalise the operation of the railways, leaving the rail infrastructures under public ownership."
"I believe this would be the best formula for sustainable responsibility for the appropriate maintenance of them beyond the restrictions which would be imposed by the objectives of economic and financial viability inherent in any private initiative."
"And, in any event, I believe there must be an early assessment of the effects of liberalisation both in terms of safety, social and environmental repercussions, the effect on the interests of clients and users and on public service as well as the development of intermodality, and also its effect on the companies involved within the transport market."
"I would ask the Commission to inform us regularly and periodically on all these issues."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at times in this debate you get the impression that we have been building a European Union for only a short time and are addressing issues that actually ought to have been dealt with long ago."
"It is inherent in the very concept of the internal market that freight and passenger transport should have an appeal that gains them acceptance."
"The national railway companies' actions in recent years have predominantly been characterised by the fact that they have continued to try to cordon off their markets, while at the same time coming to terms with the consistent and dramatic decline in their figures in the freight transport sector."
"The only way of putting freight transport back on track at all is to ensure, firstly, that cross-border journeys can operate more smoothly in the future and, secondly, that the market is opened up and competition introduced, so that those who wish to offer attractive freight transport services have the opportunity to do so, and - so far at least -it has usually not been the national rail companies that have done this."
"When I hear people argue that liberalisation would mean job cuts then I only have one thing to say in reply: if the current trend continues there will not be any jobs in the rail freight sector at all, a result of the railways' conscious decision to neglect freight transport because it is not worth their while."
"I can only say that those who are well intentioned towards the railways have to ensure that the rail systems are compatible across Europe, that the highest safety requirements are put in place and, in addition, they must ensure that the railways are customer-friendly, which means that they should be reliable, that they should have attractive services on offer and that they should stick to their timetables."
"I can only hope that we and the Commissioner can push this through together in the Council."
"Measures in other areas - the Single European Sky to name but one example, when we wanted to have Europe designate airspace blocks in the future, because the national Member States had been failing to do so for decades - were repeatedly blocked by the Council, because they thought that all of this could be resolved bilaterally."
"I can only say that the Member States should have done it long ago, and now we are going to do it instead!"
"Mr President, all these reports on Community railways are part and parcel of the recent tidal wave of privatisation aimed at ensuring that not one public sector escapes the clutches of private capital, at the expense of quality, public safety and the cost of the services provided."
"Accounting tricks and baseless arguments are being used to persuade us that, as with road transport, which contributes nothing to the infrastructure costs of the road network but is open to the private sector, we should allow the private sector to run down railway infrastructures and services which they have done nothing to create and which were and still are paid for by the taxpayer, in the name of free competition."
"In the middle of a serious recession in the economy, in energy, in road, air and sea transport and in the environmental sector, big business has seen the potential in the railways for saving energy and cutting costs - and hence making a profit - and has turned its attention to rail transport and is trying to penetrate it ''as an equal partner'', although in practice there is nothing ''equal' about it in relation to the nationalised railway companies."
"In other words, the Commission proposals - and unfortunately these reports go along with them - care nothing for quality, the cost of transport or the safety of users, all of which have been blown out of the water by the philosophy of unbridled competition and the profitability of capital, leaving the way free for private investors to ransack the profitable rail transport sector and dump responsibility for exorbitant infrastructure building and maintenance costs and the unprofitable side of rail transport on the public sector."
"As you will have gathered, we totally oppose proposals for any moderate, calculated liberalisation of the railways because it paves the way for full liberalisation with all the adverse consequences that will have on the travelling public."
"Mr President, I had actually intended to say something completely different, but in the light of the last two speakers' comments I will digress somewhat and take up another point."
"We have heard things said that actually belong in the past - in a past that is, thankfully, long gone - a time when all that mattered was intervention and the class struggle, when people tried to create confrontation."
"I believe that this was completely the wrong attitude."
"History has condemned this approach and life punishes latecomers, as an extremely famous man once said, a man who had his roots in this system and then in the end also brought about its downfall because he knew it so well, I mean President Gorbachev."
"We want better environmental protection, more goods to be transferred from road to rail, a better modal balance and thus better protection for consumers."
"Better protection for consumers: let me give you an example of something that happened two days ago in my home region, in the cross-border Brenner Pass, where consignments of dangerous goods, which now have to be carried by road because there are no rail services that can handle them, caught fire, with very serious consequences for the environment and for the public."
"We escaped an environmental disaster by the skin of our teeth."
"This is our intention: we want to make transport safer, and here I am particularly grateful to my colleague, Mr Jarzembowski, who has been fighting for these initiatives to be taken for years."
"We hope that these reports - and his in particular - will mean that we can take a substantial step in the right direction."
"I am also grateful to the Vice-President of the Commission, Mrs de Palacio, who has a particularly good understanding of this issue and is endeavouring to achieve a modal balance."
"We hope that we can continue further along this positive route."
"Mr President, we of course support all measures designed to enhance the role of rail transport and to change the present situation, which favours road transport."
"That is why we particularly support the reports by Sylviane Ainardi and Gilles Savary."
"If we want to have a competitive European railway system, we must harmonise technical standards and remove bottlenecks in the international network, and at the same time create high safety standards."
"Nevertheless, we will not achieve the interoperability needed by liberalising this sector."
"In cases where this has happened, private operators have not responded, particularly as regards the high levels of investment required."
"Nor has the Commission told us where it is going to find the finance needed to achieve this goal. It will not help at all to increase the flow of traffic by stimulating competition between the various operators if all the trains are forced to run on the same tracks, because that will simply lead to greater chaos and congestion."
"Furthermore, we are against the total liberalisation of the freight and passenger transport sectors by 2008."
"We oppose this extreme position just as we oppose the Commission proposal to anticipate the opening up of the market in international freight transport, and we equally cannot accept the Member States being prevented from setting safety standards higher than those stipulated by the EU, simply so as not to create difficulties in opening up this market."
"We are responsible to Europe's citizens."
"We must have the courage to fight for a public rail transport service which is of a high standard and safe, which will encourage people to use it."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like once again to congratulate the four rapporteurs on their excellent work and say that, in general, the amendments they propose support - as I said at the beginning of my first speech - the Commission's proposals."
"Furthermore, in some cases, they propose going further and more quickly in the reform of the rail sector."
"That is why the majority of the proposals are acceptable to the Commission, either in their current form or in principle."
"I believe that they clearly improve on the Commission's initial text: they provide it with detail, they improve it and they clarify some of the specific points."
"I will provide Parliament's Secretariat with a complete list indicating the Commission's position on each of the amendments, but I would nevertheless like to make a few comments in relation to our discussions and some general assessments of the amendments."
"Firstly, ladies and gentlemen, I am surprised that some of you are still raising the debate on whether or not the railways should be liberalised."
"Ladies and gentlemen, to those of you who love the railways so much that they want nothing to be done, all I can say is that over the years we have seen what is taking place: the railways are disappearing."
"If we do nothing - and I say this to those who are so worried that jobs will be lost with this supposed liberalisation - what will happen is that there will be no jobs, except for those which remain in the railway museums of the different countries of the European Union."
"That is what we have to realise."
"We are not talking about privatising the rail network."
"That is an option which may be chosen by some countries, but I would like to point out to the honourable Member that for the only one that had adopted the fixed network, the fixed infrastructure, we have recently authorised a series of very significant State measures in order to renationalise that rail network."
"The Commission is not adopting any action of this type."
"We are proposing something different: the network is a natural monopoly, and therefore, the existence of non-public ownership would lead to many difficulties, and there should be a series of public controls of this natural monopoly."
"We are saying that a natural monopoly, such as a European network, should above all be European, there should be no national concept, but a global European one, which requires common technological, administrative and safety rules."
"Secondly, we argue that there should be competition between the various operators."
"Ladies and gentlemen, some of you are concerned that there will be competition between the French operator - or the French operators, France will decide what to do - and the German, British or any other European Union operator."
"The only alternative to this situation of competition is to create a single European operator, operating for the entire European rail network."
"Do the honourable Members really believe that this can be done?"
"That this is the way to make the railways more operative, more competitive and more dynamic, and to recover the market quotas and the sections of transport which correspond to them?"
"I frankly believe not; that is not the way forward."
"The way forward is the one we are proposing: the conception and planning of the railways at European level - later I will discuss funding as well;"
"European planning of the railways and for the different operators currently in the countries of the European Union to be able to compete within this network."
"And, if there are new operators - because the legislation in the different countries authorise this - that they fulfil suitable requirements to be able to operate throughout this rail network, and that they also compete."
"We are talking about introducing rationality into the rail sector and turning it into a rail sector which is European and appropriate for the twenty-first century."
"I understand, as Mr Caveri, chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, has said, that the Directorate-General for Transport has made them work hard on the railways."
"As Commissioner responsible for transport, I would like to thank the chairman and the entire committee once again for their understanding, support and cooperation in all our work."
"Mr President, I will refer briefly to the amendments tabled."
"With regard to Mr Jarzembowski's report, in relation to the opening up of the market, I would stress his support for the Commission's proposal, with a view to completing the opening up of the market in the transport of goods by rail."
"The amendments presented deal with coordination in the time between the entry into force of Directive 2001/12/EC, on the first stage of the opening up to competition of goods transport by rail, which must be incorporated into the legislation of the Member States so that, from 15 March 2003, we have a starting gun for the whole of the European Union, with the supplementary stages we propose and, specifically, the incorporation of all the networks of the Union countries into a European network."
"In this regard, all these amendments are acceptable to the Commission."
"With regard to the amendments which propose extending the opening up to competition of the passenger sector, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Jarzembowski, the Commission believes that, in order to produce positive effects, this opening up, which requires a differentiated pace, requires a more appropriate and stricter framework."
"This opening up should therefore be considered not only from the point of view of the contracts signed by public administrations - something already regulated by the proposed regulations on public service obligations, which is still awaiting the decision of the Council, since Parliament gave its opinion on them some time ago - but also from the point of view of access rights and the protection of passenger rights."
"Mr Jarzembowski, we cannot accept these amendments, because we are waiting to present a proposal this year specifically for passengers and which will deal in a coherent manner with the problem of opening up competition in the railways for the passenger sector."
"I would like to thank Mr Jarzembowski for his support for the proposals the Commission will shortly present."
"With regard to Mr Sterckx's report on rail safety, we can accept the majority of the amendments, either in their current form or in principle, with some modifications of the text."
"I am referring essentially to the amendments which strengthen the requirement for transparency in terms of safety and which advocate a more rapid and intensive convergence of the strictest possible safety rules."
"I believe that that is the important point."
"However, we cannot accept either Amendment No 18 nor Amendment No 48, because they would be contrary to a clear distribution of responsibilities; we also have difficulties in accepting Amendment No 34, since we believe that it could considerably reduce the European scope of safety certificates."
"On the other hand, I must say that we attach the greatest possible importance to the independence of investigating bodies in the event of accidents, and we cannot therefore accept any restriction of this independence."
"We do not therefore accept Amendment No 56."
"I share Mrs Ainardi's view of the problem of investments, because all of this is going to require considerable investments on the part of the Member States of the Union."
"Each of the Member States has an interest in promoting this modernisation of the railways, but there is also a very obvious European interest in promoting the modernisation of the trans-European railway system."
"This is something that we must bear in mind if we really want to achieve the objective and ambitions of the Lisbon European Council."
"Therefore, I am going to make an appeal in this regard, with a view to the post-Berlin financial perspectives, that the budgets for rail transport infrastructures be increased, in a plan to create the trans-European rail network, which requires a special effort."
"We accept the proposal of the orange box of recorders, which will be strengthened with the LRTMS."
"Here also we can accept the majority of the amendments, but not all of them, since some of them are not in line with the principles."
"With regard to the report by Mr Savary, who, like all the Members and myself, is one of the friends of the railways, the key element which completes the whole circle is precisely the agency."
"I would like to thank Mr Savary for the improvements he contributes through his proposals."
"Several amendments deal with the way the agency will have to work with all the countries involved, that is, companies, operators, manufacturers of materials, operators of infrastructures and also users and people working in the rail sector."
"We support all these amendments, in particular Amendment No 14, which we consider to be very positive."
"We naturally also support various amendments relating to the institutional organisation of the agency which deal, for example, with the new financial regulation, which did not exist when the proposal was originally made."
"However, there are other amendments which cause us difficulties, for example those which would effectively confer decision-making powers on the agency, when we believe that it must only have the capacity to make technical proposals."
"Other amendments are superfluous in view of provisions in force or proposals planned for 2003 and we cannot therefore accept them."
"I would like to conclude, Mr President, by once again thanking the four rapporteurs and the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism for the work they have done, and I would like to thank this Parliament for its support."
"Following my conversations with the Greek Presidency, I am sure that under its mandate, and very possibly at the Council in March, we will have a common position from the Council, and I hope it will allow us, if not at first reading, at least at the second, to reach an agreement on this extremely important package."
"The economic capacity and productivity of Europe's economy is to an ever greater extent dependent on efficient interoperable transport which can rapidly move freight and passengers within Europe and onward to international transport links."
"Nevertheless, we have failed to make significant progress on rail transport."
"Decisions have chiefly been made at intergovernmental level, with each country trying to defend its own interests, and this has undermined the creation of a European railway market."
"This situation is untenable, because we are reaching saturation point in road transport, which is imposing a very heavy burden on our economic and environmental systems. Political will and an appropriate level of funding are needed to tackle this problem."
"Furthermore, the problems of rail transport in the peripheral countries, such as Portugal, need to be taken on board in providing solutions at European level if the EU is to function as a whole and to be economically efficient."
"So the Council must follow the lead of the European Parliament by showing the required political will and by finding the finance needed to create an internal European market in rail transport."
"The next item is the report (A5-0388/2002) by Helmuth Markov, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on the harmonisation of certain social legislation relating to road transport (COM(2001) 573 - C5-0485/2001 - 2001/0241(COD))"
"Mr President, firstly, as Commissioner responsible for transport, I would like to express my gratitude for being able to present this proposal on the social field in the road transport sector which forms part of the Commission's policy aimed at increasing road safety and the quality of road transport."
"There are social consequences in relation to safety in the road transport sector, and I believe we must deal with them."
"The proposal includes measures which will promote the efficient and uniform interpretation and application of the current rules, as stated in the White Paper, which will harmonise even further the competition conditions in the road transport sector."
"This proposal repeals and replaces the Regulation of 1985."
"Its aim is to simplify, clarify and update a piece of legislation which was approved 17 years ago."
"This modification favours effective application of the rules and in particular the introduction of digital speedometers."
"In order to simplify these rules, we have had to reduce the degree of flexibility of the Regulation in force, complex rules on compensation for reduced rest periods have been eliminated and the duration of daily rest has been increased by one hour to 12 hours."
"In order to update the rules, exemptions and exceptions have been reduced to the minimum and have been restricted to small and light vehicles, those used for short distances and those which offer a public service."
"One of the main factors which has inspired this revision has been the increase over the last 17 years in the number of services offered by private companies."
"In order to achieve this more effective application of the rules, the Commission wants to introduce certain new aspects into them, including the tightening of rules on the responsibility of companies and explicit provisions to facilitate the imposition of sanctions in a Member State on drivers who violate the Community rules in another State of the European Union."
"Furthermore, an explicit provision is introduced so that all Member States adopt the seizure of vehicles as one of the penalties for failing to comply with the law."
"Immobilising vehicles is a very effective way to penalise not only transport companies, but also transport agencies, which increasingly put pressure on drivers, demanding unreasonable and even entirely illegal driving times."
"Finally, in order to promote the constant clarification of the rules, a fruitful exchange of experiences and practices in relation to respect for them and active participation by all the Member States in the application of the Regulation, the Commission proposes the creation of an advisory committee made up of national experts from each of the Member States of the Union."
"This committee will work in collaboration with the existing European-level committee for dialogue with the sector."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, to sum up, this is our proposal, the fundamental intention of which is to improve compliance with the rules currently in force, to clarify their content, to increase responsibility and therefore to improve road safety."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the situation in which Parliament found itself when it was asked to draft this report was not a propitious one, because the Commission had drafted its proposal for this regulation without waiting for either the result of conciliation on the Working Time Directive or the Council decision on the digital tachograph."
"Both documents are - as Mrs de Palacio said - obviously closely related, by virtue of their content, to this report."
"I should like to thank Mr Andersson, who drafted the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"We had a number of preliminary discussions together."
"Originally an Enhanced Hughes Procedure was announced, but a few months later this was dispensed with and responsibility for the report was transferred to the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism."
"My thanks also go to the Commission staff, Mr Darmis from the committee administration, many European and national institutions, which are affected by this regulation and have played an active part in the debate, and the shadow rapporteurs from the other groups."
"I believe that it was this cooperation that made it possible for a number of important compromise amendments to be adopted in the committee."
"The regulation on the table has to take into account and interlink three different aspects."
"Firstly, improved road safety; secondly, social protection of workers, and thirdly, fair conditions of competition on the European Union's roads."
"I believe that a compromise between the groups has been successfully reached and that these three premises have been successfully integrated, although a few Members are proposing to reject the regulation."
"I would ask you not to comply with their wishes and instead to give the proposed draft the go-ahead."
"What then are the most important points on which a majority of the committee has so far been able to agree?"
"One, the regulation applies to all drivers of vehicles carrying goods or passengers by road, regardless of whether they are employed or self-employed."
"Two, the regulation also applies to vehicles from third countries when they are in the territory of the European Union."
"Three, the Commission is instructed to table this regulation for negotiation with the contracting parties to the AETR."
"Four, the concept of the flexible week that has been newly introduced by the Commission has not been confirmed and instead we retain the calendar week as a basis because this is more practical and easier to monitor."
"Five, the concept of 'driving time' has been defined by the committee so as to create greater legal certainty."
"Six - this is a very important point and I hope that it will be retained - all courier and express delivery services, which have contributed to a sharp increase in accidents in the transport sector, are included in the regulation."
"Seven, the daily rest period has been increased from the proposed 11 hours to 12 hours, although some flexibility is possible as it can be divided into two portions, of nine plus three hours, in a limited number of cases."
"Eight, the Member States are obliged to define a common range of sanctions to be applied in cases of infringement of the regulation, so as to harmonise the sanctions."
"Nine, the number of proposed checks on compliance with the regulation has been doubled."
"Ten, the transport undertakings are obliged to take the steps required to acquaint themselves with the total time worked, even where drivers are employed by several employers."
"Eleven, the Member States have to take the necessary measures to ensure that relations between shippers, forwarding agents, main customers and subcontractors are regulated by the adoption of binding contracts which enable compliance with the regulation to be monitored."
"Twelve, it was possible to delete some of the very numerous exemptions and also introduce some necessary new ones, such as, for example, for vintage vehicles and vehicles for humanitarian services."
"Despite this considerable number of positive changes - and the ones I have mentioned are just a selection - there are also passages which I and a large proportion of my fellow Members are still not happy with."
"That is why several amendments have also been tabled in plenary and I would encourage you to support them."
"In particular they concern the permitted driving time of 56 hours per week, which is unquestionably too high, although there is also a limit of not more than 90 hours in two weeks."
"We are proposing a maximum weekly driving time of 45 hours, which is still considerably more than the number of hours worked in almost any other branch of employment."
"Secondly, I hope, like many of my fellow Members, that the number of exemptions in this regulation will be reduced still further."
"I know that this regulation does not fulfil all of the wishes of those affected, but I am convinced that the new legislation will increase road safety, improve the social conditions of those concerned, and that it will enable companies to do their job of providing high-quality transport services."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to thank the rapporteur for his work, but also the other Members for the numerous coordination meetings."
"With 300 amendments the work was not easy."
"The main issue raised in this context was the necessity of a new regulation."
"Opinions differed on the priorities to be addressed, and colleagues in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will be taking the floor on this matter again today."
"In principle, however, the PPE-DE Group is in favour of amendment."
"The aim was to strike a balance between road safety on the one hand and, on the other, flexibility in a profession where even today there are labour shortages right across Europe, perhaps because the conditions are unfavourable, but also because demand is very high."
"This was a challenge for us."
"There was unanimity - and I should like to underline this here - on at least two points, the first being on checks."
"All Members agree that we can adopt the best directives in the world here, but if there are no effective checks on compliance in the Member States then we will not achieve anything."
"Less than 1%, as is the case in certain countries, is not enough."
"The 2% minimum that has been suggested here should certainly be respected."
"In addition, a report on implementation should be presented to Parliament at regular intervals, so that we, and also the Member States, can react in good time."
"It must not be the case, as the French say, that, 'Celui qui triche gagne le plus d'argent', that is that those who do not comply with these directives make the most money."
"That is precisely what we want to prevent: unfair competition at the expense of, amongst other things, safety."
"Secondly, there was unanimity on the scope, namely that we should include third countries: we want to create a European transport area and anyone who uses this area must play by the same rules."
"We know that for various reasons companies move their headquarters to third countries, not only for economic reasons, but for other reasons too."
"That is why it is important over time for us to create this European transport area."
"We wanted to build in flexibility."
"Exemptions have been discussed and obviously I do not want to mention all of them."
"We do however continue to attach importance to short-distance drivers and taxi drivers being excluded, although of course we also support exemptions in certain areas, such as for farmers, who do seasonal work, and for breakdown services."
"The concept of safety should not mean that the regulation imposes restrictions on the people who are actually responsible for safety."
"One area where we are still undecided is courier services."
"Some think that they should be in, while others believe that the numerous accidents are not related to rest periods and driving times but are rather a question of speed."
"We have also introduced flexibility to the breaks."
"We did not just want weekends of between 24 and 45 hours, but also 36 hours."
"We also want to take account of those countries that are not in central Europe, because tomorrow, with enlargement, we have to bear in mind that the centre is going to shift and that it is not only going to be rest periods and driving times that will determine whether a haulage business is efficient or not."
"We do not call into question the 12-hour nightly rest period either, with the related flexibility of nine plus three hours."
"This also applies to the daily rest periods and the short breaks."
"We wanted a certain degree of flexibility here, to take account on the one hand of each driver's work rhythm but on the other of the needs inherent in the job."
"Safety was the other aspect that needed to be brought into the equation."
"Rest periods, daily rest periods and weekend rest periods are issues of safety and it is not unknown for overtired drivers to be involved in accidents."
"Nevertheless, we should not exaggerate this either."
"Some statistics show the risk to be very high."
"Overall we work on the basis of realistic statistics showing that this is the case for around 15% of serious road traffic accidents."
"This is not about singling out the roads yet again for wholesale condemnation."
"The initiative being taken here by the Commission and Parliament will, I believe, improve safety."
"As far as infringements are concerned, as we see it taking vehicles out of service is the best approach."
"This is not at odds with the legislation in the various countries and only one thing is required, namely that the vehicle should be taken out of service until the failure is corrected."
"In short, I would say that by adopting the stricter rules in this regulation, and by creating new conditions, we can have a positive economic impact on this sector."
"This will, however, do nothing to change the fact that in the future road transport will continue to be one of the major players in transport as a whole."
"I am referring here to the discussions that we had earlier."
"This does not in any way mean that if we want to bring about a modal shift it can only be done by adopting legislation on road transport. Instead this must go hand in hand with clear initiatives in the other transport sectors."
"Thank you for your attention."
"Mr President, in the German press preview there was a headline that is very apt for this dossier."
"It read: fresh goods need fresh drivers."
"It is actually the case that we are usually more concerned with the economy and competition, and that all too often the issue of safety and the life and health of the public is given short shrift."
"We recently experienced the Prestige disaster."
"When there is an accident at sea or in the air the public in Europe is outraged, but the daily deaths on our roads are something that we have obviously become accustomed to."
"We should not become accustomed to them, however, because there are - as the statistics show - two main causes of accidents on our roads."
"The first is HGVs with overtired drivers, who are at the wheel for far too long, and the second, increasingly, is the express services, the so-called sprinter class, which represent the greatest potential for danger on our roads and motorways."
"That is why it is absolutely crucial for us to include these express services, this sprinter class, in this regulation."
"In the committee we arrived at a consensus on a series of sensible rules for driving times and rest periods that are realistic and geared to the needs of both drivers and companies."
"I think it is sensible, if at all possible, for drivers to spend their weekly rest periods at home, where they live, with their families."
"It is also sensible, if they are nearly at a ferry and can spend their rest time there, for the driving times and rest times to allow them to reach that ferry."
"Obviously it is not sensible to spend a rest time in a travelling vehicle, and we have therefore stated this in the text."
"As Mr Grosch has already said, we can adopt as many wonderful, detailed, even obsessively detailed, rules as we like, but if they cannot be enforced then they are just words."
"For me, in any case, this is also one of the most important points."
"At present we have an average inspection rate of barely 1% and it is actually only possible to carry out real inspections, real checks, if both the roadside check on what the vehicle is doing and the check on the undertaking are done in tandem."
"However, practice in the Member States of the Community is very variable and it is for this reason, Commissioner, that the transitional period, between our bidding farewell to the traditional tachograph and introducing the digital tachograph, has to be as short as possible, so that we can inspect all of the HGVs in the Community by means of a digital tachograph as soon as possible."
"The fact that this allows a period of 28 days to be monitored in a roadside check will make a huge contribution to improving safety on Europe's roads."
"I should like to thank the rapporteur, Helmut Markov, who has done a good job, was very willing to compromise and united us behind his proposals, and also the other Members who were shadow rapporteurs for this dossier."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would first like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Markov, for drawing up this report."
"He has done a thorough job and, furthermore, listened to those of us who have a different opinion with regard to this issue."
"Road safety is an important matter."
"From the point of view of the transport sector it is also essential to improve the social status of drivers and the esteem they are held in."
"The Commission proposal, however, was badly drafted."
"In the committee debate we were able to improve the proposal, although, in the opinion of our group, the end result is still not acceptable."
"The proposal would increase inflexibility and lead to practices that would be difficult to monitor and which would cause the sector to incur additional costs. Furthermore, natural breaks at work cannot be taken advantage of."
"The new regulation will not improve road safety either."
"Our group is proposing that we reject the Commission proposal and ask the Commission to carry out a thorough study of the need to change current rest periods, taking digital tachographs into account."
"We have also put forward important proposals for improvements in case the rejection proposal is blocked."
"The basic idea behind them is that the provisions on rest periods in the current regulation are adequate provided that they are complied with and monitored effectively."
"More effective monitoring will lead to better results than if the provisions are merely made more stringent on paper."
"Mr President, Mr Markov has produced a sterling piece of work."
"His report examines rules that will simplify a very complicated area."
"Driving is one of the hardest and most pressurised jobs there is."
"The seat behind the wheel in buses and lorries is a back-breaking place of work."
"The simple new rules proposed by Mr Markov would ease the burden of work."
"It is to be applauded that Parliament can play a part in simplifying the rules."
"Assaults are one of the major problems encountered by drivers when they take rest breaks on European motorways."
"It is more urgent than ever to cooperate on preventing the increasing violence on our motorways."
"Finally, I wish to draw attention to increased safety on motorways."
"This is relevant not only to professional drivers but to all of us who drive on European roads."
"All too often, we have seen accidents caused by tired drivers."
"The simple new rules would mean that no one could be in any doubt as to when and for how long drivers were required to take rest breaks."
"It would be easier for the police to monitor that the rules were being complied with."
"I very much hope that the police would also increase the level of checks they made."
"I must also say that I am very surprised that the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is giving more consideration to the cost of equipping lorries than to the deaths of 40 000 people each year on European highways."
"What the ELDR Group is displaying here is penny-pinching at its worst."
"They should be ashamed of themselves."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if we adopt the Markov report today then this new legislation will not only interest those directly involved in the transport sector but millions of people in Europe, because this is also about road safety."
"Safety in road freight transport concerns everyone who lives in the EU, because - and the statistics are clear about this - overtiredness at the wheel kills!"
"A study by the European Safety Council shows that more than 50% of drivers admit that they have fallen asleep at the wheel at least once in their driving careers so far."
"What then is to be done?"
"We Greens think that the working times in this sector, the driving times, need to be reduced."
"We have tabled an amendment stating that they should be reduced to 80 hours every two weeks with a maximum of 45 to 48 hours in any one week."
"What we have at the moment is 56 hours per week."
"That is only the driving time."
"On top of that there is loading and unloading."
"There is no other job in industry that presents such a high risk for which we permit such long working hours."
"In addition, systematic inspections need to be introduced."
"As Mr Piecyk mentioned, when the regulation on the digital tachograph is implemented, we must exert pressure on all of the national governments to introduce checks on undertakings, the company card."
"If you talk to police officers they will tell you that this company card is the only way of effecting systematic checks on undertakings."
"Obviously we will have to ensure that this European legislation is respected in the competent overarching bodies, for example in the requirements for CEMT licences."
"I have raised this with Mrs Isabelle Durant, who is currently chairing CEMT, so that this issue is put on the agenda of the CEMT ministerial meeting of 21 and 22 April."
"Mr President, Commissioner, opinions on this harmonisation proposal differ sharply."
"Shippers in particular say that the existing regulation is operating satisfactorily."
"Changes would have far-reaching consequences for the sector."
"On the other hand, plenty of reports are appearing which show that the provisions of the regulation are being completely disregarded."
"On the basis of the first point of view, therefore, no changes are needed, although they are needed on the basis of the second."
"I think that both interpretations are in some sense correct."
"In the final analysis there is not so much intrinsically wrong with the regulation."
"There is, however, something wrong with the way in which Member States interpret and apply the regulation."
"Partly as a result of limited and inadequate opportunities for control, contraventions of the regulation are not uncommon, with all the consequences this has for road safety, competitive conditions and the viability of this sector."
"In order to improve the situation, I believe that intervention in the existing regulation is inevitable."
"Two starting points are crucial here."
"Firstly, most of the current provisions can remain intact."
"Only a few provisions have proved to be open to multiple interpretations."
"A clear definition must be found for these elements."
"I therefore support most of the amendments aimed at reinstating the original text."
"I also support those amendments that clarify the existing ambiguities, like the separate rest periods."
"Secondly, we must tighten the provisions in respect of control and international coordination."
"Different interpretations of the regulation by national regulatory authorities obstruct the creation of a level playing field for competition in the European Union."
"We therefore support the amendments that aim to achieve qualitative and quantitative improvement of the controls."
"This also applies to amendments that are intended to achieve international harmonisation amongst regulatory authorities."
"In short, the emphasis must lie on simple, enforceable provisions, adequate controls and identical assessment standards by regulatory authorities."
"We believe that the report provides a good starting point for this."
"My thanks to the rapporteur for his work."
"Mr President, I would like to focus my contribution to this debate on the essence of what the proposal means to people in my constituency."
"This report, and the original proposal behind it, would have grave implications for business and individuals alike."
"Even though several important derogations were won in committee, the concept of the proposal remains impractical, untenable and unenforceable."
"This is why, along with a number of colleagues, I have submitted an amendment which would have the Commission proposal rejected in its entirety."
"Indeed it seems to me that recent times have seen the transport industry being hit hard by piece after piece of excessive legislation. The by-word seems to be: if it moves, regulate it."
"I have to justify to my constituents the ethics of a report which originally sought to bind road rescue services and public utility vehicles - all absolutely essential to society - to strict new working hours."
"These requirements about working time prevent professionals from doing their job efficiently by imposing strict terms on when breaks have to be taken."
"Once again we see Europe hamstringing business rather than liberating it."
"The introduction of a common range of penalties in particular is worrying."
"This clearly gives licence to interfere in matters of national sovereignty and national autonomy."
"Indeed the subsidiarity and extraterritoriality issues apparent in this report are clear examples of the report itself being over-extended."
"British Conservatives by their very nature oppose such restrictive legislation being piled on business."
"We believe that this particular piece of legislation is unnecessary, highly excessive and has little relevance to the needs of business and employees alike."
"It takes no account of the need for flexibility in key areas of transport, pays scant regard to the consumer and seems contemptuous of the need for Europe's industry to remain competitive, a cornerstone of the Lisbon Declaration."
"I therefore have no hesitation in urging this House to support our key amendment to reject the proposal in its entirety."
"Mr President, Commissioner, in the plenum we value your presence in the debates of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism."
"The fundamental axis of this report is road safety."
"As some honourable Members have said, lack of safety leads to 40 000 deaths and 1 750 000 injuries per year in the European Union."
"And there is great consensus on the part of all the groups with regard to the need to achieve the objective of safety."
"But here the differences begin, and we are producing proposals which will give the Council work, because the Council will have to take a position on many points on which in this House we are naturally not going to achieve unanimity."
"Specifically, we are talking about one of the factors of safety."
"It is true that there are technological factors, there are infrastructure factors, there are many agents involved in the question of safety or lack of safety, but I believe we must focus on the essential factor, the human factor, the driver in this case."
"On the basis of Mr Markov's proposals, and with his cooperation, the report has developed, leading to greater flexibility for the driver, because it is the driver who is aware of levels of tiredness at any given moment and it must be they who call the shots in terms of rests and the distribution of working time."
"There is a gremlin which creeps into all these debates and that is that sometimes this flexibility can be used by the transport company to counter the driver's capacity to decide."
"If this were the case, the system of controls on companies would have to be extremely strict, since we are talking about risking lives, in particular that of the drivers themselves."
"We are also talking about a very important European small or medium-sized enterprise, the transport enterprise, which we must promote and whose competitiveness we must defend."
"And we are talking about a transport problem in a Europe which is not equal, a Europe which has peripheral areas for which transport has an importance which is different to that of central areas."
"I believe that this report has important objectives, but we must continue to work on it until we reach a consensus."
"Mr President, I too think it good that we obtain clearer rules and that the regulation be revised in such a way as to take account of the changes that have occurred in the transport sector over the last 15 years."
"I think it important, however, that, in connection with regulating the safety of road transport, we obtain a clear definition of the rules relating to driving time and rest periods, viewed partly in relation to features supplementary to these rules, such as the rules governing drivers' working time, as well as checks that the rules governing driving time and rest periods are being complied with."
"My country's geographical situation is such that it is particularly important for us that transport be efficient at the same time as being safe."
"It is therefore important that the concept of driving time be defined as the period during which the vehicle's wheels are turning and that there be no confusion with the rules governing drivers' working time."
"I want to warn against the proposals to change the present rules so as to extend rest periods because such changes could entail major expenditure without providing drivers with greater safety or better conditions."
"That is because the quality of a rest is not necessarily directly proportional to its length, and it is also important that drivers themselves be able to organise their rest periods and choose where they are going to rest."
"Everyone may agree that there are problems with the safety of transport on our highways, but that is not necessarily always because of unduly lax rules but, rather, because of inadequate checks and insufficient efforts to ensure that the rules are being complied with in practice."
"That is something we must do something about."
"I should like to add that I very much agree with my fellow MEP, Mr Blak, that we must also look at another problem for drivers."
"It is important that they be safer when they take their breaks."
"It is disgraceful that drivers should live in fear of assault and robbery."
"The Council has accepted that countries must make efforts in this area, and I am looking forward to seeing some practical initiatives soon."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Regulation (EC) No 3820/85, which is currently being replaced, deals with problems on roads, safety and all sorts of social problems."
"We all know that we have had, and still are having, very great problems supervising and enforcing this."
"All sorts of special cases such as the Willy Betz formula, the Kralowetz affair, etc., and most particularly the regular occurrence of road accidents with all the consequences of these make it clear that we really have our work cut out."
"I would like to thank the two rapporteurs, Mr Markov and Mr Andersson, for their constructive collaboration on this work."
"It will be clear that we are very much in favour of bringing this proposal into line with the proposal about the organisation of working hours, about which we had such intensive arguments in this Parliament not so very long ago."
"Of course, this also applies to the reinstatement of a wide range of definitions so that they are not open to multiple interpretations."
"We do not need flexible weeks; difficult definitions of driving times must be replaced; opting-out clauses must be restricted; and enforcement must be intensified."
"I would, however, particularly like to focus attention on a couple of amendments which we are in favour of."
"Firstly, Amendment No 90 on the reduction of the 90-hour driving time over two weeks to 80 hours."
"We think that this is an important safety issue."
"Secondly, the amendment concerning improving checks by linking the digital tachograph directive to this regulation."
"Finally, we have a joint amendment from a number of parties about reducing the shortened daily rest periods of not less than 10 and not more than 12 hours, for which I request your attention."
"Mr President, in this legislation I detect a worrying and sinister extension of the scope of Community power."
"It seems to me that the Commission is no longer content just to set harmonised standards; it is now moving firmly into setting standards and priorities for enforcement."
"Within the narrow confines of this legislation, ensuring standards for adequate enforcement certainly has its own internal logic, but there is more to it than meets the eye."
"Road transport enforcement is carried out by a variety of agencies, most of which have multiple responsibilities and duties."
"In this instance, the main burden will fall on police forces whose duties also extend to dealing with a wide range of criminal matters outside the scope of this regulation and the scope of Community law."
"With resources painfully limited, the decisions on how these resources should be employed should be local decisions, based on an assessment of the needs of the local communities and their different patterns."
"In this context, where the officers who deal with transport matters also deal with crime, such as burglary and other accident prevention, Community requirements in this specific area will almost certainly lead to a distortion of priorities, dictated not by local needs but by a supranational authority which has neither knowledge nor understanding of local conditions."
"As a result, national authorities, in their haste to conform with the requirements of the Commission in this area, will be neglecting other duties which are actually far more important."
"It is not unrealistic, therefore, to suggest that burglars will be able to roam free because police management, under pressure from national authorities, is more concerned with satisfying Community requirements."
"This is simply not acceptable."
"I will therefore be voting against this regulation."
"I would normally thank the Commission for a proposal it sends to Parliament, but this time I am not so grateful."
"I have objections to the proposal concerning driving times and rest periods in road transport in the form in which it was originally sent to Parliament by the Commission."
"The amendment by Mr Bradbourn, myself and a large number of fellow MEPs is therefore intended as a signal to the European Commission to stop using this old method of legislating."
"It is time we became aware of the bureaucracy we are causing."
"Making new regulations does not mean that they will be enforced any better than the old regulations, which were satisfactory but were not enforced either."
"Many of the new regulations cannot be monitored at all."
"Other regulations are only being amended on account of the technology used for monitoring, which had worked well for 17 years."
"An example of legislation that cannot be monitored and is therefore poor is the new attempt to tell self-employed contractors how long they may work."
"My colleague Mathieu Grosch has improved the proposal a great deal, and it will be thanks to him that there will in fact be a directive."
"The question remains, however: what possessed the Commission to come up with such poor legislation in the first place?"
"The last thing the sector needs is more new regulations."
"What it does need is well -thought through, intelligent and harmonised monitoring that also creates a climate for honest competition, monitoring that will apply equally to the 15, soon to be 25, Member States."
"I know that the European Commission supports attempts to create more extensive and more intelligent monitoring of freight traffic."
"I also know, however, that cooperation often depends on personal input and sympathies and therefore still takes place on a relatively informal basis."
"This difficult process must also be given more political support, and it is a pity that business must sacrifice flexibility for the sake of regulation, flexibility being the keyword in the sector."
"The sector has always managed to make its way through the increasingly stringent requirements and the difficult market with great creativity, but when I look at the profit figures, I fear that even this creativity will miss the mark."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to thank you for your constructive comments on our proposal and say, in order to dispel any doubts, that this is not a social policy proposal."
"That would be the responsibility of Mrs Diamantopoulou rather than me."
"That is not my competence."
"I am talking about road safety."
"That is the objective of this proposal."
"If the social aspect were the primary objective, we would have to consider other issues."
"I am talking about safety on our roads in the transport sector and, of course, distortions of competition."
"In view of the large number of amendments proposed, I will present a list in writing to the Secretariat of Parliament indicating the Commission's specific position on each of them."
"I would like to make a few general comments on the most important issues which have been raised here today, however."
"Firstly, the adoption of the sectoral directive on types of work, which lays down a method for weekly calculation, makes it necessary to adapt our Regulation, above all the provisions relating to working and rest times."
"The Commission therefore accepts the amendments - some with modifications to the wording - which clarify the text in this respect."
"We also accept those amendments - some reworded - which call for improvements in the control and application of the regulations."
"We will incorporate these suggestions into the proposal on road controls which we will present soon, bearing in mind that this is a different proposal - and this is my response to one of the speakers who referred earlier to this aspect."
"We also accept the amendments which call for compatibility between the rules of the European Union and those of third countries and which call for the inclusion of smaller international transport vehicles in the legislation, especially those which provide courier services, as well as all those amendments which request a degree of flexibility in terms of permitting all existing practices which do not have a negative effect on the application of the Regulation."
"Mr President, we cannot accept the arguments that this proposal is not necessary, however."
"Seventeen years have passed since the original Regulation entered into force and both the nature of the market and European realities and technological developments, specifically the digital speedometer, have developed and changed considerably."
"The changes therefore have to be incorporated."
"The Commission will ensure a balance between flexibility and the control of application."
"We cannot accept those amendments which ask for more controls and imply an excessive increase in administrative burdens."
"And with regard to the exceptions and derogations, the Commission accepts those which are based on concrete realities, but not the generic ones which could be used to evade the rules."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Markov, for this wonderful work, since he has had to deal with a real sea of amendments, but I believe that in the end he has been able to propose a balanced report which the Commission generally agrees with."
"Thank you, Commissioner de Palacio."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
"In some parts of the European Union, such as the rural and island areas of Scotland, there is simply no alternative to road transport for the distribution of goods or passengers."
"For that reason, excessively restricted working hours for lorry and coach drivers would add to the difficulties already faced by residents and businesses, bringing further increases in costs of essential goods and services."
"I will therefore vote against amendments which seek to apply even greater reductions in driving time than contained in the Commission's proposal."
"If EU regulations are to be seen as relevant, due account must be taken of the realities facing rural and island communities."
"I hope that the final proposal in relation to drivers' working hours will recognise that some areas, such as the Highlands and Islands of Scotland, require a flexible approach to be taken and I hope that the Council and Commission will agree."
"The next item is the vote."

"Before the vote:"
"Mr President, I think we can make things easier for ourselves."
"My group opposes the oral amendments."
"I am sorry, but having discussed these reports in detail in the committee and voted on them as a package, it is simply out of the question to untie that package by making changes at this stage."
"That is why my group opposes all oral amendments to the Ainardi report."
"In order to follow the procedures correctly, if 32 Members object when we come to the vote there cannot be an oral amendment."
"When we reach the relevant points in the vote, the House can indicate its preference."
"Before the votes on the Amendments to Article 1 point 4, Article 2 point 5, recital 6 and recital 8, the President established that more than 32 Members objected to the oral amendments."

"Before the vote on Amendment No 91:"
"Mr President, I just wanted to point out that Amendments Nos 45 and 78, both of which have been adopted, are contradictory."
"We actually intended to request a separate vote yesterday, but that all fell through."
"I should therefore like to inform the administration that both amendments need to be reformulated."
"Mr President, I would like to question the order decided upon for the votes. In my opinion, Amendment No 9 is the amendment which is furthest from the text adopted in committee."
"However, it is for the President to decide."
"Mr President, Amendment No 9 is the furthest from the committee's paragraph, but if the rapporteur is of a contrary opinion, I bow to his superior experience."
"Given the level of entente, I shall also bow to that experience."
"Mr President, I indicated beforehand that I wished to raise a point of order before the vote on Amendment No 24."
"I refer to Rule 139(6) of the Rules of Procedure, which states that amendments have to be distributed and translated."
"I have various language versions in front of me, none of which contains this particular amendment, Amendment No 24."
"In addition, a number of Members, from both the conservative and Social Democratic groups, were under the impression that this vote would not be taking place until tomorrow."
"I would therefore firstly move that the vote should not take place."
"Insofar as it is possible for me to assess the situation as one of the proposers of the original right to bring cases before the court, I do not think that a proper decision can be made if these amendments are put to the vote first and not Mr Duff's amendment."
"In any case, Members are free to exercise their independent judgment."
"I refer here to Rule 2 of the Rules of Procedure."
"Give us an opportunity actually to vote on the right to bring cases before the court, that is, on the original wording of Paragraph 8."
"Just to clarify matters for the House, Mrs Berès, you have requested that the author withdraw his amendment."
"Mr President, I do not agree with the last observation by Mrs Berès."
"It is not a question of having an amendment passed."
"It is a question of reflecting, in relation to a text which is important in terms of the Convention, on something which is of great importance to this Parliament, which is the legitimacy, the double legitimacy, of the Union."
"Mr Tsatsos and I, in our report on the Treaty of Amsterdam, speak of the double legitimacy of States and peoples."
"The concept of the people seems to us to be an archaic one."
"We want to talk of citizens, because we want to bring Europe closer to the citizens."
"I am not therefore withdrawing my amendment and I would ask that it be put to the vote."
"And I would also ask the Socialist Group to take on board that this is truly the modern way to act and not the old-fashioned one."
"Air travel has become cheaper and cheaper over the last few decades."
"In addition to the traditional national air carriers, a number of other airlines have entered the arena offering conspicuously cheap rates."
"Some of these companies come from outside the EU."
"What is now being proposed is aimed at these companies from outside the EU."
"They are often based in countries in the developing world or countries in the former Soviet Union."
"These are poor countries that think that they can make money as low-cost competitors in the European market."
"For example, the Brazilian airline Varig flies people very cheaply between Amsterdam and Paris."
"We need to act on this, not least because these companies make unnecessary amounts of noise and apply less stringent safety standards."
"Barring these companies, however, is only part of the solution."
"The low-cost airlines based inside the EU, like Ryanair, Easyjet, Virgin and Germanwings have been ignored."
"The freedom from taxation enjoyed by the airlines, which gives them an unfair competitive advantage over international rail travel, likewise remains in place."
"The proposals on which we are voting today are therefore a half-measure that inflicts the pain one-sidedly on other countries."
"I am voting in favour of this proposal, but I think that it is one-sided and inadequate."
"When will we see the essential other part that puts an end to the risks associated with the low-cost airlines?"
"In principle, I regard the Commission's proposal for a regulation as something to be welcomed."
"Most of Parliament's amendments complement it well, but I regard the following points as problematic in view of current Community rules and practices:"
"a new and higher standard through substituting 'significant material injury' for 'material injury' in the area of goods, resulting in uncertainty due to the new definition, as well as the potential weakening of our negotiating position on this point at the Doha follow-up negotiations, and discrimination in favour of the service sector to the detriment of the manufacturing sector (Amendments Nos 9, 25, 26, 38);"
"the lack of any scope for legal action afforded to 'allied enterprises', these being defined by the existence of an alliance agreement, which, in practice, because of the worldwide network of alliances, results in marked reduction in the scope for legal action (Amendment No 39);"
"the need for Amendment No 60 to be clarified to ascertain whether it is to be read as meaning that a decision by the Commission shall be regarded as confirmed if no agreement on it can be reached in Council."
"In any case, Amendment No 62 (qualified majority in the Council) sets a higher standard for the imposition of measures in the area of services than in that of goods."
"When determining where the Community interest lies, there is a departure from the original assumption that the imposition of measures is in principle in the Community interest, unless the opposite is established to be the case, in the sense that measures are imposed only when their application is in the Community interest."
"I hope that these points can be examined closely during the remainder of the proceedings."
"I voted in favour of this report concerning the Commission communication on the annual report on humanitarian aid in 2000-2001, because I agree with the rapporteur's diagnosis of the situation and also with many of her proposals."
"As the draftsman of the opinion of the AFET Committee says: 'the key objective of EU humanitarian action is to respond promptly and efficiently to the needs of the victims of humanitarian crises, in order to alleviate their suffering in a spirit of human solidarity."
"It goes without saying that political considerations have no place in such an area'."
"I attach particular importance to the rapporteur's warning that there has been a downward trend in the amount of emergency humanitarian aid, 'aid making it possible immediately to save lives'."
"I consider it vital, in order to counter this trend, and as has indeed already been proposed, to strengthen action under ECHO, and to develop awareness-raising campaigns for the citizens of the European Union, so as to bring these actions closer to the public, and of course to reverse the negative trend identified in the budget."
"One of our priorities should be to improve coordination of humanitarian aid and of aid providers so as to avoid the kind of situation that recently occurred in Angola when aid was 'guaranteed' but was very slow in coming through on the ground."
"Our response mechanisms need to be made far more flexible."
"Mr President, I am sleeping very well at the moment and I have had a lot of dreams."
"In one of them, at the Palais de l'Europe casino - which does not really exist but is there in my dreams - four players were sitting at the table: Mr Jarzembowski, Mr Sterckx, Mrs Ainardi and Mr Savary."
"It was an animated, very convivial game."
"Mr Jarzembowski, who was dressed as a guard, was talking to the other players and said: 'The railways must be developed!'"
"He was illustrating his report, pleading zealously and astutely the cause of the development of the railways in Europe."
"He spoke so eloquently that he convinced me to vote for his report."
"I will tell you what the other players were saying when their turn comes."
"With this rail package the European Commission is proposing a new version of Directive 91/440, which seeks to increase the liberalisation of rail services, in particular for freight."
"The amendments of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism broadened its scope to include the liberalisation of passenger services as well."
"I will vote against both these measures."
"We should ask why we are speeding up the liberalisation process when the 1991 directive has only just been revised."
"We should ask why we are reconsidering an agreement, a balanced agreement, reached with some difficulty just over a year ago. The Member States have not even finished the transposition of the revised directive of 2001."
"This means that we are moving ahead with liberalisation, with no going back, before we have even assessed the effects of the beginning of the process."
"It is simplistic to assert that the main reason why rail has become less competitive than road transport for freight is because the sector has not been liberalised."
"We did not have to liberalise rail passenger services to achieve cooperation between national operators in the case of Thalys."
"What works for passenger services could be applied to and developed for freight services."
"The will must be there though, and European and national investment at the ready."
"Let us go for rail rather than for lorries!"
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)"
"We are conscious that the Commission's second railway package, and in particular the proposal for a directive on the development of the Community's railways, which is the subject of the Jarzembowski report, touches on important long-standing issues in various Member States, including my own - Portugal."
"Although it is not long since the previous package was adopted - agreement with the Council was only reached in 2001 - the Commission's current proposal attempts to go somewhat further with measures designed to liberalise this sector, particularly in the field of freight transport, coupled with measures to strengthen safety standards governing this mode of transport."
"We believe we should support the greater liberalisation proposed by the Commission, while rejecting the amendments establishing a specific timetable for the total opening of the market in rail passenger and freight transport."
"That is why we were also unable to give our support to Amendment No 13 tabled by Mr Miranda, because this amendment reflects a rigid approach to the need to revitalise a mode of transport that is environmentally clean and which has a contribution to make in the area of freight transport to reducing congestion in European road transport, but which requires substantial financial investment that only opening up the market can make viable."
"The proposals for a second railway package set in motion important initiatives towards strengthening Europe's railway system."
"Opening rail freight services within Member States, and accelerating the process of opening up the international ones, represent a significant step towards deregulating the railway sector."
"The objectives set by the White Paper for European transport policy up to 2010, as well as the constantly increasing volume of traffic on Europe's roads, mean that absolute priority must be accorded to transferring goods traffic from road to rail."
"Diverting the flow of European freight traffic can succeed in the long term only if railways are high-performing and competitive."
"The planned harmonisation of the European railway network is therefore to be welcomed, provided that a maximum of safety in rail travel can be guaranteed."
"In the same dream, Mr President, still at the Palais de l'Europe casino, another player at the table was Mr Sterckx. Now, Mr Sterckx was dressed as a cyclist."
"Why was that?"
"Who knows!"
"Probably the fact that the names Merckx and Sterckx rhyme had made me imagine him to be a cyclist, and a very fast cyclist at that, given that Eddy Merckx won all his races, as we all remember well."
"Indeed, Mr Sterckx was talking to the others and illustrating his report, stressing the importance of high speed in the railways in Europe and, in particular, the need for high-speed trains to contain especially comfortable accommodation for pensioners."
"Listening to this, I could only vote for Mr Sterckx' excellent report the next morning, as, indeed, I have done."
"I voted for this report because I too believe that if we are to make the Community's railway system safer and raise the standard of international rail services, we need to encourage a progressive move towards a system of common safety standards in the Member States."
"I am delighted to see what excellent safety indicators the European railway system has. This only goes to underscore the urgent need to increase the use of rail transport and to reduce the use of road transport, especially heavy goods vehicles, which has a poorer safety record."
"The report before us describes a package for the liberalisation of railway services, which is intended to take place by 2008. In this respect, however, it is important to learn from the British experience over recent years, which indicates that the public authorities need to carry on supervising and checking compliance with rail safety regulations, particularly as regards infrastructure maintenance."
"I have also been looking at some of the suggestions emanating from the relevant committee as regards the introduction of a safety certificate for train operating companies and for those responsible for infrastructure management."
"It also suggested appropriate training leading to a qualification for railway staff, together with access to all information on safety for all new rail companies, and the adoption of a single working language for all international transport, as in the world of aviation."
"Mr President, Mrs Ainardi was also playing at the Palais de l'Europe casino in my dream - a game of poker in this case - with the other rapporteurs on the European railways."
"She was extremely elegant and beautiful and surrounded by many young admirers, but when it came to her turn to play, she always said, 'Pass'."
"When the other players asked her why, she replied: 'We must avoid breaks in our game, just as, at Europe's borders, we must avoid breaks between railway networks."
"See how much less time the game takes if there are no breaks."
"Of course, therefore, I could not fail to vote for the Ainardi report."
"Mr President, Mr Savary was also playing at the Palais de l'Europe casino with Mr Jarzembowski, Mr Sterckx, and Mrs Ainardi, but he was wearing a fireman's uniform in my dream and was saying to the others: 'I am wearing a fireman's uniform for two reasons: firstly because, with my report, I am rushing to the aid of rail passengers, who must have safe railways, and secondly, because who is better qualified than I am to ensure safe railways?"
"My name is Savary, as derived from the words 'safe' and 'save'."
"I am in the best position to make the railways safe!"
"Moreover, I saw from his report that this is, indeed, the case, and I therefore decided to vote for Mr Savary's report on the safety, specifically, of rail transport."
"In order to guarantee the safety, quality and efficiency of transport on our continent - including both passenger transport and freight - we need to give absolute priority, once and for all, to transport and in particular to rail transport, not to mention short sea shipping and maritime cabotage."
"I therefore think that the idea of setting up a European Railways Agency is a very important one; this agency would work with the Commission to promote greater cooperation and coordination between the various stakeholders involved in rail policy and the operability of the railway system, whilst also making an ongoing contribution to the debate through its recommendations and opinions."
"If proper publicity is given to its remit as regards consultation, monitoring and submitting proposals, this will result in ever greater awareness, on the part of both the Member States and the European public, of the enormous advantages of this mode of transport, especially as compared with the increasing problems and dangers associated with road transport."
"Still on this subject, I would like to mention the White Paper European transport policy for 2010: time to decide which refers in various places to the need to reverse the trend away from rail and towards road transport."
"I therefore hope that this will represent a further step towards the objective of creating a genuine internal market in rail services which will above all make it possible to effectively reduce the volume of traffic on our roads, and especially the enormous volume of freight transported by heavy goods vehicles."
"This, Mr President, is a revolutionary proposal, the proposal advanced by myself and the Pensioners' Party, and I therefore hope that it will meet with great attention from all the many, esteemed Members of the European Parliament here today."
"The Markov report organises, inter alia, the working hours and rest periods of drivers engaged in the carriage of goods and passengers by road."
"Well then, my proposal is as follows."
"Why do we not organise pension years in the same way as we regulate the daily working hours: ten years of work and then five years of pension, then another ten years of work and five years of pension, then another ten years of work and five of pension?"
"In this way, I am sure we could start to enjoy our pensions between the ages of 25 and 30, for example, from 35 to 40 and so on."
"My figures might not be exact but I believe the concept is clear."
"I propose that we decide to start to draw on our pensions and have a rest from work not when have grown old but at intervals throughout our working lives, as I have endeavoured to illustrate."
"Mr President, when I read yesterday's newspapers from Luxembourg, I was amazed at the fuss created by the Greens, who have made themselves out to be the prime movers behind the revision of the Regulation harmonising certain social security provisions in the area of road transport."
"If our rapporteur had read these articles, he would surely also be astonished, as, out of the 269 amendments with which the committee had to get to grips, a mere 16 originated from the Greens, and - thank God - 14 of those were voted out."
"It takes a certain kind of sheer nerve to muster the whole of Luxembourg's press in order to give them to believe that this report would bear the stamp of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, whereas it in fact saw the light of day in consequence of an agreement between the rapporteur and the three largest groups in this House."
"Today, I have voted against the amendment on driving times that the Greens have put before us, my reason being that it does not guarantee the necessary flexibility and would do the drivers a disservice."
"A solution as inflexible as this one would in fact not permit those who have to drive at a great distance from their base to apportion their rest periods in such a way as to allow them to spend more time with their families and friends."
"I welcome the opportunity given to us at first reading to make a sensible contribution to a regulation on social provision that is clearer, safer, and more controllable."
"I hope that, from 2004, the digital tachograph will prevent black sheep from finding new boltholes!"
". (FR) First of all I would like to express my satisfaction with the report by Mr Markov supporting the Commission proposal of October 2001 for a new regulation on road transport."
"This report includes in particular the improvements made by the new regulation to the current situation, with the dual objective of increasing road safety and improving working conditions for drivers."
"Measures such as removing the possibility of dividing breaks, extending scope, increasing penalties for infringing the regulation, which are measures that appeared in the Commission proposal and are reiterated in the report, represent important milestones."
"The Markov report reinforces the regulation further, for example, by opposing the creation of a flexible week through the introduction of a limit on working time, by setting a fixed driving time or encouraging the participation of the social partners."
"I would particularly like to highlight the importance of the measure aimed at extending the scope of the regulation to all lorry drivers operating within European territory, whether or not they are EU nationals."
"This measure might consequently considerably reduce social dumping while encouraging third countries to strengthen their national legislation to improve working conditions for their drivers."
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)"
"Whilst this proposal was submitted in the name of safety and simplification, its contents provide for little more than further bureaucracy and regulation."
"We are particularly concerned about the effect that these measures would have on minibuses operated by the voluntary and non-commercial sectors."
"Whilst the British government has expressed an intention to apply for a national derogation within this area, it is our opinion that the interests of the voluntary sector are best protected by the existing exemptions."
"Changes to rest requirements and driving times will severely reduce the ability of schools and coach companies to offer trips abroad at an economically viable rate."
"These proposals impose further burdens on an industry that is already heavily regulated, yet the Commission fails to provide any cost-benefit analyses to justify its arguments."
"The British Government has described many of these proposals as being either unnecessary or disproportionate to any benefit."
"We are happy to support this line and trust that they will act accordingly when these measures are considered by the Council."
"Decisions on safety are usually preceded by fatal accidents."
"Other considerations are all given priority until regulation becomes unavoidable, and then the emphasis is on freedom for business, limiting costs and free competition."
"Yet everyone knew beforehand that allowing professional drivers to drive too long would result in accidents."
"Unfortunately that has never stopped people in this industry from being allowed to work for longer consecutive periods than in other industries where less harm can be caused."
"Businesses want to avoid taking on a second driver and avoid waiting times at all costs, as these measures cost money."
"What is more, drivers want to be protected against overworking and overtiredness, but they also want to get home quickly after a long trip."
"Self-employed drivers even believe that they are exempt from the regulations, and businesses who want to exploit this have sold their lorries to their drivers."
"If we give in to such counterforces, honest hauliers and the railways will be driven out of business."
"Getting all lorries and courier services that drive within the EU, even those driven by self-employed drivers or those from outside the EU, to comply with the standard of not less than 12 hours' rest a day and working not more than 9 hours a day and 90 hours over two weeks is therefore an important step in the right direction."
"We were happy to vote for the Markov report."
"At a time when efforts are being made both at European and national level to adopt measures to reduce the number of road accident victims - an area in which Portugal unfortunately tops the list - it would be very hard not to agree with a report which aims to improve the social and working conditions of drivers engaged in road transport."
"The report we have now approved considers measures that are undeniably positive: removing the proposal for a flexible week; imposing limits on driving time and working hours; setting a minimum age for drivers engaged in the carriage of goods; limiting possible derogations; increasing the involvement of Europe's social partners; and encouraging the extension of these regulations to cover all drivers on the EU's roads."
"These measures deserve our approval, given that they will make a serious contribution to improving road safety."
"However, we very much regret that a majority of Members of this House did not support the rapporteur's proposal to reduce weekly driving time to 45 hours."
"We nevertheless hope that the Commission and the Council will be sufficiently open-minded towards the amendments that have now been adopted."
"Mr President, in 1990, as Parliament's rapporteur on what became the Maastricht report, I urged the establishment of what we now know as the 'Committee of the Regions'."
"I did so because local authorities in regions play a vital role in implementing European law."
"Given that role, I felt it was right that they should have a say in the adoption of European law."
"The Napolitano report takes that principle and moves it forward in the context of today's Europe."
"I welcome what Mr Napolitano has argued for in terms of the higher status of regions and local authorities in European decision-making."
"But I also accept that he is right to do that in a non-prescriptive way that does not interfere with the internal constitutions of the Member States."
"By making a case for the regions but leaving it to the individual Member States to decide how to implement his recommendations, he has struck the right balance."
"For example, we have just heard an argument for regions to be involved in the Council of Ministers."
"I support that argument, but each Member State must do that in the context of its own constitution."
"Finally, the one weakness in the Napolitano report is that it has not given enough emphasis to the role of regions with legislative authority."
"I hope that the Commission will look at that and find a way of engaging them more coherently in EU activities."
"Mr President, like other speakers, I am glad that in relation to the Napolitano report we have moved forward on some important points."
"It is recognised that, in appropriate constitutional circumstances, regions will have access to the Court of Justice."
"It is recognised rather clearly and in good terms that the principle of subsidiarity is iterative and applies down the line, not just between the Union of the Member States, but to the regions and local authorities as well."
"There are some points I regret. I particularly regret that the opportunity was not taken to comment about the odd composition of the Committee of the Regions."
"In future, for example, it seems probable that there will be five Members from Malta in the Committee of the Regions, as against 21 from Spain and 24 from the United Kingdom."
"That means that there will likely be five times as many Maltese as Galicians in the Committee of the Regions, if any Galicians get there at all - or Catalans or Scots."
"This is not a satisfactory situation."
"The Committee of the Regions is supposed to counterbalance the Parliament."
"The balance of populations and regions on the Committee of the Regions is not at all a reasonable one."
"This report will not convince those in my party at home who think that being an independent Member State would be better than being a constitutional region, as things stand."
"Mr President, last night, I dreamed about Mr Napolitano too."
"Mr Napolitano, who is the rapporteur of this document on the role of the regional authorities, was the President of the WUR - the World Union of Regions - in my dream."
"Already, since, in my dream, a single world government had been established made up of the regions, the individual States no longer existed and the regions had assumed such importance as to form, all together, a worldwide association, the WUR - the World Union of Regions - with Mr Napolitano as President."
"I know that this is only a dream and that the dream is unlikely to come true, but since these regions had ceased to fight with each other, as, I regret to say, some States still do now, it is my hope and desire that, step by step, as per the Napolitano report, we will genuinely achieve the WUR, the World Union of Regions."
"I therefore voted for the motion."
"Mr President, I voted for the report, although I am quite aware that this is not a decisive document but just a recommendation and we do not know how it will be received."
"I hope that the Commission and the Member States take into consideration many of the points adopted, although I must lament the fact that some fundamental parts have been rejected, such as those providing for the participation of regions with legislative powers in the European Union's Council of Ministers."
"I feel that this is an area in which, in any case, it is for the Member States to decide."
"My political party has already supported amendments and legislative proposals to that effect in Italy, and I hope that the European regions will be able to have more influence, notwithstanding the fact that this matter must continue to be the competence, for the most part, of the individual States, without interference from the Union."
"Mr President, I knew that Mr Méndez de Vigo was reactionary on issues of European diversity, but I did not know that he was so ignorant."
"To call the concept of a people archaic not only runs counter to the fundamental principles of our civilisation, it is also contrary to many constitutions, such as that of the United States of America, which starts with the precise phrase 'We the people'."
"Mr Méndez de Vigo's statement conflicts with the constitution of the United States, and also with the views of his boss, José Maria Aznar."
"Mr President, we believe that the European Union is at present an historically unprecedented union of shared sovereignty, and the stateless nations, such as Galicia, want to make progress through their participation in these institutions, and are even working towards a kind of internal enlargement."
"What we ask is why Malta and not Galicia?"
"Why Cyprus and not Scotland?"
"Stateless nations very often have a history, a political will and a demography that justify this participation."
"Nevertheless, the Napolitano report was a step in the right direction, but it has to some extent been frustrated by the reactionary Jacobinism of people like Mr Aznar and Mr Méndez de Vigo, a Jacobinism that is now negated by the reality of the European Union itself."
"- (DA) We shall vote in favour of compromise Amendment No 30 and Amendment No 21 if Amendment No 30 is not adopted."
"We would point out, however, that the content of the amendments must not be included in a possible future European constitution but be included in a future treaty."
"The June Movement does not, in fact, wish to see a European constitution that will take precedence over the national constitutions."
". (ES) This Parliament has just missed a great opportunity to act in accordance with its role as representative of the peoples of Europe as laid down in the Treaties."
"Firstly, and this is the most serious thing, because by approving amendment by Mr Méndez de Vigo - whose 'care' has been noted - we are depriving the European peoples of their capacity as holders of some of the Union's legitimacy, which, in accordance with the philosophy of the Treaties, they are entitled to."
"Secondly, because the final text lays down that the regions with legislative powers will not be able to bring cases before the Court of Justice on their own behalf, and that they must do so with the prior agreement of the State."
"The Socialist amendment, proposing that the case should be presented through the intermediary of the State, was not much better."
"Thirdly, nor are these regions explicitly guaranteed the right to participate in Councils of Ministers which deal with matters falling within their competence, leaving this capacity to arbitrate to the respective governments whose lack of political will in relation to this issue is, in the majority of cases, including Spain, notorious."
"The Napolitano report, however, still contains some very positive aspects and I have therefore decided to vote in favour of it tomorrow."
"We agree with regionalisation and with the idea of strengthening the role played by regional and local authorities within the constitutional framework and within sovereign decision-making processes in each Member State. For that reason, we support those aspects that the report emphasises in this respect."
"For the same reason, we think it is important that there should be a forum at EU level, and indeed one already exists, the Committee of the Regions, for exchanging experience on the work of these authorities and to provide them with a means of presenting their views at EU level on matters relevant to them."
"Nevertheless, although some positive amendments have been adopted, the Napolitano report is still inspired by the more or less explicit objective of trying to create direct links between the institutions of the European Union and regional and local authorities, thus bypassing the Member States' sovereign decision-making powers. We cannot agree with this, because internal organisation is a matter for the Member States alone, especially when it comes to how decisions are made."
"So, although we agree with reinforcing the role of the regions, we reject any federalist approach that aims to circumvent the sovereignty of the Member States of the European Union."
"I would like to congratulate Giorgio Napolitano on his excellent and timely report on the role of regional and local authorities in the building of Europe, which I support. I particularly support the need for the Union to find new ways for regional and local authorities to participate in Community activities without neglecting the important role of the Committee of the Regions."
"I also very much support the need to ensure that regional and local authorities are involved when Community policies and legislative acts are being conceived and drawn up, as it is most often those authorities that are responsible for implementing such policies and acts. Nevertheless, I believe that these links should be established at the level of individual Member States."
"I very much support Mr Napolitano's desire for consolidation of Article 299(2) of the EC Treaty, which concerns the outermost regions."
"It is certainly necessary to take steps so as to allow us to take full advantage of the scope for action provided for in the current provisions governing the outermost regions, thus making it possible to put into practice a genuine Community policy for the outermost regions, a policy genuinely committed to overcoming the limitations imposed by their location."
"The Committee on Constitutional Affairs believes that the hierarchical and pyramid-like structure of the EU's institutional system should be abandoned in favour of a system involving regional and local authorities more in Europe's decision-making process."
"One of the key questions addressed in this report is, quite rightly, the role of the Committee of the Regions. The report stresses the legitimacy and the vital role of this committee as an institutional partner for regional and local authorities within the framework of the Union."
"Against this background, genuine changes to the Treaties are envisaged at precisely the point when the Convention is moving forward with its work, such as granting the Committee of the Regions the right to bring cases before the Court of Justice in the event of a breach of the principle of subsidiarity - a right also to be extended to those regional and local authorities that have legislative powers - in order to protect their rights, in many cases against their own Member States."
"This, and other proposals such as the proposed addition to Article 6(3) of the Treaty on European Union, would mean that the Member States, which are the sole members of the Union, would overnight be reduced to playing a secondary role in the building of Europe, quite apart from issues of constitutionality that would doubtless be raised in some Member States."
"I was therefore forced to vote against the report, despite the fact that it included some positive proposals such as the defence of linguistic diversity and the promotion of the outermost regions."
"I generally support the diagnosis contained in this report concerning the clearly diverse nature of regionalisation and of the very concept of a region, just as I support the view that regionalisation has 'to a large extent been the result of institutional and political developments specific to each of the countries concerned'."
"Although I agree in principle about the effective existence of different traditional and specific administrative approaches in each Member State, I part company from the report when, politically speaking, it tries to relegate the Member States to a subordinate role, encouraging interference in the Member States' decision-making processes, promoting their legal and institutional fencing-in with powers being assumed by the European institutions and the regions, and advocating that the political legitimacy of the regions should be artificially equated with that of the Member States in the Treaties."
"As I see it, the attempt made in this report to water down the functions and the importance of the Member States on the grounds that it brings the people closer to the Union's institutions is tantamount to an at times covert new version of federalist opportunism. There seems to be an attempt to make us forget the inter-state approach that underpinned the creation of the Union, whilst neglecting the pivotal and vital role of the Member States as privileged vectors and actors in the process of building Europe."
"I accordingly voted against the report."
"However, one important positive point in this report is the recommendation that Article 299 of the EC Treaty, which relates to the outermost regions, should be consolidated."
"Mr Gollnisch, for your information and that of the House, there will be a debate on 29 January 2003, led by Mr Solana, on the question of Iraq regarding Mr Hans Blix's report to the United Nations."
"(The Minutes of the previous sitting were approved)"
"The next item is the Council statement on the work programme of the Greek Presidency."
"I should like, on behalf of the House, to acknowledge that Prime Minister Simitis took the time in December, before the formal launch of the presidency, to meet with the Conference of Presidents of Parliament."
"I thank him and his ministerial and public service colleagues for that meeting."
"We look forward to working closely and productively with the Greek Presidency."
"It gives me great pleasure to call upon the Prime Minister to make his opening statement."
"Mr President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I am both honoured and delighted to be here today, in my role as President-in-Office of the European Council, to present the priorities of the Greek Presidency."
"As chairman of various Councils in the past, I have been involved in proceedings with the European Parliament and have appreciated at first hand how useful and indispensable this dialogue is."
"The Greek Presidency plans to cooperate with Parliament to the maximum possible extent at all levels."
"It plans to cooperate not merely as a formality, but because cooperation is, I believe, a necessary and fundamental factor in achieving our joint objectives."
"We shall grab every possible opportunity for fruitful cooperation between us."
"Greece is one of the countries which believes that developing the European Union will help to strengthen the role and authority of the European Parliament."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this is an historic phase in the ongoing development of Europe."
"All of us, the Council, Parliament, the Commission and our citizens, are expected to help with this phase."
"To support the move towards European integration, to a Europe of the 25 and/or more Member States, a Europe constructed and developed on the basis of our common values, the values which have informed our actions over the past fifty years."
"A Europe which creates the potential for everyone to grow and prosper, which strengthens every country's society, and which promotes cohesion and solidarity."
"A Europe which, in a multipolar global system, works for peace, cooperation and justice."
"Working in this direction is not our only responsibility."
"It is important that we make these policies convincing, that we convince people that the Europe we are building is focused on caring for its nations and citizens and ensuring that everyone shares a common future in a community of values."
"The presidency's programme has not been planned solely to meet the challenge of the ongoing development of Europe; it has also been planned to meet the challenge posed by today's international economic climate, the global recession and all the sources of insecurity waiting to ambush our societies: the lack of competitiveness and stability in the economy, unemployment, social exclusion and so on and so forth."
"We need to respond to this insecurity with decisive action, to hit at the heart of individual and collective insecurity and to create a more rational, a fairer and freer living environment which offers everyone more opportunity. At the same time, we need to turn our attention to the international crises that create insecurity."
"International crises which originate in the fragile states on the fringes of the Union, international crises rooted in the Middle East, international crises caused by international terrorism."
"What we need is a Europe which has a constant presence and speaks with one clear voice on the international stage."
"Ladies and gentlemen, under the decisions taken in Seville, we were required to plan the Greek Presidency in collaboration with the next presidency, the Italian Presidency, so that an annual operational action programme could be formulated."
"We did precisely that and I should like to comment on our five main sets of priorities."
"It goes without saying that our first priority post Copenhagen is enlargement."
"We need to continue with all the basic, procedural arrangements so that the accession treaties can be signed in Athens on 16 April."
"Your role is paramount in these arrangements because the European Parliament has to assent to the accession of the new Member States."
"At the same time, we shall continue negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania in application of the new pre-accession strategy for these two countries."
"Our aim is to keep to the timetable for their accession in 2007."
"We shall be actively working on Turkey's progress towards accession."
"Greece believes that Turkey should take its place in Europe on the basis of the decisions already taken by the European Councils."
"We must give Turkey the opportunity to carry out the reforms its country needs."
"That is why the Copenhagen European Council decided to follow a strategy, a plan aimed at starting accession negotiations with Turkey."
"The next two years will be crucial here."
"Greece, both as the country holding the presidency and as a Member State, wants to help with this new process, which is why one of our objectives is to draft a new partnership agreement with Turkey."
"We also aim to develop relations with the countries of the Western Balkans, so that they can join the process and accede to the European Union at a later date."
"I should like to comment at this point on the question of Cyprus."
"We want Cyprus to join the European Union as a united country."
"We want it to overcome and resolve its political problem."
"We want the two communities to share a common future and enjoy the benefits accession has to offer."
"We felt right from the start that the Annan plan gave Cyprus a chance to resolve its political problem."
"We have been working along these lines and we hope that a solution will be found by 28 February."
"Whatever happens, Cyprus will accede to the Union, as agreed in Copenhagen, although the way will still be left clear for the Cyprus problem to be resolved and the acquis communautaire to be applied to the whole island."
"Our second priority is to reform the European economy and promote social cohesion."
"The spring summit in 2003 will be held in a political and economic climate beset with both problems and opportunities."
"The introduction of the euro last year was an historic process."
"We believe that, although progress has been made, the Lisbon strategy is now more topical than ever."
"We need to implement the economic decisions taken over recent years which we have not done enough to promote."
"This is a vital opportunity to update the European economic and social model."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we shall be working on six issues."
"First, macro-economic policy; we want a reliable European economic policy, an intergovernmental economic policy in Europe."
"Secondly, we want to create more and better jobs."
"This will help to consolidate social solidarity and cohesion."
"It is important that we review the European Employment Strategy and a debate on the subject will allow us to make more of the social pillar in the Lisbon strategy."
"Our third aim within the Lisbon framework is to encourage entrepreneurship and support small enterprises."
"The presidency sets great store by support for entrepreneurship, which is important to economic development, not to mention employment and regional development."
"Our fourth aim is to build up the European economy of knowledge and innovation, because we cannot achieve the Lisbon objectives unless we develop knowledge and technology."
"As you all know, a number of issues are still pending, such as the Community patent, and we intend to try and wrap them up."
"The presidency will also be tackling other issues, such as developing research in cutting-edge technologies, including defence research."
"Our fifth aim is to improve links within Europe, by which I mean full and operational liberalisation of the energy and transport markets, extending the trans-European energy and transport networks, promoting the single services market and unifying the financial markets."
"Our sixth aim is to safeguard future prosperity through sustainability."
"This mainly means reviewing the Union's strategy on sustainable development in the light of the outcome of the world summit in Johannesburg."
"We want to make more of the Union's leading role in environmental protection."
"So much, ladies and gentlemen, for our second set of priorities which relates to the Lisbon strategy."
"Our third set of priorities covers the sensitive issue of immigration, illegal immigration, external borders and asylum."
"We all know that immigration in one form or another has now taken on such proportions that we are forced to act."
"And we need to act in two directions."
"We need to ensure that the Union becomes a genuine area of freedom, justice and security for its citizens, free from any form of organised crime, xenophobia and racism. That it becomes a multicultural area of understanding for man's problems, that we fight the causes of problems such as poverty, falling living standards and political suppression."
"We hope here to adopt directives on the reunification of families of long-standing immigrants."
"In the asylum sector, we want to push ahead with directives such as directives on refugees."
"The second strand in our action on immigration will be to protect the Member States of the European Union from illegal immigration, share out the costs of protecting our common external borders more equitably, promote repatriation policies and speed up negotiations on readmission agreements."
"Our fourth set of priorities concerns a matter which has already taken up a great deal of our time and energy. The future of Europe."
"We believe that the enlargement of Europe should go hand in glove with greater European unification."
"Our institutional system needs efficient, democratic functions and policies which reach our citizens."
"The question is: what route will the Convention on the future of Europe take and how will this fit in with the work of the presidency?"
"As you may remember, the Copenhagen European Council decided that the Convention should complete its work before the European Council in June and that, at the spring European Council, we should focus on the institutional aspects of the future of Europe."
"So we hope to achieve three main objectives at these two Councils:"
"First, we want to carry out a review without taking any decisions, because that would prejudge the outcome of the Convention."
"Secondly, we intend to hold a substantive debate on the outcome of this work at the June Council and set the starting and/or the finishing date for the work of the new Intergovernmental Conference, because some Member States have already expressed a wish for an interim period and we will need some time between when it starts and the June summit."
"Thirdly, we want to lay down the remit for the Intergovernmental Conference; in other words we need to be prepared at the end of June for subsequent procedures as and when they start."
"Our fifth set of priorities concerns the Union's international profile and strengthening its role on the international stage."
"The European Union has proceeded in leaps and bounds with its common security and defence policy."
"What we now need is to ensure that we have full operational readiness in the crisis management sector by developing our military and non-military capabilities."
"We therefore intend to concentrate on achieving the general military objective and finalising permanent arrangements for collaboration between the ?U and ????."
"We are keen to ensure that European operations in Bosnia Herzgovina and the FYROM, which will be the first field test of the European Union's operational readiness, are properly prepared and executed."
"Over and above this defence policy, we need to examine relations with the Union's neighbours in order to ensure that no new divisions are created."
"A summit meeting with Russia is scheduled to take place in St Petersburg in May, attended by the countries of the Western Balkans, the Ukraine, the Caucasus and the Mediterranean, and we shall be attaching great importance to Mediterranean cooperation."
"We may have to deal with war with Iraq over coming months."
"We hope not."
"We want peace."
"However, we are giving this issue our utmost attention, and rightly so; it is one of our priorities."
"We want to work and we shall work for peace and a peaceful resolution to any differences."
"We trust efforts by the UN will have a positive outcome."
"The will and the resolutions of the United Nations must prevail."
"Iraq has to respect and apply Security Council resolutions."
"The presidency wants to speak for Europe as a union of countries with a common, strong voice and opinions."
"Safeguarding international stability, wiping out the threat of weapons of mass destruction and peace are common virtues; they are what we are all striving towards and the countries of the European Union need a clear common policy along these lines."
"(Applause)"
"We need to break our old habit of having different countries saying different things and seeking different objectives."
"It is not easy but we must fight for it."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to finish by commenting briefly on two or three matters of particular interest to the European Parliament."
"First, the status of MEPs."
"A great deal of work has been done and we have spent a fair amount of time discussing this."
"I think this issue is ripe for a final solution and we shall endeavour to reach a solution at the European Council in Thessaloniki."
"Secondly, the interinstitutional agreement on improving European Union legislation, which has done a great deal to improve the quality of legislation."
"We hope that there will be agreement here too during our presidency."
"Thirdly, and lastly, we shall endeavour to complete the rules on European political parties, which are well overdue."
"I have commented on a number of central issues, although there are a great many other important issues."
"There is too little time to talk about the review of the CAP, the development of the European defence industry or measures on safety at sea, which many of us are working on."
"We want the Greek Presidency to give extra momentum to the development of the Union."
"We want to strengthen every aspect of the Union and convince our citizens that Europe is close to them, that it embraces them all in a society of values and that it offers everyone a common future."
"Mr President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, I look forward to the best possible collaboration with you."
"The success of the presidency depends on it."
"The success of the European Union depends on it."
"So let us put our heads together and deal with the problems."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, Prime Minister of the Republic of Greece, ladies and gentlemen, we have just closed the chapter on that quite remarkable year, 2002, which began with the launch of the euro and ended with the decision to carry out the largest enlargement in Europe's history."
"This coming year will in many respects be equally crucial."
"In 2003, we will have to prepare to implement enlargement and we will have to carry out the institutional reforms. Above all, we must provide the new Europe with much more solid economic and social foundations."
"Prime Minister, in setting its priorities for the first six months of the year, the Greek Presidency has shown that it is keenly aware of the major challenges before us."
"This was clear throughout your speech. There is absolutely no need for me to go over the main points again - we fully endorse them: the intense focus on immigration, patents, energy and the major obstacles to lasting peace in Europe - the Balkans question and the Mediterranean question."
"I want to focus closely on these last two issues because the Balkans are a European Union issue - they are our responsibility and in our hearts - and, in the situation described by Prime Minister Simitis, whether the future holds peace or war depends on the Mediterranean."
"I also endorse the far-reaching decision by the Greek Presidency to choose peace: I endorse it and I call for unified peacekeeping measures from the countries and the European institutions."
"Before us is a unique opportunity, a huge presence of European countries in the Security Council, a European Presidency, and, most importantly, we have a public opinion which is deeply disturbed and concerned to see what war might involve and, in particular, what the consequences of war might be."
"The European governments may have had their disagreements and different perspectives in recent months, but their citizens are closely united in the desire to avoid war as far as possible."
"Of course, this does not mean that they do not have an equally strong desire to combat terrorism, to present a united front before this new threat."
"However, war is considered to be the last resort and our peacekeeping measures must therefore be strong and unified."
"We therefore feel that we are in complete harmony with the Greek Presidency and its programme for Europe, both as regards its intention to develop the work that needs to be done within the institutions on matters such as the Members' Statute and the issue of rules on parties and as regards the two major themes which were at the heart of Prime Minister Simitis' speech, enlargement and unification: we want a wider Europe but we also want a more unified Europe."
"There can be no objection to that and there is no need for clarification."
"I would now like to mention briefly the fact, following on from what Prime Minister Simitis said, that the Spring Report, the Commission's contribution to the work of the Spring Council, was adopted by the institution today and will therefore play a major part in the work of the Greek Presidency."
"We also adopted a number of related documents, most noteworthy being the report on the implementation of the broad economic policy guidelines and the general principles of a new European Employment Strategy."
"I would like to thank the Greek Commissioner, Mrs Diamantopoulou, wholeheartedly, for she really has done some absolutely first rate work in this area."
"I would now like to tell you a little more about the key points of the Spring Report, although the Commission is, as always, at Parliament's disposal should it want to organise specific debates on these important issues."
"The Spring Report is a general report which does not just outline our programme but enters into specific aspects of it."
"The Lisbon strategy seeks to achieve far-reaching economic and social renewal by the end of the decade and will be the right course for an enlarged European Union too."
"That means - and we must not forget it - that it does not lose any of its value with enlargement but actually becomes more important."
"It is the best way of delivering what concerns our citizens most - greater prosperity, better jobs, greater social cohesion and a cleaner, sustainable environment - and it is the only way of making sure that these are achieved sustainably for future generations too."
"The Spring European Council must drive forward this process in the face of the two-fold challenge of enlargement and, in particular - and this is the real problem - the continuing deterioration of economic conditions."
"We must not be discouraged by these challenges. Quite the opposite: they must spur us on to greater endeavours, for the Lisbon agenda is the best way to integrate the new Member States and boost the economy."
"The Lisbon process is already starting to bear fruit."
"In many areas, reforms are already generating growth and jobs but, and I tell you this frankly, ladies and gentlemen, much of the European Union's production potential continues to remain untapped."
"The Lisbon objectives are still within our reach, but if we do not display much greater political will from this moment onwards there is no firm guarantee that we will succeed."
"This time last year, I laid stress on the unsustainable delivery gap between agreement on policy and action to turn policy into legislation."
"Thanks to the combined efforts of Parliament, the Commission and the Council, this gap has now been reduced."
"However, a similar gap is now forming in the area of the transposition of Community directives and decisions into Member States' law."
"Thus, the problem of the practical implementation of these decisions is still partly to be resolved."
"Moreover, many of the national policy reforms which are necessary for the achievement of the Lisbon objectives still remain to be implemented."
"On the other hand, it is encouraging to see that there are Member States meeting and even exceeding many of the Lisbon objectives."
"These countries are a benchmark of world-beating performance and prove that the right policy mix can bring development on all fronts: economic, social and environmental."
"The unsatisfactory performance of some countries is holding back the overall development of the Union."
"This is why coordination at Community level is vital to encourage all the Member States to work towards the objectives that are in their own interest as well as in the interest of all the other Members of the Union. They will all benefit from macroeconomic stability, growth, more jobs and social inclusion."
"The Commission's proposals for strengthening the coordination of budgetary policy and the proposals on the employment strategy point the way forward, and I welcome the fact that the Greek Presidency shares this commitment and is determined to play its part fully."
"We will make a good team."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Lisbon strategy is an integrated strategy for sustainably boosting the European Union's economy and meeting the major medium and long-term challenges before us."
"This is why, today, in the context of our strategy, I want to highlight the importance of investment in knowledge and innovation."
"We have made it our priority for this year."
"In addition to a list of things to do, with which we are all familiar and of which everyone is quite aware, there are moments when some factors assume more importance."
"I believe that, this year, knowledge, innovation, research and education are the genuine top priorities in a European Union which is lacking in human resources, which are falling in number, and which needs there to be an improvement in the quality of these resources."
"I have to say that this observation is a result of an analysis of the policy - implemented, in some cases against their will, by some of the Member States as a result of the restrictions - to reduce, in accordance with budgetary requirements, in some cases even because of the limits we ourselves have imposed, research expenditure first of all."
"If we look at the policy of many of the Member States, this has been the result, with a shift away from the 3% we set out in the major objectives of the Lisbon process."
"We must not make this mistake: we must help each other to avoid making this mistake."
"I am speaking so emphatically, if you will, because remarkable things are happening in the world."
"Asia's capacity to absorb new technologies, the growing dynamism of the international markets, the market shares of many European countries which are eroded every year: all this means that the problem facing us is no longer theoretical but a question of our future survival, of the future balance of our economy, of preserving our wealth."
"Thus, knowledge and innovation are the driving force of sustainable development."
"Without investment and innovation, we will not achieve growth and we will not be able to maintain our present levels of prosperity."
"Many things are necessary: computers in our schools, lifelong learning, skilled, flexible employment."
"It is vital that we promote research into world-beating products and clean technologies, and we must help businesses turn knowledge into commercial opportunities."
"In my opinion, it is at precisely this last step - converting discoveries into innovation and exploiting them commercially - that European businesses fall down."
"Although the Union has made progress towards a knowledge-based economy and an analysis of the past three years is not discouraging, the fact remains that others are moving even faster and it still lags behind its main international competitors in terms of investment and performance."
"We still have far fewer researchers than the United States or Japan. Levels of public expenditure on education and research and development vary too greatly throughout the Union."
"Businesses need a dynamic environment that will stimulate this economic activity."
"Today, in Europe, such conditions are not widespread enough."
"Significantly and surprisingly - and I will give you just one statistic for this is not a theoretical discussion: we are here to take decisions - our largest companies are carrying out 40% of their research activities outside the Union."
"A startling figure."
"This is critical, for it means that researchers and resources are staying outside the Union."
"Clearly, we must invest in the future."
"We must be better coordinated and set more ambitious national targets in the fields of education, research and innovation, and we must do more to share our best practices."
"The accession of the candidate countries with their strong skills base will offer the Union enormous opportunities."
"Great emphasis has been placed on the fact that, after enlargement, these countries - those which have actually entered, having been given the political green light - will make up 20% of the population but only provide 5 or 6% of income."
"Yet this represents a 25% increase in applied scientists and engineers. In many cases, they are working in specific sectors, but once part of the European circuit, they will genuinely be able to give us great impetus."
"We must therefore make sure we are ready to absorb these human resources, to put them into circulation, to ensure that they become an active part of our economy."
"In this connection, the Commission will be launching an action plan for research and development."
"We must also as a matter of urgency address the matter of the legislative and administrative framework for the business world."
"Before I conclude, I would like, if I may, to make another personal observation."
"We can devise all the Lisbon processes we like, but if Europe does not become the centre of attraction for young talent, for the whole world, we will never achieve economic and scientific leadership."
"The United States are succeeding by using human resources from all over the world."
"Whereas our young people, who are going to the United States in ever-increasing numbers, stay there for the most part, I can tell you that the majority of Asians and Chinese - and there are currently tens of thousands of Chinese studying in the United States - go back home."
"Well then, if we do not find a way of inducing our young people to return home, if we do not build some large, top-level schools of excellence which are the symbol, the attraction of the future, which convey the impression that we are working for the future, we will never attract the young people, the best brains from the other continents, and we will never succeed in getting our own young people to stay in our continent."
"This is the crucial challenge, and this is why the Commission and I personally have called strongly for this matter to be taken up, as it must be, at the level of all the European countries, for if our young people are leaving Europe, if the situation is such that our businesses are setting up research laboratories outside Europe, particularly in the United States, I warn you that our horizons will become narrower and narrower, I warn you that, if we go on like this, all will be lost."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have clear responsibilities towards our present and future citizens and towards the whole world in this field."
"We set ourselves the target of creating a competitive, knowledge-based society based on sustainable growth."
"On our success will hang the future of the European social model too."
"We do not believe we can achieve the goals Commissioner Diamantopoulou and I set ourselves so carefully, the goals behind all politics such as social equality and class promotion - we do not believe we can do it without a knowledge-based society."
"It will also, therefore, determine our ability to honour the international commitments we made at Monterrey, Doha and Johannesburg and to implement policies which can secure peace and stability in the world."
"Mr President, Prime Minister, time and time again, the European Union has confounded the most sceptical critics with bold, resolute initiatives."
"We have achieved many goals and I know that we will continue to do so in the future, but I implore you to understand that this matter of centres of scientific excellence, of a research effort, of rules to attract laboratories, the centres of innovation, to Europe, of becoming once again the catalyst and centre of culture and science, as Europe has always been throughout the centuries, is vital for our future."
"Quite frankly, the present generations have fewer opportunities, fewer options than most of us sitting here had."
"I believe it is our duty to restore to them these options, these opportunities, for they are entitled to them and we need them too."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, our group, that of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, wishes the Greek Presidency every success ..."
"Interruption by Mr Cohn-Bendit: No, I said you were the bourgeois party ..."
"Look, whenever Mr Cohn-Bendit butts in, we lose time for debate."
"We in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats wish you every success, and you will find in us a very fair partner."
"I want to make it clear that I say this with the agreement of our Greek friends, and Mr Trakatellis will speak immediately after me."
"We think it is particularly splendid that the treaty with the countries that are to join the EU should be signed, on 16 April, in front of the Acropolis or in its immediate vicinity, that being a symbolic expression of the fact that it is at the site of democracy's foundation, Athens, that we are giving the green light to the membership of the Central European countries that have achieved democracy after the horrors of the Communist era, and before that, the years under National Socialism."
"Mr President, we are of one mind with you as far as a peaceful solution to Cyprus is concerned, and also as regards the pre-accession strategy for Bulgaria and Romania, and we have an urgent request to make of you in connection with the Balkans."
"Whilst sharing your belief that these countries must have the prospect of joining the European Union, we must always affirm - and you yourself used the word 'later' - the long-term nature of that prospect."
"For the people of the European Union will first have to cope with the accession of ten countries, to which they will have to adjust, and we may not demand too much of them, nor must we give the impression that the Balkan countries are to be added to them overnight; hence our constant reiteration that this is a long-term process."
"We wish to strongly encourage you to seize the initiative in relation to the Mediterranean region and the Barcelona process."
"I am horrified by the sight, repeated week after week, of boats sailing from Morocco in the hope of reaching the Spanish coast, capsizing under stormy conditions, and the people on them being killed."
"I regard this as unacceptable, and we have to give the countries where these people live a chance of development - not only in the context of immigration policy, but as part of helping the countries of the Mediterranean to help themselves."
"Governments themselves must also help, of course."
"Any initiative by you in this area would meet with our full support."
"Turning to the Convention, Mr Papandreou, as Foreign Minister, will of course be one of its members, and I am sure - and I hope - that we will, if he follows the examples set by others, see and hear much of him in Parliament."
"Speaking on behalf of the PPE half of our group, I can say that we want a European constitution."
"We want a European constitution, we want European democracy, we want Europe to have capacity to act, and we want it to be transparent."
"And such a Europe must rest on the foundations of the Community Europe."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we are sure that you support that too."
"We want the Convention to complete its work by the end of June and to be followed by a brief Intergovernmental Conference, so that the Italian Presidency will find us gaining a constitution for Europe."
"Let me move on to the Lisbon process. There is much truth in what has been said about this, but, Mr President of the Commission, we agree that we will only get qualified scientists to stay in Europe if we actually manage to reform our tax systems in such a way that it is again worthwhile to make investments, in such a way that Europe is a place where achievement is worth the effort, if we are willing to reform our labour laws and make them more flexible, and if we are able to change our social security systems so that they are characterised by greater self-reliance, so that subsidiarity and solidarity are intertwined."
"Such a Europe must become more competitive, and so working in it must again be made worth the effort."
"We need to encourage people to take the initiative, and, above all else, we must not make the citizen promises that the European Union is unable to keep."
"So let your coordinating efforts be directed towards tax cuts for businesses, reform of the labour market, and reform of our social security systems."
"There are two important foreign policy issues, Mr President-in-Office of the Council; Iraq is one of them."
"We must see that weapons of mass destruction are a menace and that, when they threaten us or regions of the globe, those who have them at their disposal, must relinquish them, but what we do and have to do, we do within the framework of the United Nations."
"We support your efforts towards a common European position on this issue, on the basis of action by the United Nations."
"It is not acceptable for a European government to say, 'Leave us out; no matter what the United Nations decide, we're not taking part', or for another government to give the impression of saying, 'Whatever happens, we stand alongside the United States'."
"No, any European policy must be a responsible one, and I would encourage you, and us, to go about it as Europeans, and together."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you mentioned cooperation with Russia, and in May of this year you will be travelling to a meeting in St Petersburg."
"Appalling things are currently happening in Chechnya."
"The Russian Government's unwillingness to extend the OSCE mandate in Chechnya violates the humanitarian principles that we share."
"I urge you and beg you to raise these things not only when you are in St Petersburg, that beautiful city, which is Russia's window on the world, but make it clear to the Russian Government even before you get there that we expect the OSCE mandate to be extended, that we expect this Parliament's ad hoc delegation to Chechnya, which we have decided on, to actually be allowed to travel to that country."
"Mr President, I welcome the way you have often encouraged us by referring to our values, but we will gain credibility only if we lay hold of these values not merely for ourselves in this wonderful European Union, which, taking everything into account, is democratic and in a good position both economically and in terms of human rights, but also for the people on our doorstep and throughout the world."
"That is why we have to speak in a loud voice, and I would encourage you to do just that in St Petersburg."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, during this six-month period, the Council is going to deal with five historic challenges which the President-in-Office of the Council has mentioned."
"Firstly, enlargement."
"It is a fortunate coincidence that enlargement to ten is going to be signed in Athens, the cradle of democracy; and in a country such as Greece, which will hold the next Olympic games."
"Two inventions dating back 2 500 years which are foundation stones of the current Europe."
"And the Olympics were the first organised system of peace."
"All they need is access to the airport, but work is being done on that."
"During this six months, we must finish the first phase of enlargement: the ten countries."
"And you have also mentioned some other important challenges."
"Firstly, a reunified Cyprus."
"We entirely support any action you may take with a view to supporting the policy of Kofi Annan and we believe this is a very decisive step."
"Furthermore, and you have mentioned this, for the first time, you have in your hands -and I welcome Greece's intelligent and courageous policy in relation to Turkey - the opportunity to play an historic role in terms of bringing us closer to Turkey."
"We are counting on your intelligence and flexibility."
"Secondly, the Lisbon Strategy."
"In this regard, we have seen that you insist on full employment, on technological development, on training and on social cohesion, which is an essential prerequisite for economic growth and not an obstacle."
"You have also held the Presidency of the monetary union since the middle of last year."
"In this regard, I would like to say that it is important that we increase our economic coordination."
"I am not going to ask you to employ such an interventionist and brutal policy as the United States, but it is important and necessary that Europe can be an economic driving force and end this stagnation."
"This is one of the Greek Presidency's responsibilities."
"I would also address the President of the Commission."
"Mr Prodi, why do you not propose a world-wide Socrates in order to attract brains?"
"This falls within the competence of the Commission and of course we in Parliament would support a proposal of this nature."
"In the economic chapter, the Greek Presidency has dedicated a section to maritime security, and following the drama we are witnessing of globalised shipwrecks, which are desolating our coasts - the Prestige being just one more, not the only one - I believe that the Greek Presidency must play an important role."
"You have more than half the Community's gross tonnage and plenty of experience."
"You have spoken of sustainable development and the protection of the environment."
"All of this must be integrated into a European maritime area, which could be one of the Greek Presidency's great pieces of work."
"In terms of the policy on the third pillar, especially on immigration, the Greek Presidency is the first, since Tampere, to propose a proactive policy and not just a repressive one."
"In this regard, you can rely on Parliament in terms of the proposals you are going to make and I believe that, in this field, the Greek Presidency is showing the right way."
"With regard to the future of Europe, the Convention has passed its half-way point - as President Giscard d'Estaing reminded us in an article which has appeared today in the press."
"Under the Greek Presidency, we want the Convention to prepare a draft Constitution."
"In this regard, both the work of our colleague, Mr Giorgos Katiforis, in completing the social dimension, and of Georgios Papandreu, as an addition to the Presidium of the Convention, are important."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you must defend the Community method, which has allowed us to come this far, and which can inspire and organise our future."
"We would also ask you to carefully study the timetable for the inauguration of the European Parliament, so that we can carry out our investiture of the Commission correctly and in a manner which is agreed amongst all of us."
"Finally, Mr President, with regard to external relations, I would like to say that a war with Iraq can be prevented, that the European Union must speak with one voice and that we await with interest the result of the meeting you are going to hold in Brussels with Hans Blix, the head of the inspectors."
"You have a very important job: to coordinate four members of the Security Council, plus one candidate, and everything possible must be done so that, within the multilateral and civilised framework of the UN, we can make progress and prevent a war which is not only unnecessary, but also extremely dangerous, and so that we can impose the principles of international law."
"In this regard, Mr President-in-Office, and I will end here, please also continue an active policy in the Middle East."
"It is very important, everything is related, and you are our border with that region."
"It is essential that we are able to re-launch the Middle East peace process."
"On behalf of the Socialist Group, I would like to offer you our support and I thank you for mentioning the Statute for Members of Parliament and parties, which is a sign of Greek capacity and wisdom."
"I wish you lots of luck."
"Mr President, I have heard it said that there is nothing left for the Greek Presidency, other than providing the after-sales service for Copenhagen. Nothing could be further from the truth."
"The Greek Presidency will have a key role in the birth of a reformed and enlarged European Union."
"But to ensure a smooth birth a good midwife is essential and I am pleased to see that the Greek Presidency seems well prepared to play that role."
"With regard to the reform of the Union, the Convention is due to report in Thessaloniki."
"As every good midwife knows, it is important to keep pushy relatives out of the delivery room and while the discussions in the Elysée Palace tonight will be important, they must not dictate the outcome of that Convention."
"It is also important to ensure that the baby is not strangled at birth by Member States fearful of an ambitious constitutional Treaty."
"I would therefore take issue with the President-in-Office and say we should not have a lengthy interim period."
"We need a short IGC, which should be a tidying-up exercise to ratify quickly the outcome of the Convention quickly."
"2003 will be the year when politicians must sell enlargement to the voters."
"Nine out of ten of the new countries will have referenda between March and September this year."
"We need to put far more effort into making the case for a 'yes' vote in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe than we have put recently into convincing citizens in our current Union that Europe is a 'good thing'."
"Liberal Democrats in this House and beyond are committed to campaigning in the new countries to make sure that we get a 'yes' vote and we call on others to join us."
"We hope in particular that the Greek Presidency can use its privileged relationship with many on the island of Cyprus to ensure that a united island joins our Union."
"Time is short, but recent developments, both on the island and in Ankara, have created a window of opportunity and I hope that you, Mr President-in-Office, will work with all parties to craft a compromise."
"I welcome the generous aspirations that you have expressed today in that regard."
"If the European Union is to succeed, however, for its current citizens and its new ones, it will need reform."
"As we approach the third anniversary of the ten-year Lisbon strategy, it has to be said that progress to date on productivity, growth, employment, investment, research and development has been disappointing."
"The continued economic slow-down is making structural reform more, not less, urgent and governments should not be deflected from the goals they set themselves."
"It will be important for the presidency to reaffirm commitment to a reformed Stability Pact, to focus on the underlying deficit, to give the Commission the power to issue early warnings to countries in danger."
"It will also need to stick to the timetable for the Financial Services Action Plan, which has already shown dangerous slippage, and to secure approval of the takeover bids directive."
"If you want someone to help you along this path, why not give the European Parliament more of a role in the follow-up to the decisions of the Spring Councils, in holding the Council accountable for the decisions that are taken?"
"That is something we would do very well."
"Europe is of course though far more than a common market and your presidency recognises this."
"The Amsterdam and Nice Treaties have created a Community of values."
"I welcome the emphasis in your presidency's statement on the values of a generous, outward-looking and civilised society."
"You speak in your document of a planned legal immigration policy."
"Exposed as you are on Europe's southern and eastern flanks, you see the importance of understanding a little more and condemning a little less."
"The fact is that, as long as we keep out their produce and deprive them of the hope of economic development, we will take the people of the developing countries to the south and the east."
"We need many of them to deal with the problems of an ageing population here, or the brain drain problems the Commission President referred to."
"Let us work to close the back door to illegal immigration more effectively by offering legal opportunities to those wishing to settle here and integrating them properly in our society."
"I had a great deal to say about Iraq and the Middle East peace process as well, but my time is running short."
"I would, however, say that the Greeks are well acquainted with what we in the rest of Europe understand by the word 'marathon'."
"You take the baton from the last runner, Denmark, and try and cover as much ground as possible as quickly as possible, before handing it over to the next presidency."
"We wish you good speed in the marathon that you are running on our behalf."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, it is to you, Mr President of the Council, that I wish to express my group's emphatic support for your initiative towards resolving the hostilities with Iraq by diplomatic means."
"There must be no war with Iraq."
"The public do not want one, and this is where the EU - as many Members of this House have said, and this is something I want to endorse - must put all its political weight into the balance, and it must be united in doing so."
"Statements, such as that made by the German ambassador to the UN, to the effect that no second resolution by the Security Council would be needed to give legitimacy to an attack on Iraq by the USA, are counter-productive."
"Fortunately, the Greek Presidency of the Council is taking the opposite line."
"You have our entire support in your efforts to prevent war, in the teeth of the Bush administration's declared intentions."
"That employment, economic, and social policies rank high on the Greek agenda is another thing that earns our high regard, but, especially in view of the spring summit, what matters is what we do about them."
"The social pillar does indeed need to be strengthened to a perceptible degree, the EU must give its attention to the public's concerns and needs, and, above all else, press on with effective measures to counter mass unemployment and social exclusion within its borders."
"Most of all, the Member States must be willing to counteract the looming economic crisis in Europe."
"It is willingness to reform the Stability Pact that we regard as the litmus test in this regard."
"Be bold enough to do it!"
"Let public investment at last be removed from the Stability Pact's calculation basis, preventing a socially irresponsible policy of cutting back until there is nothing left from making a difficult economic situation even worse, or even - as President Prodi has just warned us - leaving education utterly unable to compete."
"In conclusion, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I wish to endorse your objective of speeding up the Convention's reforming work."
"This is another area where the public interest demands that tangible progress be made, especially towards creating social Europe."
"My plea to you, and to your foreign minister as a new member of the Convention, is that you should insist on definite results in this issue in particular."
"Thank you Mr President."
"The Greek Government is assuming the presidency of the European Union at a time of great international uncertainty."
"UN inspectors in Iraq are due to report back to the United Nations Security Council at the end of the month with their findings as to whether or not Iraq is in possession of weapons of mass destruction."
"No one can judge what will be in this report, but the military build-up of American and British troops in the Middle East is certainly an ominous sign that conflict in Iraq is a very real possibility."
"I welcome the recent comments of Prime Minister Simitis, when he stated that the United Nations is the forum that must be used to address the issues raised in the UN inspectors' report on Iraq."
"It is very important that the United Nations is the organisation that deals with international security issues."
"International global security is best dealt with multilaterally under the auspices of the UN, not unilaterally, and I welcome the objective for Prime Minister Simitis to secure a common European Union position on Iraq when the UN inspectors' report is published."
"This is certainly a very ambitious political objective but I fully support it and I am sure the majority of Members of this House do as well."
"The European economy is not performing very well at present and the Greek Presidency is correct to accelerate the Lisbon Process."
"We need to make European businesses more competitive; more support mechanisms must be put in place to assist small- and medium-sized enterprises."
"The Greek Presidency is also making illegal immigration in Europe a priority."
"When it comes to protecting the borders of the European Union, a common approach is needed at EU level."
"Certainly we are going to have to reform under the EU Convention how we legislate for issues such as immigration, asylum, refugees, displaced persons and European visas."
"As has been mentioned, the Convention will now be reporting to European governments during the Greek Presidency of the Union."
"Members of the Convention plan to have the draft new European Union Treaty ready for the Greek meeting in June in Thessaloniki and liaising with members of the Convention and preparing this new Treaty are certainly going to be very important for the Greek Presidency."
"As a result of the decisions taken at the Copenhagen Summit last December, accession treaties for the new Member States joining the Union are to be signed on 16 April."
"These treaties are being prepared and referenda will then be held in the applicant states."
"It is very clear that there are wide-ranging and diverse issues that will have to be addressed by the Greek Presidency of the European Union."
"The spectre of a conflict in Iraq hangs over us all like the sword of Damocles and that is something that we all need to have in mind."
"In conclusion, I wish the Greek Presidency every success and would like to say, on behalf of my political group, that we will be more than willing to cooperate with them fully in the interests of the European Union as a whole."
"Mr President, kalispera, the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities would also like to welcome the Greek Presidency."
"Greece was the cradle of democracy."
"That means you have a special duty to give the EU a democratic overhaul."
"This is our advice. Open up all meetings in which you debate laws."
"Make all the minutes from meetings available."
"Give the European Parliament and the national parliaments access to all papers from the Council's working parties."
"Prepare complete registers of correspondence in the Council."
"Introduce public access to documents according to the principle of best practice among the countries."
"Place all agendas and minutes from the Council's working parties on the Presidency's web site."
"Give the Ombudsman a new statute, giving him or her access to everything for monitoring purposes."
"Give the Court of Auditors the access required for monitoring both the Commission and the organisations that use EU funds."
"Retain the rotating Presidency so that each country has six months in which to pull out all the stops."
"Keep the EU and the military separate and prepare reforms of agriculture, the structural funds and the budget so that we are ready to receive the new countries."
"Also, let Greek hospitality be accompanied by efficient organisation so that we can follow the work on your as yet unfinished web site and are able in six months to say what a jolly good Presidency Greece's was."
"The next few years, and certainly the next few decades, will be of great significance to all European people, but primarily to the European Union."
"The Greek Presidency must therefore not simply be allowed to be the umpteenth routine presidency."
"After all, Greece is, more than any other country in Europe, best placed both from a political and historical point of view to use the presidency to readdress the issue of the absurdity of Turkey's candidature."
"I will say it again now: Turkey is not a European country, it does not belong to our European community of peoples, either geographically or historically or as far as its socio-economic situation and culture are concerned."
"It goes without saying that we must maintain the very best relations with our Turkish neighbours, and that we can maintain the best possible trading and other relations where applicable."
"To give this country a prospect of acceding to the European Union is, however, complete madness."
"It will throw the door wide open to a massive tidal wave of immigration, and will in particular fundamentally change the nature of the European Union itself, a union that with the best will in the world will not be able to call itself European any more."
"The Greek Presidency is being given an historic opportunity here."
"Take the initiative, for example, or suggest holding a referendum on Turkey's candidature in all our European countries."
"Why should the electorates of democracies not have their say on something that is so crucial to our very existence?"
"If you do not, my party in Flanders will turn the European elections in 2004 into a referendum on Turkey's accession."
"It is striking that the German Christian-Democrats are also more or less announcing the same thing."
"If the Greek Presidency fails to take this opportunity - which will probably be the case - you will be taking on a very great responsibility, and the Turkish question may become a divisive element that could bring the house of Europe crashing down around our ears."
"Mr President, I would like to welcome both the President of the Council and the President of the Commission here this afternoon."
"I want to talk specifically about jobs, competitiveness and the internal market."
"I have a particular interest in that as the Parliament's rapporteur for the internal market strategy: if all goes well my report will be voted on in February and will be presented to you as a basis for action in the Economic Summit."
"Both of the Presidents have a crucial responsibility to the global economy over the next six months."
"Colleagues around the chamber have been quoted, and indeed Mr Simitis was quoted in the Financial Times yesterday, as saying that 'we are in a global recession'."
"I hope he was wrongly quoted, because as far as I know, we are not."
"Growth is slowing down, but stimulating and restoring that growth will be crucial to the responsibilities of both Presidents over the next six months with that Economic Summit at the centrepiece."
"I am concerned that neither of your statements, Presidents, mentioned the fact that the foundation of economic growth in the European Union has to be the completion of the internal market, in spite of the fact that this is the tenth anniversary."
"We have had major reports from the Commission showing the benefits of the internal market and we also know that the principal engine for job creation in markets of the future is going to be jobs in the service economy."
"The biggest project that is coming forward to all of you is the completion of the internal market for services, and the barriers to companies setting up across the European Union are amply demonstrated by the work the Commission has done."
"I want to ask you, President of the Council, to put on your agenda a determined effort by all Member State governments to clear out the difficulties of establishing businesses across the European Union."
"You do not need to wait for the Commission to take that initiative to create jobs and move the European economy forward, we look to you to do it."
"Mr President, my thanks go to Greece for an excellent presentation and for highlighting some delicate matters."
"Recently, actually since the autumn, it has been mainly the issues of enlargement and the Convention that have been the focus of attention at EU level."
"In its presentation Greece mentioned some well-chosen issues it intends to address over the next six months."
"Unfortunately, however, we cannot cure all the ills of the world even though we might want to."
"We should also be as good as our word with regard to improving European competitiveness, something that was endorsed at Lisbon."
"Things have, however, gone the opposite way."
"The United States of America has rushed off even further into the distance."
"There is barely any eye contact anymore."
"If there is, the Americans come whistling past one lap of the circuit ahead of us whatever the event, to use a sports image."
"In view of this I would ask Greece what it really intends to do during its presidency to put its own house in order also, to fulfil the Lisbon objectives?"
"Does it intend to make the economic reforms insisted on by the Commission, and which Mr Prodi also mentioned here at the start, and, if so, working to what sort of timetable?"
"If Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Germany keep to their commitments we can really talk about a Lisbon strategy and improvements in our competitiveness, but if that should not be the case, we might as well wipe our backsides with the Lisbon Declaration and say goodbye to European competitiveness."
"Mr President, resolution 1441 firstly calls for effective weapons inspections in Iraq, and secondly for the discussion of the weapons inspector's report in the Security Council at the end of January, and only thereafter for any new steps to be taken."
"These steps must be based on a new UN resolution and must concentrate on eliminating any problems encountered."
"That is the view in the European countries where the vast majority of our people, as Mr Prodi said, is against a war in Iraq, and rightly so."
"Our people correctly fear that there are divisions in the international coalition against terrorism, that peace negotiations will be disrupted, that the sorely needed democratisation of the Middle East will be wrecked, followed by substantial repercussions for our economies, not least in the poorest countries that do not have their own crude oil."
"At this historic moment our Group of the Party of European Socialists is asking the Greek Presidency to clearly state that this is also the position of the European Union."
"We are now asking for leadership from Europe, so that Europe speaks with one voice."
"We must do our utmost to prevent war in Iraq and at the same time engage in serious peace negotiations in the Middle East."
"The two-state solution must really be carried through now."
"Europe must not hesitate to deploy all its diplomatic and economic resources to achieve this."
"We pride ourselves on our capacity for conflict prevention and humanitarian aid, and rightly so."
"We operate with a broad security concept, and rightly so, and realise that prevention is much better."
"Time after time, Europe has emphasised the importance of the multilateral approach via the Security Council."
"Confronted with incessant statements about a war that is all but unavoidable, it is of great importance that the Council and the Commission side with Parliament."
"Maximum pressure should, of course, be brought to bear on Saddam via the Security Council, but we must also make every effort to prevent war."
"We call on President Bush to take the desire of our peoples for peace seriously and not to sow dissent in the international coalition against terrorism, and therefore to fight together for a peaceful and a more stable world."
"Mr President, the ambitious but nonetheless realistic programme of the Greek Presidency, which aims to breathe new life into basic policy areas of the European Union is, unfortunately, already overshadowed by the threat of war with Iraq, a war which has galvanised international public opinion which, as the President of the Commission pointed out, is not divided."
"Nor, would I say, is it divided in the United States where, as we know, two-thirds of the people oppose this war."
"We are talking about a war which is both pointless and destructive, as members from all sides of this House have pointed out."
"However, the main brunt of any military attack will be borne by the Iraqi people themselves, who have been suffering under the economic embargo for years now."
"A military conflict will completely wipe out any hope of combating poverty, hunger, child malnutrition and the lack of medical care; these are the problems which the millions of people who are victims of an autocratic regime and a harsh western policy have to live with."
"The twelve-year embargo has itself operated as a weapon of mass destruction; it has cost the lives of one million people, half of whom were children."
"Anyone in any doubt need only visit the hospitals in Iraq, where children are dying of malnutrition and a lack of rudimentary medical care."
"I have seen them with my own eyes."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have a saying in Greece; you see who the good captains are in a storm and the European Union is fortunate to have at its helm a very able captain and an equally efficient crew, who have clearly demonstrated their courage, combined with caution, efficient management of national and European affairs and an inspired foreign policy which has made Greece a pole of stability in the problematic Balkan area, a pole that promotes dialogue and the resolution of differences by peaceful means."
"I am positive that the Greek Presidency will meet the challenges and play its historic part."
"Mr President, I should like to welcome the Greek prime minister and wish him every success."
"We all know that Greece is a relatively small country."
"No one expects any miracles."
"But they do expect the right approach."
"This is not the first Greek Presidency; there have been two previous presidencies, both of which left themselves open to a great deal of criticism."
"However, the previous presidencies held by the same party, PASOK, when Andreas Papandreou was prime minister, did leave us one useful legacy: a fighting stance, which often went against the grain, on the question of peace."
"I trust that this positive trend, which is demonstrated both by our country as a whole and its ruling party, will continue today, especially on the question of Iraq."
"As the chairman of the Greens quite rightly said, you cannot hide behind the Security Council."
"With four members in the Security Council, the European Union should be fighting to block a war."
"I listened very closely to the prime minister's speech and I should like to comment on three points which worry me."
"First, the fact that the prime minister said that this is a joint annual programme of the Greek and Italian presidencies."
"In my opinion, Mr Simitis is - and needs to be - one thing, and Mr Berlusconi is another, and I fail to see how they will find any common ground on social issues, on democratic issues, on the issue of relations with the USA or on media issues."
"A second point which worries me is that agricultural policy - and I am thinking here of small family-run holdings, especially in the south, being squeezed by reforms and by what is happening in the World Trade Organisation - warranted no more than one line at the end of the prime minister's speech."
"I expect him to refer to this at greater length in his next speech."
"And the third point has to do with social issues."
"Mr Prime Minister, I am waiting for Greece to apply Directive 70/1999 on fixed-term work."
"It should have started applying this directive on 10 July 2002 but has yet to do so."
"Please do not put Mrs Diamantopoulou in the unenviable position of having to institute proceedings against Greece before the European Court."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, you, Mr President of the Council, concluded your remarks with a brief discussion of European defence policy."
"You observed that the agreement between NATO and the European Union has now come into being, thus leaving the way open for the next European defence policy measures, which we can expect to be taken in Bosnia-Herzegovina."
"This is an eventuality to which particular attention must be drawn, as the European Union will then, for the first time, be taking on responsibilities in defence in a visible way."
"This leads me to put two questions, the first of which has to do with how this defence policy is to develop in future."
"Do you share the view that the constitutional treaty currently under negotiation should include an article stipulating a mutual defence commitment, comparable to the corresponding article in the treaty on the Western European Union?"
"That would be an expression of confidence when we take joint action."
"Secondly, you also, very briefly, addressed the area of armaments policy, alluding to the way in which the countries of the European Union spend EUR 150 billion on defence, whereas we are always being told that the excessive duplication resulting from this means that efficiency is minimal."
"Do you share the view that a common market in defence needs to be created?"
"What definite steps will the Greeks take during their presidency of the Council?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, much has been said about policy relating to Iraq, to most of which I do not need to add anything, but I would like, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, to address two remarks to you."
"There appears to be broad agreement in this House that Resolution 1441 does not automatically result in military action, but rather that, in the light of the weapons inspectors' reports, any further action must be subject to a resolution by the Security Council."
"It is important that the presidency should also say this on behalf of the EU, and so I ask you to take the initiative by stating this here and now."
"That you should do so is made all the more important by the powerful impression that the United States of America takes a different view, and we do indeed need to state what our differences with them are."
"They do indeed believe - and how else is the deployment of 100 000 troops in the region to be explained? - that Resolution 1441 does not exclude the possibility of immediate military strike action, but there is also the implicit danger that international law, to which nations are subject, and by which alone world peace can be guaranteed on a long-term basis, will be jeopardised by unilateral power-seeking on the part of one UN member state."
"This is where the European Union has to state its position in clear terms, the primary reason for this being that international law cannot be enforced in an arbitrary and opportunistic way."
"In the case of North Korea, against which there is a mass of evidence that it is desirous or capable of producing weapons of mass destruction - and its actions suggest that this is the case - negotiations are in progress, and yet it is Saddam Hussein who is threatened, despite the presence of a host of inspectors in his country, who have found nothing."
"I might add that this threat is not justified under the UN Charter."
"Bringing this difference between us into the open is one of the primary tasks of the European Union and of its Greek Presidency, and I know that you are determined to do this."
"You can count on the support of the Group of the Party of European Socialists in this House!"
"Mr President, in wishing the Greek Presidency well, I appeal to it to make every effort to address the grave problem of falling farm incomes."
"I make this appeal as someone who has spent his whole life in agriculture and rural development in one way or another."
"We have here in Europe a unique model of family farming which, with falling incomes, is now under serious threat."
"In the context of the mid-term review proposals due to be adopted this week and the forthcoming world trade talks, I appeal to the Greek Presidency to work towards continued commitment at EU level for the European agricultural model and to guarantee a decent livelihood for our farmers."
"The reluctance of young people to take up farming as a career is evidence of the problem within agriculture."
"Unless we address the very serious problem of the declining age profile in European agriculture, in the not too distant future Parliament will be sitting in an emergency session to address what has turned out to be a very serious problem."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, taking the helm of the European Union for six months is a major challenge for any country, and that is true, Mr Simitis, of your Greek Presidency as well."
"The five priorities that you have enumerated and set yourself are, politically speaking, not merely a matter of logic but also of necessity."
"The list does not sound particularly sensational, but, as you will already have gathered from the speeches here in the European Parliament, a number of these topics carry within themselves the seeds of potential tensions, both within the European Union and beyond its borders."
"The smouldering Iraq crisis, along with America's continuing deployment of troops in this region and the divergent views on this emanating from London, Berlin and Paris, demand sensitive handling."
"What I would ask the Greek Presidency in this regard is what measures they contemplate taking in order to perhaps get the EU to have a single line on this issue."
"My second question has to do with enlargement, and, in particular, with your strategy in relation to Turkey."
"In Copenhagen, Turkey was given a specific date, and the prospect of the commencement of accession negotiations, subject to its fulfilment of the Copenhagen criteria by that deadline."
"This is a considerable obstacle to surmount, and it is at present far from clear that Turkey will be able to meet these conditions."
"Quite apart from that, I believe that it is wrong to be always offering Turkey only an either/or choice and not the option of a privileged special relationship, a perhaps far more rewarding prospect, and one that has already been addressed in a report by Mr Brok."
"The question I have in this context relates to Greek strategy towards Turkey."
"There is a third point, and this is something to which I would like to give favourable mention."
"Your declaration of belief, in the chapter on energy policy, in the establishment of common rules on nuclear safety is something that I very much welcome."
"Do you think this has a real chance of being more widely accepted in the Council?"
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, it is only right that much should have been said about Iraq, which is very much a live issue."
"I would nonetheless like to touch upon a topic that is not a live issue - at any rate, not at the moment - by which I mean the situation in the Balkans."
"You have announced a sort of Integration Summit in Saloniki, with the intention of opening up for the Balkan countries the road that leads to the European Union, and I regard that as highly meritorious, although we must not be deluded."
"Even today, there are manifestations of crisis, and there has been a recent recurrence of gunfights in Sandzak."
"We know that neither the situation in Yugoslavia - now Serbia and Montenegro - nor that in Kosovo have really been resolved to the satisfaction of all parties."
"This leads me to see it as important that the Greek Presidency, and of course the EU as a whole, should send out signals to the Balkan countries to the effect that a way is open for them to join the European Union, a difficult and lengthy way though it may be."
"We must be guided by the need for adaptation of the mechanisms for encouragement and support."
"There is a great difference between what we are currently giving to these poorest of poor countries and what we gave to the countries that are about to join us, so these instruments need to be adapted."
"The next, post-2004, Commission will have to give consideration to how to allocate responsibilities for the Balkans within itself."
"If, though, unmistakeable signals go out from Saloniki, even the Commission will be able to adapt itself as necessary."
"There is also a need for annual progress reports."
"These countries need to know when they are moving closer to the European Union, when stagnation is setting in, and when, indeed, their progress is being set back."
"All the forces in these regions need to know that the chance of moving closer to the European Union is there, but that we will monitor, very closely and country by country, whether real use has been made of these opportunities."
"Mr President of the Council, I believe that, one day in the distant future, Saloniki may well mean for this region what Copenhagen - by which I mean the 1993 Copenhagen Council - meant for the present candidate countries."
"Let the signal you send out be a bold one, one that is readily understood, and one that also awakens a sense of responsibility in these countries."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office, I too would like to speak today about enlargement, about the Convention, about Iraq and about the economic situation, but I do not have time."
"I certainly support what the chairman of my group has said."
"Before coming here, I asked the Greek Presidency if it would give priority to the issue of international maritime traffic in dangerous goods."
"I subsequently noted that the President-in-Office of the Council did in fact refer to this question."
"Maritime traffic is an important issue for Greece and it is to be expected that the Greek Prime Minister should give it priority."
"However, Mr President-in-Office, international maritime traffic has at present unfortunately fallen from grace and is associated with the situation in Galicia, the location of one of Europe's and the world's biggest disasters over the last 30 years."
"These names are all too familiar: 'Andos Patria', 'Telepolicomander', 'Orquiola', 'Cason' and 'Prestige'."
"Mr President-in-Office, like those I have quoted many of the names are Greek and most of the shipowners were or are Greek."
"There seems to be no solution and no end to the 'Prestige' disaster: our coastline and sea have been contaminated and the wreck of the 'Prestige' on the seabed still represents a continuing threat."
"The actions of the Spanish Government, of Mr Aznar's Partido Popular, have been disastrous, and the same applies to the Galician Government, while the European Union has stood on the sidelines, judging at the Copenhagen Council that five million euros would be enough to solve this problem - which is a problem for Europe as well as for Galicia and for other countries."
"The sea is now ruled by illegal and lawless mafias. Yet faced with this problem, the public, volunteers, seamen and fishermen have had to do the job of the government and of the European Union and solve this problem with their own hands, because the 'black tide' is still landing on the shores of Galicia, of the Iberian Peninsula and even of France."
"The Copenhagen European Council laid bare a serious political conflict: the Member States turned their back on the public, on the fishermen and on the volunteers who had acted so admirably."
"The Member States have neither implemented the 'Erika' legislation nor set up the compensation fund."
"This is very far removed from the attitude of the United States, where with the Oil Pollution Act they are preventing accidents and even setting up a responsibility fund of four billion euros."
"What does the Greek Presidency intend to do along these lines?"
"I believe it should distinguish itself by taking action in this area."
"Mr President, may I welcome the prime minister of Greece as President-in-Office of the European Council and sincerely wish him every success, because his success will be beneficial both to Europe and to Greece."
"He rightly stated that one of the basic objectives of the presidency is to promote the Lisbon strategy;"
"Mr Prodi also had a great deal to say about this and very important it was too."
"However, I read in the international press today that the Commission is about to submit a report which concludes that Europe is losing its battle to acquire a more competitive economy in the world by 2010."
"On the contrary, growth is very weak and the political will is lacking."
"This Commission report also states, if the Figaro is to be believed, that it expects a twin-track Europe to emerge, with Sweden and Denmark fast-forwarding on one track and Greece, Italy and France in slow motion on the other."
"What I want to ask is: first, is there a common policy for promoting the Lisbon strategy or is it a question of each country either doing what it likes or, at the very least, failing to apply any such common policy?"
"And secondly: do you intend to apply policies that will help achieve the Lisbon objectives in all the Member States of the European Union, especially Greece?"
"Mr President, the Greek Presidency has come along at a crucial time for our planet, and not just because we are on the brink of at least one armed conflict."
"It is a crucial time because the only superpower, the United States, is doing all it can to turn its tremendous power into a global hegemony and, naturally, this is provoking a reaction."
"When we emerge from these vicissitudes, the entire world - and the European Union in particular - will be a different place, regardless of the outcome of the crisis."
"What is certain is that the post-war world order and its institutions will be the victims of the conflict and a different world will emerge from it."
"The European Union needs to have a view and an opinion about this new world."
"However, I get the impression that the prevailing mood in the institutions of the European Union is one of complacency, as if what is happening has nothing to do with us."
"I get the impression that many of us believe that we are living in a vacuum, in another world, immune from what is already happening and what is yet to come."
"In times such as these, a European Union presidency has to be able to rework the values which we say we stand for into a vision of the world to come, and to persuade the people of Europe that these values are worth fighting for."
"Only with this priority will a presidency be successful and worthy of the times we live in."
"Sittings come and go."
"So do programmes."
"However, the times we live in call for a return to the values of the people of Europe, as is only proper when we are fighting for peace."
"Mr President, Mr Prime Minister, Mr President of the Commission, I have listened very carefully to the priorities you set out."
"I wish there were six instead of five, but I think that the sixth will be added in due course."
"I refer to the mid-term review of the common agricultural policy."
"The final proposals are due before the end of January."
"The European Union is already taking on ten new members."
"The rural population of the European Union will rise by 165% and rural land by 43%."
"Cultivable land will increase by 55%."
"And yet the budget up to 2013, in the best case scenario - with minimum inflation - will remain the same."
"I should like to ask you what your presidency's objectives are, Mr Prime Minister, and what you intend to do for the millions of European farmers, in both the current European Union and the enlarged European Union."
"As far as Lisbon is concerned, two of the ten years have passed and little has been achieved, far less than the 20% which should have been achieved by now."
"What is certain is that, instead of closing, the competitiveness differential between our economy and the American economy, which is our main competitor, is now even wider."
"I was both interested and delighted to see that entrepreneurship and small enterprises are one of your priorities."
"An excellent move."
"Today you announced this in an ambitious voice."
"We shall be here in about five months' time, totting up the accounts to see what has been done."
"I should like to know, Mr Prime Minister and President-in-Office, what you intend to do to achieve these ambitious objectives, which you have failed to achieve at home."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the European Commission, ladies and gentlemen, while welcoming the fact that Greece has taken over the presidency, I should like to point out that it has done so at an historic moment in the development of the unique phenomenon which we refer to as European integration and which, among other things, has replaced the post-war division of our continent."
"As regards the priorities of the Greek Presidency, as time is so short, I shall confine myself to the following brief points and comments:"
"On enlargement: the main decisions may have been taken during the previous presidency, but the final stages have yet to be completed, culminating in the signature of the accession treaties in Athens."
"Preparations still have to be made so that the new Member States can adjust smoothly to European developments, which is why enlargement has rightly been given priority and will require close attention if we are to avoid irregularities and delays in the accession process."
"I noted that you intend to continue the enhanced pre-accession strategy with Bulgaria and Romania, Mr President-in-Office, and rightly so."
"But we must not forget the southern Balkans, where rapprochement with the European Union started up some time ago under the stability and association process."
"This rapprochement needs to be encouraged here too, so that we can consolidate our relations, which we are not doing when it comes to the security and stability of the new, enlarged Europe."
"On the Lisbon strategy, I should like to focus on sustainable development."
"The need to promote a sustainable development strategy within the framework of European integration is even more urgent today, what with the pressure of enlargement and increasing globalisation."
"The plan for implementing the sustainable development strategy drawn up by the European Commission is already filling the vacuum between what we say and what we do, by way of legislation, to protect the environment and public health and encourage the application and mainstreaming of the environmental dimension in all our policies."
"That is why I think it is so important for us to adopt a step-by-step procedure for monitoring policy in practice at the spring European Council."
"The difficulties in getting the Kyoto protocol signed make it even more imperative that we step up dialogue and collaboration with the USA, Japan and developing countries."
"Obviously, the European Union cannot deal with this as an internal problem."
"So it needs to shoulder its responsibilities at international level, which means pioneering efforts to achieve sustainable development through technology and science."
"This is where I should like to focus your attention, Mr President-in-Office, because Europe has clearly started slipping behind recently, especially in biotechnology, in comparison with the United States and Japan."
"As far as defence and immigration policy are concerned, I agree."
"As you know, we have been calling for an immigration policy in the European Union for years, without any concrete results."
"We expect an integrated policy to be developed and an integrated policy on illegal immigration to be developed."
"Although illegal immigrants themselves are often living in abject circumstances, they also cause huge problems in the societies and to the people living in the Member States of the European Union."
"Measures therefore need to be taken to improve the management of our external borders and to combat illegal immigration networks and trafficking in human beings by promoting measures under the third pillar."
"I was most interested to hear you talk of readmission agreements with all our partners, especially those under serious pressure, and would ask you, please, to push ahead on this issue."
"I think the Thessaloniki Council needs to push on with the reform of the Treaties of the European Union."
"Finally, in foreign relations, I think that you need to encourage Euro-Mediterranean cooperation, basically under a long-term Euro-Mediterranean policy. Italy is to follow Greece, giving two countries with excellent knowledge of these problems the chance to draw up an efficient Euro-Mediterranean policy."
"Cooperation is not enough."
"We need a long-term policy."
"I wish you every success."
"I trust that in six months' time we shall meet here, with you reporting that you have done what you said here today, and with us ready to exercise constructive, honest criticism in good faith."
"May I wish you every success."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, honourable Members, it is a fact that Greece is taking over the helm of the European Union at a crucial turning point for the European Union, both at home and abroad."
"We are on the brink of the biggest enlargement in the history of the Union, an enlargement which puts an end to a division which has lasted fifty years."
"We are about to draft a European constitution and strengthen our institutions, in order to guarantee the continuing cohesion of Europe, even after the ten new countries have joined, and ensure that it continues to operate as a political union so that it can achieve its objective, which is greater and greater unification of the nations of Europe."
"The Convention has called for more Europe on numerous occasions and the Greek Presidency will put the finishing touches to this structure in Thessaloniki in June."
"Europe is also in the middle of a very serious downturn in the economy."
"The global economy is in recession, but that is nothing new."
"The economic depression in Europe has lasted at least ten years."
"Europe has resisted an inspired strategy, the Lisbon strategy. And now this strategy is also in danger of being washed away by the recession."
"I think that Greece, a country whose economy has recovered thanks to a programme of reform carried out on its own initiative, and a country which has achieved rates of growth putting it at the forefront of the European Union and has used this process to bring about a positive revolution in the agricultural sector, and a country which now has a first-world rather than a third-world economy, thanks also, of course, to the common agricultural policy, is now well prepared to breathe new life into the Lisbon process, which it badly needs if it is to survive."
"In addition, Greece, as a country on the borders of Europe, has always linked trade between east and west and it can do the same now; it understands better than anyone else that the economies of eastern Europe have the potential to become a driving force behind the economy of the Fifteen."
"These creative prospects cannot be reversed."
"We are not going to cancel enlargement and we are not going to stop drafting a European constitution."
"Their beneficial results, however, may be delayed if we have to deal with war with Iraq. I agree with my honourable friend Mr Poettering that nuclear weapons cannot be left in irresponsible hands."
"But nor can they be left in responsible hands, Mr Poettering. There are no hands responsible enough for these terrifying, apocalyptic weapons we have armed ourselves with."
"We do not know what is going to happen in Iraq. But we do know that the President-in-Office of the Council is the only European leader who has had the unfortunate privilege of dealing with the danger of his country's becoming involved in a catastrophic war."
"He managed to avert that war."
"I trust the experience he gained will help him do as much for the war which is threatening the entire planet as we speak."
"Mr President, I am grateful to have the opportunity to respond at the end of the debate."
"Members have raised very interesting points."
"I hope that the President-in-Office of the Council will have taken careful note and will be keen to take on board as many of them as he can."
"Until recently relations between Parliament and the Council were not extensive, but a combination of an increase in the powers of this House and the prospect of an increase in the number of Member States has had the effect of bringing our two institutions much closer together."
"On behalf of the Liberal Group I welcome this closer working relationship between Parliament and the Council."
"We see it very publicly, particularly in the Convention, and also in the number of very successful negotiations through the codecision process."
"I welcome the approach taken, first by the Danish Presidency and now continued by the Greek Presidency, to much closer working relations with this House, shown in the President-in-Office's concern that a statute for Members should form part of the successful reform of the European Union institutions."
"We look forward to working closely with you."
"Mr President, unfortunately, circumstances prevent me from being in celebratory mood."
"The Greek Government has indeed taken over the presidency at a time of acute economic crisis, with growing prospects of a new, even more murderous attack by the imperialist powers on the Iraqi people."
"Their pretext is that Iraq has a smoking gun, although they have yet to find it; and yet these self-same hypocrites make, use and sell every type of weapon of mass destruction there is."
"The Greek Government was party to the wars against Yugoslavia and Afghanistan and has said that it will join the impending war against Iraq, even if it is hiding behind its fig leaf by saying that war needs to be preceded by a UN Security Council resolution."
"The Greek Presidency will promote the interventionist European defence and security policy by immediately deploying the European army, first in Bosnia and the FYROM and then anywhere else it is needed."
"It will step up the attack on employment, insurance and pension rights."
"It will wipe out even more small and medium-sized farms during the mid-term review of the CAP."
"It will promote mechanisms for deporting immigrants and strict asylum laws."
"Using terrorism as a pretext, it will promote the transposition of anti-grass roots European legislation into national law and the abolition of democratic rights and freedoms."
"The signature of the Treaty enlarging the European Union under the Greek Presidency will mark the start of even more hardships for its people and will, we fear, result in the Euro-partition of Cyprus."
"May I reassure anyone who may be worried by the socialist label sported by the Greek Government that, as we have heard today, the Greek Presidency intends to keep big business happy."
"That is why the people of Europe who, unlike big business, have nothing good to expect from the Greek Presidency, should not be complacent."
"The only way out is for them to join forces and step up their fight against this policy."
"In Greece, demonstrations are almost a daily occurrence."
"They will culminate with demonstrations in June, which we invite the workers of Europe to attend."
"As far as the Communist Party of Greece is concerned, it will be right on the front line of this fight."
"Mr President, I wanted to pick up on a couple of the points raised by Mr Prodi and by the Greek Presidency."
"Firstly, on the research and development policy of the European Union, Mr Prodi talked about the need to develop and invest in clean technologies."
"Obviously our group agrees with this."
"We need to develop environmentally friendly technologies, partly because of the employment opportunities they create and the training needs that exist, but also because of their positive social repercussions."
"I note that the Greek Presidency has identified cutting-edge technologies, in biotechnology and defence, as research priorities."
"That begs a few questions about how we are deciding what we wish to invest in, with whom we are wishing to compete, and for what purpose."
"I am interested in understanding how this links to the current treaty requirement in Article 6 to integrate the environment into policies and practices of the European Union."
"Mr Trakatellis made some very important points on this."
"We are pleased that in future we are going to be monitoring policies in terms of a social sustainable development emphasis."
"Given that the Spring summit is supposed to be about sustainability, I am also interested to know what proposals there will be from Council about how it is going to change its own structures to deal with this much more integrated approach."
"Our group is also interested to note that the Greek Presidency's priorities include the tasks relating to services of general interest, because we are going to be looking at the preparations for Cancun and the offers from the EU in that connection."
"Mr President, allow me to start by thanking all the members of the European Parliament."
"Their interventions will help the presidency enormously in outlining its policy and taking decisive action."
"This has been a most useful debate."
"Mr President, after Prime Minister Simitis' exhaustive reply, I wish only to add a brief comment and response in order not to prolong your suffering."
"The first question concerns the proposal to create a worldwide Socrates programme."
"I believe that this is the way to go."
"We have already created an Erasmus World based on the same criteria, save that the financing is such as to restrict us to minor projects."
"Let this be clear: if Europe does not undertake a major common research programme to bring back the drained brains from abroad, to make the most of our young people, to create a breeding ground for scientific and cultural knowledge, then we are lost."
"You all know that I never exaggerate. I can assure you: we are lost."
"We, with our costs, with our social structure, with our diversities - if we do not take a great leap forward we will be lost."
"I will give you just one example, by way of a practical illustration. At present, it costs three times as much to transport a container from China to Amsterdam as it does to transport a container from Amsterdam to China."
"Such are the market forces on both sides. I can give you another figure."
"In the past month, there have been 8 million new subscribers to mobile telephone networks in China - in one month."
"Do we really think we can tackle this world with our research sector in such a fragmented state, without entering the technology race, without being at the forefront of innovation?"
"We are deluding ourselves."
"My response to the second question is this. We have been accused of not mentioning the benefits of the internal markets."
"No: these are the basis of all the measures we will take this year."
"I would merely point out that so great is the importance of the internal market that, if we were to analyse the sectors which have been affected by inflation in recent months, entering the great, heated debate on the euro, we would find that, where the internal market has been implemented, there has not been any inflation and where there have been delays in implementing the internal market there has been inflation."
"Suffice it to say that our future depends on the competition the internal market can bring."
"That concludes the item."
"Mr President, I realise that this is rather out of the ordinary, but might I not be permitted to take over Mr Lage's question?"
"I would be happy to do so."
"I wanted to put a supplementary question in any case."
"Mr President, the Commission is committed to addressing the dramatic humanitarian crisis in Angola effectively and without delay and to supporting the peace process."
"The Commission is constantly monitoring the situation in Angola, as we have done for many years, in order to get a clear picture of humanitarian needs."
"I will be going to Angola - and also to Zambia - to assess the situation myself later this month, so I shall gain an overview of the humanitarian situation and the development of the peace process in Angola."
"On that occasion I will be signing the EC-Angola cooperation strategy for 2002-2007, including the plan of action."
"The Commission's action in Angola is twofold: emergency humanitarian aid and a longer-term strategy based on cooperation."
"This is funded by ECHO and by EDF funds."
"As far as the humanitarian aid is concerned, the Commission, through ECHO, has already generated a considerable amount of funding to address the needs and will maintain its presence and commitment in the country throughout this year."
"Last year Angola was among the top ten recipients of ECHO funding, receiving a total of EUR 14 million."
"This year, an initial decision has been taken to provide EUR 8 million funding, due to be adopted soon."
"Malnutrition is one of the main targets for our support in the humanitarian area, particularly in forgotten regions where no other donors are present in the country."
"As far as the longer-term strategy is concerned, in May 2002, a month after the signature of the peace agreement, a plan of action to support the peace process was presented by the Commission and approved by the General Affairs Council on 13 May."
"The plan of action identified a financial package, originally EUR 124 million, from unspent EDF funds and budget lines aimed at addressing the most pressing concerns at this stage, including emergency relief, food aid and food security, reintegration and resettlement of refugees and displaced persons and de-mining operations."
"The implementation of this is now under way and to our great satisfaction we can start doing things in a country where for many years we have, owing to the circumstances, only been able to do humanitarian work."
"On that basis, and as part of this plan of action, the Commission has made EUR 30 million available for emergency support for the peace process by reallocating funds from earlier European Development Funds to support short-term work on the peace process."
"These funds are targeted at medical assistance, the distribution of seeds and tools, food aid and the resettlement of former UNITA soldiers and their families."
"De-mining is also important."
"We tried to do all this as quickly as possible last year."
"The decision on all this will be implemented through different UN agencies, EuronAid and FAO for the food security component and different NGOs for the de-mining operations."
"Proposals for EUR 16 million have been signed and the remaining proposals are awaiting approval by the Angolan national authorities."
"They are expected to be finalised within the next few weeks."
"Although humanitarian support will continue to be provided, the Commission considers that pressure must be kept up on the Angolan Government to urge it to assume more direct responsibility for its own vulnerable populations."
"We are therefore calling upon the government of Angola to make more efforts in addressing the critical humanitarian needs of the population."
"We welcome the Angolan Government's intention to organise an international conference for the reconstruction of the country, and trust that the views of all groups in society will be reflected in the reconstruction plan to be presented."
"The Commission has offered to assist in the organisation of the conference, which is tentatively scheduled to take place in March or April 2003 in Brussels, kindly hosted by the Belgian Government."
"These are times of great change and challenge for Angola after many years of conflict."
"The emphasis now will be on progress, economic growth, stability and governance."
"That will change the whole mood of politics in the country and I am looking forward to the dialogue we shall be participating in next week."
"Commissioner, thank you for your very balanced reply to my question. I am pleased with the action taken by the Commission and by the European Union in Angola, and I note that the Commission is stepping up the action it is taking to assist development in and provide humanitarian aid to Angola."
"I totally agree that the best solution for Angola is to take advantage of this country's enormous potential."
"Angola has been generously endowed with resources by nature, but unfortunately it has also been the victim of acts of madness by mankind for decade upon decade."
"It is now possible to use these rich and immense natural resources to benefit the people of this country, which, although it covers an enormous geographical area, has a population of just 13 or 14 million people."
"So we are faced with a difficult paradox: a land rich in resources with a population living on the verge of misery, hunger and death."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner, I think that the Commission should continue along the lines you have just informed us about."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to add something to what has just been said."
"Only a matter of a few decades ago, Angola was one of Africa's principal agricultural exporters, and this of course means that it is appalling that we now have to supply it with food aid - a situation brought about by both war and socialist mismanagement of the economy."
"There are three questions I would like to put to you."
"Firstly, what actual agricultural programmes is the Commission implementing?"
"That, in my view, is the most important thing, that the country can again be self-supporting and export agricultural produce."
"Secondly, what is the state of the infrastructure that is needed to distribute the food?"
"And thirdly, what is happening about educational and training programmes?"
"These are, I believe, the three most important issues that are at stake here."
"It is difficult to say what is most important."
"In cases like this almost everything is important."
"I would say to Mr Posselt that consolidating peace, to give people the confidence that it is irreversible, is most important right now."
"But certainly it is essential to open up the interior of the country and make roads safe from landmines so that economic life and the resettlement of people can take place."
"This is extremely high on the agenda."
"For many years any support, even food supplies and basic commodities, has had to be flown in to the small towns in most of the country: these towns were more or less isolated because of UNITA which surrounded them."
"For humanitarian reasons, for political reasons and for economic reasons, opening up and creating a normal flow is absolutely essential."
"There is an increasing number of accidents due to landmines because things are starting to move now."
"It is therefore enormously urgent to accelerate that effort."
"As regards agriculture, as defined in the country strategy paper, we will be focusing on agricultural development."
"This is essential both for the survival of the people and because of the enormous potential that Mr Posselt rightly pointed to."
"Angola is more than diamonds and oil."
"It is also a country that has great potential for a much more diversified economy."
"As the author is not present, Question No 16 lapses."
"I would apologise to the Commissioner on behalf of this Parliament."
"Question No 17 by John Walls Cushnahan (H-0872/02):"
"Subject: Recent maritime disasters"
"In light of the series of maritime disasters that have occurred in European waters in November and December 2002, namely the Prestige disaster which continues to produce yet more oil slicks which are devastating the coastline and marine life of Galicia, compounded with the recent collision between the freighter the Tricolor and the Kariba, and the second collision between the wreck of the Tricolor and the freighter the Nicola, will the Commission recognise that there is a clear need for a coordinated EU response?"
"Furthermore, given the severe consequences of such maritime accidents, what is the Commission's view of the submission that I made to the Convention on the Future of Europe in June 2002 (reference Conv 150/02), calling for the creation of an EU Coastguard?"
"Mr President, on 3 December, the Commission approved a communication on the measures to be taken as a result of the accident involving the oil tanker Prestige."
"This document contains detailed proposals for a series of measures and, in particular, speeds up the application of the legislation approved by Parliament and the Council following the Erika disaster, the so-called Erika I and II packages."
"The Transport Council of 6 December supported the majority of the initiatives proposed by the Commission."
"Therefore, on 20 December, the College approved a proposal for a regulation, which has just been sent to the Council and to Parliament, prohibiting the transport of heavy oils by single-hull oil tankers destined for or originating from European Union ports and speeding up the replacement of this type of oil tanker by double-hull oil tankers."
"The European Union has not waited for the recent events to happen to implement an agreed maritime safety policy."
"There was already a wide range of measures for guaranteeing better protection in this field."
"The Commission takes good note of Parliament's contribution to the work of the Convention with regard to the creation of a European coastguard body as an effective means of fighting the danger of pollution and maintaining maritime safety."
"The recurrence of accidents such as the Erika or the Prestige, not to mention other lesser ones such as the Vicky just a few days ago, demonstrates that the whole of Europe would gain from a European coastguard body, particularly in view of the fact that some of the 25 future States of the Union have absolutely no type of protection or body of this nature."
"In any event, the main task of the European Maritime Safety Agency, which is soon to be created, is to technically coordinate the application of Community rules, and the Commission will study which measures must be adopted in the future, in view of the experiences of the Agency."
"Commissioner, thank you for your response."
"The Prestige disaster highlights not only the gaps in the implementation of EU legislation which you referred to in your answer, designed to prevent the recurrence of such incidents, but also the lack of an adequate EU response mechanism."
"In relation to the Prestige, responsibility and liability were disputed."
"This delayed action and the absence of a coordinated EU response aggravated the environmental impact."
"If this incident, with the consequences it had for the shared environment and European fishing industries, had occurred in EU waters, and if an EU coastguard had existed, the response time would have been reduced, a refuge port would have been designated and the damage could have been minimised."
"On top of this, we have had the subsequent incidents involving the Tricolor, the Kariba and the Nicola."
"All these indicate the need not just for legislation but for the resources to do the job."
"Would the Commission consider setting up a study?"
"We can learn how the United States tackles this problem, in relation not only to prevention - it saves some USD 6 billion per year by preventing incidents like this - but to its response when incidents do happen."
"They have successful experience in this field, and we have a lot to learn from them."
"Since the Commission is the body which initiates legislation, I urge you, Commissioner, to consider acting on the findings of any such inquiry you may care to set up."
"Mr Cushnahan, I can only agree with you in that, amongst other things, I cannot accept that citizens have fewer rights in Europe than in the United States."
"This is what I said very clearly when I made the proposals in the Erika I and Erika II packages."
"If the Council had agreed to the proposal for single-hull vessels transporting oil to leave Community waters, the Prestige disaster would not have taken place, because it would have had to leave Community waters several months beforehand."
"I do fully agree that there are things we can learn from the United States."
"I do not understand why the United States can have a timetable according to which there will be no single-hull vessels transporting oil in its ports by 2010 and we cannot adopt a similar measure."
"In the end, as the honourable Members know, a less ambitious timetable was approved."
"What I have proposed to this Parliament and to the Council of Ministers is that we return to the Commission's initial proposal and speed up the departure of single-hull ships transporting oil. And furthermore, to take the maximum security measures, specifically, that the transport of heavy oil, of heavy fuel oil, of bituminous products and of tars, in other words, of the most polluting products, should be carried out by safer ships, meaning those with double hulls."
"Copenhagen speaks of specific measures."
"The Commission is studying how to apply those specific measures following the Prestige; they include the possibility of promoting the construction and maintenance of two or three large skimmers, large suction machines, so that, if an oil slick happens - unfortunately there is no such thing as zero risk, although it should be reduced to the minimum - there may be vessels of the greatest possible power, superior to the vessels currently in existence on European coasts, which furthermore can operate and act at sea at times of storms and difficulties."
"We must coordinate the European response."
"The Agency, which would be responsible for these vessels and for the deployment at different strategic points on European coasts, must also implement a series of plans for responding to maritime accidents of this type."
"This will be one of your tasks: to create a pre-established method for cooperation between different Member States of the Union, which could work better, since it largely depends on bilateral agreements rather than on a perfectly coordinated European-type action."
"With regard to responsibility, as the honourable Member knows, we are working on it and I hope that over the next few weeks we can present, within the Commission and rapidly approved, a proposal to provide a criminal definition of serious negligence in all the Member States of the Union in the event of this type of accident."
"Commissioner, it seems to me from reading the documents drafted by the Commission, which have your imprimatur on them, and from listening to what you have said, or at least what you have said from time to time in the past, that there is a real political conflict between your position, that is the Commission's position, and the Council's position as presented at Copenhagen."
"I do indeed have the document of 3 December, which I read with great interest."
"However, as I see it, the Transport and Environment Councils held in the same month and the Copenhagen European Council did not respond in any practical way to the Commission's request for urgent action."
"You called for the commitments given in the 'Erika' legislation to be implemented, Mrs de Palacio, and you called for an approach that went beyond those commitments, but the European Council turned its back on the victims of the disaster who at that very moment were scooping up oil with their own hands."
"The Council seemed to hold the Commission's views in contempt, and it is enough to say that it proposed only five million euros for Galicia and all the countries affected, whereas the United States is currently calling for four billion euros for the 'Exxon Valdez' accident."
"With this in mind, Commissioner, I would like to ask you why the Commission has not brought forward a legislative act like the United States' Oil Pollution Act, which provides a real basis for combating this problem."
"Furthermore, will Galicia be considered as a location for a European Maritime Safety Agency?"
"Mr Nogueira, firstly, in relation to your last comments, I do not see that conflict between the positions of the Commission and of the Council."
"At the Transport Council on 6 December, conclusions were unanimously approved which stated that the States are committed at national level, until we have a Community proposal, to adopting measures aimed at excluding from their ports any ships transporting bituminous products (heavy fuel oil, heavy oil, tars) which do not have a double hull."
"And the country which I know best, just like the honourable Member, has already taken a measure which entered into force on 1 January this year, and certain other countries have adopted it as well."
"Secondly, as well as this proposal, they have committed themselves to adopting, before June, an accelerated timetable for the departure of single-hull ships transporting oil from European ports."
"Thirdly, they have committed themselves to speeding up the implementation of all the measures adopted in the Erika I and Erika II packages and therefore not to wait until July of this year or February 2004 to do so."
"In particular, I am awaiting a response to the delicate issue of the famous ports of refuge; in principle, the Member States of the Union have the time limit of February 2004, but I hope they will communicate it to us before that - some countries are beginning to work on this - and I hope that they will do so before the summer."
"I would therefore insist that I believe there is considerable agreement."
"The Prestige tragedy has been a real wake-up call for all the Member States of the Union."
"I would like to have the powers of the federal government of the United States, but the European Union is not a federation and the Commission is not therefore the federal government of a United States of Europe;"
"I would not mind if it were, and if I were a Minister in that federal government, but that is not the case."
"Despite this, we have proposed a series of measures which are very similar to the American proposal, except on the timetable - which, I insist, we are going to raise again so that it may be speeded up - and on the amount of compensation, which is on the table with the Ministers and must be discussed, and if it is not adopted by the International Maritime Organisation, the Ministers have committed themselves to proposing it at European level."
"Finally, I would like to say to the honourable Member that I have nothing against the Maritime Safety Agency, but rather I am entirely in favour of it, but it is not I who decides."
"This will be decided by the European Council at the appropriate time."
"I should like to thank Mr Cushnahan for raising this issue in the House today."
"My supplementary question to the Commissioner is: given recent maritime disasters off the Spanish coast, and indeed in the English Channel, does she agree with me that it is only a matter of time before a passenger ferry and a rogue oil tanker collide, with devastating environmental and indeed human consequences?"
"Is it not time to ban all flag-of-convenience ships once and for all, not just from EU ports but from EU waters as well?"
"Mr President, the honourable Member has a very good knowledge of maritime safety issues; you have been a rapporteur and furthermore you have had considerable successes, such as the inclusion of black boxes, which was largely achieved thanks to your work, effort and persistence."
"You are also well aware of the problem associated with maritime traffic."
"I believe we must do work on this; in relation to the problem of the Channel, we have seen that there are aspects on which progress can be made."
"With regard to flags of convenience, the honourable Members are aware that, within the International Maritime Organisation, work is being done to improve this situation."
"In any event, there are two types of flag of convenience: those which exist for purely economic or tax reasons and those which, furthermore, demonstrate very little responsibility when it comes to control and the quality of the ships which fly them."
"We must distinguish between these two situations."
"The way to act is not to make a generic declaration; which would be the easiest thing to do, but, when it comes down to it, would be difficult to put into practice."
"We have to make their lives difficult in our ports so that they stop coming."
"In this regard, port inspections, with the selective criteria we have proposed and which have been approved thanks to the support of this Parliament, and which the Council also approved, clearly mean that, as soon as a ship flying that flag reaches a European Union port, it will be thoroughly inspected."
"It will therefore have to be up to scratch."
"This type of action and control, particularly in relation to those countries and flags which present most risk, is the way to act in the immediate term."
"However, the honourable Member is right, because it is not just a question of flags of convenience, but also the problem of the responsibility of classification societies, who have a conflict of interests, because they justify and certify the quality of a ship on behalf of the State issuing the flag but at the same time work for the owner of the ship in order to issue certain types of certificates."
"We must analyse these chains and deal with the issues in depth, and we must also deal with responsibility in the event of serious negligence."
"We will begin the second part of this Question Time with a question which should be replied to by Mr Vitorino but which, as we have already said, will be replied to by Mrs de Palacio."
"Part II"
"Questions to Commissioner de Palacio"
"Question No 18 by Mihail Papayannakis (H-0874/02):"
"Subject: Accusations of torture in Greece"
"A recent Council of Europe report (Committee for the Prevention of Torture) points out that during investigations ELAS, the Port Police and the Customs Authorities concealed the existence of temporary detention areas for foreigners, while completely unacceptable conditions were found to exist at jails in Kozani and Heraklion."
"Given that the above Committee has received 'a significant number' of accusations from detainees about ill-treatment by police and port authorities, usually during interrogation, that it states in its conclusions that Greece significantly downplays the extent of the problem of the ill-treatment of prisoners by the police authorities and that the EU is based, inter alia, on the principle of respect for human rights, what measures does the Commission intend to take to put an end to the flagrant violation of human rights?"
"Questions to Commissioner Liikanen"
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Commission would point out that the issues raised by the honourable Member are linked, in particular, to respect for human dignity and the prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading punishments or treatment, principles which are common to all the Member States of the Union."
"These principles are laid down in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union and are confirmed in Articles 1 and 4 of the European Union's Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"Respect for these principles by the States is guaranteed by the infringement procedure laid down in Article 226 of the European Community Treaty and by the political procedures laid down in Article 7 of the Union Treaty."
"In accordance with the former, the Commission can bring a case before the Court of Justice if the alleged act falls within the scope of Community law."
"In the case of the latter, the Commission or a third of the Member States of the Union can raise the issue before the Council, meeting at the level of Heads of State or Government, in the event of a serious or persistent violation of the principles laid down in Article 6."
"The majority of cases relating to the issues raised by the honourable Member relate to asylum, immigration and the protection of the rights of third-country nationals."
"These issues are included in the scope of the Community's competences."
"Furthermore, the Community began to legislate on this issue in accordance with Articles 61 and 63 of the European Community Treaty."
"The Commission would point out however that the report by the Council of Europe which the honourable Member refers to was followed by a detailed response by the Greek authorities, which in the current situation is providing a series of responses to the concerns expressed by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture."
"In any event, the Commission will closely monitor the development of the dialogue between the Council of Europe and the Greek authorities."
"Thank you, Commissioner, for your reply."
"I really do hope that you will keep an eye on this."
"It is a very, very serious matter."
"It raises questions of transparency and questions of control because, as you can see, the committee of the Council of Europe has been given false information."
"I hope that neither you nor the European Commission will be given false information."
"I should like to put the following supplementary question to you: quite apart from anything else, when it comes in these cases to the right to visit foreign nationals, especially immigrants, wherever they are being held, and it is often in unofficial detention centres, can we guarantee or can we call on or persuade the Greek authorities to make visiting rights normal practice, at least for non-governmental organisations?"
"Then at least we could resolve the problems which have already been raised as a result of these accusations, accusations which make me personally cringe with shame, both on my own account and as a Greek citizen."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, apart from the fact that - as I have said - it seems that there is a clear dialogue between the Greek authorities and the European Council, I would like to say that the Council of Ministers of the European Union reached a political agreement in December 2002 to bring forward a directive on the minimum rules for the reception of asylum seekers in the Member States of the European Union, on the basis of a Commission proposal of May 2001."
"Formal adoption is yet to take place because of the parliamentary reservations of one State of the Union."
"However, this directive - which was also supported by the Greek Government - intends to grant asylum seekers material facilities, which include accommodation, food and clothing, as well as a daily allowance which guarantees an adequate standard of living and subsistence for the asylum seekers."
"The States will also have to inform asylum seekers of the advantages they may benefit from, give them access to the labour market in certain circumstances, and ensure that they receive the necessary medical care."
"Furthermore, they will ensure that the conditions for reception are subject to appropriate monitoring and control."
"Finally, they will have to ensure the prevention of violence in places intended to house asylum seekers, at borders and in residential centres."
"All these measures will be applied in favour of asylum seekers authorised to remain in the territory in that capacity, even if they are obliged to remain in a particular place."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Greece has accepted this agreement and - although the Commission will monitor this issue - we know that the dialogue between the Greek authorities and the European Council about these complaints that the honourable Member has mentioned is continuing."
"Mr President, all I can say to the honourable Member is that I have taken good note and that I will communicate the suggestion you have just made to my colleague, Mr Vitorino."
"Mr President, I would like to refer to my question which is now number 52 on the question paper, which I tabled within due time specifically addressed to Mr. Liikanen, on the subject of regulatory impact assessment."
"This is a subject which I know he is very capable to deal with, since I have participated in a number of seminars organised by his services."
"When I arrived in Strasbourg this week, I discovered that this question was not down for a reply by Mr Liikanen, and Parliament's services told me that it had been reclassified by the Commission - I understand, by President Prodi's services - as a general question, and that therefore it would not be covered. I have two points to make to the President."
"Firstly, I have discussed this with Mr. Liikanen and, if we have time to reach it this afternoon, he is certainly prepared to address the subject, if not necessarily the full scope of the question."
"The broader issue is, could we ask the Parliament's services - and I am not blaming them in any way because this is a Commission issue - to ensure that if a Member's question is reclassified in this way, and is not down for an answer by the Commissioner to whom it is redirected, we are told about that, so that it can be reformulated if necessary and the Commissioner to whom it is addressed can answer it."
"It does seem to me, Mr President, from the point of view of this Parliament, that it is perfectly possible for the Commission services in effect to deflect a question away from a Commissioner unilaterally, without the Member concerned having any knowledge of it."
"Perhaps you could address that, and take it up with the services, so that in future we may be given more knowledge about these instances."
"Can I ask you, if we have time, to allow Mr Liikanen to answer my question?"
"In general terms, I must say to Mr Harbour that we have provided ourselves with Rules of Procedure - approved a few weeks ago - and that these Rules regulate practically everything."
"Competence for and allocation of the order or classification of these questions falls to the Commission, which naturally can make mistakes, just as Parliament can."
"In the classification today, as you have explained quite rightly, this question is not allocated to Mr Liikanen."
"I have no opposition to Mr Liikanen replying, but I must say one thing: that this is not just an issue between Mr Liikanen, you and myself, but that there are other Members whose questions are in the order, who wish to ask their questions and we have very little time."
"In other words, introducing one question means giving up another, and this sets a very difficult precedent."
"You, as a Briton, know better than anybody else how important precedents are."
"In principle, your question will be replied to in writing."
"It will only be possible if some of the twenty minutes remains and Mr Liikanen is prepared to answer it."
"Only in this case."
"In any event, Mr Liikanen can give his opinion."
"Since you have referred to the opinion of Mr Liikanen, I will give him the floor so that he can give his opinion on this point or order."
"Mr President, in the Commission of course the impact assessment has a global approach at the moment, because we try to assess business, environmental and social aspects at the same time."
"I am very honoured that the President of the Commission has taken full responsibility for that, but I might have some questions which are closely related to Mr Harbour's question."
"I can then reply in that context."
"If it comes within the twenty minutes, without setting a precedent - and I have heard Mr Liikanen - I will allow a brief reply."
"Otherwise, it will not be possible and you will receive a reply in writing."
"As the author is not present, Question No 19 lapses."
"Question No 20 by Rodi Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou (H-0876/02):"
"Subject: Greece and SMEs"
"At the Barcelona European Council Member States were asked to speed up the implementation of the European Charter for SMEs and the Commission was asked to draw up a Green Paper on the entrepreneurial spirit and SMEs."
"Has the Commission drawn up such a document and, if so, what are the main new strategies for promoting the entrepreneurial activities of SMEs?"
"Has it already evaluated the participation of SMEs in existing Community support programmes for SMEs?"
"In particular in respect of Greece, is any information available on the number of SMEs, by category of activity and size of undertaking, which have so far benefited from Community funding (beyond the EUR 1000 subsidy from the Greek Ministry of Development's 'Diktiotheite' (Link Up) Programme and on the results of this funding?"
"Thank you for your reply, Commissioner."
"The only specific information you have given me is that the Green Paper is being prepared and will contribute to the joint effort being made by the European institutions and the Member States to increase entrepreneurship, kick-start the European economy and, as a result, create new jobs."
"I, for my part, need more specific details and I think it would be worth your spending some time on them because, as we have seen from our lengthy discussion of the Lisbon strategy earlier today, following the presentation of the Greek Presidency's priorities, it will not be easy to achieve the targets we have set and the best way of giving the European economy the competitiveness it needs and creating jobs is to develop small and medium-sized enterprises."
"I shall wait and see what information I obtain in response to my questions from the report you will be publishing next week, and I reserve the right to re-table my question and ask for specific answers to specific questions."
"Question No 21 by Paul Rübig (H-0879/02):"
"Subject: Status of third-party certifiers in the EU"
"The European Commission is currently working on a new approach to the CE marking system and the future strategy for that system."
"From the point of view of European SMUs, it is particularly important that European third-party certifiers should continue to be able to place their own marks on all products."
"Particularly in the light of global competition, and in the interests of consumer protection, those marks should be easily recognisable by every member of the public, given that non-European certifiers can at any time check a product and, as third-party certifiers, have their own names and logos placed on that product."
"How does the European Commission intend to incorporate these considerations regarding the strengthening of the position of European certification undertakings into its new approach to the CE marking system?"
"The objectives of the forthcoming communication on the new approach, enhancing the implementation and new approach are: firstly, to analyse the overall situation in the field of new approach directives which cover a wide range of products; secondly, to detect possible weaknesses; and thirdly, to outline remedial measures to improve the application of the new approach directives."
"CE conformity is one of the main points that have been identified as requiring strengthening."
"This marking, required by most new approach directives, is addressed to market surveillance authorities of the Member States and symbolises the conformity of the product with the applicable Community requirements imposed on the manufacturer."
"The communication will also address the issue of the relationship between the CE marking and voluntary markings."
"The Commission has conducted an on-line survey of new approach stakeholders."
"As far as the CE marking was concerned, the Commission has taken on board the opinions of the majority of those who replied, the main thinking being that the additional voluntary markings are not in contradiction with the CE marking, as long as they do not cause confusion or overlap in meaning or purpose with it."
"They also often provide added value for consumers, users, public authorities and all those being addressed."
"Third party certifiers are in some sectors already involved in the conformity assessment procedures leading to the CE marking."
"It is also quite often stipulated that the identification number of the item should appear next to the CE marking."
"Third party certification, in areas of conformity assessment where no harmonised directives apply, is permitted and even welcomed, since it indicates to the people to whom it is addressed that certain qualities of the product have been tested and certified by the body in question."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to express my gratitude to the Commissioner, believing as I do that third-party certification will be a particularly important consideration for us in the future."
"The CE conformity marking does indeed confirm that the product complies with all rules within the European Union and is legal here."
"The only thing is that the public do not, in fact, want just this legal status quo; they want certification by a third - and of course neutral - party to give better products a higher market profile, so that what we end up with, for all practical purposes, is a quality pyramid."
"The CE marking would be its lowest level, with a standard mark being required to indicate significant improvements in quality, practical usefulness, or safety features in comparison with the normal CE marking."
"I believe that such upward gradation of quality would be of great importance to consumers and the public."
"I thank Mr Rübig for his interest on this issue of conformity assessment."
"Conformity assessment new approach directives are not usually included among the major policy issues which reach the front page."
"When we talk about SMEs or any entrepreneurs, whether small or large enterprises, these are key issues to enable a company to act in the internal market and globally."
"On the other hand, they also enable the proper weight to be given to the interests of the consumer."
"I hope Parliament will create a system to deal properly with the communication which is coming in fairly soon."
"Of course, I am not going to set any bad precedents, and therefore, within the Questions to Mr Liikanen, if it is considered that the question can be partially replied to - not Question No 53, but Question No 20b - I do not have any opposition, but if Mr Liikanen believes that the question is much more general and the Commission's allocation of the question to Mr Prodi is correct, this question will be replied to in writing."
"First of all, I should like to refer to the reply that the President will give today."
"For the first time the Commission has made a proposal that has undergone this broadened impact assessment, concerning employment policy guidelines."
"It is very important for our internal work that we stick to this impact assessment system."
"I hope that Parliament will take advantage of this too."
"When dealing with legislation Parliament will be able properly to assess the Commission proposal."
"The next challenge is how Parliament and the Council will assess the changes they might make to the Commission proposal."
"That is the issue for Parliament, the Council and the Commission in forthcoming discussions."
"Referring to the President's reply, we will have opportunities to discuss the matter further."
"Mr Rübig, in any event you will receive a reply in writing as Question No 52."
"Questions to Commissioner Patten"
"Question No 22 by Bart Staes (H-0832/02):"
"Subject: CFSP: Future prospects for Kosova"
"Recent contacts with political leaders in Kosova have made it clear to me that the young Kosovan institutions face enormous handicaps in seeking to pursue a real and effective policy, not least on the socio-economic front."
"I can dispense with a description of the dire economic situation in Kosova, well known as it is."
"Kosova needs urgently to be enabled to pursue an imaginative policy in order to attract investment."
"The big problem is that the Kosovan authorities are prevented by the statute in force from pursuing any such policy."
"Kosova is, in particular, not at present in a position to conclude any international trade agreements or to contract loans with international financial institutions."
"Kosova needs a clearly autonomous statute."
"I therefore ask the Commission what future prospects it can hold out to the Kosovars of that happening."
"Specifically, can Kosovan institutions count on very wide-ranging autonomy in the future?"
"Let me emphasise that Kosovo's institutional set-up, including the distribution of responsibilities, has been defined by the United Nations Security Council and must be respected by all sides, including the provisional institutions of self-government in Kosovo."
"Kosovo's current economic situation is clearly a product of past political and economic neglect and oppression before 1999."
"This demanded major economic efforts from the United Nations interim administration, and especially its European Union pillar, in the last three years."
"A war-torn region has been economically stabilised, basic infrastructure has been repaired, the euro has been introduced and the legal framework for a market economy is being laid."
"A new customs service is collecting much-needed revenues for the Kosovo budget."
"We are still heavily engaged on the ground to further support Kosovo's recovery, for instance, the consolidation of the rule of law, which is vital to attract foreign direct investment."
"There is still a long way to go but we should not forget from which level we started."
"Furthermore, the Commission has succeeded in letting Kosovo benefit from the various instruments of the European Union's stabilisation and association process, even without a decision on its future status, to ensure that it does not fall behind in the region."
"UNMIK is also currently consulting with various international financial organisations on how to give Kosovo access to their funds in the absence of a decision on its final status."
"In the framework of the stability pact, UNMIK is exploring ways of embedding Kosovo in the process of regional trade liberalisation and has already signed the Memorandum of Understanding on the regional electricity market in south-east Europe."
"In short, we have gone a very long way to find creative ways to improve Kosovo's economic situation and we will continue to do so. Our efforts and those of the United Nations qualify the imaginative policy that the honourable Member mentioned in his question, even though Kosovo's unresolved status poses additional challenges to both the international and local authorities."
"This should not prevent us from pursuing a sound economic policy and structural reforms, which are feasible and necessary to ensure economic growth and welfare for the people of Kosovo."
"I hope that the technical breakdown is not a reflection of the situation in Kosovo, for we all know that there are power cuts there sometimes as the electricity supply is not yet fully operational."
"I would like to thank Commissioner Patten wholeheartedly for his answer."
"It was a very elaborate answer which took account of reality."
"My question was actually prompted by talks with representatives of the Kosovar community, representatives of both Mr Haradinaj's party and the LDK of Ibrahim Rugova, both of whom point out whenever we meet them that Kosovo has no status as yet, which makes their work much more difficult."
"They are asking us to make serious efforts to enable them to contact international financial institutions despite their current status."
"We know that much has happened."
"The war took place almost three and a half years ago."
"Is it not possible for us, the European Union, which has the necessary leverage in the international institutions, to make efforts to help Kosovo gain access to institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in the context of the United Nations?"
"This is a question from the people on the spot."
"First of all I am glad that technology eventually brought us the honourable Member's supplementary question."
"I have two points."
"First of all I very much agree with the argument of the head of the UN mission in Kosovo, Mr Steiner, that the real task for Kosovo over the coming year is to put standards before status."
"What we want to see is Kosovo putting in place the sort of policies and the sort of implementing agencies which will allow it, with the other countries in the region, to move ever closer to the European Union."
"Secondly, the honourable Member is correct in saying that a problem that we face in Kosovo is that as it becomes more economically self-sustaining, as it moves away from heavy dependency on grants, it will naturally be looking to international financial institutions and others for loans."
"The status issue has raised some problems in that respect."
"We are discussing that issue with the IFIs, in particular with the European Investment Bank, and I very much hope that we will be able to resolve it in a way which enables Kosovo, as one would expect of any economy in those circumstances, to move from grant-dependency to the ability to borrow money and to service those loans."
"Question No 23 by Bernd Posselt (H-0866/02):"
"Subject: Status of Kosovo"
"Would the Commission be prepared to have various options drawn up for the future status of Kosovo and to submit them to the Council and Parliament for further discussion, or does it see any other practicable ways of finally tackling this problem?"
"Kosovo's status is currently defined under UN Security Council Resolution 1244 of 10 June 1999."
"Any decision on its final status will therefore have to be taken by the Security Council."
"The international community has not set a clear point in time at which this issue will be debated."
"Consequently it is not up to the Commission to draw up scenarios for Kosovo's future status."
"The European Union fully supports the policy of standards before status pursued by the UN Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo to which I have just referred, endorsed by the UN Security Council at its meeting of 24 April last year."
"UNMIC has set clear benchmarks concerning democratic and market economic reforms, human and minority rights, which are all necessary to prepare Kosovo for future challenges."
"These basic standards must be met before a discussion on status can begin."
"Kosovo is an integral part of the region for which we have devised the stabilisation and association process to bring it closer to European Union structures."
"We have made sure that Kosovo's unresolved status does not prevent it from benefiting from the stabilisation and association process."
"Commissioner, I too am aware that Kosovo's present status is laid down in the UN Resolution, but the simple fact is that we also have to consider the future, and that is where I can envisage a problem, in that no major investor will put money into Kosovo if he does not know what sort of long-term future the place has to look forward to."
"If people cannot see what prospects there are for the country, they will carry on trying to emigrate, rather than investing their energies in Kosovo itself."
"Hence this question: is there any sort of dialogue between the European Union and the representatives of Kosovo, in which these issues are at least considered?"
"After all, the present position cannot remain as it is for decades at a stretch, and we cannot go sliding, without any sort of forward planning, into a future that will be with us very soon."
"The Member is right to show the importance of attracting inward investment to Kosovo, but I think that any would-be investor would have a lot of other concerns higher on their agenda than the constitutional status of Kosovo - concerns about the rule of law, about the law and order situation, about organised crime and about the policy infrastructure within which he or she was being encouraged to invest."
"That is why, as I said earlier, I support the arguments which have been put forward by the special representative of the Secretary-General, Mr Steiner, that the task at this stage for Kosovo is to focus on standards rather than to consume the political process with debates about status."
"Clearly we have discussed those political issues with Kosovar representatives."
"I am very pleased that in the three years and more that I have been visiting Kosovo we have seen not only a transformation of the economic and social situation on the ground but the establishment of the provisional administration: the political structure to reflect the wishes of the people of Kosovo themselves."
"I think that is a step forward, but I very much hope, in the debate which local politicians have, that they will recognise that whatever the nature of their aspirations on the status issue, the first thing they have to get right is the basics of economic and social life in Kosovo."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I think that you are right to refer to the arguments of the honourable Member who is talking about standards before status."
"That is an 'either/or' approach."
"Should we not, however, be aiming for a 'both/and' approach?"
"Should we not be working on standards - and I share your opinion entirely - and the status of Kosovo at the same time?"
"I think that a 'both/and' approach is a better one, one which offers the Kosovar people more hope and more opportunities."
"I just wanted to point that out."
"It is not unreasonable to say that one should take a step at a time, without of course suggesting for one moment that the discussion on status is irrelevant to Kosovo and to Kosovo's future."
"I would not suggest that, but I think it would be better for Kosovo at the moment if efforts were to be focused on the question of standards."
"This does not mean that we are going to be able to put off indefinitely a discussion on the terms of the UN Security Council resolution."
"'First things first' is not a bad piece of advice to give to the people of Kosovo at the moment."
"Question No 24 by Torben Lund (H-0836/02):"
"Subject: Israeli military operations and lost EU funding"
"The EU has financed many projects in the state of Palestine, in particular to help develop democracy and secure human rights."
"Will the Commission say which projects the EU is financing in the state of Palestine and indicate the extent of the damage caused by Israeli military operations to EU-funded projects?"
"Will the Commission also say what the consequences of Israeli military operations in the state of Palestine are in terms of Israel's chances of obtaining support from the EU and in regard to relations between the EU and Israel in general?"
"Following a request from the Council, the Commission compiled in January last year a list of projects funded by the European Union and Member States which had either been destroyed or damaged by Israeli military forces."
"The list of destroyed projects has recently been updated by the Commission office in Jerusalem, in coordination with the EU Member State representative offices in Jerusalem and Ramallah."
"The estimated total, as of 14 December last year, stands at approximately EUR 24 million."
"This assessment is limited to the costs of physical infrastructure, excluding indirect losses such as project delays or suspensions."
"These estimated damages were presented to the General Affairs Council of 28 January last year; the GAC in turn asked the Government of Israel to put an end to this practice and reserved the right to claim reparation in the appropriate fora."
"The issue was also more recently discussed at the EU-Israel Association Council meeting of 21 October 2002."
"The position of the European Union in the international community is that the wanton destruction of basic infrastructure and facilities is counter-productive."
"It sets back efforts to improve the economic, social and humanitarian development in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip."
"Poverty levels are now at over 60% and unemployment is at around 50%."
"This situation of economic collapse, and a deepening humanitarian crisis, destroys hope and destroys any prospect of stability and security for both Israel and the Palestinians."
"Israel, due to its relatively high average income per inhabitant, is not eligible to benefit from bilateral European Union funding under MEDA programmes."
"So the Israeli Government or Israeli public entities do not receive funding from the European Union aid budget."
"Some organisations from civil society in Israel and the Palestinian territories may apply for projects designed to support the peace process."
"These projects should, in our view, be pursued in any circumstances."
"Some organisations have advocated - and this has been debated in Parliament - commercial sanctions against Israel."
"I am bound to say that in my strong judgment the suspension of the association agreement, which provides the basis not only for the European Union's trade relations with Israel but also for its political dialogue, would do nothing at all to increase the understanding of the Israeli authorities in relation to the current widely held concerns of the European Union and of many European Union citizens."
"A summary table of financial aid given by the European Union to the Palestinian Authority from 1994 to 2002, as well as the updated table with the estimate of losses, are being sent directly to the honourable Member."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Commissioner Patten for a very precise and very satisfactory answer."
"We no doubt all view the present situation in the Middle East as one of unimaginative tit-for-tat exchanges, and I personally think that the military action on the part of Israel is such as to make it almost impossible to imagine the Palestinian people's being able to unite around a well-functioning society."
"In answer to the only supplementary question, I should like to be told whether the military action currently being taken by Israel in the Gaza Strip and on the West Bank affects the EU's policy of aid to the Palestinian people."
"Has it any influence, or is the EU trying to maintain the aid it is at present able to give to the development of Palestinian society?"
"I also think that this is all illustrated very graphically by the fact that it has not even been possible to hold democratic elections in the Palestinian area because of the situation inflicted by Israel upon the Palestinian people."
"I should like to make two points."
"Firstly, all of us condemn terrorist acts."
"All of us condemn suicide bombing."
"Many of us doubt whether the right way of rooting out the infrastructure of terrorism in the Palestinian territories is by destroying the infrastructure of public facilities and the Palestinian authority."
"I am not sure what damaging and almost destroying the Central Bureau of Statistics in the Palestinian territories has to do with rooting out terrorism. I am not sure what destroying the Land Registry has to do with rooting out terrorism."
"Very often it looks to bystanders as though every manifestation of institutional life in the Palestinian territories has been targeted, whether public or private, whether the authorities' administrative structure or civil society."
"I happen to believe that is a profoundly mistaken policy, particularly if one is trying to hold out to Palestinians a political prospect and a path to peace and future security."
"As to the question of our assistance in Palestine, we continue to provide to the Palestinian authority - and this is a policy that began because of the block put on the payment of tax revenues by Israel to the Palestinian authority - very carefully controlled and monitored assistance, for instance to pay for doctors and nurses and for the ordinary infrastructure."
"We have been one of the main supporters of the Palestinian authority and have been the subject of some very unfair criticism for that."
"However, keeping a Palestinian authority in being is an important part of holding out the prospect of a peace process."
"We continue to provide substantial quantities of other sorts of assistance, such as humanitarian assistance."
"Before Christmas we announced that we would provide EUR 30 million for those municipalities in Palestine that had been hardest hit by hostilities."
"We are providing a loan fund of EUR 10 million for small- and medium-sized enterprises."
"I can send details of all the assistance that we have given in the Palestinian authorities."
"I am only sorry that it has not been more successful in creating the economic and social foundations that are so relevant to a peaceful political future."
"Mr President, I would be interested to know if the Commission has considered the accusations from the Israeli point of view."
"Following the destruction of Palestinian infrastructure, these accusations were made precisely when that same infrastructure had some connection with terrorist activities directed against Israel and against Israeli civilians, without regard to whether they were Jewish or of Arab descent. I would be interested to know what conclusions this has led the Commission to draw."
"As I suggested in response to the previous supplementary question, it may be that the destruction of some projects and some infrastructure has been an unfortunate by-product of legitimate, counter-terrorism activities, which are proportionate to the violence that they are seeking to contain."
"This may be true in some circumstances, but what has seemed surprising to us is the way in which one Palestinian institution after another has been destroyed or badly damaged as though some people believe that the aim of the exercise should be to undermine the ability of Palestinians to actually create an administrative structure for a future Palestinian state."
"I will take two examples that I referred to earlier."
"How can destruction of the Land Registry contribute to the defeat of terrorism?"
"How can doing a huge amount of damage to the Central Bureau of Statistics in the Palestinian territory be other than an example of needless destruction?"
"It is not very sensible when most of the material contained in the Central Bureau of Statistics can be found freely on the internet."
"It is difficult to see how those activities can be justified."
"This is a point I have made before; it is a point that the Council of Ministers has also made, and it is a point which the Israeli authorities should address rather more intelligently and sympathetically than they have so far."
"Question No 25 by Olivier Dupuis (H-0843/02):"
"Subject: Voice of Europe"
"In its answer to Question H-0234/02"
"The Commission fully shares the motives and objectives of the honourable Member, in particular in strengthening the pressure for a better respect for human rights by improving the availability of information."
"Our differences are on two points: firstly the eligibility of this specific proposal in terms of the current funding policies and criteria, and secondly the cost of the proposal both in investment and running costs."
"Projects of this nature are foreseen neither in the communication of May 2001 on the European Union's role in promoting human rights and democratisation in third countries, nor in the 2002-2004 programming document for the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights."
"The programming document which governs the selection of projects sets out eligible themes for support, including freedom of expression for the independent media, which were then refined in the context of programming identification missions to 29 focus countries of the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights."
"These refined themes, which effectively excluded the possibility of a project with a regional character, formed the basis of an international call for proposals launched in July 2002 with a deadline of 5 November."
"It is nevertheless likely that, with future calls proposals, the criteria concerning the selection of projects under the general theme of strengthening democratisation, good governance and the rule of law will be modified to allow projects of a regional nature."
"In this context it would be possible for an applicant to present a project concerning a 'Voice of Europe'."
"However, this brings me to the problem of cost."
"Any application would be admitted only provided it satisfied the general conditions of eligibility applicable under the published guidelines, including the condition that the grant is to fund specific project activities rather than general operating costs."
"Whichever comparison is drawn, the cost of establishing a radio station would be high and it would probably require permanent annual core funding for which this budget line is an inappropriate instrument."
"Achieving the same objectives by the use of the Internet might be a more appropriate way forward."
"I should like first of all to emphasise my personal interest in this subject."
"I am absolutely convinced that providing reliable information about world affairs in countries that are suffering from tyrannies, or where freedom of speech and freedom of the media is attenuated, is exceptionally important."
"Referring to the country I know best, the work done by the BBC World Service has, over the years, been of enormous significance in the promotion of pluralism around the world."
"I understand, however, the point made by the Member."
"Radio Free Asia has a budget of about EUR 30 million per year."
"If we were to take that as the model, we would be talking about committing 30 per cent of the budget for Chapter B7-7."
"I suspect that the House would regard that as rather a large chunk of the available funds."
"The Member asked whether establishing a broadcasting medium would be a good use of the funds if we were to have a larger budget and more money to spend on human rights."
"I suspect that, if this were so, I would have to argue with the Court of Auditors and with Parliament."
"The policy on democracy and human rights that we now faithfully follow precisely reflects reports by Parliament and the Court of Auditors."
"It was warmly endorsed for its strategic thrust by both the Council and by the Parliament."
"The Member concerned has powerful powers of persuasion."
"His silver tongue might be able to convince Parliament to support this proposition and to change its view on strategic thrust."
"He may, however, have more difficulty in persuading the Court of Auditors that we should support the core funding that would undoubtedly be necessary in order to establish such a broadcasting medium."
"I believe it is more sensible to look at other options, including use of the Internet, while wholly concurring with what the Member said about the importance of trying to broadcast the truth to countries where, alas, the truth is obfuscated by darkness and tyranny."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, while dealing with the 2003 Budget, the Committee on Budgets discussed Euro-News - the television channel that concentrates its coverage on European affairs - and did so in very great depth."
"Do you believe that Euro-News might be a means of disseminating European values and discussions throughout the world?"
"EuroNews has promoted European values and ensured that more people around the world are able to follow what is happening in Europe, but whether the organisation is EuroNews or any other, when you start discussing a public subsidy, in my experience legislators and others ask searching questions about value for money and about alternatives for achieving the same objective."
"Nobody should be immune from that sort of scrutiny where taxpayers' money is involved."
"When I look back, I might well wish that European broadcasters had done more at an earlier stage to provide greater competition with CNN."
"In the field of television news that would have been sensible, but nobody should underestimate the costs and nobody should argue today that it would be easy for Europe to rival the main American international broadcaster."
"As the time allotted to questions to the Commission has elapsed, Questions Nos 26 to 58 will be replied to in writing"
"The next item is the report (A5-0431/2002) by Mr Andria, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament entitled 'Clearing and settlement in the European Union. Main policy issues and future challenges' [COM(2002) 257 - C5-0325/2002 - 2002/2169(COS)]."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in financial markets, where the liquidity of the market is closely related to the confidence operators have in the reliability of securities payment and settlement systems, the inefficient operation of the latter can represent a source of risk for the markets themselves."
"Reliable payment and settlement systems require a clear legal framework, rules and procedures to govern securities holding, transfers, lending and related payments, as well as the imposition of constraints on these securities."
"Clearing and settlement, essential components of all securities transactions, are therefore fundamental to the smooth functioning of integrated financial markets."
"In any case we should note that, despite the increased demand for foreign securities, not only does the EU's infrastructure for clearing and settlement for cross-border transactions remain fragmented to a high degree, but there is also an excessive and certainly not controlled incidence of costs at cross-border level."
"In any case, in order to attain specific objectives, it is necessary to know what the operational situation in the sector is, in order to make the appropriate adjustments."
"There are two main reference markets: the United States and Europe."
"The USA has opted for the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, which incorporates both clearing and settlement systems and is overseen by a single managerial body, whose proven efficiency has led to substantial cost reductions."
"The European model with as many as 20 CSDs is fragmentary, benefiting from the fact that competition is only limited to securing new areas of influence."
"There has never been a price war, as market liquidity is controlled by a single active player."
"From an analysis of the existing framework and from the thorough research undertaken by the Giovannini Group, it is clear that there are a range of technical, legal and taxation barriers at the root of the high costs and inefficiency."
"Removal of the technical barriers has to be our prime objective and can be considered easily attainable."
"Standardising information technology languages and paper-based documentation does not, in fact, require a particular operational effort."
"There would certainly be greater difficulties in harmonising legal and taxation rules."
"We should aim to achieve the ambitious objective of creating a single securities code, which would constitute a real guarantee for operators; but it would certainly be difficult for Member States to reach agreement on this issue, for delicate and sensitive reasons linked to the differences between legislation governing property rights, company law and insolvency law."
"Therefore, the creation of this code must be considered a long-term objective."
"In the short term, an information statement should be drawn up which would provide market participants with a guide to the differences between the laws in the Member States."
"With regard to taxation barriers, the difficulties do not stem only from the differences between systems but also from strong resistance to change and harmonisation by some Member States."
"Starting with the need to reform the post-trading environment, with the aim of eliminating confusion between infrastructures and functions and destroying existing natural monopolistic positions, there must be an arrangement for core settlement services managed for legal purposes as a user-owned service governed by the rules of non-profit status."
"This option would guarantee market integrity, ease of access to the service by users and effective supervision with regard to operational risks."
"There could not be any distortions of competition, because this guarantee stems from the fact that the services user participates in managing the body."
"Innovation and technical progress could also be attained since the arrangement in paragraph 11 of the report specifies that non-profit status comes after allowing for necessary investment needs."
"Separation of core services and value-added services is considered vital."
"The latter could, in any case, be performed by central depositaries but with separate structures, including from a logistical point of view, by means of shared or supervised companies."
"The clearing and settlement service encompasses guarantee, margining, clearing, settlement and regulation activities."
"A quick read through reveals that these are all public utility services."
"The added-value services offered by banks or structures separate from depositaries are securities lending, collateral management, cash management, corporate actions, income management and taxation services: all purely commercial activities."
"In conclusion, it is also vital to have strong cooperation between the States in order to ensure adequate supervision."
"The Commission welcomes the European Parliament's timely and constructive response to its communication on clearing and settlement."
"In particular I should like to thank the rapporteur for his important report."
"The Commission will assess Parliament's response to its communication very carefully and will take into account the views expressed in that report."
"The Commission shares the view expressed in the resolution that efficient clearing and settlement is vital for the proper and safe functioning of the European financial markets."
"In fact, as is often said with reason, clearing and settlement is the plumbing system of the securities markets, without which nothing works."
"The challenge that lies ahead for the Community institutions is to ensure - in cooperation with market participants, national regulatory authorities and national legislators - the elimination of all existing barriers to integration and lack of competition, which would make cross-border post-trade arrangements in the European Union inefficient."
"That is essential for our common goal to build an integrated EU capital market by 2005."
"The Commission feels that we should encourage market-led approaches and solutions wherever possible."
"However, it is also true that major public policy concerns are at stake, such as the efficiency of the systems, costs, petition issues - namely open and non-discriminatory access and exclusivity agreements - interoperability of systems, and prudential and systemic safety."
"All these concerns need to be taken into account, and the rapporteur referred to a number of them."
"Now that the initial consultation period has been completed, we at the Commission are in the process of digesting the responses to that consultation document and of defining our approach to clearing and settlement arrangements."
"The Commission now intends to issue a new communication which will set out clear policy orientations, something which, until now, we have not been able to do."
"That document will serve as a basis for a second round of consultation, possibly in the first half of this year."
"I look forward to having a further discussion with Parliament, hopefully with the same rapporteur, on that subject."
"As in all future steps that we might want to take, we intend to proceed in close cooperation with the rapporteur, with Parliament and, in particular, with the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"Mr President, like Mr Bolkestein I would like to thank Mr Andria for his hard work on this most important of subjects."
"I agree with the Commissioner and the rapporteur that it is very important to remove technical and other barriers to cross-border clearing and settlement in Europe."
"The Commission and the European Union can play a constructive role in facilitating cross-border clearing and settlement as a vital part of creating a single market in financial services."
"There are certain points upon which PPE-DE Group opinion is divided, in particular point 11."
"It is not necessary to separate so-called core and value-added services, contrary to the view of the rapporteur."
"It is vital to price these different services transparently, so that when people are purchasing they know exactly which service they are buying and which they are not."
"It is also necessary to ensure that suitable risk management schemes are in place so that if there is a problem with one service there is no contagion between the so-called core services and value-added services."
"A law which said that a financial institution could only create or provide a certain core service and was not allowed to diversify into others would be too big an intervention in the market."
"I myself and many in the group therefore support a small amendment to Mr Andria's report on that point."
"I have reservations about the proposal that we should move to a directive at this point."
"We might well need to look at a directive in the future but it may be premature to decide now whether a directive is necessary."
"There may be many other ways in which the European Union and the European Commission can facilitate cross-border clearing and settlement, without necessarily having to resort to a hard law solution."
"Finally, the only other point of substance where I have a slightly different view from Mr Andria is the suggestion that we should prescribe that clearing and settlement systems are based on a 'not for profit' principle."
"I appreciate that Mr Andria has moved on this and has compromised and added the facility for allowing the services to make proper investments, but we should not prescribe a non-profit status and compel the markets to adopt this model."
"There are great merits in opting for user-owned systems."
"These are very good ways to ensure that the clearing and settlement service provides an excellent service to its users, but I am not really sure that we should prescribe on that issue."
"We certainly should not write in at this stage the requirement that these services must be managed on a 'not for profit' basis."
"It is important to allow firms to innovate and to invest, and a certain amount of profit generation is necessary to allow that investment."
"I welcome much of Mr Andria's report, with those three minor reservations."
"In particular we should not prejudge the market at this stage."
"We should allow and encourage the market to produce its own solutions, to produce market-led solutions, although I can see that there are merits in encouraging user-owned systems, because looking around the European Union we can see a number of systems which are working well on a user-owned basis."
"It has recently become clear in Europe and in the USA how sensitively financial markets react to various developments."
"Stability in the financial markets is continuously under fire, with all the repercussions that this has on consumer confidence in the economy."
"Stability in the financial markets can be aided by effective management based on clear regulation."
"Mr Andria's report on promoting the efficient settlement of securities therefore requires our full attention."
"Given the complexity of the way securities are organised, there is no simple solution."
"I would, however, like to emphasise that a solution must be transparent and controllable."
"That is in the interests of confidence in the financial markets."
"An inquiry into competition aspects as described in paragraph 15 can contribute to creating a transparent securities market."
"I believe that we can look back on the way in which this Parliament worked to eliminate obstacles to cross-border payments last year."
"At that time too, all the organisations, rules and interests formed a complex whole."
"Yet it turned out to be possible to eliminate virtually insurmountable obstacles."
"It is therefore high time we made sure that where there is an internal securities market, the numerous settlement costs do not obstruct cross-border transactions in this market."
"Mr President, Commissioner, clearing and settlement are an essential element in all securities market transactions."
"The Commission communication on clearing and settlement in the European Union analyses the sources of inefficiency in cross-border clearing and settlement arrangements."
"This inefficiency is largely due to technical requirements, market practice and the fragmentation resulting from national differences and legal barriers."
"It is also very important that the supervisory authorities adhere to a common approach and harmonised rules."
"Firstly, the technical barriers should be broken down and there should be a move towards interoperability of systems."
"Understandably, it is often the situation obtaining in the big Member States that serves as a basis for drafting single market directives and this sometimes seems to lead to the 'one size fits all' principle being applied."
"The solution chosen in drafting an EU securities code would not necessarily represent Europe's single financial markets but the application of a national solution on a European scale."
"This principle is very poorly suited to the stock markets, which will still be characterised by their own national features well into the future."
"As I see it this is partly the situation dealt with by Generoso Andria in the report we are discussing today."
"Items 11 and 12 explore the most desirable way of organising securities trading settlement services and the relationship between the central securities depositories and the custodian banks."
"The message in these points, put in just a few words, is that core functions in settlement should be properly determined, and the central securities depositories and the settlement institutions should practise these with a view to making a profit and under the supervision of users, whereas those offering services must be kept separate from the others."
"Unfortunately I cannot agree with Mr Andria's proposed solution on these two points."
"There are considerably more differences between Member States in arrangements for securities trading clearing and settlement and custodian services than in securities trading on the stock exchange."
"For example, in Germany securities are still kept in a physical form in vaults, whereas in Finland all securities have been converted into electronic recorded items, or book-entry securities."
"Owing to national laws relating to limited companies, the status of the German shareholder differs essentially from that of the Finnish shareholder in company transactions, for example."
"There is also a fundamental difference in the structure of central securities depositories in continental Europe on the one hand and the Nordic countries on the other, in that information on the investor in the Nordic central securities depositories is entered directly into the system and also, except in Denmark, directly into the issuer's register of shareholders."
"In the systems in continental Europe custody is nominee registered, and the investor has no direct contact with the issuer."
"The Commission has furthermore become conscious of these differences and is approaching the matter of clearing and settlement cautiously and from a functional point of view, which is a very good thing."
"If a directive should be issued on this matter, the Commission's approach, which takes account of these differences in the markets, should be adhered to."
"In my country, Finland, for example, Finnish issuers have, in their everyday activities, had a high opinion of value-added services based on registers of shareholders."
"The giant Nokia, for example, considers them to be very important."
"Items 11 and 12 in Mr Andria's report correspond very much with the views of banks in certain countries in relation to clearing and settlement structures, and in that respect they reflect partially outdated thinking."
"Together with my colleague, Astrid Lulling, I have drafted two amendments, which are aimed at preserving the efficacy of the national markets and would make possible the existence of all structural systems and alternatives."
"There is a saying in English: 'If it ain't broken, don't fix it.'"
"The rapporteur, Mr Andria, is trying to repair a situation here that works fine."
"This being the case I would like to stress the importance of accepting these two amendments, and I also hope that my group will support them."
"Mr President, my compliments to Mr Andria for this report on the Commission communication to Parliament and the Council dealing with policy issues and the future challenges of clearing and settlement in the European Union, the process through which transfer of ownership takes place in a securities market."
"This communication builds on the Giovannini report of November 2001, which identified many sources of inefficiency in cross-border clearing and settlement arrangements within the European Union."
"It is essential to manage the potentially high risks of clearing and settlement systems effectively, to ensure the stability of the financial system."
"With the increased demand for foreign securities since the introduction of the euro, our infrastructure for clearing and settlement of cross-border transactions remains fragmented, resulting in much higher costs than with national transactions."
"In this report we are presented with proposals to remove the barriers and distortions in the European Union post-trading environment, to create a level playing field between institutions, a common regulatory view and the development of rights of access and choice."
"Pan-European infrastructures are essential to an integrated financial market, with market participants, regulators and competition authorities all playing a role."
"We know the European Union has already accepted natural monopolies in certain service areas such as gas, electricity and air traffic control to ensure fair access to all users in the single market."
"Now the same principle must be applied to post-trading infrastructure."
"But - and I enter a very strong caveat here - it is very important for the effect of consolidation on competition and financial stability to safeguard prices in what will, de facto, be a less competitive arena."
"In concentrating the services in one or two main players we must be sure that we do not risk security in the event of institutional collapse."
"Proper safeguards will be needed."
"The American model is obviously an attractive template."
"It is very efficient in its delivery of cost-effective clearing and settlement."
"But such radical departure from our present systems of up to 20 central security depositories and very different legal frameworks would probably make it very difficult to achieve."
"While a lot more work is needed prior to any legislative initiative from the Commission - and I welcome Commissioner Bolkestein's offer of a second round of consultation - the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has laid out its stall, proposing separate core settlement services as a user-owned or public service, governed by the rules of non-profit status."
"It wants a specific directive on clearing, on the one hand, and settlement on the other, laying down common rules on authorisations, supervision and a common framework amongst others."
"An early step will no doubt be the revision of the investment services directive which provides for the possibility of choice of systems for post-trading activity."
"There is certainly a long and fraught road ahead, with different banking cultures and legal systems, but there can be no doubt about the bottom line: without provision for efficient cross-border clearing and settlement, the full benefit of an internal market for financial services cannot be realised."
"Mr President, I cannot but wonder at the way in which several Members here present have been giving us the benefit of their views on this highly complex subject-matter without ever having taken part in the discussions on it, but I do want to say that, whether in agriculture or in politics, you must know that there is no point in putting the cart before the horse."
"I find it regrettable that our rapporteur has largely disregarded this self-evident truth."
"As regards clearing and settlement, we have reached the stage of consultation on the basis of a Commission communication, a stage at which it is premature to say the least to instruct the Commission, in precise terms, to submit a proposal for a directive, and to tell them what should be in it."
"We are all in agreement with the Commission that it is right to make the cross-border clearing and settlement systems more efficient and to cut their costs."
"It does not inevitably follow, though, that we need a European legislative instrument in order to do this."
"What is first required is that the technical barriers within the EU be dismantled."
"It is at least premature to predict today what form this might take, having had a not very satisfactory discussion in committee, when we could have done with more time in order to dispel various evident misconceptions."
"We would, in my view, have done better to wait for the second Giovanni report, which is due to be with us in mid-February, rather than now attempting to commit this Parliament to a line that I regard - putting it bluntly - as nonsensical."
"In this area, though, nonsense is a public menace."
"My hair stands on end at the sight of the proposal that core settlement services should be handled by a service subject to the rules applicable to non-profit organisations."
"Such a proposal simply ignores the fact that a single legal system is capable of being applied only if laws on securities and taxation have already been standardised."
"I have been told by practitioners and specialists in these fields that there is at present no system capable of bringing together even only two jurisdictions, which means that such a system could not be made to work throughout the EU."
"I am also astonished at the sweeping proposal for a non-profit system of this sort, even though it is far from being proven that such a model would be preferable to a system run on a profit-making basis."
"There are enough examples to demonstrate the fact that the achievement of profit and reductions in cost are not mutually exclusive."
"Indeed, if I understand him right, the Commissioner has, in this House, declared himself to be in favour of a market-based approach."
"There are today many sectors in which a policy of moderate deregulation is being pursued and in which the market is being opened up."
"To do the very opposite in a sector like clearing and settlement, which is so important to the nascent internal market in financial services, and to attempt to establish a public monopoly, is quite simply absurd and demonstrates a lack of awareness of the world's realities."
"Healthy competition - which already exists - has always benefited the consumer."
"Contrary to what the rapporteur would have us believe, that is not fragmentation; that is competition."
"As adopted in committee, the report also envisages the provision of core settlement services by one structure, and of 'value added services' by another, separate structure."
"This would result in the enforced breaking-up of a variety of enterprises and is contrary to the approach favoured not only by most market operators, but also by the European Central Bank."
"Any operator in the market should be able to provide all these services, and any future European legislation should focus on the service itself and not on the body providing it."
"In view of these considerations, Mrs Kauppi and I have tabled amendments, and I hope that Members will support them."
"It is my especial hope - having heard the rapporteur's praises sung by the Socialist/Communist element in this House - that Mr Andria will take time to think things through again."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Andria, ladies and gentlemen, I knew why I had been moved down the list of speakers when I realised that I would have something to say in response to Mrs Lulling."
"Both in my personal capacity and as our group's co-ordinator, I repudiate any and every personal attack upon the rapporteur."
"It is a matter of political good form that opposing views are to be accepted as such and that one engages with them without simply dismissing them as nonsense."
"The report presented by Mr Andria has been passed, by a clear majority, by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"It is not his report alone, but a report to plenary by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, and Members who have failed to win their case in committee are entitled to use the tabling of amendments as a means of keeping discussion going and making differences of opinion clear. This is all the more the case - and, in my view, right and proper - when we are engaged in an intermediate consultation, that is to say in the midst of the opinion-forming process."
"Many interventions, as well as what has been said here today, show us that opinions have not yet taken their final form - it is not that the report is not good enough, but that the subject-matter is too important."
"The creation of an integrated financial market is not alone in still facing too many obstacles, hindrances and barriers, and the costs involved are still excessive."
"Historically speaking, we know that the settlement systems within the European Union have developed along different lines."
"This means that integration is something to be advocated if we really want an integrated financial market, but I would not venture to say today whether vertical or horizontal integration is to be preferred, in other words, whether the amalgamation of different settlement systems is in itself something to be favoured or repudiated, or, indeed, whether it is inimical to competition."
"Yes, we have excessive costs."
"Reference has been made to reports that make it clear that barriers are among the causes of this."
"A study carried out jointly by the German stock exchange and Clearstream has clearly shown that overall transaction costs resulting from barriers amount to some EUR 4.3 billion."
"We all want a level playing field."
"We all want improved access, and many of us believe that the structures of power mean that regulatory intervention is contrary to functional approaches to regulation."
"Criticism of the report has focussed on two aspects; one being the idea of a government body for 'core' settlement services, and hence of restricting the services of international central securities depositories to 'core' settlement services, and the other the idea of non-profit status, many being of the opinion that this would preclude competition."
"There is, moreover, the desire that all these services should be able to be performed by both banks and central securities depositories."
"Hence the amendments, and we hope that the debate has also demonstrated to the Commission the need for the various standpoints to be reconsidered."
"We await a proposal for a directive, which will make it possible to move this debate on to a more concrete phase."
"Thank you very much, Mr Karas."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report (A5-0452/2002) by Mr Mantovani, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Commission communication to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of Regions on the future of health care and care for the elderly: guaranteeing accessibility, quality and financial viability [COM(2001) 723 - C5-0163/2002 - 2002/2071(COS)]."
"- (IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this evening we are addressing a subject of considerable importance for all European citizens."
"We are discussing health and the elderly, and I would say that the health systems of all the European Union Member States are experiencing, albeit to varying degrees, similar situations."
"In fact, they are already, at this juncture, faced with the fundamental challenge of how, in particular, to control and cover the costs of health care."
"The ageing of the population, developments in medical technology and rising demand for health care services have led to a significant increase in the costs of health care across the board, which, at times, cannot be sustained by current economies, and in the costs of care for the elderly throughout Europe."
"Here are some examples: in the European Union, the proportion of the population over the age of 65 will rise from 16.1% in 2000 to 22% in 2025 and 27% in 2050, that is a third of the population."
"At the same time people over the age of 80, who made up 3.6% of the population in 2000 are likely to make up 6% in 2025 and 10% in 2050."
"Although the provision of health care and care for the elderly remains essentially the responsibility of the Member States, we realise that this trend, owing to the significant and complex implications, cannot find an effective response at exclusively national level."
"These problems must be included in the context of broader European cooperation so that we can achieve successful results, as set out by the principles and goals of the Community action programme in the field of public health and the specific objectives established by the United Nations Plan of Action."
"In order to meet these objectives, the cooperation of all health care professionals is required."
"There needs to be greater cooperation in the exchange of information and best practice, research, the establishment of a data bank covering the social and health care sector containing statistical analyses and projections, and the definition of common qualitative and quantitative standards, which will establish health indicators and formulate common standards to monitor the health services."
"In March 2002, the Barcelona European Council also stressed the need to launch and develop cooperation between Member States in this sector, through exchanges of best practice and information and discussion of the common challenges facing them at European level."
"The European Union has already affirmed on various occasions the need to draw up a global strategy covering the economic, employment and social implications of an ageing population, by harnessing the full potential of people of all ages and strengthening solidarity between generations."
"The safeguarding and further improvement of high quality social protection and health care provision in the Member States, based on the principle of solidarity and accessibility to healthcare for all concerned, will be necessary in order to fully attain the goals of financial viability, accessibility and quality."
"All this should, in the future, also lead to the creation of an internal market in health services and products: an internal market not treated in the same way as a commercial product and subject to its rules, but a product subject to the rules on quality and accessibility for all, and I am saying this in particular for Mrs Jöns, who has contributed a great deal and whom I would like to thank for her work on this report."
"Another key aspect to take into account is the risk of overemphasising the importance of the goal of financial viability at the expense of accessibility and quality."
"Solutions should be defined at the earliest opportunity: there need to be awareness-raising and information campaigns, specific analyses and research, programmes to fund training projects and refresher courses for medical, nursing and care staff, as Mr Mussa also suggested."
"Lastly, more attention needs to be paid to certain aspects of developing health care and social services for the elderly, especially for those who are not self-sufficient, who constitute the main, most important problem, such as the treatment of mental illnesses affecting the elderly, preserving peoples' autonomy, integration, access to rehabilitation and readjustment services, prevention, assistance and support for families caring for elderly people and combating maltreatment and neglect."
"Yesterday, the Commission sounded the umpteenth alarm, seeking to make us the most competitive economy in the world by 2010: precisely what was determined in Lisbon three years ago, owing to slow growth."
"Well, the thorny question of ageing of the population is important in this context."
"Therefore, in the hope that we shall soon see the European Parliament participating more actively in drawing up the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines and health policy guidelines, I would call on the Commission and the Council to take into consideration the decisions contained in this report when preparing the joint synthesis report for the Spring 2003 European Council, and also the European Convention, which should include a high level of health protection as a general goal."
"I believe that having a 'Social Europe' is the only way that we will move from being a Europe of banks and money to a Europe of people and peoples."
"Mr President, I should like to start by thanking Mr Mantovani and the honourable Members for their report."
"The Commission will be taking account of the proposals and recommendations made in it."
"The fact that the report is in favour of Community cooperation to improve health care in the European Union is very important."
"The information provided by Mr Mantovani, which illustrates that the viability of social systems, especially care services for the elderly, has deteriorated dramatically and that we really do need cooperation at Community level, is equally important."
"The ageing population, the increasingly technological nature of services for the elderly, the special programme needed and the increase in the prosperity index are creating huge problems which need to be addressed."
"As you know, the Barcelona European Council called on the Commission and the Member States to work together in this sector."
"The Commission presented its first communication in December 2001 and this parliamentary report is in response to it."
"A series of questionnaires was sent to the Member States in the autumn."
"They have now been returned and the Commission is working on a new report which will be presented to the Employment Council and then to the European Council in 2003."
"I should like to point out that this whole procedure centres around social protection rather than care issues."
"Our aim is to make sure that citizens, especially elderly citizens, have access to a high standard of affordable care and long-term care services, which is what the elderly generally require, and to address the question of cost, which often exceeds the financial resources of both the patients and their families."
"Another important objective is the economic viability of care services faced with an ageing population which, as I said earlier, is one of the main causes of the crises in a number of Member States and will be one of the main causes of future crises in others."
"This entire process forms part of a coordinated strategy to modernise social protection systems."
"The Commission proposed this strategy in 1999 as part of the social agenda under the Lisbon strategy."
"Of course, this report will influence our work throughout 2003 and I think that both Parliament and the Commission will be formulating the same urgent request to the Member States to cooperate and teach each other so that three basic objectives can be achieved: access to these systems for the elderly, the provision of quality services and economic viability."
"We are working constantly on the comparability of the data and indices needed to facilitate cooperation between the Member States."
"The Commission will issue a new communication on measures which need to be taken during the current year on the basis of this experience and the work I referred to earlier."
"Obviously, the entire procedure comes under the Community strategy on public health and the Community action programme which has finally been approved and to which Mr Berend referred."
"Mr Mantovani's report also examines a whole series of other issues relating to public health and the free movement of people and services on the internal market."
"These are important issues which we shall continue to work on, using appropriate political tools and bearing in mind that they need to be complementary and cohesive."
"I should like to finish with the candidate countries."
"Last year, my services started a series of studies into the social protection systems in the 13 candidate countries and they are currently examining health care systems."
"The conclusions of these studies, which were discussed in Brussels on 5 and 6 December, will be available to you shortly."
"Mr President, as has already been said, this is one of the major issues facing the European Union."
"As the elderly population increases, we need to work out ways of coping with it and to find a strategy across the European Union which really works."
"But this is ultimately the responsibility of Member States."
"Our challenge is to ensure that Member States carry on with their own provision, but with coordination and cooperation and the sharing of best practice throughout the European Union."
"We must also be aware that not all elderly people fall into the same category."
"Elderly people should be encouraged to remain active because otherwise, as previous speakers have said, this will ultimately cost more money than we are able to afford at the moment."
"So we need to find a sustainable way of keeping people active and healthy for as long as possible."
"I welcome Mr Mantovani's report and the Commission communication."
"We must ensure that, sooner rather than later, there is real dialogue between Member States and an exchange of best practice, so that we can put the strategies into effect and make this a reality."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my compliments to Mr Mario Mantovani, who has carried out the onerous task of determining the difficult challenges which health care systems and public health polices in European Union countries will have to face, in view of the ageing of the population, and, not least, in view of enlargement."
"Although the provision of health care in general and care for the elderly in particular is essentially the responsibility of the Member States, it is right that we look to broader European cooperation in order to face these problems, given the extremely difficult situation which countries continue to experience."
"One of the difficulties is the nursing shortage: in fact, an ever-increasing number of nurses will be needed."
"The increased life expectancy of the European population, with a growing adult proportion, will create the difficult question of the staff who must care for them, staff who must, moreover, be increasingly qualified owing to the specific nature of the diseases which affect the elderly."
"Employment of nursing staff has already increased by more than twice the average in the last five years: a level of employment which, however, is still not enough to meet the demand."
"Secondly, it is easy to foresee that this shortage will be felt particularly keenly when, thanks to enlargement, there will be increased mobility of patients from the CEEC, whose health systems provide less than those in the Community, because they will automatically turn to cross-border health services."
"From this point of view, an issue comes to the fore: ensuring a high level of human health protection, as set out in Article 152 of the Treaty of Amsterdam and as specified by the goals of the Community action programme in the field of public health, which, moreover, calls for universal and equal access to health services, the constant improvement of these services and promotion of the social inclusion of people with disabilities and people in the most vulnerable categories."
"Qualitative principles in the field of health care can be put into effect through the creation of specialised higher training for nurses, financed by European training funds, which encourage people to obtain further professional qualifications in important areas such as oncology, transplants, heart surgery and all the age-related diseases."
"With the launch of this higher training, we will ensure access to health services for European citizens, the provision of high-quality care and financially sustainable care systems, which is included in the three objectives proposed by the Barcelona European Council."
"In order to ensure care for all, however, the European Union Member States need to take steps to raise young people's awareness of paramedical professions."
"The solution to this problem must be implemented quickly since it concerns all the Member States."
"It is all well and good to raise awareness of the profession among young people of the Member States but, up to now, this has been on too small a scale, so much so that there are far fewer qualified nurses than the countries need."
"This opportunity should therefore also be extended to CEEC qualifications, in order to resolve a twofold problem quickly: to respond to the nursing crisis in the Member States and to respond to the situation of countless immigrants seeking work in Europe."
"What I am about to say may sound like a provocation, but I cannot avoid talking to you about another serious problem which concerns citizens from every European country, that is the 500 000 job cuts in the engineering industry over the next four or five years, a figure I have been given by an international trade union source."
"This employment problem could be resolved in part though the transfer of qualified resources from one sector to another."
"The mobility and retraining of the unemployed engineering workers who hold an advanced secondary education qualification could be achieved by providing them with access to information on nursing."
"I would close by calling on everyone to reflect on what has been said regarding the need to remedy as soon as possible the nursing shortage in the European Union, the need to meet the quality criteria for care specified in the Community action programme by providing higher training, and the need to respond to the specific employment needs of the citizens of the Member States with solutions such as mobility and retraining, looking, where these prove inadequate, to human resources from the countries of Central and Eastern Europe."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, rapporteur, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Mantovani on the quality of his report, which I believe is serious and well-balanced."
"I have heard it said on occasions that we cannot give our opinion on numbers and therefore we are saying nothing new when we say that world demographic tendencies reveal a gradual ageing of the population."
"The rapporteur has already mentioned the percentage of the European population over the age of 65, 16 %, an estimated 22 % and 27.5 % for 2025 and 2050, and that the number of people over 80 is going to increase as well, from 3.6% in 2000 to 6% in 2025 and to 10% in 2050."
"In view of these statistics it is no good to bury our heads in the sand like an ostrich and wait to see what happens and nor must we be alarmist."
"The demographic situation is obviously a success for society, which can be attributed to medical care and an improvement in living conditions in general."
"Elderly people do not make up an homogenous group and their needs therefore also vary."
"Policies relating to the elderly must focus on the double perspective of their needs and the care they require - and which they have a right to - in order to meet those needs, and of their potential and the services they lend to society."
"No society - including European society - can afford not to take advantage of the contributions elderly people can make in terms of their experience, training and knowledge."
"As well as Article 152 of the Treaty, these policies comply with Article 21 of the European Union's Charter of Fundamental Rights, by prohibiting all discrimination - in this case on grounds of age - and Article 25, stating that the Union recognises and respects the rights of the elderly to lead a life of dignity and independence and to participate in social and cultural life."
"These principles would be deprived of content if they were not accompanied by policies to turn them into realities."
"In this regard, the Barcelona Council of March 2002 pointed out the need to initiate and develop cooperation between the Member States on these issues during 2002 and 2003, the need for an exchange of good practices and information and the need to hold a debate on the common challenges at European level."
"Healthcare systems must face a triple challenge."
"Firstly, access to care for all, with the special characteristics of care for the elderly; secondly, a high degree of quality and, thirdly, the financial sustainability of the systems."
"I believe these are three necessary, minimal and laudable objectives, and I would like to draw attention to the close link between them."
"Whatever the system of funding, taxation or contributions, their achievement can and must be promoted also through the promotion of healthier lifestyles, prevention measures and increasing awareness on the part of service providers and users on the correct application of therapies and medications."
"This will allow a balance between the three objectives."
"The risk of prioritising the objective of financial sustainability could undermine those of quality and accessibility, but also, without sustainability, quality and accessibility would only be possible in the short term."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by extending my very warm thanks to Mr Mantovani for his excellent cooperation."
"I think we have succeeded in securing a broad majority in tomorrow's plenary for this most important report."
"It is also timely that we should at last achieve closer cooperation in health policy and, of course, also in care for the elderly, something to which the Gothenburg Summit, albeit very late in the day, pointed the way."
"Let us just be honest."
"In matters of health policy, the EU is still catching up with reality."
"In many fields, after all, a European health policy already exists - the Euregios spring to mind."
"Even now, to take an example, patients in the German Rhineland have the right to use their German health insurance cards to obtain treatment in health centres in the Netherlands."
"Apart from that, Europe has hospitals generally recognised as specialising in specific diseases, and there are also European networks that draw up guidelines for the treatment of those diseases."
"All the Member States are looking for strategies to guarantee that their health care systems will, in future, remain accessible to all and to secure their standards of quality and performance, as well as ensuring that it is possible to finance them."
"New mechanisms are constantly being tried out, but, as yet, nobody has made the great breakthrough."
"So, when governments realise the importance of organising an EU-wide exchange of experience on matters concerning health care and the care of the elderly, they are simply being logically consistent."
"Just to take the wind out of the sceptics' sails, let me say that I am convinced that nobody in this House actively wants a single European system of health care."
"The Commission does not, and the Council very definitely does not."
"The organisation and funding of health care systems is a matter decided at the national level and should remain so in future."
"It is far more a case of how we are to retain, in the long term, our European model of a health care policy based on solidarity."
"I am speaking quite deliberately in terms of a European model, as the following four principles underlie all health care systems."
"The first is that health is not, and must not be allowed to become, a purely economic commodity."
"The second is that equal access to health services is a fundamental right and must remain one."
"The third is that, as has already been said, all systems of health care are based upon the principle of solidarity."
"And the fourth is that the State has a crucial role to play in regulating, funding and providing services."
"Now, the Mantovani report makes quite practical proposals as to what enhanced European cooperation in health care policy might be like."
"These proposals have to do with methodology, objectives and specific content."
"As regards the working method, the report proposes that the open method of coordination should now be brought into play in this area as it has been elsewhere, which is consonant - I am very glad to say - with what the Greek Presidency has said."
"Now, though, we must not lose any more time, and it is for that reason that the report urges the forthcoming European spring summit to resolve upon a precise timetable for further action and to agree on common targets and indicators within one year."
"If, though, we are to be able to carry out any kind of exchange of experience, we have to start by improving the national and European systems of health monitoring."
"Comparable data are absolutely indispensable here, but to date the EU has not even had a standard measurement of mortality rates."
"This is where we can even now make progress by using the new action programme on health care policy."
"The same is true of the establishment of common criteria for patients' rights, and, in view of eastward enlargement in particular, there is a need for a survey of patient mobility in the Euregios, for we know all too well that the shortfall in health care provision is especially pronounced in the regions bordering on the new Member States, and any European constitution must not only stipulate a high standard of health care as an objective, but also health policy's continuing status as a responsibility shared between the EU and the Member States."
"We do all, after all, want the EU to be able to keep on, in future, using legislation to supplement the Member States' policies."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking Mr Mantovani for the work he has done on this report."
"I say that, even though there are features of the report in its final form with which my group disagrees."
"I should like to thank the Commission for the survey it has given us of future care for the elderly, for I do believe that the Commission communication is genuinely constructive."
"It indicates a number of overriding goals in terms of access, quality and financial sustainability."
"It also points out that, even though we know that there will be many more elderly people in the future, it is quite uncertain what that will actually mean in the form of future financial burdens."
"Over and above this, it points out that, in many areas, the EU has opportunities to make joint contributions under the current rules."
"That is true in relation to public health policy, on the basis of Article 152 of the Treaty, to economic policy and to the development of the internal market."
"We therefore have a host of opportunities for cooperating under the existing rules."
"My group must therefore also reject Parliament's present proposal, as put forward in the report, that we should introduce outright open coordination when it comes to health policy and policy in relation to the elderly."
"We have tabled a number of amendments, and if, as I really believe will be the case, it is not possible for these to be supported by Parliament, we shall find it difficult to support the report as a whole."
"The open coordination method has, of course, become very popular in recent years and is used in a great many areas of economic policy, such as pensions, social exclusion within education and the convergence criteria in employment policy. It is a good form of cooperation in which a number of common objectives are set that can be achieved in different ways."
"I am a great believer in using open coordination because it is a way of achieving common objectives without needing to legislate in a lot of new areas, but I think it important that open coordination be binding."
"In some areas, open coordination is directly authorised by the treaties."
"That applies in the case of economic policy and employment policy."
"In other areas, there is a less obvious basis in the treaties, or else there is really no basis."
"It might be said that the Member States have every possible freedom to decide to coordinate their efforts and develop good practice."
"That is something we have done within the framework of the OSCD for many years, but the difference between OSCD reports and the open coordination we undertake within the framework of the EU is - and, in my view, should be - that open coordination is more binding and that the countries in actual fact undertake to pursue the common objectives. In addition, the parties concerned are very actively involved."
"I think it would be wrong of us to allow the use of open coordination to escalate to the point of its being used in every possible area."
"It is of course a basic principle of EU cooperation that we accept diversity and difference."
"It is an advantage that we have many different models so that we can learn from each other."
"We must not sneak harmonisation in through the back door in areas where national competence should clearly apply."
"That is not something for which we would be thanked."
"In the health sphere, there are many areas in which cooperation and common rules are important and necessary, and there are therefore clear rules about this in the Treaty."
"Cooperation will develop via the internal market, as a result of that internal market and through other cooperation, such as cooperation on research."
"As for a common EU policy on residential homes, however, my response is no thank you."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the institutions of the European Union and of the Member States need to pay special attention to health care and in particular to care for the elderly, because health is a fundamental human and social right recognised in international and national legislation."
"So it is important to give absolute priority to policies and measures based on an integrated approach which aim to promote health, ensure primary prevention, eliminate health risks, include a high level of health protection and which define and implement sectoral policies designed to eliminate health inequality."
"It is also worth highlighting the close relationship between socio-economic measures and health, particularly in the fields of employment, housing, education, transport, income distribution and social welfare."
"The emphasis placed on monetary policies, on giving priority to nominal convergence and on maintaining the blinkered criteria of the Stability Pact is leading to restrictive social policies and being used to justify such policies, and it is having a negative impact on public health policies and on health care for the elderly, as has become clear in Portugal."
"The Commission communication on this subject, which the report welcomes despite some occasional criticisms, is indicative of the contradictions in social policies."
"Despite statements about defending the quality and accessibility of health care, too much weight is given to the objective of achieving financial viability with a view to establishing an internal market in health services and products. This could lead to the liberalisation and privatisation of an essential public service, which health certainly is, whilst ultimately jeopardising equality of access to high-quality health services."
"This is an untenable position and it is the main reason why we intend to reject the report before us if it is not revised on this key point, and if the amendments that we are tabling are not approved. These amendments advocate better quality health services, security and solidarity, and propose new means of financing statutory retirement schemes with a view in particular to extending social welfare contributions to all income, at a rate identical to that levied on wages and salaries."
"The challenge here therefore remains that of achieving some coherence amongst those who say that they are committed to defending health care and care for the elderly."
"Mr President, I welcome the opportunity for debate on this report, on what is an important issue for all our countries."
"I am grateful to Mr Mantovani for his work."
"Caring for the ageing population throughout Europe will be one of the biggest challenges facing the Member States in the future."
"Although, as has already been said, the organisation of health care is a matter reserved for Member States, they cannot do this in isolation."
"That is why my group welcomes the cooperation suggested by the Commission, in terms of exchanging information and best practice and developing common quality standards."
"The current provision and funding systems for care of the elderly vary greatly throughout Europe, from comprehensive free care with financial risks spread throughout the population to state funding as a last resort safety net."
"Drawing comparisons and exploring the care systems within Member States could be a valuable way of highlighting successful solutions."
"I welcome the reference in Mr Mantovani's report to social care as well as health care, as the combination of both is an essential element in the welfare of older people."
"If those responsible for health and social policy took a real life-long approach to preventing disease and disability and viewed health promotion and prevention as the cornerstone of a 'foresighted policy', in the words of the report, this would not only improve health but would also cut costs."
"The reduction in costs would not be temporary or short term, but long term."
"For example, we know that older women and people in rural areas experience greater levels of poverty."
"In my constituency in Wales, three out of five older people live in poverty."
"Most pensioners depend entirely on their state pension or other state benefits as their only income."
"More people have long-term illnesses in Wales than in England or Scotland."
"These facts are not unrelated."
"Some methods of health prevention and early detection of illness are essential."
"Hand-in-hand with this is the importance of a multi-agency approach to coordinating care and a multi-sectoral approach to policy-making, to include social, employment, environmental and economic considerations as well as the need to involve users and their families."
"The elderly play a very valuable role in our society."
"Life-long learning, communication between the generations, voluntary work and similar issues on which the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has done a lot of work are intrinsically related to this discussion."
"Trying to establish a free market of care and treatment and harmonising health care systems has its dangers."
"Meeting the Stability Pact requirements, whilst providing the necessary funding for health, welfare and social services, is a major challenge."
"Health care, as I said earlier, is the responsibility of the Member States."
"The references in this report to an internal market in health services and products reflects the move towards liberalisation."
"As has been seen time after time and as we see in the private finance initiative in health services in the UK, privatisation does not improve services or reduce costs, but leads to longer waiting lists, worse levels of care and staff shortages."
"My group believes that health care and the care of the elderly is too important to be put at risk by privatisation and the GATS Agreement."
"The focus of this report and one of the main issues in this debate must be equality of access."
"This means access to care for everyone and securing a local supply of services."
"GATS threatens this."
"I would ask, therefore, for support of Amendment No 6, to call for exemption of health and care services from GATS, ensuring that the very good proposals made by Mr Mantovani - which I hope will be adopted by Parliament tomorrow - can be implemented and services to older people secured for the long term."
"Mr President, I too would like to join my colleagues in congratulating and thanking the rapporteur, Mr Mantovani, for his work, and also to thank the Commission for coming forward with the proposal."
"Care for the frail and elderly is a challenge that faces us all and unfortunately it is one that we will probably all face ourselves at some stage in our lives."
"How we provide care and services for people is how we will be judged."
"Health care and care of the elderly, whilst an important part of the overall health system, does not necessarily represent the overall health system."
"There is a tendency in the report to assume that issues concerning health care of the elderly apply to the health system as a whole."
"A detailed study on the financing of long-term care for older people is being carried out in my own country, Ireland."
"I look forward to examining the policy proposals which this will bring forward."
"Particular attention has been paid in the report to meeting long-term care needs, reducing unnecessary recourse to institutional care and widening consumer choice."
"In Ireland we have a very active health policy to give old people a better way of life."
"The implications of Amendments Nos 1 to 6 run counter to this policy."
"I am able to support Amendments Nos 7 to 11 on replacing the 'open method of cooperation' with 'cooperation'."
"Also, in the area of private financing for the health service, there must be a risk equalisation element whereby, if you bring in a private health insurer for the health care system, they must take the same risk as existing insurers or the state, which means covering everyone and all sections of society."
"We have been developing our own health strategy which includes payments and allowances for carers, including carers looking after two or more people."
"Another aspect I want to highlight is the changing role of the family and community."
"We must ensure that support is put in place to allow people to remain in their families and their local communities as much as possible."
"In providing and caring for the elderly, that will mean utilising new technologies and new methods of ensuring that they have independent means of living and can fully participate in their own community."
"All Member States have faced the same common issues: how to address the impact of demographic ageing or healthcare systems and expenditure, how to use the new technologies for the benefit of the elderly, how to ensure a better standard and quality of life for the elderly."
"Sharing information in these areas can only be beneficial."
"I would also like to congratulate my colleague, Mr Mussa, for his work on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy in tackling issues which were not fully addressed in the Commission proposal, in particular training for health professionals, nurses and those involved in specific expert care for the elderly."
"These are now being included in the report by Mr Mantovani."
"That is a welcome move."
"There are many organisations that want to work in assisting the elderly."
"This year - 2003 - is the year of the disabled."
"There are many elderly people who suffer from disabilities as well."
"We must ensure that we not only pay lip service to the disabled this year, but also give particular emphasis to those who cannot speak for themselves, and mostly that means the elderly disabled."
"We all want to grow old, but we would prefer not to be old."
"This is a Dutch expression about the consequences of getting older."
"After all, age generally comes with ailments."
"Ailments which, with proper attention and care, a person can live with. This proper attention and care involves people."
"People who provide the necessary hands-on care."
"With the support of good policy and the commitment of politicians, this can be accommodated."
"Mr Mantovani's report aims to provide the space to do so from a European perspective."
"He puts forward a range of proposals based on a great concern about the demographic trend towards an ageing population and the consequences this will have for our health systems."
"In addition to expressing my appreciation for the report, I would like to indicate why, in my opinion, his proposals lose sight of the reality of care provision."
"The report is brimming over with the politics of good intentions."
"Good intentions alone will not, in my opinion, be the mainspring of political and policy-related activities."
"Certainly not if Europe would have to be given new powers on such a basis."
"Assigning powers to European institutions is a failure to appreciate the fact that care is provided between people at the micro level."
"Promoting good healthcare and exchanging good practices are points I endorse."
"Also of great importance is the fact that it is made clear that healthcare and care of the elderly must not only be approached from the point of view of what it costs."
"Elderly people and patients are more than just an item of expense to society."
"The number of new policy-coordinating proposals and inventories will not, in my opinion, promote good care and assistance but will rather impede it."
"In my country there is a lot of discussion about healthcare at the moment."
"Dozens of rules, procedures and administrative obligations are impeding the work of nurses and carers."
"If one thing has become clear, it is that we need hands at the bedside and not at the computer."
"If we also have to comply with European wishes in respect of the provision of information, you will understand that there are few hands left over to actually provide the care."
"Although many of Mr Mantovani's ideas appeal to me, I cannot endorse his report."
"The report misunderstands the position of the concept of subsidiarity when it comes to the role of Europe and the role of the Member States in these areas of policy."
"The report furthermore disregards day-to-day practice."
"Practice is not waiting for new rules from Europe, it is waiting for people who want to do the work."
"You will understand that I do not regard the European institutions and the Convention as being assigned a role in the policy areas of care for the elderly and healthcare."
"I therefore support Mrs Lynne's amendments concerning scrapping paragraphs 18 and 20."
"This will ensure that responsibility for healthcare and care for the elderly remains with the national governments."
"It is there that the parameters are established and a substantive policy can be pursued that enables us to respond to the people's demand for care."
"Finally, I would like to point out the importance of interrelationships between people in family, church or home circles."
"That is where the care is provided in practice, at the micro level."
"It is pointless worrying about care, you have to go out and do it!"
"Mr President, let me begin by disagreeing with Mr Blokland for once, and I will explain to Hans why later."
"I would like wholeheartedly to support the proposal from the European Commission, together with my colleague's, Mr Mantovani's, proposal."
"In Europe we all have the same problem."
"We all have healthcare that is expanding, certainly financially."
"Why?"
"Because we are dealing with emancipated citizens, citizens who have a different lifestyle, citizens who want more and who want better quality."
"We also have facilities that are making healthcare more expensive."
"We all want to keep this system under control, but we would all also like to be able to respond to this justified demand on the part of our citizens."
"This means we will have to discuss a number of matters with each other, perhaps not with a view to doing everything in the same way but with a view to finding out how we can all learn from each other's experience."
"Incidentally, I must now make a critical comment about the communication from the European Commission."
"In the Netherlands, healthcare is not financed via taxes but via premiums; the situation is therefore different from what it says in the communication."
"I also see that the communication - and this is why I am so much in favour of this open method of coordination - states that in those countries in which only a small proportion is financed via private insurance and the bulk via taxes, the best example in the table being Luxembourg, the per capita cost of healthcare is simply considerably lower."
"That is therefore something that we can learn from one another."
"What we should also have learned from one another is that Europe actually plays a major role in the field of healthcare already, despite the fact that we have little to say formally."
"Firstly via the article in the Treaty in which achieving a high level of healthcare protection is stated as an objective."
"Incidentally, Hans, Dutch citizens benefit a lot from this."
"Secondly via the deepening of the internal market; we do in fact have a great deal to say about appliances and certainly also about medicines."
"So we should - and I would like to ask the Commissioner if she agrees - come up with solutions for the shortages and gaps in order to achieve proper financeability."
"In this case I am thinking about the whole range of medicines, for example."
"If we were to do something about generic medicines, we would be able to save EUR 500 million a year in our country alone."
"I therefore say to the Commissioner: do something about it, start taking targeted action on this point in consultation with your colleague Mr Byrne."
"Now to go back briefly to that high level of protection."
"The Dutch citizen benefits from that too."
"Why?"
"Because with that high level, we can at least arrange for people to have the opportunity to go abroad for healthcare if care in the Netherlands is inadequate because it is a demand-led system, the last communist system still in existence in Europe."
"Furthermore, we cannot declare a certain treatment to be experimental."
"No, that has all been tested by the European Court of Justice."
"I am convinced that Europe can do a lot, does do a lot and should actually do even more in the area of healthcare, even if it is initially via the open coordination method."
"In any event the first reports reveal that we can learn an awful lot from one another."
"Mr President, like other Members, I would firstly like to thank and congratulate the Commissioner and the rapporteur, Mr Mantovani, because I believe it has really been an excellent idea to produce a communication on the needs relating to healthcare and the care of elderly people."
"Commissioner, holding this debate is consistent with all this House's concerns about the needs of elderly people, and it is very helpful that Mr Mantovani's report has achieved such a broad consensus on certain very important ideas."
"I am one of those people who believe that the dignity of a society is basically measured by the dignity with which it treats its elderly people;"
"I also believe that issues relating to health, rather than being commercial goods, are a matter of rights."
"Fortunately, Mr Mantovani's report and the amendments which I hope we will approve tomorrow and others which we will reject - I hope - will highlight these elements, which are fundamental to the future of Europe."
"I am pleased that it moves in this direction, that it stresses the coordination elements which the Commissioner has mentioned, that it maintains the open coordination method, and I hope that this is the beginning of a broader consideration, so that it may also reach other elements of our society."
"As the Commission has said in some of its documents, Europe - despite its great progress and despite having increased its standard of living and life expectancy over recent decades - still has problems such as the fact that one in every five citizens dies prematurely; the new risks; inequalities and differences on health issues, ..."
"These problems are not exclusive to elderly people, but they are problems and issues for all European citizens, who are appealing to us, to the politicians, to the European Convention, to finally treat Europe as an area in which there can be competition but also cooperation and solidarity."
"The European citizens are asking for it for essential elements of their lives such as health."
"I therefore hope that this method of open coordination, this detailed and exhaustive approximation of health needs - but also social needs and the humanisation of the lives of the elderly - and of these problems, is extended in future communications."
"I hope that we will have new instruments so that Europe is not just a market, but also a collection of rights and a source of hope, which is what the public are asking us for."
"Mr President, as a visibly greying member of the population I have a considerable interest in this debate, as do many others in this House."
"I have some concern about the climate of it."
"I would like to believe that it is genuinely about providing universal high-quality care in a variety of situations and circumstances, but that is certainly not the tone of the debate as it often comes across in a number of our Member States, where it seems to be all about how we can cut costs and find the money to make provisions."
"As others have said, that is not the only way in which we should be looking at this issue, if we should be looking at it that way at all."
"One way of improving the situation is to pay reasonable wages to well-trained and qualified staff."
"I am aware that non-medical care is one of the fastest growing areas in terms of job creation."
"However, it is all too often very poorly paid, it is often done by women, by migrant women, and the staff are often recruited with difficulty."
"It is certainly a boom area for temporary work agencies in the UK."
"Yet those workers are then treated as if they are some sort of disposable commodity and as if the work is unskilled, whereas care work is immensely skilled and stressful."
"We also need to look at the implications of the current employment policy which not only encourages but actively pushes more people, especially women, into the workforce and away from the caring role they might have fulfilled or the voluntary work they might have done."
"I am not saying that women should be forced to stay at home."
"I have never believed that."
"But it means that we must look carefully at the financial and social support for carers, which should reflect the much larger costs that society would otherwise bear."
"We also need to recognise that carers who are in work need leave provision, not just parents."
"We need to look at the employment needs of carers."
"I am pleased to say that the equal funding is being used for at least one such project involving the UK."
"Some of my other concerns also focus on the issue of discrimination in the provision of health care for the elderly."
"This is observed in quite a number of Member States."
"It is a useful area for comparison between Member States and might at some point be part of another horizontal directive for Article 13."
"We mentioned in the debate the issue of an adequate income for older people."
"I am very pleased that paragraph 7 of Mr Mantovani's report, quoting the World Health Organisation, talks about health being best served in a more socially cohesive, egalitarian society with a smaller burden of relative deprivation."
"People have raised the question of the internal market in health care, not just in terms of cross-border treatment, although, judging by the post I receive, the ability to transfer disability allowances and carers' allowances across borders under Regulation 1408/71 would be welcomed."
"It is also an issue of cross-border service providers and increasing provision from third country providers."
"As Mrs Evans said, it is not yet clear what impact the future negotiation on GATS will have on service provision and which aspects of health care and other care for the elderly will be put into any EU offer for discussion under the World Trade Organisation's agreements."
"It is certainly the view of my group that such services should not be included."
"It is also clear that at some point we will need a framework for the cross-border liability of service providers."
"I agree with Mr Crowley on the issue of risk equalisation in the private sector, to avoid cherry-picking of the purely profitable."
"We also need to consider, both inside and outside the Convention, to what extent health care and general care are services of general interest and whether universal and affordable access should be guaranteed in the Treaties of the European Union."
"We have to look further at what constitutes goods or services in health and other care."
"I am aware that Denmark has already introduced legislation on this."
"It would be another useful area for comparison in an open method of coordination."
"Mr President, Commissioner, this report is good, the Commission proposal is a good one, and, although you, Commissioner, can be thanked for this, permit me one comment."
"I found in the report the word 'Überalterung'."
"I do not know what that is in Greek, English, or any other language, but in German it amounts to quite offensive discrimination against older - or as the word in question would have it, superannuated - people."
"When one is no longer as young and beautiful as you are, but, like me, is in one's seventieth year, that sort of thing causes an enormous amount of anguish."
"Let us at last stop using these stupid expressions about the superannuation or geriatrification of Europe."
"Even though you can read it all over the media, it is quite simply not true."
"Never have there been so many people alive in Europe as there are today and never before has there been such high life expectancy as there is now."
"As recently as 150 years ago, average life expectancy was around 40 years, and now it is 80."
"Any girl born today has the chance to live to a hundred."
"People today have the good fortune to be able, at long last, to live to an age that has in fact always been genetically possible."
"So let us stop talking about any geriatrification of Europe or about its superannuation."
"I assume that this has simply escaped your notice."
"Please stop talking about people being superannuated."
"Let me make another comment."
"In the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, I tabled a whole series of amendments, all of which were adopted."
"I am very pleased about that."
"There is one amendment of which I am particularly proud, Commissioner, and it is one that I should especially like to commend to you."
"It has to do with something that is a quite splendid addition to what has been achieved in terms of family and social policy - continued remuneration for one week in the year in the event of a person remaining at home to care for a close family member - perhaps a parent or grandparent - who has become ill."
"That is the law in Austria, so that any working person can stay at home for one week in the year to care for his or her elderly family members."
"I think it is a great thing that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has adopted this amendment."
"I hope that we will do the same when we vote tomorrow."
"Commissioner, I commend this matter to your care."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by congratulating Mr Mantovani on his excellent report, which highlights the need to guarantee people's right to high-quality protection against health risks and loss of independence, and the importance of ensuring that that right reflects the challenges of our times, and in particular the demographic trend towards an ageing population."
"That phenomenon is the result of low birth rates and increased life expectancy, especially amongst women."
"In less than one decade, between 1990 and 1999, the number of women over 65 has increased by nearly 3%."
"The effects of an ageing population are being felt at various levels."
"In Portugal, for example, if we consider the population of working age, greater longevity amongst women means that since 1995 the number of elderly women has been greater than that of young women."
"At the same time, the increase in the number of elderly persons is imposing a greater burden on health care and social services."
"The issue we face is a simple and intuitive one. Society cannot be said to be progressing if greater life expectancy is not matched by improvements in quality of life."
"So the great challenge for us is to achieve a high level of satisfaction amongst the elderly with their quality of life, while keeping the costs that this involves in check."
"This will inevitably make demands on public finance, which plays a key part in expenditure on health in all the Member States."
"Even in Greece, the country where public finance makes the lowest contribution to health services, the figure is about 56%, rising to 84% in the United Kingdom."
"An ageing population will have a considerable impact on budgets, which will in turn increase public expenditure."
"Health care systems in the European Union should therefore be pursuing the objective of being simultaneously accessible, high in quality and financially viable."
"Each Member State is responsible for the organisation and financing of its own social protection system."
"Nevertheless, this responsibility is increasingly being exercised in an overall context that affects various Community policies."
"For this reason, as has already been mentioned, the Barcelona European Council stressed the need to establish and develop closer cooperation between the Member States as regards social protection, exchanges of good practice and information, research, establishing common indicators and standards and the development of health and social services for the elderly."
"Lastly, I believe that the Greek Presidency should examine the European Community strategy and action programme in the field of public health, with a view to the next European Council in the spring adopting the use of the open method of coordination and a precise timetable for cooperation between the Member States."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Flemming's remarks oblige me to say that we should not view this report in isolation from other reports and initiatives, for example, the Lisbon strategy, which also aims towards social cohesion and sustainability, the Commission report on the evaluation of national strategies for adequate and sustainable pensions, or the Streamlining Report on the coordination of employment policy with economic policy."
"All these serve the purpose of ensuring that our social security system continues to be financially viable, because that is what is needed."
"Demographic changes are relevant to every area of policy and have effects on the social fabric and on the socio-political framework, and so I welcome this report and this debate as helping to increase our awareness of these things."
"Action is needed, on the part of all of and us at every political level."
"A survey by Eurostat, a few days ago, showed that in 2002 there were fewer births, but more deaths, recorded in the EU."
"The number of live births in the EU reached 3.99 million in 2002, which is 0.3% fewer than in 2001."
"It is estimated that, in 2002, some 3.68 million people died in the EU, which amounts to some 60 000 more than in 2001."
"These figures alone show that our society faces a change which will affect policy on social security, employment, finance and the economy."
"There is just one aspect that I would like to pick out - that of care."
"In my country - Austria - alone, 540 000 people are at present in need of help and care."
"This figure will increase to just over 800 000 by 2011."
"At the same time, 84% of all those in need of care - and this is the case in all countries - receive that care from members of their own family."
"Only 26% require or receive additional help or avail themselves of it."
"Demographic and economic changes mean, though, that the family members who provide care are becoming fewer in number."
"The number of people employed in the care field has increased by 5.5%, so the health and welfare sector is creating jobs."
"Underdevelopment of many areas of the mobile care and support services means that far from all the sufficiently trained staff can be employed. I therefore demand certain things above all in this context."
"Among other things, we should be attaching greater importance to the mobile services and to the services needed to supplement them - hospices, family support, and day centres - and extending them."
"There is a need for a build-up of resources in personal environments and for more extensive support both for recipients of care and for their families."
"In my view, though, we also need uniform standards of training and professional development, as aid is often required across national boundaries."
"The caring professions need a campaign to enhance their image and we have to explore why they are so unstable and why staff remain in them for so short a time."
"Care is one of the greatest challenges of our time, and we need European standards for it."
"Thank you very much, Mr Karas."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"(The sitting was closed at 11.07 p.m.)"
"Afghanistan: one year after the Bonn Agreement"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on Afghanistan, one year after the Bonn Agreement."
"Mr Yiannitsis, President-in-Office of the Council, has the floor."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is now a year since the Bonn Agreement was signed in 2001 and, as we look back over what has already been done and what has yet to be done in order to ensure it is fully implemented, I would point out that this Agreement laid the foundations for a new, modern Afghan state and that there is cause for reserved satisfaction with the progress it has made so far."
"Once a transitional authority and administration had been set up, an emergency Loya Jirga was convened and elected a president."
"A Judicial Commission and an Independent Human Rights Commission have been set up."
"A central bank has been established and has introduced a national currency."
"A drafting committee has been set up as a forerunner to a Constitutional Commission."
"A proposal has been adopted for a national development framework, which will be used as a guide for rebuilding and improving the situation in the country."
"President Karzai has issued a decree creating an Afghan national army, an important step towards Afghan ownership in the field of security and stability."
"On 22 December 2002, Afghanistan and its six neighbours signed the Kabul Declaration of Good Neighbourly Relations, in which they agreed not to interfere in each other's internal affairs; this will do a great deal to foster peace and stability in the region."
"Generally speaking, President Karzai and the Afghan Transitional Administration have achieved substantial results and the Bonn Process is on the right track."
"During the Petersberg Conference on 2 December reaffirming the commitment to supporting the Bonn Agreement on Afghanistan and inject new impetus into efforts to rebuild the country, a declaration was issued containing a clear reference to the objectives and timetable for applying the Bonn Process, introducing a new constitution and holding elections in 2004."
"Both the Afghan Transitional Administration and the international community, however, still have a great many challenges to meet between now and then."
"Over the past six months there have been a number of reforms, some visible reconstruction and limited restoration of the balance of power both within the central administration and between the centre and the regions."
"Progress needs to be made in these sectors in order to boost the confidence of the Afghan people, which is the key to support for the administration."
"The whole idea behind the Bonn Agreement was that transitional arrangements should be based on traditional, local, national and religious structures in Afghanistan. And every effort must be made to ensure there is proper representation, in accordance with rules introduced by the central administration."
"Consequently, the administration will need to introduce even greater order over coming months, keep a lid on hostilities and improve how the institutions function, because otherwise it risks incurring the disappointment of the people, with the risk of their turning their back on the central administration, relaxing in their efforts to meet the demands of the international community and jeopardising the efforts being made to achieve the objectives of the Bonn Agreement."
"By definition the administration is fragmented, with its members coming as they do from every corner of the country, which is why it is vital for it to consolidate its efforts and speed up the process to rebuild the country."
"One way of supporting the central administration is to ensure that all aid is channelled through it; this will affirm its authority to the entire country and ensure that neighbouring countries and local leaders are on board."
"Security continues to be a priority and we feel that all the Afghan groups should be encouraged to solve their grievances in a peaceful manner."
"We share the view of the Afghan people that, as long as there is a state of insecurity, the degree of progress hoped for has still not been made."
"Rebuilding the country's economy should also be a priority."
"The Afghan authorities need to work with the International Monetary Fund and introduce an efficient and cohesive macroeconomic and monetary framework within which stable economic development can be fostered and donors' contributions invested."
"As part of this, we need to encourage the Tokyo donors to make the promised funds available through the national investment budget presented by the Afghan administration."
"Naturally, Community aid to Afghanistan will continue to be provided on terms dictated by the basic principles and values we subscribe to as members of western society."
"Our terms are geared to achieving the aims of the Bonn Agreement and, by extension, ensuring all sides in Afghanistan comply with the procedure set up to achieve peace, a representative government and stability, convict terrorists and stop the illicit production and trafficking of narcotics."
"Community aid must be geared to rebuilding a stable nation, improving the food supply and supporting the return of refugees and exiles."
"Unless democratic values, pluralism and the respect for human rights, including women's rights, are strengthened, there can be no social or political development in Afghanistan."
"We are encouraging the Afghan Transitional Administration, in close consultation with the international community, to establish verifiable benchmarks and timetables to ensure the full implementation of the Bonn Agreement."
"The Council has already expressed its appreciation for the role Turkey assumed as lead nation for the international peacekeeping force and we would like to commend Germany and the Netherlands for agreeing to take over the command of ?SAF for the next six months and wish them every success with this difficult mission."
"I should like to reiterate the European Union's commitment, in cooperation with the United Nations, to help Afghanistan eliminate the illicit production and trafficking of narcotics through accelerated implementation of reconstruction programmes, including in poppy-growing areas, the development of law-enforcement institutions, and provision of an alternative, better livelihood for the local people."
"If Afghanistan is to enter modern statehood, it needs to reform its security, administrative, judicial, financial and social domains."
"We welcome the fact that a constitutional drafting committee has been set up to draft a constitution which will modernise the judicial system and protect human rights."
"However, we note that the Civil Service Commission is not yet fully functioning."
"The European Union is committed to contributing to the work of these bodies."
"The Judicial Commission needs to be strengthened if it is to improve the procedural system."
"We welcome Italy's contribution here in organising the conference on the Afghan legal system in Rome last December."
"We need timetables and benchmarks here in order to ensure the provisions of the Bonn agreement are applied."
"Activating the constitutional drafting committee and adopting an electoral law so that elections can be held by June 2004 are immediate priorities here and the presidency will continue to monitor these issues through the European Union's special representative in Afghanistan."
"2003 will be a crucial year for Afghanistan and will most likely decide the future shape of the country."
"During 2003, President Karzai will need to push through the reforms needed for fast reconstruction and rebuilding, curtail the powers of local leaders, draft a modern, working constitution based on the principles of honest administration, convene a constituent Loya Jirga and start preparations for elections in 2004, so that the Afghan people can realise their aspirations for peace and progress in Afghanistan and determine their own future, free from violence and fear."
"We have reiterated the European Union's continued commitment to delivering a substantial contribution to the reconstruction of Afghanistan."
"Finally, may I remind you that, in its conclusions of 4 December, the Council invited the High Representative and the European Union's special representative, Mr Vendrell, to follow closely the implementation of the Petersberg commitments and, in cooperation with the Commission, to make recommendations for further actions that the European Union can undertake in support of the Afghan Transitional Administration."
"Mr President, I very much welcome this opportunity, with my colleague Mr Ionitsis, to discuss progress in Afghanistan over the past year."
"As I said to the Foreign Affairs Committee in December, the changes have been in many respects dramatic, and do offer a real chance to build a stable democracy."
"But timing is critical; there is - as the Minister properly underlined - a limited window of opportunity which we have to exploit."
"Unless President Karzai and his Government manage to strengthen their position throughout the country, then there is a risk that these early gains will be lost."
"But before turning to the substantial challenges that lie ahead, I would like to say something about the successes of 2002, successes accomplished in extremely difficult circumstances."
"Only a year ago donors met in Tokyo to pledge over USD 1.8 billion for 2002."
"Much has since been achieved in Afghanistan."
"In the summer, President Karzai was elected by an Emergency Loya Jirga to lead the Afghanistan Transitional Authority; constitutional and judicial commissions have been established; a new currency has been introduced, and the process of recovery and of reconstruction is well under way with increasingly strong leadership from the Afghan Government."
"The international community has not only honoured the pledges made at Tokyo, but, not least in comparison with some problems we have experienced in the past, the speed of disbursement has been remarkable."
"The track record of the European Union and the European Commission has been, I think one can fairly say, particularly impressive."
"By early December, EUR 755 million of the total European Union commitment of over EUR 830 million had actually been disbursed."
"The Commission has played a leading role in co-ordinating the European Union effort and we have been actively involved in building up a strategic dialogue on Afghanistan with the United States and other G-8 partners."
"I must say that I am very proud of the quality of the EC assistance programme and the speed with which it has been delivered."
"It is a fine example of a successful linkage between relief and recovery, and it has been a good test case for the reform of the management of the external service."
"It is also fair to pay tribute to the excellent staff we have at the newly set-up EC office in Kabul."
"I would also like to pay tribute to the Special Representative, who brings so much knowledge and so much expertise to his extremely challenging work."
"In more concrete terms, our development programme of over EUR 205 million in 2002 has helped to finance: firstly, the operation of 238 health clinics and over 450 primary schools as part of the Government's 2002 Back to School campaign; secondly, the clearance of landmines and unexploded bombs from more than 8 000 square kilometres of land; thirdly, the return of some 17 000 key public sector workers, including the return to service of over 2 000 teachers and 2 000 nurses and doctors and fourthly, the creation of jobs."
"Through our rural recovery and urban rehabilitation programmes, we are financing over 3 million person days of work this year alone, and I should also refer to the rebuilding of infrastructure."
"The Commission, along with the Swedish government and Pakistan, has already started the emergency rehabilitation and reconstruction of the Kabul-Jalalabad-Torkham road and full reconstruction will start next year ."
"In addition, our humanitarian aid has helped to support the return of over 1.8 million refugees to Afghanistan."
"Over EUR 70 million has been spent by ECHO in 2002."
"That means that the money which we have spent in total in Afghanistan over the last twelve months, the money which is voted by this Parliament, now stands at EUR 275 million."
"I do not think anybody can suggest that we have not played - or are not still playing - our full part so far in the reconstruction of Afghanistan."
"For 2003, the challenge will be to consolidate this early progress."
"The Commission will continue to play a leading role."
"We anticipate total development assistance of about EUR 185 million, and there will also be continued humanitarian assistance from ECHO of between EUR 45 and 55 million."
"That means that we will be spending in Afghanistan this year, on present estimates, between EUR 230 and 240 million."
"Colleagues will recall that at Tokyo on behalf of the Commission I pledged EUR 1 billion over five years in reconstruction assistance."
"That is not including the humanitarian assistance figures that I have mentioned, so the total contribution of the European Commission, from your taxpayers' money, to Afghanistan, quite apart from contributions from Member States, will be well in excess of EUR 1 billion for the reconstruction of Afghanistan."
"Some people in the past have derided that sort of work as nation-building or social work."
"Frankly, when I look back, I think if we had done more of it in the 1980s and 90s, we would not have the problems that we have had recently in Afghanistan."
"Success in 2003 will hinge on three key issues."
"First, the need to improve internal security."
"Second, the need to ensure human rights are fully respected, including those of women and minorities."
"When I visited Kabul last year, one of the most moving visits that I paid was to a school in the extraordinary bomb site that is southern and western Kabul, where young women had returned to schooling for the first time in six years and were sitting in classrooms without blackboards, without textbooks, being taught physics."
"I must say the commitment and dedication of the staff, and of those young women, was remarkable: anybody who ever thought that it would have been right for us to stand by and allow Taliban rule to continue indefinitely should perhaps have been present on that occasion."
"The third key issue for us is the need for continued long-term commitment from donors and for effective coordination."
"The argument about coordination is one which has been extremely well made by Members of this Parliament, and I will say another word about it a little later if I may."
"Internal security is critical not only for the future of Afghanistan but also to the delivery of aid."
"Aid workers must be able to work without fear of recrimination."
"In this context, I would like to express my strong concern about the death of one aid worker, and the serious injury of two others, in Kabul just before Christmas."
"I think sometimes we underestimate the amounts of courage and commitment which are required for aid workers working in these sort of circumstances."
"President Karzai's commitment at the 2 December Bonn II Conference to form an Afghan National Army is a welcome step forward, as is the recent signing of the Kabul Declaration on good-neighbourly relations."
"The Government must press on quickly with the creation of a National Army, but clearly this will not be achieved overnight."
"In the meantime, the international community must do everything possible to support President Karzai and to strengthen the Government's position across all regions of the country, including in the fight against opium poppy production."
"The Minister has already referred to our concern about this."
"If you look at the present UN figures, there is very considerable reason not just for concern, but alarm."
"There has been a substantial increase in the amount of hectares under opium production, a rapid increase in the farm-gate price of poppies, a ballooning in the production of heroin with implications not only for surrounding countries, but for European countries, and for the funding of organised crime and terrorism in the region and beyond."
"I believe that we have to give far more attention to this problem in the next year or so, a problem which directly affects political authority in Afghanistan itself."
"Overall, as agreed at the Bonn II meeting, we need tangible benchmarks to measure progress. These are critical not only to shape our vision of Afghanistan's future, but to provide support to the reformers within the Government."
"This is of critical importance for human rights ."
"Recent reports highlight the unacceptable situation faced by minority groups, and women, in some parts of the country."
"We must secure fundamental change by ensuring that the establishment of the independent Human Rights Commission translates into tangible change on the ground, and that the new Constitution enshrines human rights for all, including women."
"Clearly, these issues are vital in view of the general elections which are scheduled for mid 2004."
"We also cannot hope to deliver sustainable change without good donor coordination."
"We must all continue to give a strong and consistent message to the Afghan Government about the need to tackle internal security, to respect human rights for everyone and to set benchmarks for progress."
"I would like to finish by stressing that we must be prepared for the long haul - regardless of other events that may unfold in 2003."
"Rebuilding a cohesive state will take time, as will improving the unacceptably low levels of education and healthcare."
"I want to assure Parliament of my personal commitment to these tasks."
"I paid a first trip to Kabul in May 2002 and will be returning this February as part of a trip to the Central Asian Republics."
"I intend to make one of the priorities of my visit the discussion of the better coordination of donor efforts, including the work done by NGOs."
"The support received from this House has been very reassuring, especially in helping to secure funding for Afghanistan for 2003."
"I look forward to an equally rewarding working relationship with Parliament over the coming year and I want to express my great gratitude for the informed and thoughtful contribution which Parliament has made to the discussion of these issues."
"It is sometimes difficult for the international community to focus on more than one or two blips on its radar screen at any one moment."
"There is a real danger of us assuming that, because we do not read as much about Afghanistan on the front pages of the newspapers, our job in Afghanistan is, as we would say colloquially in English, done and dusted."
"It is far from that."
"There is a huge job for us to do in Afghanistan."
"There are worrying tasks for the international community in the Central Asian Republics and there are reasons for concern about the situation in Pakistan."
"So I hope that we can continue to focus on this work in the years ahead, whatever the tragic distractions may be elsewhere."
"Mr President, to those who have been there, who have stood on the mountains, who know the people, Afghanistan is a beautiful country."
"The Afghan people are a strong people who deserve our support."
"The liberation of Afghanistan by the international coalition against terrorism, against the Taliban and against the Al-Qaida network has fortunately been very successful."
"Commissioner Patten has rightly said that this is in no small measure thanks to the efforts of the European Union."
"There is a new provisional government, and no fewer than 1.8 million Afghans have returned after what has, for many, been decades of forced exile abroad, and thousands of girls and women once again have the opportunity to enjoy an education in Afghanistan."
"At the same time, this success is being threatened by the diversion of some of the very important international players to a new playground - Iraq."
"It would be very tragic if the international coalition against terrorism were to allow itself to become divided and diverted towards Iraq."
"We now specifically want the international coalition to give us extra support for Afghanistan and to concentrate on it, as it has rightly been pointed out in this context that we could otherwise lose ground."
"The Afghan transitional administration, the ATA, under the leadership of President Karzai, has control over the capital, Kabul, with the help of the ISAF, but in reality the warlords still play far too great a role in the various regions of the country such as Herat."
"Human rights, women's rights and reconstruction are threatened on a daily basis in these regions."
"The first and most important priority must be to extend the ISAF's mandate so as to help the ATA to build up a national army that will cover the whole of Afghanistan."
"Starting in February, the Netherlands and Germany will be playing a leading role in the ISAF forces on behalf of Europe, hopefully with a mandate that will actually demobilise the warlords, build up the national army and re-establish authority over the whole of Afghanistan."
"The important agreement which Afghanistan concluded with its neighbours on 22 December last year should thus also be given another chance."
"Only then will Afghans have sufficient trust, and only then will they have the opportunity to take the reconstruction into their own hands."
"Almost two million refugees have returned, and 700 000 are trekking around inside Afghanistan - in other words, they are internally displaced."
"That is why it is so very important that we actually give substance to the reconstruction that Commissioner Patten was talking about and that has now begun, with the cooperation of local forces, particularly in the area of education and healthcare, giving priority to women and girls."
"Free and fair elections must be held and a new constitution prepared in 2004."
"The preparations for these elections are essential, as this is the way to actually establish a broad gender-sensitive, multi-ethnic and representative government."
"Tremendous steps have been taken."
"A human rights committee has been set up, a central bank has been established and a constitutional committee has been set up, but much ground may still be lost, as General Morillon rightly said."
"I therefore very strongly support the view of the Greek Presidency and of Commissioner Patten."
"Let us use the substantial amounts we have at our disposal for the coming year, coupled with our effort, in a focused way."
"Given everything that is happening elsewhere in the world, we must make a success of Afghanistan now."
"That will only work if we maintain this focus during the coming year."
"Mr President, may I first congratulate the Greek minister for taking up the Presidency."
"We look forward with confidence to a very successful and very effective six months."
"The President today commented that our aim must be to bring Afghanistan into a modern statehood."
"Women's rights give increasing cause for concern, they are not improving, they are becoming worse."
"Facial covering has become mandatory in many parts of the country; the movement of women is heavily restricted."
"Virginity is examined on the whim of the police, women are dragged into hospitals and physically examined."
"In other words, women are reverting to their traditional subordinate role of being the property of the male."
"The Commissioner has already commented that women's rights in certain areas of the country are under assault, but I say this is also happening at central government level."
"Women are now forbidden to be presenters on radio or television, which some of them were doing successfully."
"I have no doubt that women journalists are also under pressure in the written media."
"Under-representation of women has been commented on already, but I would ask you to recall the famous Loya Jirga, which was almost 100% male."
"When the deputy Health minister visited the European Commission recently, it was the - male - deputy Health minister, Dr Feroz, who attended, not the Health minister herself, the only senior minister who is a woman."
"40% of all health facilities do not have one single woman at any level of their staff, yet it is women worldwide who are fundamentally responsible for all aspects of family health."
"The word Afghanistan translates correctly into the words 'the land of sorrow and suffering'."
"For women Afghanistan is becoming, yet again, the land of their deepest sorrow and suffering."
"Humanitarian aid undoubtedly helps, but just as obviously it is simply not enough."
"I warmly congratulate both ECHO and the entire Commission involved in Afghanistan, for their fantastic work."
"But if we want to bring Afghanistan into the modern world, the most basic of human rights, equal respect between the sexes, must become, both a hallmark of our aid and a continuing measurement of our success."
"It is not so today."
"If we look at what Mr Solana identified as the aims of European Union involvement in Afghanistan, women are not mentioned: women's rights are just not there."
"Yet if we mean business, this attitude must be tackled, and it is an attitude, a tribal culture in Baluchistan, which has spread around the region."
"Why be so squeamish about tackling women's rights?"
"Is it because Afghanistan is an Islamic society?"
"I do not need to quote the Koran to you to remind you that men and women were equal in the Koran from the very start of Islam; it cannot be because of that."
"I urge you, alter the priorities of the Council of Ministers, place women's rights high on the agenda."
"If we fail on that, then we will have no success at all."
"Mr President, yesterday the Greek Presidency stated that the priority under its mandate is to put the motto ''Our Europe'' into effect, and share the future in a community of values."
"However, values should not just be described; justice, the fight against poverty and peace must be pursued in difficult circumstances."
"In reality, the more we talk about peace, the more war there is; there is talk of negotiations while troops are being prepared."
"When will this duplicity end?"
"How much longer will bullets kill Palestinian children, suicide bombers kill Israeli citizens, Russian soldiers kill people in Chechnya and the USA kill wherever it thinks it has an interest, and so on?"
"I shall not give any further examples, since the world is such a big and terrible place."
"Is this rhetoric or sentimentality?"
"No. I am expressing political and moral outrage, a stern warning against creating a Europe which has a forked tongue, as an American Indian chief once said while his people were being wiped out and moved to reservations."
"One year on from the Bonn Agreement and clearly many positive steps have been taken."
"The Commission's facts and Commissioner Patten's outstanding analyses, which I shall not dwell on as he read them out very clearly, are impressive."
"We all know that in a situation where there is devastation such as this, there are no shortcuts to achieving common interests without destroying specific aspects."
"We need to develop civilian infrastructure, rebuild houses, roads, schools, hospitals, not allow returning refugees to die from starvation and cold and attack the cultivation or sale of opium but give the population an alternative."
"I have personally seen the progress made this year, especially in Kabul - schools reopened, girls studying journalism - but at the same time, I have seen and heard that key figures such as military leaders and the United States have allowed human rights failures, which are still apparent."
"I am not just referring to abuse and discrimination against women at work, in the streets, in the media and not just, moreover, in the Herat area - land of the infamous Khan - but all over the country;"
"I am also referring to social discrimination, to favour-based politics and nepotism, applied to everyone, but especially - and the USA is primarily responsible for this - with regard to the supply of arms, aid and political support for military leaders who should be before the International Court."
"We need to help the central government, the Ministry of Social Affairs - the Minister for Equal Opportunities, Habiba Sarabi, has appealed to us all to increase aid and support for gender policies and women's policies within the European Commission too - and enable democratic elections to take place in 2004: these are all essential things."
"Moreover, it is also essential, as Commissioner Patten said, to extend central power to the various areas of the country, above all separate military power from civilian power and encourage the Human Rights Commission, not just the Afghan one - Sima Samar is a courageous woman who bravely continues her work - but also UNAMA."
"I met UNAMA representatives in Kabul who could not travel round the country for fear not only of warlords, but also of marines, for fear of speaking out and exposing human rights violations, in which we were also complicit."
"We must therefore carry out investigations for UNAMA."
"The passage of time does not, however, help democratic forces: Commissioner Patten also said this, just as he said we are arriving late; perhaps we could have done more in 1980."
"Donor countries should pay greater heed to the government, but above all to women's organisations which are saying loud and clear that the warlords' power must be cut off and the country must be reconstructed on the basis of law and democracy, because there can be no democracy if there is torture or massacres such as the one at Mazar-i-Sharif."
"Europe must continue to do its part; we cannot take a different path: we must give continuity to our work and our commitment."
"Mr President, four months ago we took part in another debate about Afghanistan in this very room, with some of the same people."
"I have just re-read the report and must come to the conclusion that a large number of subjects dealt with at the time are regrettably still highly topical, such as the position of women."
"To be honest, I have little to add to Baroness Nicholson's impressive arguments on that point."
"I do, however, think that the time has come to do more than just acknowledge that the position of women has deteriorated over the past year."
"The UN Human Rights Committee, which has a special rapporteur for the position of women, should really go and carry out targeted investigations in places where we all know the position of women has deteriorated, like in Herat, for example."
"The time has also come for the international community, including the European Union, to make it clear that aid depends on progress with regard to the position of women, and that deterioration will have long-term consequences."
"Another subject that we dealt with four months ago - and this has also been mentioned now by a number of fellow Members - was the extension of the ISAF's mandate outside Kabul."
"Kofi Annan has described this extension as a precondition for continuing stability in Afghanistan."
"In his response to our contribution four months ago, the Commissioner himself stated at the time, and I quote: the Member States will certainly take note of the comments of many MEPs."
"Mr Yiannitsis, I would like to once more ask the question I also put to your Danish counterpart at the time: is the Council prepared to make money and troops available in order to enable this extension to happen?"
"If not, please tell me; then we will not have this illusion hanging over our heads."
"I am convinced that this is necessary, otherwise there will be no stability anywhere at all in Afghanistan."
"Why is it so necessary to extend the ISAF's mandate?"
"That has everything to do with what I would call the perverse return of the warlords."
"I again refer to what Mr Patten said on 4 September: we must not use the warlords in the fight against Al-Qaida again."
"Regrettably this is still happening."
"Some of the warlords are still being supported financially but also with weapons in the context of the fight against terrorism."
"This must come to an end."
"Otherwise everything we have been discussing here about reforms will simply have no chance at all."
"Take, for example, the fact that many warlords and generals are governors at the same time."
"This must not be allowed to continue."
"This only advances their standing; this really must come to an end."
"The position of the ISAF has started to suffer, even in Kabul."
"There are increasing numbers of incidents, and the present Turkish commanding officer has rightly warned that this situation will only worsen in the event of an attack on Iraq."
"Understandably, there is increasing concern in Germany and the Netherlands, the countries taking over command of the ISAF, that the warlords, together with Al-Qaida, are very likely to use an attack on Iraq to turn people against all Westerners, not only soldiers but aid workers as well."
"If the ISAF's mandate is not extended, if the role of the warlords is not diminished, the reforms will simply have no chance at all."
"Then the human rights violations will continue and - let us not forget this - the credibility of the international community and that of the European Union will be called into question."
"This must not be allowed to happen."
"Mr President, we should applaud the action of President Karzai who, faced with countless problems, has set in motion the creation of a new Constitution and the formation of a national army, essential cornerstones for the construction of a secular, democratic and functional state."
"The facts set out at the Petersberg Conference are encouraging: EUR 830 million already allocated by Europe, with a tangible impact on medicine and health, education - education which is now finally accessible to girls too - security through mine-clearing and the deactivation of unexploded bombs, agriculture, the restoration of urban areas, the reconstruction of infrastructure and return and assistance for refugees who are at last going back to their country."
"There is, however, still a long way to go: many of the funds allocated by Europe are still frozen, and we need a stronger commitment by our countries' governments to the democratic development of Afghanistan."
"A key issue for development, in fact, is to expand agriculture, which will take land away from opium cultivation."
"At this point, it is clear that not just the Union but also individual national governments, their Ministers for Agriculture, possibly also in conjunction with national farmers' organisations, must help Afghanistan and Afghan farmers with more immediacy to reconvert their crops, with, moreover, the help of specialists and experts in this area."
"The terrorism emergency is, in any case, unresolved and Europe must renew its political and moral commitment to helping the secular governments of those Muslim countries that wish to combat fundamentalist extremism."
"Members of the various terrorist networks are not only continuing to operate in areas of Afghanistan not yet controlled by the government but, in fact, live and are active in bordering countries and are operationally linked with areas which have become centres for attracting and recruiting others, such as certain areas of Somalia and South-East Asia."
"Support for Afghanistan goes beyond the exclusively political or economic principle of international cooperation, and constitutes a very real challenge for the protection of civilisation, the dignity of peoples and freedom now and in the future."
"With regard to the issue of women, this is still a vast and ongoing problem, but it is helpful to point out that there are female Ministers in Afghanistan, such as the Minister for Women's Affairs, and that the First Counsellor of the Afghan Embassy in Brussels is a woman who works and actively collaborates with the government precisely in order to improve the status of women."
"Finally, we cannot, in this first report on free Afghanistan, forget Commander Massoud and Europe's lethargy when he asked for help just a few months before being assassinated and before the Twin Towers tragedy."
"We would therefore reiterate the call on Parliament to award him the Sakharov Prize posthumously, or better still, to establish a Massoud Prize to be bestowed on those who tragically, have lost their lives defending their people and freedom."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is interesting to hear certain reconstructions of the facts which - quite rightly - merely skim the surface of the present, while totally overlooking or pretending to overlook the past, the Taliban past, or, as in other contexts, while criticising the actions which may lead to war in Iraq and forgetting the thousands, the hundreds of thousands of people massacred, tortured and exterminated under Saddam Hussein's regime."
"I would say to Mrs Morgantini that, while today there are human rights violations in Afghanistan, if we had listened to her and her friends, and the international community had refrained from intervening in Afghanistan, as they were asking us to do, there would not have been any human rights violations in that country simply because there would not have been any human rights whatsoever, just as there were none in the past."
"Therefore, these ex post lessons must offset what existed in the past with what, with difficulty, the international community and the Karzai Government are trying, clearly with numerous problems, to establish."
"From this point of view I would like to draw your attention, ladies and gentlemen, to something that happened two days ago and that I consider to be of extreme importance: the Afghan Government acceded, it ratified the treaty establishing the International Criminal Court."
"This is an extraordinary fact, if you think about it, as things stand in Afghanistan, when many countries - starting with, unfortunately, the United States - are against the Court."
"Well, I feel that Parliament should take note and encourage this desire to become a fully paid-up member of the international community, also in this respect, because who knows, in the future the Court could operate precisely to try crimes committed in that country."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the human suffering in Afghanistan has lasted for decades and precludes a cynical approach to these deliberations, although such would be a very tempting option."
"It must be clear to us that the years since the Soviet invasion saw a country that was poor in any case progressively smashed to pieces, only then for it to tear itself apart in a civil war, before the Taliban finished off what was left. The removal of the Taliban regime has now provided the opportunity for reconstruction."
"The question arises, however, of to what extent both the military victors and the present government have the authority to achieve real stability and get reconstruction underway."
"We cannot fail to observe that the stability needed to get real aid efforts to the whole of the country is not in place."
"Are we not deceiving ourselves when much of the reconstruction work is going on only in Kabul?"
"In Kabul, non-governmental organisations are falling over each other in their efforts to get projects going in that city, the reason being that other locations are too dangerous, and so aid soon becomes concentrated on projects that do not help rebuild the country as a whole."
"If, though, it proves impossible to stabilise the whole country, we can organise as many conferences of donors and so on as we like, but we will not get business to put its hands in its pocket and come up with private-sector funds for investment."
"The fact is that private-sector funds for investment are forthcoming only when there is a degree of certainty, founded upon both military security and firm legal policies, that these funds can continue to be put to work and that they will not be lost."
"I believe this to be a reason why this issue has to be examined in a very critical light, so that we do not end up engaging in the sort of activism that looks good but helps nobody."
"The country as a whole needs aid to be provided quickly, but it must then be distributed fairly."
"It seems to me that there is as yet no guarantee, for example, of the Pashtuns, who make up the majority of Afghanistan's population, having a share equal to that of others in political decision-making in Kabul, or in other beneficial things."
"If they do not, it appears to me that there will be a grave danger of a nascent resistance movement that new warlords could use for their own ends, so that, in spring or summer, new internal conflicts could flare up and make it even more difficult to guarantee the entire region's stability, to attract investment, and organise aid - with the country thus ending up in another vicious circle, and with us in a situation in which we can achieve even less."
"The fact that soldiers from my own country are working together with others in taking charge of Afghanistan means that I am very aware of the implications when I say that the situation could indeed arise in which these conditions make things far more dangerous for individual soldiers on the ground in Afghanistan than does anything currently being planned in Iraq."
"This is also a point of view that it is not wise to express openly."
"Even though it is not politically correct to make this connection, I fear that this is the case or, at least, that the danger is real."
"Anyone who knows Afghanistan's history will be aware that foreign troops have never felt at home there for long."
"When I see how even the United States of America can no longer guarantee the safety of its troops, and how they are now starting to set up camps in certain areas into which they can withdraw at night, it reminds me of other examples."
"It is for this reason that I wish to ask you to join with us in considering these facts in an open debate, in order to bring about real improvements on that basis, rather than merely giving the impression that money is being poured away even while we know it will not solve the problem in the long term."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, I am sure you would understand me perfectly if I spoke in German but, in honour of the Greek Presidency, I shall torment the interpreters with my Greek."
"Mr President-in-Office, I fully endorse your presentation of the situation in Afghanistan."
"I think we all feel a reserved satisfaction; we all see the continuing shortcomings in Afghanistan and we all know what has to be done over coming years."
"You yourself referred to the lack of security, the hostilities and the production and trafficking of narcotics, as did the Commissioner, and I think that the House is in full agreement with the timetable you suggest for elections in Afghanistan and improving the situation in general."
"There is no need for me to repeat what we are all agreed on."
"I should like to highlight two points which should not be left out of any discussion of Afghanistan."
"One is the terrible events which have taken place in the name of the fight against terrorism."
"Let there be no misunderstanding: I am behind the fight against terrorism in Afghanistan or anywhere else 100%."
"The warlords and the Taliban were never our allies."
"It was not the European Union that trained, armed and helped the Taliban through Pakistan."
"It was not us who created the forces we are now fighting against."
"But the fight against terrorism, the fight against violations of human rights and terrorism against women, the fight for democracy and the rule of law is only a credible fight if it is fought within a framework of respect for human rights and respect for the right to life of people who may be terrorists or criminals."
"I should like to add to today's debate on Afghanistan by mentioning two very dark sides to this war."
"First, the horrendous allegations about the slaughter in Mazar-I-Sharif."
"I think the UN has an obligation both to investigate and examine these allegations closely and to make known and publish the results of their enquiries."
"And secondly, we should be ashamed about the fate of prisoners in Guantanamo and other detention camps run by the American military for members of the Taliban who have been arrested and people who have been imprisoned and are being called Taliban."
"The European Union should do something about this, it is a disgrace."
"Mr President, the danger with foreign policy initiatives designed to counter terrorism following the 11 September disaster is that we are deluded into thinking that in the parts of the world where this strategy has been deployed everything has therefore been resolved."
"The reality is, however, rather different."
"In Afghanistan, most of the country outside Kabul is still under the control of warlords and regional leaders who continue to commit human rights abuses on a large scale, including torture and the disappearance of Afghan civilians."
"Women's rights, as has already been mentioned, are also consistently being violated."
"Along with the detention of 600 people without charge or trial in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, that Mr Sakellariou mentioned, these are matters that we tend to forget, deluding ourselves that the problems have been and are being resolved."
"In Afghanistan, in the Herat province under the governorship of Ismail Khan, the situation has deteriorated."
"Whereas once there was a liberal, literary and cultural tradition, women are again being persecuted and barred from education, health care and the justice system."
"Even under the Taliban there was at least a semblance of central control that limited the excesses of these regional autocrats."
"Now many regions have reverted to a quasi-dictatorship and reconstruction funds are benefiting regional leaders who are committing human rights abuses politically and financially."
"This must stop."
"UNAMA, the United Nations Assistance Mission to Afghanistan, must stop funding these offending warlords immediately."
"Some of us in the European Parliament recently saw a film by Jamie Doran, the Scottish film-maker, backing with hard evidence the existence of a mass grave in the Mazar-i-Sharif region which might contain the remains of 3 000 prisoners of war, killed and tortured by anti-Taliban forces."
"This is an atrocity that members of the American forces witnessed and did not prevent."
"I am glad the United Nations and the European Union have now agreed to investigate this alleged crime."
"Mr President, the reconstruction of Afghanistan has not, in my view, remotely begun, despite the assurances given in the House today."
"The warlords still maintain their iron grip outside Kabul and women still wear the burka and have no rights whatsoever, for instance to education or primary healthcare."
"It is, in my view, right for the United States and the rest of the Western world to seek to destroy Al-Qaida and eliminate Osama Bin Laden, but so far they have failed."
"Much has been made of women's rights in Afghanistan, but as I said , nothing has changed."
"I believe that Afghanistan is only the tip of the iceberg as far as the United States is concerned."
"Many commentators suggest that it is part of the strategy to ensure access to oil from the Caspian Sea."
"Now the question arises, how many fronts will open up after Afghanistan?"
"The American administration is preparing for war on Iraq, with unpredictable consequences that no one will be able to control."
"They will of course have won control of the Iraqi oil wells, but Afghanistan is ignored."
"In a recent poll in England, 71% were against their government participating in a war without the approval of the Security Council."
"No doubt as soon as the war begins, other European leaders along with Tony Blair, will bend to the will of the United States, ignoring the views of the people, which says a lot about our democracy."
"The Iraqi people have suffered death and destruction for the past eleven years under the United States sanctions, as have the people of Afghanistan."
"We have to look clearly at our policy in the Middle East and elsewhere."
"Mr President, I might well continue where my fellow MEP, Mrs Theorin, left off."
"It is as if many of the things we take very seriously when we make speeches are not really taken seriously in practice."
"Women's rights and legal position are among these things."
"Others are international law and human rights."
"When the talk turns to Afghanistan, I find myself thinking automatically of those people, including European citizens, who are imprisoned in Guantánamo."
"What has become of their rights?"
"What legal system do they come under? None at all."
"The United States does not respect international law - of that we are well aware - but nor does it respect its own law."
"I find it bizarre that we have a resolution by Parliament that takes no account at all of the fact that a number of European citizens are in a prison camp and that we do not know for how long they will be there, what their future prospects are and what legal system they come under."
"I also find this in stark contrast to the fact that, in other situations, there is a demand that international law be complied with."
"A very good example is Iraq, which we demand comply with international stipulations and UN resolutions."
"In that way, we give people the impression - in Afghanistan too - that there are two standards in this world, namely that which we demand that they themselves uphold and that which we, for our part, are willing to uphold, because it is we who have the power and thus, in our view, also the right to make demands."
"Another area in which we face similar problems is in relation to the massacre in Mazar-i-Sharif."
"There is quite a lot to suggest that there were American soldiers present."
"Some people maintain that they took part in the massacre."
"There is much, however, to suggest that they were present."
"That being said, we are doing nothing to have this matter thoroughly investigated and have the people responsible brought to trial."
"I think these double standards are causing us problems."
"They make matters more difficult in relation to Afghanistan and the Afghan people."
"Why is it so difficult to bring about change?"
"To arrive in Afghanistan or Kabul is to enter a world that is exclusively male."
"Men with piercing eyes scowling at women."
"Some men may have changed outwardly, but on the inside they are still the same."
"When you wander around the famous Chicken Street in Kabul, for example, you see women in dirty old burkas begging, children begging, men standing around chatting."
"We must not forget that there is still a culture of men who think that women should not be educated."
"Are there any solutions?"
"Yes."
"In a country in which people have always fought each other, you must involve women, you must put women in a prominent position, and this must be enforced."
"After all, can we imagine a society in the European Union which provides healthcare without women, where there is education without women, for example?"
"This is only one of many examples."
"Mr President, one year on we can take much satisfaction from what has been achieved by the Afghan people supported by the international community, but all this reveals the size of the mountain to be climbed."
"It is not going to be a quick fix for Afghanistan."
"It is likely that the democracies will have to maintain a commitment for many years to come."
"There will be reverses that will place this commitment under severe strain."
"We see the scale of the problem when we understand that the writ of President Karzai does not extend far beyond Kabul and a few other towns, and his personal security remains largely in foreign hands."
"I endorse the presidency's congratulations to the Turkish armed forces, which took over the organisation and command of ISAF from the United Kingdom last June."
"There is a compelling argument for the international peace-keeping force to deploy to key locations outside Kabul until the Afghan National Army is in a position to assume its responsibilities, but such forces will be highly vulnerable."
"The fact is that warlords continue to hold sway in many of the more remote areas, and their commitment to peaceful development and democracy is largely non-existent."
"They are interested in personal power and the fruits of criminal activity."
"They can be won over - but by anyone."
"Even more worrying, therefore, is the evidence of an Al-Qaida-Taliban resurgence in border areas with Pakistan, regrouping in camps on both sides of the border in alliance with local mujahedin."
"This is in spite of a large American-led counter-insurgency force which operates in parallel to ISAF."
"At the moment western military forces are operational in Bosnia, Kosovo and Macedonia, as well as in Afghanistan."
"There will be fresh demands, not only in relation to Iraq, but in other places as well."
"The fact is that all our countries need to generate more military capability and the willingness to use it in concert with America and other allies, along with other instruments."
"Afghanistan's neighbours have been enormously affected by the refugee problem, but equally countries such as the United Kingdom have felt the impact."
"In recent years Afghans have been the largest single national category of those claiming asylum in the United Kingdom."
"In due course these people must go home."
"With this in mind I welcome the Council decision of 29 November to adopt the return action plan for Afghanistan, the first application of this programme."
"Finally, Afghanistan is one of the most heavily mined countries in the world."
"This is a consequence of activities by the former Soviet Army and more especially by warring factions over the past ten years."
"In spite of massive international financial assistance, where the European Community in particular has been a major contributor, only a small proportion of anti-personnel landmines have been cleared and the casualty rate continues to be very high."
"Landmines and their suspected presence are one of the greatest obstacles to reconstruction and return to any sort of normality."
"We need to find more effective, quicker methods involving local people to overcome the scourge of landmines, not just in Afghanistan, but elsewhere as well."
"This is not just a question of funds, this is a specific practical area where the Commission has a key role to play and needs even more focus."
"Mr President, the subject of today's debate is Afghanistan: one year after the Bonn Agreement."
"What we are in fact debating is several decades of Afghan history, with Bonn as just one stage in an ongoing crisis and, as we take stock, we realise that there is good news and bad news."
"In cases such as these it is, in fact, the people who need to take stock, by which I mean that it makes no difference to the people whether the violence is perpetrated by the warlords or the Taliban."
"In this sense, our objectives must be to establish a stable rule of law with stable institutions that allow democracy to function and everyone's rights to be respected."
"A great deal of costly work needs to be done; more to the point, a long-term strategy is needed."
"The question is: do all the forces operating in the area have a common strategy?"
"We have talked about the European Union, be it of the 15 or 25, but we have said nothing about, for example, Russia's, America's or Pakistan's plans for the area."
"Are they with us or do they have a separate agenda, in which case our common objectives may not be so common after all."
"Under these circumstances, as we take stock, we see that there is a great deal of cause for satisfaction: the situation is not the same as it was a year ago, but we still need to worry on a number of counts; are we perhaps turning back the clock and will situations return which should not return?"
"So it might be a good idea to take stock of a few basic facts, such as the increase in crime, the operational limits of the state, whatever form it takes, and where the European taxpayers' money is going."
"Because, if memory serves me well, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, for example, said that 80% of the money was being used by non-governmental organisations working in the area in order to stay afloat and only 20% was going to the country."
"If this is true, the best thing we can do for institutional development, democratisation and stabilisation is to involve as many Afghan citizens as possible."
"Mr President, President-in-Office, Commissioner, the strategic importance of Afghanistan cannot be overestimated."
"A peaceful and stable Afghanistan is an important bulwark against the resurgence of extremism in the region."
"One year after the Bonn Conference, it is an opportune time to reflect on the EU's contribution in restoring peace, stability and credible political structures."
"Commissioner Patten was right to emphasise the contribution that the EU as a whole and the EU Commission in particular have made during the last year."
"EU funds have been used to finance health clinics and primary schools, the clearance of landmines, the return of key public service workers, the creation of jobs to combat the opium production that is spiralling in post-Taliban Afghanistan, the rebuilding of infrastructures, clean-up operations in 7 cities and support for the return of the 1.8 million or so refugees returning to the country."
"This in an impressive list and the Commission, ECHO and the various aid organisations involved deserve credit."
"However, on the general issue of aid, it is important to point out that, although the total aid from the international community may seem enormous when compared to other areas in crisis, Afghanistan is at the bottom of the pile when we look at aid given per capita."
"The average aid pledges to Bosnia, Kosovo, East Timor and Rwanda were approximately $250 per person, as against $75 for Afghanistan."
"The international community should take note of this."
"As the Commissioner himself pointed out, investing money earlier is much more effective and more economical than spending money to pick up the pieces afterwards."
"Given our strong record on aid, I believe we have the moral authority to put pressure on our international partners to translate their verbal pledges into money."
"We should also use our influence to ensure a proper balance is struck between providing short term relief and undertaking long term reconstruction."
"The EU has done a lot, but we cannot become complacent or allow the problems of Afghanistan to be sidelined by the prospect of war with Iraq or problems with North Korea."
"We have a moral obligation to create permanent peace and stability, tackle the problem of the warlords, improve human rights, especially, as other speakers have pointed out, women's rights, and establish real democracy in Afghanistan."
"Much still needs to be done."
"The holding of democratic elections next year, the establishment of a national army and the pursuit of good neighbourly relations are all positive steps in the right direction."
"Ladies and gentlemen , I wish to give a brief but warm welcome to the third year of the D. E. Montemurro National School of Media, from Gravina, in Apulia, which has been awarded the 'Let's Build Europe Together' prize, established by the Italian Chamber of Deputies."
"The main aim of this initiative is to promote the involvement of our younger citizens in the debate on the future of Europe."
"We therefore offer these young people our congratulations on having gained first place in this competition and we also congratulate them on their attentive involvement in the work being undertaken in the plenary sitting."
"Well done!"
"Mr President, I too have had the unique experience of visiting Afghanistan and seeing the situation with my own eyes."
"The first thing that needs to be said is that our staff are doing an excellent job, as you yourself said, Commissioner, and the European Union has a high profile there."
"However, a year after Bonn, I think coordination is a serious problem, both in the provision and distribution of aid and, more to the point, the policy being applied."
"By which I mean that the European Union is following one political tack and supporting a strong central administration in Afghanistan, while the United States are taking a different approach and sticking to their favourite tactic of divide and rule from the days of the Taliban and the Mujahedin by backing the warlords, who they seem to think have taken their side."
"Mr Morillon and Mr Sakellariou said likewise."
"Unfortunately, the upshot of this divisive western policy is that entire areas are beyond the control of the central administration and this is precisely what caused the recent surge in the production of opium, which accounted for 70% of world production in 2002."
"Women, of course, are still in a dire situation in all sectors."
"Blue ghosts continue to waft round the streets of Kabul, with few women daring to risk their lives by taking off their burka."
"The Taliban may have lost power, but their spirit still haunts Afghanistan."
"In my opinion, there can be no economic or social progress as long as a culture of violence, religious fanaticism and misogyny reigns in Afghanistan."
"98% of women are illiterate and economically dependent and 99% give birth without medical assistance."
"This sort of soil provides an ideal breeding ground for extremist movements such as the Taliban."
"I think the Greek Presidency, Mr President-in-Office, could do a great deal to help by proposing that a European fund be set up and a line included in the 2004 budget especially for women in Afghanistan."
"This fund could be used to finance new infrastructures to integrate women into public life."
"I also suggest, Commissioner, that we should invite President Karzai to Strasbourg to speak before a plenary session of the European Parliament."
"Mr President, I too would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council and Commissioner Patten for what they have told us today."
"I too, like other fellow Members, recently went to Afghanistan with a European Parliament delegation and I can bear witness to the truth of the things reported by Commissioner Patten."
"Let us not forget that we found a country ravaged by 23 years of war and years of drought."
"The progress made in one year since the first Bonn Conference is truly remarkable, and likewise we should applaud the determination, selflessness and competence of our Commission officials in Kabul."
"All this is true: schools have been opened, they have started to rebuild some health facilities; valuable work is being done, particularly in terms of supporting the administration."
"In this connection, I would like to urge Commissioner Patten not to abandon the aspect of specific personnel training, including for customs officers, which is fundamental."
"It is also true, however - and the last Bonn Conference showed this to some degree - that the most committed donor countries are asking the Karzai Government to show more determination."
"There has been some criticism: reforms announced by the Karzai Government itself have been delayed; even though a commission has been appointed to draw up the new Constitution, it is being obstructed by religious issues, by minorities, whereas it needs to go ahead, especially with a specific acknowledgement of women's rights too; security is still a serious problem; there is no judicial system and there is no national defence force; an operative police force is still lacking."
"All this is true."
"The European Union, which has done a great deal, must therefore persevere on these issues."
"Lastly - a final word on women's rights - I would like to refer here, to the European Parliament, to the appeal which the Minister, Mrs Sarabi, made to us: each donor country has chosen a specific area of intervention; however, no one has chosen the specific issue of women's rights."
"This is an urgent appeal that I am making to the European Union and to us all lest we forget this: there is no chance of making progress or finding a way out of this situation unless women are directly involved in this process."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the honourable Members of the European Parliament for the debate we have had, for the support they have expressed for many of the Presidency's thoughts and proposals and for the Commission's thoughts and proposals, even though they do not come within my jurisdiction."
"We have set out a whole series of useful proposals."
"I must say that I agree that the role of the administration needs to extend beyond Kabul city limits if there is to be greater stability and normalisation in the country as a whole, that the mission of the ISAF needs to be extended so that it can work along the same political lines and, thirdly, that human rights must be respected, be they women's rights, prisoners' rights or adversaries' rights."
"We have a history of respect for human rights for institutional, historic and cultural reasons."
"It is a tradition in Europe and we must respect it wherever necessary."
"The debate as a whole has shown that what we want to create in Afghanistan, as everyone knows, is a country in which the values of democracy and freedom take hold and the potential for economic development and confidence is realised."
"History has taught us that this is a long, hard process in any country and I know of no other country in which such huge changes have come about in such a short space of time."
"We, for our part, need to show political determination, we need to provide economic, political and humanitarian assistance, but we also need to be realistic about what we can do, how far we can go, what the prevailing circumstances are, what difficulties the people there face, what balances need to be respected, what values hold sway and how we can provide help in the right direction."
"We are still a long way from being able to say that the game in Afghanistan has been won."
"We are only a short way down the line and we still have a great deal to do over a very long period of time."
"Developments in Afghanistan will be influenced by numerous factors, both internal and external."
"We need to look at individual concerns, what is happening with the constitution, what is happening on the humanitarian and numerous other fronts, and we need to take an overall view and apply an overall strategy as to how we can influence developments."
"Success cannot be measured by one criterion alone or by a number of individual criteria which we might mention, and several have been mentioned, be they institutional or individual rights or economic progress."
"Success will be measured by simultaneous progress on a number of political, institutional, social and economic fronts in Afghanistan."
"I have received six motions for resolutions tabled in accordance with Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The next item is the report (A5-0001/2003), by Mrs Roth-Behrendt, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive 76/768/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to cosmetic products (PE-CONS 3668/2002 - C5-0557/2002 - 2000/0077(COD))."
"Mr President, you are right to say that today sees the third reading of the report on cosmetics, a topic to which - as will be known to most of us - Parliament has now been repeatedly returning over the space of ten years."
"By far and away most of the proposals, both in this parliamentary session and in the last one, concern themselves with a ban on experiments on animals and on the sale of products tested on animals."
"These areas have been the subject of the most controversy, and, indeed, still are."
"Both within the European Union and outside it, the most controversial issue was about whether experiments on animals would continue to be permitted in the future in connection with toothpaste and shampoos."
"Controversy continued to rage around the issue of whether a product that had been tested on animals could still be sold."
"It was said over and over again in this House that the only way to prevent tests being exported was to couple a ban on testing with a ban on the marketing - and hence the sale - of the products."
"Both in the first and second readings of this seventh amendment to the cosmetics directive, that was the crucial issue, but, both in the competent committee and here in this House, we made the point that cosmetics and cosmetic products are of immediate relevance to the protection of consumers."
"We pointed out that, for example, the information on a product's useful life was of importance to consumers, who were to be told for how long they could use a cosmetic product once it had been opened."
"That was one of the points on which this House made proposals at first and second reading."
"This House's final demand - one that I was happy to endorse as rapporteur - was that hazardous products, those known to be carcinogenic, to affect the reproductive system or to be mutagenic, should not be permitted to be used in cosmetics."
"These proposals were what, in essence, our second reading was about."
"All of them gave rise to controversy."
"Although they passed through second reading by a very large majority, the Commission did not exactly welcome us with open arms."
"Today, though, at third reading, we can permit ourselves some self-congratulation, because the conciliation procedure was, I have to say, difficult."
"Over the years, I have had direct or indirect experience of many conciliation procedures."
"In this one, I started out uncertain as to whether we would achieve a compromise."
"We did."
"The outcome is that a ban on testing cosmetics on animals will be in place - six years after the legislation is adopted."
"There will be a sales ban on most of the products still containing ingredients tested on animals - six years after the legislation is adopted."
"We have also said that there will be a derogation for three tests, the development of alternatives to which is not yet in sight."
"The cosmetics industry is not entirely blameless in this."
"That so little has been done to develop these tests is partly due to the cosmetics industry having been, in the past, what we might call dozy."
"But we are now giving them an incentive, and a certain amount of time, to come up with alternatives."
"Let me make it clear that what we have achieved is a compromise, a compromise which, like all others, is not ideal."
"I am aware that the cosmetics industry finds it less than ideal, and also that the animal welfare organisations are convinced that more could have been achieved."
"I have had to keep on telling our friends in the animal welfare organisations that if they can find someone who can achieve more, they should get them down here and let them get on with it."
"My fellow-Members and I have tried to get a workable solution accepted, and so let me conclude by saying that I am grateful to the outgoing Danish Presidency, whose cooperation with us has been excellent, and also to the Commission, which had become cooperative by the end."
"Mr Liikanen, I wish it had done so a bit sooner, but at least it was never too late."
"I will also express my thanks to our colleagues in the Conciliation Committee, and to all those with whom we dealt during the conciliation procedure."
"This all adds up to one of the reasons why I love this Parliament so much, and why I would not wish to be a member of any other."
"The cooperation between Members of every nation and political group was open, decorous, frank and supportive to such an extent that I am convinced that you will not find the like of it in any legislature in the world."
"It was a joy to work through the night with you until twenty past four in the morning."
"It was a joy to achieve this outcome and to have been allowed to be your rapporteur."
"So I again want to thank most especially the colleagues who have always, and repeatedly, assured me of their support, even when conditions were rather less favourable on every side."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I would firstly like to warmly congratulate Mrs Roth-Behrendt on having made progress on this difficult directive and particularly on the manner in which she has done so."
"During this legislature, I have had the opportunity to debate many issues, some of them genuinely difficult and complicated, but perhaps in none of them have I seen so much desire to reach consensus through cooperation amongst all the agents involved as in the case of the rapporteur on this directive."
"I do not believe that this has been a debate based on the positions of the different political groups, in confrontation; it has essentially been a debate between stagnation and progress in an area on which the European Parliament has for years maintained a united and coherent position, with a view of the issues which differs from that of the cosmetics industry and, on several fundamental points, also from that of the Commission itself."
"Parliament had a clear view of what it wanted: to set time limits for the end of experimentation on animals, and of the marketing of products experimented on them and, furthermore, to improve the general framework of the legislation regulating these products in the Member States."
"For its part, the industry initially maintained the same position of rejecting these requests which Parliament had been defending for years, which made the application of the sixth amendment of the directive unviable."
"The rapporteur has already mentioned the long process of debate and joint work between the parliamentary groups with the industry, the Commission and also with the competent administrations of the Member States and finally a compromise was achieved last November following an extremely long conciliation which, if I remember correctly, lasted twelve hours."
"I genuinely believe that there are no losers in relation to this issue."
"I am convinced that the industry is also a winner with the new commitments on prohibition, experimentation and marketing of six years from the entry into force of the directive."
"And this is essentially because they will be better able to serve the interests of the citizens in the field of animal protection, without in any way also undermining the safety or diversity, of course, of the products on the market."
"In this regard, one of the most difficult parts of the work on this directive has been managing to establish the field of exceptions through the definition of tests which, for a period of ten years in specific and essential cases where no alternative methods have been found, will still be able to be carried out."
"Another element which increases the safety of products is the prohibition of dangerous substances such as those which are carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic for reproduction which must be excluded from cosmetics."
"I am convinced that this seventh amendment offers the industry a new range of opportunities for research and development of new products, which, while guaranteeing their effectiveness and above all their safety, will need to be tested on animals."
"I believe this is a great challenge for the industry, which I would encourage to seek new sources of competitive advantage through this research and to initiate, with interest and good will, close cooperation with this Parliament."
"I believe that the European Parliament not only can and must communicate that this seventh amendment is a success, but also it would be a mistake for the industry not to take this opportunity to draw up a new communication strategy based on the agreements reached and on its position in favour of the concerns of the consumers, not only with regard to animal experimentation, but also, as we have seen, with regard to other points of the directive which imply greater control of the marketing of these products."
"Finally, I would like once again to highlight the issue of cooperation between the parties involved, in particular the eventual, it is true, but positive, flexibility of the Member States and the industry which has led to this final agreement."
"Madam President, I should like to add my congratulations and conclude with a warning."
"I congratulate Mrs Roth-Behrendt, who has achieved so much over this long process."
"Perhaps if she had known at the outset the scale of the obstructions and difficulties, she would not have achieved so much."
"It helps sometimes to be a little ignorant of the difficulties."
"This proposal puts animal welfare above human vanity, but never above human health."
"It sets time limits, graduated in accordance with the difficulties involved, and it sets new standards of reference which should and will be respected."
"I also want to thank the Commission for carrying out its intermediary role, mindful of law and precedent, but also of the strong views of this Parliament which have been echoed here under three different Commissions, for more than ten years."
"To come to this final conclusion is an enormous satisfaction for all of us."
"My colleagues on the Conciliation Committee expressed the long frustrations of this process in that last marathon session."
"It was literally at the eleventh hour that we achieved the result that all desired."
"A new model strip cartoon has just been distributed to Members showing how exciting the work of the European Parliament is, with glamorous young male and female characters."
"If there is another edition of this series, it should deal with the long night with Mrs Roth-Behrendt at the end of these proceedings."
"I also want to thank the Danish presidency."
"One often sees a presidency looking at a problem firmly in the eye, and then running away."
"The Danes knew that they could get a deal and they got it - through great skill in my opinion."
"This was a deal - I want to say this before going on to a word of warning - that meets Parliament's principal concerns."
"It sticks."
"It is a signal for action, and not an argument for delay."
"The animal welfare organisations which campaigned tirelessly for this outcome should not complain about the compromise that we achieved."
"The spotlight is now on compliance, with a provision to find alternative tests, especially in the most difficult areas of toxicity."
"None of us should make any apologies for how we came to be in this place today."
"I am personally proud of the fact that the rapporteur got us through this procedure and it enhances the reputation of Parliament, not merely for its procedures but also for their effectiveness."
"Madam President, my dear Dagmar, I have to tell Mr Barnier that, when I came into the plenary, I was still in a good mood."
"No doubt it is my fault that I have been unaware of your existence in recent years."
"At any rate, you have had nothing to say for the whole of the debate on cosmetics, and, if you are going to go away today and say that everything went wrong, I cannot recall you having made any serious or creditable contribution to this debate."
"My dear Dagmar, a veritable fanfare of compliments has been sounded in your honour today."
"It is one in which I am happy to join."
"Having done well, you have earned it, and it was our great good fortune to be allowed to spend whole nights in your company - and how many can boast of that?"
"Every directive has, of course, its pros and cons."
"We have not yet slammed the door shut, but I believe that we have made a great advance by saying that the cut-off point will be at the end of a period of time - in 2009 as far as I am concerned."
"I know perfectly well from my study of the market economy, Mr Barnier, that industry needs facts and data in order to be able to plan ahead - and there is nothing you can teach us on that score."
"Today, industry will go away and take on young people - researchers, doctors, engineers - whose job will be to look for alternatives."
"That is precisely what management needs, and that is why this is the right way to go."
"Mr Liikanen, you know that, much as I respect you, your office sometimes puts forward wearisome proposals."
"Now, though, you are on the right track, and I would like to give you strong encouragement to stand firm when it comes to the question of whether or not all this is acceptable to the WTO."
"And stand firm you certainly will, for you know that the whole serried ranks of this House are behind you."
"That means, I believe, that another solid success will be ours."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I have no need of three minutes."
"Europe and her people's representatives have grasped that animals are to be valued in a different way."
"I cannot but go along with that, and we will do everything to ensure a respectable and credible reduction in the number of experiments on animals."
"That there has to be, yet again, one small category in which such tests must still be carried out, is something that we accept, and that I believe to be necessary, but the great number of them must be brought down, never to increase again."
"The victory is yours, Mrs Roth-Behrendt - congratulations!"
"Madam President, I want to begin by saying a big thank you to Mrs Roth-Behrendt for her skilful and very consistent work on the directive. I certainly also enjoyed working into the night with Dagmar."
"It looked very difficult at the beginning."
"There were a number of Member States and also parts of industry that did everything to block decent rules concerning animal experiments. Thanks to Mrs Roth-Behrendt's and others' stubbornness, however, acceptable results were in actual fact achieved in two areas."
"The first of these was in relation to animal experiments."
"We are now to have bans imposed on animal experiments and on the marketing of new products developed by means of animal experiments."
"Where most experiments are concerned, the ban will apply in six years' time; but, unfortunately, the bans on three areas, or methods, of experimentation will only apply in ten years' time, and then with a risk of the deadline's also being extended."
"It might of course be said that both deadlines are too far in the future."
"That is also what we have said here in Parliament but, as we know from the negotiations, there were some Member States that simply blocked the experiments concerned being halted more quickly."
"It is now crucial that the Commission be consistent in following up the issue."
"I am able fully to endorse Mr Davies's observation."
"Compliance with the current directives has not been sufficiently well monitored, and this has inflicted quite unnecessary suffering upon millions of animals used in experiments."
"There has most definitely been an acceptance of laxity in developing alternative methods, and that laxity must cease with this directive."
"The second major result concerned ourselves as consumers."
"First and foremost, we are obtaining a ban on the use of a range of carcinogenic substances and on the use of substances that impair our reproductive ability."
"We are to have special safety requirements in relation to children; allergy-producing ingredients are to be labelled; and details are to be provided of the shelf-life of individual products."
"I believe that, overall, there has been a breakthrough in relation to unnecessary animal experiments and that there has also been a breakthrough in terms of public health and consumer protection in the cosmetics area."
"Overall, this is a constructive outcome, and I would once again call upon the Commission to be consistent in following up this matter. I also believe that it is necessary for ourselves in Parliament to monitor such follow-up from the sidelines."
"Madam President, there were three goals that were important to the Greens."
"Firstly the abolition of animal testing in cosmetics."
"That has succeeded; congratulations to Mrs Roth-Behrendt who negotiated so excellently."
"The second point, which was given less of a chance, relates to dangerous substances."
"Dangerous substances must not be allowed to be used in cosmetics."
"We also won on that point, so compliments are due to Mrs Roth-Behrendt in that regard too."
"The third point concerns allergens."
"Some cosmetics still contain allergens."
"Originally the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance wanted a complete ban on these substances, but we are quite happy with the labelling that has now been decided upon, because we think that it will mean the same thing in practice."
"There are already signs that quite a few big companies will be removing these allergens from their cosmetics."
"So we have also won on that point."
"There is one thing I would like to get off my chest, though: I really cannot understand the criticism from the animal protectionists."
"We have achieved the most we could achieve, and we commend the rapporteur and the whole negotiation delegation."
"Madam President, current policy whereby industry has been given time to develop alternative methods of experimentation has not produced results."
"It is essential to impose bans on experiments and marketing."
"Animals should not suffer through its being possible to develop new vanity products."
"I should therefore like to congratulate Mrs Roth-Behrendt on the outcome of what will soon have been a long fight."
"Even if the conciliation text turned out not to be as restrictive as Parliament had wished, it contains the right principles."
"It is still a puzzle to me that the Council does not consider that dangerous substances that are carcinogenic, mutagenic or reproductively toxic should, in accordance with the precautionary principle, be completely excluded from being used in cosmetics."
"All substances, including those in category 3, must be covered."
"Children too use products, such as shampoo and shower soap, containing these substances, and no type of risk should be taken."
"The conciliation text is along the right lines, however, so I would once again congratulate you on your worthwhile struggle, Dagmar. The June Movement will of course vote in favour of the conciliation text."
"When viewed solely from the point of view of cosmetics, the outcome of the conciliation can be described as good."
"The industrial lobby has once again triumphed over the interests of animals who suffer unnecessarily."
"Europeans will only allow animal testing if it is absolutely necessary."
"This necessity does not apply to beauty products, so this directive should have implemented an unconditional ban on the sale and testing of these cosmetics."
"There is no such ban, however."
"The standpoint taken by our Parliament was already a compromise, but the outcome that has now been achieved makes things even worse."
"A partial prohibition will not enter into force until 2009, and three tests will be allowed to continue until as late as 2013 and perhaps even after that."
"It is not the Parliamentary delegation in the conciliation committee who is to blame for this flawed compromise but the Commission and the Council who have unilaterally bowed to pressure from the cosmetics industry."
"Better information for the consumer will hopefully result in consumers not wanting to become more beautiful by buying 'ugly' cosmetics."
"It is of the greatest importance that governments, science and industry invest in alternative methods."
"There is nothing at all wrong with a constant stream of new cosmetics coming on to the market; it must just not be at the expense of animals suffering unnecessarily."
"There are already very many products on the market which contain very many safe ingredients that have been tested on animals, and as far as I am concerned, that is enough now."
"This directive makes Europe look ugly, so I will not be supporting it."
"Madam President, we have been on a long journey."
"This third reading stage it is not the end of the journey, but it is a very significant point on that road towards the protection of human health and the enhancement of animal welfare."
"That is why the rapporteur has rightly received the plaudits today because she has taken us along that road."
"When we hear the phrase 'long gestation periods' we have tended hitherto to think of elephants."
"In future we will think of European legislation."
"It has been a long gestation period."
"We then had a long period in labour from 4 p.m. in the afternoon until 4 a.m. in the morning, and at the end we gave birth to a programme which will stand the test, which is why we welcome this point on the debate today."
"The Commission originally came forward with a proposal to end tests."
"However, that would have done no more than the proposal which went through in the United Kingdom, which ended testing on animals, but which simply resulted in the tests on animals being exported."
"We were in danger of doing just that and putting the testing into countries where the welfare of animals was a much lower priority than it is within the Member States."
"It was right that we moved the debate on to the end of the marketing of products tested on animals within the European Union."
"We reminded ourselves, and we do so again, that on 1 July the sixth amendment came into force."
"Technically that would have brought any research using animals to a standstill."
"There would have been no further progress on the production of new items, not just in the makeup field, but in areas such as medicated shampoos and dental hygiene."
"We looked beyond that and we see the seventh amendment as the last chance."
"It sets the target dates to end that marketing."
"We decided that a blanket target date was not sustainable and so we looked for a timetable, and as a validated alternative becomes available for each test, that test on animals will be banned."
"All such tests will be banned within the six years with the exception of the three to which the rapporteur has drawn attention, for which there will be a ten-year permitted timetable and a possibility of an extension of two years if, and only if, this Parliament endorses that extension through codecision."
"Now the challenge is not only to the Commission, other colleagues have said that, but it is to the industry."
"It is up to the industry to accelerate that search for validated alternatives."
"The cooperation that exists already between Parliament and industry has been impressive."
"It has helped to convince firstly the Commission, and then even the minority on the Council which was reluctant to go along with this."
"This minority too came into line and that is why we are at the point we are today, in optimistic mode."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the compromise reached by the Council and Parliament after much deliberation represents progress for animal welfare, as it will mean a ban on animal testing in cosmetics - as long as there are alternative methods available, of course."
"Congratulations are in order for that."
"I am wholly in favour of it."
"I am also extremely pleased about the transitional period of six years to allow alternatives to be found, as there are only three categories of tests that are particularly difficult to replace and the industry has until 2013 to develop alternative methods for these."
"After all, ladies and gentlemen, let us be honest, which of you would volunteer to be tested with new substances?"
"The widespread criticism about this transitional period, which argues that permitting animal testing to continue is a loophole in the law, is therefore unjustified."
"As long as people do not volunteer for testing themselves, other ways of testing certain bulk products must be permitted."
"After all, these bulk products are also used in the pharmaceutical industry, and the standards we apply to medicines are naturally different from those we apply to lipstick."
"I therefore wholeheartedly endorse this compromise."
"Madam President, Commissioner, today is an immensely important day for the European cosmetics industry, ushering in a completely new era for cosmetic products, one for which a very large number of women have waited for a very long time."
"I hope that products will come on to the market that will make beautiful young girls even more beautiful, but these are also very important to older women, who of course want to be attractive grandmothers to their grandchildren - and you try and find a grandmother who would dare tell her grandchildren that the cream she has just used, or that she uses on the children, has caused suffering to an immense number of animals."
"Such a grandmother would be done for!"
"You see, celebrated and truly beautiful women have for a long time used products made without experimentation on animals."
"Julia Roberts is one such; she loves natural cosmetics, preferring to use a rose cream from a German firm - and, ladies and gentlemen, as she is a celebrated American actress, perhaps that is sending an important message to the American cosmetics industry."
"Do American actresses really have to resort to European products simply because they are not tested on animals here?"
"That attests to the inadequacy of the American cosmetics industry."
"I love cosmetics."
"I owe my hair colour to l'Oréal, my perfume is by Dior, and my face cream comes from Great Britain - Englishwomen have such wonderful complexions."
"In future, though, I will use far more cosmetics, and will be proposing Mrs Roth-Behrendt for honorary membership of all animal welfare organisations."
"Today, though, I really would like to thank Europe's cosmetics industry most warmly for its cooperation, and I wish you a turnover of staggering dimensions."
"May these new products earn you masses and masses of money."
"The next item is the vote."
"Motion for a resolution (B5-0027/2003) tabled by Giuseppe Di Lello Finuoli, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on immigration and asylum policy"
"(Parliament rejected the motion for resolution)"
"Joint motion for a resolution"
"Mr President, I rise on a brief point of order."
"I have two short comments to make: firstly, to express my regret and to apologise, because I am the author of an alternative motion for a resolution which, as a result of the appalling time constraints, could not be included in Monday evening's debate on this report."
"I wish to apologise for this and have my apology recorded in the House; secondly, I wish to ask the Bureau to draw attention to the fact that the first vote we will be holding on Amendment No 49 is not an ordinary vote; it is not a common vote on the amendment. It is instead the first time that we shall be using one of Parliament's new rules - Rule 140(4) and, consequently, the possibility of adopting an alternative overall text."
"In accordance with the new Rule 140(4) of the Rules of Procedure, we will take your amendment to replace the whole motion for a resolution by a new text first."
"Before the vote on Amendment No 23:"
"Mr President, our voting list does not seem to be following the same order as yours."
"That may be our problem rather than yours, but could we just take a moment to clarify?"
"We did not have Amendment 6 or Amendment 30, so we are a bit lost at the moment."
"Could my colleagues help me here?"
"I think we have lost the page."
"We have lost a whole page."
"It is OK."
"We will catch up."
"(Laughter and applause)"
"The Liberals have been saying that for a hundred years."
"(Laughter and applause)"
"Before the vote on Amendment No 24:"
"We will ensure that all language versions are compatible."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"It is my pleasure to welcome to the public gallery representatives of the Egyptian Parliament, led by Dr Mustafa El-Feki."
"This is the first visit by representatives from the Egyptian Parliament since 1987."
"It occurs at a very important time, in terms of the Middle East."
"We particularly wish the delegation success under the current circumstances."
"Mr President, the oral amendment consists of a social measure."
"In paragraph 14, letter s, where it refers to attention to the care needs of those in rural communities, I would add ''and mountain communities''."
"This is also in honour of the International Year of Mountains and the many mountains we have in Europe."
"Mr President, I nevertheless deplore the way in which this vote has proceeded."
"I regret that our colleagues were not serious to the end and showed no respect for the efforts of our fellow Members who worked on this resolution."
"I agree with you entirely."
"That concludes the vote"
"- (DA) Overall, we are voting against the joint resolution on immigration and asylum policy tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party and the Group of the Party of European Socialists."
"We are against the EU's having influence in this area, since it should be up to the Member States themselves to decide on these matters."
"We are, however, able to support those parts of the resolution that take account of the social and humanitarian situation of refugees and immigrants and that try to improve it."
"- (DA) We have, today in the European Parliament, voted in favour of the joint resolution (B5-0031/2003) on immigration and asylum policy."
"The proposal contains quite a number of useful features for improving immigration and asylum policy in the EU."
"We are nonetheless aware of the fact that this area includes states of affairs covered by Title IV of the EC Treaty and not relevant to Denmark, cf. the Protocol on Denmark's Position."
"Mr President, it was with great pleasure that I voted for the report against the experimentation of cosmetics on animals, tabled by Mrs Dagmar Roth-Behrendt."
"Why did I vote for the report?"
"I must say that fish, which I have helped and supported for a long time with regard to reports concerning them, have spread the word that Mr Fatuzzo helps and listens to animals, and consequently the news has spread from them to many other animal species."
"So many of these creatures have asked me to ensure - in my own small way with my vote - that these experiments, which they do not look on kindly, are ended."
"They also asked me to try my best to stop fur coats being made from their pelts: another important achievement which I hope will come about soon."
"In the meantime, we have obtained what I voted for, contained in the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee in the Roth-Behrendt report."
". (PT) The European Parliament has fought for the Directive on Cosmetics to be extended and deepened, especially in the field of testing on animals."
"Parliament was therefore calling for: a ban on animal testing from 2004; a ban on the marketing of products that have been tested on animals five years after the adoption of this directive and the promotion of alternative testing methods that do not involve experiments on animals."
"Unfortunately, the original position of the European Commission was to advocate a ban on animal testing in the European area rather than a ban on the marketing of such products."
"I welcome the fact that, in the conciliation process, both the Council and the Commission moved towards the position maintained by the European Parliament. I am also pleased that an agreement was reached, stipulating a ban on experimenting and marketing for most testing methods within six years and, with regard to tests for which alternative methods have not yet been tested, a ten-year transposition period for this ban."
"Mr President, the final two lines of paragraph 55 of the Swiebel report, which has been adopted by the House, calls for steps to be taken as soon as possible, on the basis of the Treaty of Amsterdam, to issue a directive abolishing all the other kinds of discrimination not yet regulated, which are set out in Article 13, including the prohibition of discrimination against citizens on the grounds of age and disability."
"In Italy, we still have a law which does not grant a disability pension to elderly citizens, whereas it does grant it to its younger citizens."
"I think that, when someone falls ill, the age that this occurs is unimportant: people fall ill to the same degree; if people have no income, they are the same, whether young or old."
"In particular, I feel that not giving a disability pension to European citizens just because they are over 65, whereas one would be granted before, is discrimination, and that is why I gladly approved this report."
"Mr President, as has already been said, by just five votes Parliament has provided the news reports with one of the most disappointing and shameful pages on our work in this forum: a report entitled 'on the human rights situation in the European Union' and which, on the contrary, has violated, or is violating, many of the rights which most affect citizens."
"Let us consider one of many: the institution of the family, which is, to say the least, distorted by this report; a family model which proposes the free union between men or women of the same sex and liberalised single-parent or, precisely, homosexual, adoption laws."
"And furthermore, a country is put forward as a model - the Netherlands to be exact - which, in addition to these things, has official euthanasia and liberalised drug policies."
"Well, if this is the social model which is now coming out of Parliament, I dissociate myself from it and - here lies the weak spot - the majority of Member States dissociate themselves from it too: only two or three indirectly follow the Dutch model."
"There will now be an institutional deadlock, because neither the Commission nor the Council - they have already announced this - are willing to accept this trend."
"We have missed an opportunity to be clearer and more coherent."
"The British Labour members and I have voted in favour of the Swiebel report, which as a whole serves a valuable purpose."
"All Member States must, by their very nature, be strong and confident enough to accept criticism."
"This does not automatically mean that every criticism should be accepted as valid."
"The report is based on second-hand information from NGOs and other organisations."
"A number of factual inaccuracies have therefore crept in."
"The UK takes very seriously all allegations of violence and racism by public servants."
"Any allegations are rigorously investigated and prosecutions sought."
"The detention of foreign nationals suspected of terrorism is a very serious matter."
"However, exceptional measures are sometimes necessary to deal with potential threats to national security."
"The 1951 Geneva Convention was surely never intended to give protection to terrorists; it is therefore right that they should be excluded."
"Whilst not perfect, UK legislation seeks to promote the rights of workers and encourages employers to treat employees with due consideration at all times."
"They also have access to legal redress if appropriate."
"With respect to maternity rights in the UK, all pregnant women are entitled to 18 weeks leave, which may begin up to 11 weeks before the birth of the child."
"So we have reservations about the accuracy of the report but we welcome it and have voted in favour."
"?he motion on fundamental rights in the European Union is, generally speaking, a good motion."
"However, there are several problem paragraphs, such as paragraph 78 on the ban on women entering Mount Athos."
"I do not think it is against this criterion that women's rights will be measured; they will be measured in terms of employment, equal pay, domestic violence and the fight against trafficking in human beings."
"We can hardly talk about freedom of movement on this tiny strip of land which has its own sense of time and observes customs and traditions which date back thousands of years."
"Soon we will be calling for freedom of establishment and freedom of business activity and the monasteries will be overrun with Coca-Cola stands."
"In an increasingly plastic and homogenised world, we should respect the cultural wealth which comes down from the past, without affecting modern society, and leave Mount Athos to travel through time at its own pace."
"It is because of paragraph 78 that I am forced to vote against the report as a whole."
"- (IT) The defence of fundamental rights cannot and must not become the ideological flag of any particular group, but must be the joint heritage of all citizens."
"Reading the pages of the Swiebel Report, however, it can be inferred that this important commitment to everybody's rights is being transformed into an accusation against some quarters: in particular Italy and those who, in Italy, took the liberty of voting against the rapporteur's wishes."
"Also with regard to defence of the family and related values, the report takes a one-sided, prejudiced view, which is certainly legitimate for a political group, but which cannot and must not become a common position of the European Union."
"Apart from religious aspects - which, nevertheless, cannot be completely overlooked, given the importance attached to Christian culture in Europe - the report completely ignores the great social and educational value undeniably inherent in the traditional couple, intended as a basic cell in the connective tissue of society."
"Defence of the right of individuals to conduct their relationships in their preferred manner is sacrosanct, but the European institutions cannot, in my view, equate these relationships with the social institution of the family in its traditional meaning."
"(Text abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)"
"I am deeply concerned to read the many criticisms of the United Kingdom in this report."
"I note that most Labour members voted for the passages concerned with the UK and can well understand their despair at the state of the United Kingdom after just under five years of a Labour Government."
"For myself, I felt obliged to vote against the report."
"Possibly, at the next election the Labour Members should unite around the slogan: 'Things can only get better'."
"- (DA) We have today voted in favour of paragraph 41 of Mrs Swiebel's report for, if the common EU asylum policy should unfortunately be adopted, we want it to be based upon humanitarianism and respect for international conventions. Moreover, respect for human rights must be, and remain, its indispensable point of departure."
"On principle, we do not however believe that this is best achieved by developing a common European refugee policy based on the supranational first pillar."
"The June Movement is also voting in favour of the whole report, because human rights within the EU must naturally be respected, if not improved."
"We are doing this in spite of the fact that we do not wish to see a common asylum policy, the incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the development of an EU human rights agency."
"The June Movement endeavours to support and improve the human rights situation both within and outside the EU."
"We support the right of everyone to a life of dignity, but we do not believe that this is necessarily best achieved within the framework of the EU."
". (PT) The report both criticises and praises the human rights situation in Portugal, in a way that we feel is accurate and balanced."
"It would not be acceptable for the Portuguese institutions not to take account of them on the pretext that the integrity of the State takes precedence over citizens' rights and this is the factor that won my vote."
"The report's explanatory statement also contains less rigorous information which did not, however, influence my vote, because I do not feel they are important in determining the report's content, since they are not being voted on or published."
"Like local, regional or national institutions, the European institutions must also be free to adopt a position, criticise or praise the practices of institutions other than their own."
"Nevertheless, a report on the situation of fundamental rights in the EU that makes no assessment of the legislation and activities of the European institutions is not a report on the European Union - it is merely a report on Member States."
"This report on the Member States must therefore be followed up with another, more important report, assessing the practices of the European institutions in the field of human rights."
". (PT) We wish to distance ourselves clearly from the approach contained in the motion for a resolution which seeks to give the Charter of Fundamental Rights a 'constitutional' value that it does not have and we would recall the criticism we made of any such intention and of the motion's retrograde content in the field of rights at the time it was adopted at the Nice Summit, whereas others have supported it and continue to do so."
"We wish to distance ourselves clearly from a vision of control and of interference in the domestic affairs of the Member States, which is reinforced in the Treaties and which we criticised at the time, whereas others have supported it and continue to do so."
"At the same time, we must not forget the methodological aspects that occur throughout the process, and we feel that the motion that has been tabled lists a set of recommendations - and we should emphasise here that these are only recommendations - which, in general terms, will protect fundamental rights."
"These include personal freedoms, immigrants' rights, freedom of movement, the right to privacy, non-discrimination, gender equality, children's rights, the rights of people with disabilities and the protection of social rights. These recommendations will protect social rights - particularly by making optimal use of the revised European Social Charter and the ILO conventions - and access to justice."
"Hence our vote in favour of the report."
"."
"(EL) The PASOK political group's vote on the motion in Mrs Joke Swiebel's report is a clear vote against, as far as Greece is concerned."
"On most points criticising Greece or urging it to make improvements, either the relevant articles of Greek law have already been amended and the called-for improvement already introduced or the first steps toward legislative reform have already been taken."
"For example:"
"1."
"We are urged (paragraph 17) to abolish the death penalty."
"However, the three facts are omitted:"
"a) the death penalty has been abolished, except in the military penal code, and then only for crimes in times of war;"
"b) the bill to abolish the death penalty in the military penal code has already been drafted;"
"c) no death penalty imposed is ever carried out."
"2."
"Conscientious objectors:"
"a) the new arrangements allowing exemption from military service are now included in a constitutional decree;"
"b) Greek legislation no longer limits these favourable arrangements to religious objection; they now extend to conscientious objection in general."
"Anyone establishing fundamental rights in the European Union must know whether these rights are being observed seriously by the governments concerned."
"It is to Mrs Swiebel's credit that she has documented so well how much is wrong in Europe in the area of human rights."
"She correctly focuses attention on police misconduct, abuses in prisons, discrimination against ethnic minorities, failings in criminal proceedings and the vestiges of inequalities between men and women."
"This also applies to child labour, the access of non-EU citizens to the labour market, the difficulties people have in obtaining the nationality of the country in which they are now living, and the lack of the right to vote for those who have not yet obtained this nationality."
"EU Member States are apparently failing to ratify international treaties on national minorities, cross-border television, the revised European Social Charter and the status of adopted or illegitimate children."
"Minors are being used as child soldiers."
"Excessively authoritarian security measures that are now being justified with reference to the current threat of terrorism are threatening to become permanent."
"We are very much in need of this inventory so that we can put an end to abuses more effectively."
"It is striking that this report, which speaks for itself, was only adopted by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs by 25 votes to 20."
"Evidently there is a large minority in this Parliament that does not want to tackle the existing violations of fundamental rights."
". (PT) There is nothing like a good political fight."
"From the democratic point of view, I congratulate Mrs Swiebel on her ultimate success."
"The narrow margin between votes, however, which meant that my own motion for a resolution was not adopted in plenary (by only 23 votes) and the extremely slim majority (of only five votes) that has just adopted the final resolution, clearly show that the wrong course has been taken."
"This adds nothing positive to European integration on which, being an issue so bound up in the tradition, history and consensus of the European peoples, we have been so profoundly divided, heading towards radical confrontations."
"In fact, anyone reading the motion that has been adopted might believe themselves to be living in a terrible atmosphere of persecution, under one of the murkiest dictatorships of the twentieth century!"
"The methodological shift employed by the rapporteur (and by the narrow majority) has led to exaggerated views that show utter contempt for the fact that the European Union is one of the few privileged regions in the entire world where human rights and respect and guarantees for these are concerned."
"Lastly, we have heaped scorn on the reality of a situation with which we are all familiar and we have ended up looking ridiculous, for having given in to a left-wing and sectarian political agenda."
"This does no favours, either for Europe or for human rights."
"Finally, I welcome the initiative of tabling an overall alternative motion: since the UEN Group has only 22 Members, the 246 votes obtained in plenary by the alternative motion clearly demonstrate the relative success achieved, as an instrument for political clarification and for affirming our difference."
"I would like to congratulate Mrs Swiebel on her outstanding work."
"I also find it disappointing that 13 of the 15 Member States appear not to have honoured their obligation to report periodically on the human rights situation in their countries to the international supervisory committees set up for this purpose."
"As the European Union, we have to set an example, otherwise our credibility with third countries will be in jeopardy."
"As the chairman of the Intergroup for Regional and Minority Languages, I would like to emphasise how important the use of regional and minority languages is to people."
"Language forms part of our personal and cultural identity and is thus one of our fundamental rights."
"It is the most important means of communication between people."
"Encouraging the use of minority languages reinforces social cohesion at regional level."
"I have therefore voted in favour of paragraphs 66 and 68."
"It is the first step."
"According to Article 149 of the Treaty on European Union, the European Union's task is to support linguistic diversity."
"This is not enough: we urgently need a legal basis for regional and minority languages in the Treaty."
"Language is an important part of our cultural heritage, and it would be a sin if regional and minority languages were to be lost on account of neglect and suppression."
"Mr President, the Pensioners' Party, which I represent here, strongly approves of this report on the European Union's management of the external borders of our 15 Member States, soon to become 25, and shortly thereafter, 27."
"In my opinion, it is important to immediately give economic strength and, in particular, the European Union's support, to all these new candidate countries which, in two or four years' time, will constitute the external borders of the Union."
"In fact, it is clear that this is where the weakness of the borders lies, and the first months following the entry of these States, in law and in fact, into the European Union, is when there will be the greatest danger of a violation of the new external borders of Europe."
"- (DA) We have, today in the European Parliament, voted neither in favour of, nor against, Mr Pirker's report (A5-0449/2002) on integrated management of the external borders."
"The proposal includes quite a few useful features, but we do not believe that the time is ripe for setting up a joint Corps of Border Guards."
"At the same time, we would draw attention to the fact that this area includes states of affairs covered by Title IV of the EC Treaty and not relevant to Denmark, cf. the Protocol on Denmark's Position."
"(PT) I wish to congratulate Mr Pirker on the excellent report he has produced on the communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament entitled 'Towards integrated management of the external borders of the Member States of the European Union' which I fully support, in particular with regard to the aptness of creating a European Corps of Border Guards. Whilst not replacing the national authorities responsible for managing their external borders, this would enable them to work together to ensure the internal security of the Union and the implementation of the principle of freedom of movement."
"I would also stress my conviction that the efficiency of border management will probably be improved by the adoption of common measures in the field of external border management."
"The collective training of officials, the collective development of radar equipment, the purchase of mobile surveillance installations and a collective border surveillance service belong to a different sort of Europe than the one the European Union has up to now professed to be."
"If the EU develops into one single superstate, it goes without saying that there must be one single minister of foreign affairs with one single embassy in every country abroad and one single collective seat in the United Nations."
"The remarkable thing is that nobody is openly advocating a superstate such as this."
"The Member States want to keep their embassies and their seats in the UN and the ministers of foreign affairs would rather coordinate their work through a common secretariat than through the European Commission."
"Specifically when it comes to everything to do with foreign affairs and defence, we try to show that the EU still consists of 15 sovereign states."
"It would therefore only be logical to opt for a standard access procedure for migrants and visitors from abroad and a standard border surveillance service if we really wanted to be one single superstate."
"What is remarkable is that we are now making a decision to screen off 'Fortress Europe' against the poor parts of the outside world without having reached agreement about a common future inside this fortress."
"I therefore reject this proposal."
". (PT) Illegal immigration networks, trafficking in human beings, organised crime and the fight against terrorism are situations that certainly warrant widespread and priority concern and, as defined in Laeken, call for cooperation mechanisms between the current services responsible for controlling our external borders."
"Nevertheless, it is clear that in the Schengen acquis, structures with competences and powers to define 'common standards' and processes for police cooperation are already in place."
"This proposal, however, goes further and the aim behind it is to create a European Corps of Border Guards, with duties that fall within the strict competence of the national authorities and to which, therefore, we cannot agree."
"Its activities would involve, in particular, the inspection of documents, the questioning of foreign citizens and the notification of admission or refusal of entry into our territory."
"Clearly, a European police corps of this nature raises questions, primarily with regard to its questionable and highly dubious effectiveness."
"Essentially, however, and as affirmed in the Commission Communication, it would pose delicate constitutional problems in various Member States."
"It is therefore a priority to make national police forces with these powers more effective and to ensure appropriate cooperation between them in order to provide a satisfactory response to such situations."
". (PT) This report focuses on the Commission communication on better management of external borders, which links the action of the Member States with measures of a European nature, which are crucial given the threat, posed in particular by organised crime, terrorism, illegal immigration, and the imminent entry of new countries into the EU."
"In light of the experience gained from applying the Schengen acquis, we feel it would be appropriate to implement a common policy in the field of managing current and future external borders, incorporating into this policy the best practices established by the Member States."
"Nevertheless, European border management still falls within the sphere of national competence and must be applied at national level and, on this point, I am in full agreement with the rapporteur's position."
"In this context, the programmes for the training and re-training of staff and senior officials, updating the design and installation of equipment and the drawing up of an integrated risk analysis model are absolutely crucial."
"Despite the rapporteur's suggestion to create a European corps of border guards composed of special units, to be made available on a temporary basis to the national authorities in high-risk sectors at external borders, when needed and requested by the Member States, which is controversial, my opinion on the report as a whole is positive and I have therefore voted for it."
"Mr President, many pensioners purchase securities in an attempt to be better off in their later life."
"The document by Mr Generoso Andria which we have adopted, helps these small investors, citizens who do not have much money but for whom it is even more important to have fewer expenses when they invest the little money they have available in securities."
"I therefore applaud the initiative and content of this report which my friend, Mr Generoso Andria, tabled to the House and which the House, myself included, voted for today."
". (PT) This report should be seen against the backdrop of the action plan for financial services planned under what is known as the Lisbon strategy, which aims to integrate markets and financial services by 2005 and to achieve greater liberalisation of movements of capital, to which we are opposed."
"On the basis of a recent Commission communication, which seeks to regulate the clearing and settlement of securities transactions, in other words, the functioning of the integrated securities markets, especially in crossborder transactions, and in the aim of liberalising movements of capital and of creating a single market for financial services, it also seeks to harmonise the rules, legislation and methods of clearing and settlement in the various Member States, taking account of the considerable national differences that exist in this field."
"Hence the desire to create a common European infrastructure and the proposals to follow the American example, exerting pressure on the Commission to study a similar approach for the European Union, also calling on the Member States, in the forthcoming revision of Directive 93/22/EEC, on investment services, to give investment companies from other States the right of access to national clearing and settlement systems."
"This is something with which we disagree."
"Mr President, the proposals contained in the document tabled by Mr Mario Mantovani on the future of health care and care for the elderly that we have adopted, is perfect, and we should approve every single line, as I did."
"I would like to stress how important it is, in my opinion and in the opinion of the Pensioners' Party which I represent in the European Parliament, for more substantial European funds to be granted to the development of remote surgical operation techniques."
"Nowadays, a surgeon in Rome can operate on an ill patient - usually an elderly patient - in Finland or Belgium and vice versa."
"This is what living without borders is all about, and we have to provide as much help as Europe can give to all citizens in this field, in particular those who are ill."
"The issue of health care and care for the elderly is an important one and of concern to us all."
"The report is thoughtful and well-considered."
"I would underline the point made early in the report that the provision of health and health care services is a Member State competence."
"It is important that this should continue to be the case."
"But all Member States can learn from each other, and in particular they need to learn in the key areas covered by this report."
"I was pleased that my amendments were accepted by the rapporteur as well as the full House today."
"The specific needs of the elderly regarding health care need much more attention, especially in rural areas."
"In my own country, projections are that more and more elderly people are moving to rural areas to retire."
"They put down roots in such communities."
"Long, active and fulfilled lives depend more on socialising than exercising, and it is important that as many as possible of the needs of the elderly are addressed within their local communities rather than addressed at a distance in the towns and cities."
"This is a challenge, but it is a challenge which must be met."
"Useful and essential community services cost money."
"Without the input of community money, people who are old, sick or unemployed will not be able to exist."
"We would have no decent healthcare for the vast majority of people, no education, no public transport, no environmental protection and no services for the aged."
"The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs wants a combination of best practices, access, high quality and accessibility."
"It makes little sense to formulate such nice objectives without providing sufficient resources to enable these objectives to actually be achieved."
"By constantly striving to cut taxes, we make it impossible to provide good services and the solidarity required for these."
"People constantly maintain that the cost of services can be cut without compromising on quality."
"That would have to be achieved by calling in private profit-oriented businesses, by reducing the number of services, by having the work done by fewer people and by increasing contributions from users."
"In the Netherlands, years of cut-backs have resulted in the closure of small hospitals, waiting lists for healthcare, a shortage of new teachers and a severe reduction in services in what used to be a good public transport system."
"At the end of the day, this report is based on a model such as this."
"As it is ultimately the weakest who pay, I reject this model."
". (PT) As a result of the Member States' policies, the EU is benefiting from clearly exceptional health systems compared to the rest of the world."
"This does not mean, however, that the ongoing need to protect those who are particularly vulnerable or who have serious financial difficulties due to the high cost of treatment should be overlooked."
"Against this backdrop, the proposals contained in the Commission Communication are of strategic importance to guaranteeing accessibility, quality and financial viability with regard to healthcare for the elderly."
"The fact that the organisation of healthcare systems, their funding and planning are the responsibility of the Member States is not a barrier to Community cooperation in policies on issues of ageing, in particular in the field of health. Instead, the sharing of experiences and solutions could help to achieve the social cohesion that we wish to see."
"I have fully supported this report, which has, in fact, incorporated valuable contributions from the opinion delivered by Mr Mussa of the UEN Group, not least with regard to: recognising the important role of healthcare providers, the proposal for Community funding for various training projects and the issue of ill treatment of the elderly."
"Lastly, we should emphasise the need for a 'New Attitude' with respect to the elderly, seeing them as an important new resource that should be cherished - not as a burden on society."
"Life expectancy has almost doubled in the last fifty years, which has created a completely different world."
"Through better levels of protection, Europe and the Europeans will benefit enormously from the huge wealth of wisdom, experience and knowledge that is the valuable capital of the elderly."
"Mr President, I have the pleasure of having a nephew, Silvio Nardini, my sister's son - he does not know that I am mentioning him in the European Parliament - whom I am very proud of because he is part of the European Force involved in a peace mission in Afghanistan: he is a 'top gun', as they say in films, but has his feet firmly on the ground."
"He said to me: 'I have been and am in the United Arab Emirates controlling air traffic from Italy to Afghanistan."
"I am very happy and proud of what I am doing, and it is very satisfying."
"This is not war; it is about bringing peace and building on it where there is need'."
"This is why I voted, even more enthusiastically, for this report on Afghanistan."
"British Conservatives voted in favour of the resolution on Afghanistan, which contains many useful elements, but we do not accept the implied criticism of US actions in Recital I, and in the new paragraph 15a; the desire for the EU as such to create a political role for itself; the suggestion in paragraph 15 that the Council should reconsider its proposals for return of refugees; or indeed the proposal in the new paragraph 10a that ISAF military forces should be employed to investigate human rights abuses, notwithstanding our earnest desire for improvement in the human rights situation, particularly in relation to the situation of women."
"That concludes the explanations of vote."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.29 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"I should like to give you the results of the second ballot in the vote of the election of the Ombudsman:"
"Members voting - 535;"
"Blank or spoiled ballots - 26;"
"Votes cast - 509"
"Absolute majority - 255."
"The votes cast were as follows: Mr Diamandouros, 294 votes, Mr Perry, 215 votes."
"Mr Diamandouros has obtained the majority of the votes cast."
"I therefore declare him to be the European Ombudsman."
"I congratulate him on his appointment and invite him, in due course, to take an oath before the Court of Justice, pursuant to our Rules of Procedure."
"I should like not only to congratulate our new Ombudsman, but to take the opportunity to place on record our thanks for and appreciation of the work of the first Ombudsman of the European Union, Mr Söderman."
"Mr President, may I take this opportunity to be the first Member to congratulate Professor Diamandouros on his election as European Ombudsman."
"It has been my pleasure over the last few years to work with Jacob Söderman, who has been an outstanding Ombudsman for Europe, but I am very happy to see that the position of Ombudsman will continue in the safe hands of Professor Diamandouros."
"The post of Ombudsman is a crucial post for European democracy."
"It is important that it is in competent hands and we now see that it will be."
"One point I would like to make is this. All the candidates for Ombudsman - and they should all be thanked for their contribution to the debate - have upheld the code of good administrative behaviour proposed and endorsed by this Parliament and proposed by Mr Söderman."
"We should very firmly say to the institutions of Europe, particularly the Commission, that they should also now seize the opportunity without any further delay to endorse that code, so that we can be quite sure that Europe has the good administration it needs and deserves and which all the servants of the institutions wish to provide."
"I offer Professor Diamandouros all my congratulations."
"Mr President, as President-in-Office, may I offer the European Parliament my warmest congratulations on its selection."
"I know that the candidates, especially those remaining in the final round, were both highly qualified and extremely able."
"I think the European Parliament has made an excellent choice and, as a result, Mr Diamandouros will, I think, be able to contribute to European affairs and make even more improvements to the office of the Ombudsman."
"As Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, as Mr Diamandouros's colleague at the University of Athens and as a long-standing friend, may I say that I am delighted and excited by his election to this post."
"I would like to congratulate him and, at the same time, say how sorry I am that Greece will be losing him for a while."
"He is so valuable that this will be a real loss to us."
"However, we look forward to winning him back, even more experienced and able than when he left us."
"President, on behalf of the Commission, on behalf of the College and on behalf of all who work in the Commission, I would like most warmly to congratulate Professor Diamandouros on his election."
"It is a great day for him and a great day for Greece, though I recognise Europe's gain is Greece's loss."
"The Professor comes to these onerous responsibilities with extraordinary credentials, not least that he is a friend of Commissioner Diamontopoulou, so there are many reasons to recognise that he has all the qualities and all the experience and knowledge which are required for this demanding job."
"I would also like to pay a tribute to the work done by Mr Söderman over the last few years."
"I am sure that Professor Diamandouros will undertake his responsibilities in a way which will enjoy the confidence of this Parliament and which will overwhelmingly earn the confidence of Europe's citizens as well."
"We wish him the best on this journey and we assure him that on this occasion, arriving and landing in Ithaca is even more exciting than travelling there."
"I would also like, if I may - having myself lost almost as many elections as I have won - to pay a tribute to Mr Perry who has, I know, enjoyed the esteem of the whole House, and his graceful remarks a few moments ago will, I know only serve to enhance his reputation."
"All our best wishes go to the Professor who I am sure will do this job outstandingly well."
"?he Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Thank you, Mrs Thors."
"Your comments have been noted."
"Mr President, I would like to point out that in the provisional Minutes for yesterday which have been distributed, it is recorded that I voted in favour of the final Resolution of the Napolitano report."
"This is a mistake."
"The final version should reflect the fact that I abstained on that report."
"The next item is the joint debate on the recommendation (?5-0410/2002) by Mr Galeote Quecedo and questions (?5-0508/2002, ?5-0509/2002) to the Council and the Commission, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the conclusion of a Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Lebanon, of the other part."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, any debate on Lebanon refers us directly to discussions on the Middle East, both about issues relating to Israel and about discussions on Iraq over the last 24 hours."
"The situation in Lebanon is still extremely complicated, mainly because so many different communities live there, meaning that problems require a multiethnic, multilingual, multi-religious approach, not forgetting that Lebanon offers shelter to a great many - about 370 000 - Palestinian refugees."
"These communities are represented at institutional level."
"The application of the arrangements in the Charter of National Reconciliation of 22 October 1989 allowing Syrian forces to be stationed in certain areas of Lebanon, basically comes within the framework of relations between Lebanon and Syria."
"The Council is closely monitoring internal political dialogue in Lebanon."
"The first step was the Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon in May 2000, followed by a partial withdrawal of the Lebanese-Syrian army in June 2001."
"At the same time, there is a risk that the presence of Hezbollah forces in the south of the country will become a destabilising factor in Israeli-Lebanese relations."
"The free parliamentary elections held on 3 September 2000 indicate that things are moving in the right direction, towards the normalisation of the situation in Lebanon, and we must not therefore underestimate the destabilising effect on Lebanon of the conflict in the Middle East."
"The Council has stated on several occasions that the fight against terrorism is a priority and the recent terrorist attack in Bali highlighted once again the need for close international cooperation on the fight against terrorism."
"Implementation of the action plan adopted by the European Council in September 2001 is progressing well."
"As far as its foreign dimension is concerned, the Council has decided to include the fight against terrorism in the agreement between the European Union and third countries."
"The fact that Lebanon was one of the first countries that agreed to sign the agreement with the European Union on this issue demonstrates that it is prepared to cooperate actively with the European Union, including in the field of information exchanges."
"The link between the Cooperation Agreement and the Association Agreement with regard to the fight against terrorism is emphasised by the fact that both agreements were signed on the same day, in Luxembourg on 17 June 2002 to be precise, and will enter into force simultaneously - and soon I hope."
"As far as respect for human rights is concerned, the Council is monitoring this issue closely."
"The Council expressed its concern about action by the Lebanese army against Christian activists in August 2001 and about the closure of the independent television station ??F last September."
"The Association Agreement will also strengthen the potential for monitoring this issue and will encourage the authorities in Lebanon to have greater respect for human rights."
"As you know, the agreement requires respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms to be a basic element in both sides' domestic and foreign policy."
"In addition, regular political dialogue will be established at various levels, mainly in the Association Agreement, on all matters of interest."
"I should like, if I may, to make a number of comments on the Association Agreement, to which the European Parliament is being invited to give its assent."
