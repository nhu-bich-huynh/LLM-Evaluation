"That is my assessment, and the Russian side agreed with it."
"The common intent that came out of that preparatory meeting was to become rather more practical in our relations and perhaps to develop fewer great new ideas, but instead to try for once actually to put into practice the ideas we already have."
"I agree with what the President-in-Office of the Council has already said here."
"In that respect, the Rome Summit was really almost the beginning of a new form of cooperation because really very precise and clear results were achieved."
"Of course, the summit in many respects confirmed the complexity of relations between the European Union and Russia."
"We reaffirmed the interest of both sides in fostering long-term integration by creating a number of common spaces both within the framework of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement and in the context of the Wider Europe initiative."
"I think it is very important that the concept of the common economic space was given really concrete form at the summit and that the High Level Group was in fact able to make concrete proposals, such as the start of a common programme for the approximation of laws and facilitation of trade."
"That will now be put into practice very quickly and will be made easier by Russia’s impending accession to the WTO, which we anticipate for 2004."
"The Commission is very much in favour of Russia joining the WTO, not least in order to drive forward and consolidate economic reform in Russia."
"We have extended the Agreement on Scientific and Technological Cooperation, seeing it as one of the most important factors for the growth of our cooperation, building on Russia’s significant scientific and research capacities."
"Russia is also becoming increasingly involved in European Union initiatives to promote cooperation in research and education."
"The President-in-Office of the Council has already drawn attention to the signing of the agreement between Europol and the Russian interior ministry."
"The Commission welcomes that because it will encourage cooperation in fighting terrorism and organised crime."
"There will be a joint declaration on cooperation in political and security matters."
"Those are quite clearly areas of common interest."
"We have also, however, seen that there are things that separate the European Union and Russia today and that there are subjects on which we need to intensify our efforts in order to make progress and arrive at common results."
"I will begin with environmental problems."
"It is quite clear that we need to do more to deal with common challenges jointly such as climate change."
"So far as the Kyoto Protocol is concerned, I see the situation roughly as follows."
"It is probably realistic to assume that progress in Russia’s preparation for when it will sign the Kyoto Protocol will run parallel to its progress on joining the WTO."
"Although there is no formal link, it is quite realistic to think that there will be some parallelism between the two processes."
"It is also most important that we should be able to reach agreement on matters of safety for maritime shipping and of nuclear safety."
"The Commission sees a need for talks concerning Russia’s OSCE obligation to withdraw troops from Transnistria by the end of this year and on extending the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement to the acceding Member States."
"So far as Transnistria in particular is concerned, I think we can expect significantly more pressure from Russia to get OSCE policy implemented."
"In the matter of , the freezing of a large proportion of shares has created much instability and uncertainty on financial markets, and the Commission has made clear, both in the political dialogue in Moscow and at the summit in Rome, that the Russian authorities must in every case apply the laws fairly and without discrimination, observing the principle of proportionality."
"In relation to Chechnya, we found that the security situation there has deteriorated further since the constitutional referendum in March and the presidential elections in October."
"The European Union has issued two statements expressing its concern about allegations of ballot rigging."
"The facts make clear that a political solution to the problem has still not been found."
"We will continue to press for a more workable political solution, but that will not be possible without full respect for human rights."
"That also includes those responsible for serious human rights violations being called to account."
"For obvious reasons, the Commission raised the question of humanitarian aid both in the political dialogue and at the summit and noted that humanitarian aid is being hampered by the fact that our personnel are unable to be active on the ground."
"Talks on this subject have not resulted in a satisfactory outcome as yet."
"I would like to stress, however, that the Commission still considers it a priority to be present in the region itself with its resources and personnel in order to be able to provide assistance when and where it is needed."
"We are, after all, the largest provider of humanitarian aid in this conflict."
"What conclusions can we draw from all this?"
"Firstly, if we want to build a genuine strategic partnership, the European Union’s policy towards Russia must be balanced and consistent."
"Selecting topics that are only to the advantage of one partner is not a sufficient basis for a strategic partnership."
"Secondly, we must also try to ensure that the Member States and the Union as a whole pursue jointly defined objectives."
"Questions of visa policy and of a readmission agreement that we want to conclude with our partner Russia ought to be discussed as a common objective under the Union’s umbrella."
"Let me be perfectly clear: I do not think it is helpful when individual Member States pursue their own policies with Russia in these matters before we have a common policy."
"Thirdly, relations between the Union and Russia are of the utmost importance for the future of both partners."
"We must not allow initiatives that would be to the advantage of both sides, such as extending the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement or cooperation in fighting crime and in environmental matters, to come to grief because of bureaucratic obstacles."
"It is therefore very important for the European Union and Russia to call the Permanent Partnership Council into being in order to intensify cooperation between respective ministers."
"Fourthly and lastly, we should place particular stress on developing a tailored concept, together with Russia as part of our new neighbourhood policy, which will give expression to the importance of the special relationship and the strategic partnership between the European Union and Russia and provide the space to substantially improve and deepen that relationship."
"I am pleased to be able to say in conclusion that talks have shown that Russia is willing to cooperate in the context of the European Union’s new neighbourhood policy and that we can therefore meaningfully combine our existing strategy with the new neighbourhood policy."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, following European Union enlargement on 1 May 2004 we will have an additional frontier with Russia, not only through Finland, but also through Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and our relations with Russia will be even more important."
"We are very clear when we say that we want to seek a strategic partnership with Russia, because we know that relations between the European Union and Russia are crucial for peace and stability on our continent in the twenty-first century."
"I would like to thank my fellow Member Arie Oostlander most sincerely for negotiating a text with the other groups."
"We have here a text from six groups that reflects our opinion."
"We expressly recognise the progress that Russia has made on the road to democracy, but it is also a sign of partnership that the deficits we see are addressed openly."
"The President-in-Office has spoken of the elections in Russia, and elections can only take place if society is free from fear."
"Elections can only take place if people have enough information."
"Elections can only take place if the political system is fair."
"Elections can only take place where there is the rule of law."
"That is where there are deficits."
"We have reports that Russian citizens are afraid to protest when they find the state behaving wrongly."
"In our legal order, it is taken for granted that we can protest against any administrative act, at whatever level."
"That is why it is important for democratic development in Russia and for stability in Russia – stability is unthinkable without freedom, without democracy – that Russia should make progress in making democracy and the rule of law a reality."
"Chechnya is an open wound in Europe, not just in Russia."
"We must insist that the Chechen people are not equated with terrorists or bandits, but that the Chechen people are granted autonomy within the Russian Federation, as is the case with Tatarstan, for example."
"It would be a tragedy if, in the necessary fight against terrorism in the world – and we are resolutely for the fight against terrorism –, the Chechen people were ultimately to pay the price of terrorism."
"I say quite calmly, but my words are addressed to the Council and the Commission, that if we hold a summit with Russia and issue a declaration, then the most important topical issue cannot be left out of the official document."
"My plea for the future is therefore that we do this, and I expressly acknowledge that the Council Presidency said something about it in its statement of 8 October."
"However, it is also important that we agree on a common policy and therefore on a formulation when meeting with the Russian president."
"We support the inclusion of Russia in the Bologna process."
"We need scientific and cultural exchange with Russia to prevent Russia turning away from Europe as it has often done in its history."
"We want partnership, we want a Russia that is turned towards Europe, and we must include young people in particular here."
"We urge Russia finally to sign and ratify the border agreement with Estonia and Latvia and we promise our future Member States Estonia and Latvia support in that, because their concerns are our concerns, the concerns of the European Union."
"We call upon Russia finally to take the necessary steps."
"We want to be Russia’s partner, and if we criticise one thing or another, we do so because we want to see democracy made a reality in Russia and because we want to live in peace, friendship and partnership with the Russian people."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Russia is becoming an ever more important partner of ours and that importance is increasing all the time."
"Russian culture is perhaps Russia’s greatest asset, and yet we know little about it."
"It is a major asset for Europe."
"My group is worried by the situation in Chechnya, and it does not seem to be improving."
"We are in favour of the political solution that Moscow also supports, but the results still seem poor."
"We fear a civil war and that the conflict will spread outside Chechnya, to a region where there are already any number of good reasons for a conflict."
"We want the Russians to know that this is harming the development of relations between us and that is a big issue."
"We demand the implementation of human rights."
"Should there not be a joint Chechnya conference?"
"We need aid organisations here quickly."
"We do not know very much about the case, at least not everything, but the method of arrest gives cause for alarm."
"What we think is important is that laws are obeyed and that openness, which is vital, is practised, but, of course, we know that there is a lot of shady business going on in the transfer of Soviet property into the hands of just a few and crimes have been committed."
"Membership of the World Trade Organisation is very important, as is acceptance of the Kyoto Protocol."
"Both these will help not just Russia’s development but the growth of its democracy."
"We also need cooperation on energy; that is the toughest sort of cooperation and the most important."
"In my opinion, we should combine our transport, telecommunications and energy networks with theirs."
"This would be the deed of the decade and would create a solid basis for cooperation between us."
"Mr President, when Peter the Great wanted to make Russia more Western, he dressed up the Russian aristocracy in Western European clothes and moved the capital of Russia westwards from Moscow to St Petersburg."
"President Putin's westward-looking government has described the European Union as its 'natural political partner', and until recently Russia has appeared to dress in the clothes of Europe: the clothes of free trade, the clothes of political and civil rights, the clothes of infant democracy."
"The ELDR Group welcomed this EU-Russia summit."
"We are right to look for political and economic spaces where our two societies can work together."
"Under the right circumstances, we welcome closer economic relations between the European Union and Russia."
"Easier travel is a necessary and important part of making this work."
"Russia and the Union share a common security environment and a high degree of mutual interdependence, so we are right to seek to make our joint borders more secure and our shared hemisphere more safe."
"We welcome Russia's ambitions to join the WTO and this may be possible, even if it is made more difficult by recent events."
"However, Europe is right to rail against Russian repression and governmental meddling in the lives of its neighbours."
"The issue of Chechnya will not go away, nor will Russia's refusal to ratify Kyoto."
"It is not enough to wear the clothes of Europe."
"Closer relations should carry the price of full subscription to modern European values, and at the very least we must continue to be critical and frank."
"At this summit, Mr President-in-Office, our position was badly compromised by those charged with representing us."
"The presidency's ill-considered comments on Chechnya and on the arrest and detention of Mikhail Khodorkovsky were out of line."
"Mr Berlusconi speaks for Europe and he should choose his words with care."
"His own presidency drafted a declaration last month that was strongly critical of Russian conduct in Chechnya."
"However, not only was there no reference to Chechnya in the summit communiqué, but the President of the Council even thought it appropriate to contradict Europe's affirmed position with an improvised display of bluster worthy of a cheap lawyer."
"In any case, why should we deny the difficulties of the Russian minorities in the Baltic states?"
"They are nothing compared to the persecution of the Chechens."
"Internal security may be complementary to justice and human rights, as the President-in-Office said, but as practised in Chechnya it is not."
"We have condemned Russian action in Chechnya and the attempt to intimidate sources of political opposition in Russia for good reason."
"Despite their European clothes, it is not clear that Mr Putin's government shares our values of democracy, human rights, the rule of law and freedom of expression."
"If it does, why is Mr Khodorkovsky in jail?"
"Mr President, I am very pleased about today’s debate within our Parliament on the latest summit between the European Union and Russia."
"This is, in a sense, a response to the declarations issued by Mr Berlusconi on Chechnya at the end of the summit, declarations that justified the Russian policy of military intervention in the region."
"Such statements do not reflect the positions agreed by the Fifteen, and my group vigorously condemns these declarations."
"Europe has expressed its disagreement with this justification, but can that be considered enough?"
"I do not think so."
"I deplore the very relative importance accorded by the Council and the Commission to the issue of Chechnya, as well as the lukewarm nature of the condemnations of the Kremlin during the summit."
"Daily life in Chechnya is still an ordeal for the civilian population."
"Lack of security, disappearances and human rights violations for which the Russian military forces are responsible continue with complete impunity."
"Over and over again, Moscow uses the fight against terrorism as an argument for justifying everything."
"That is unacceptable, even if it is, of course, necessary strongly to condemn the attacks by groups of Chechen extremists."
"In the opinion of the independent NGO observers, the would-be democratic election held on 5 October was a sham."
"My group questions the legitimacy of such a consultation, aimed solely at convincing the international community that the situation in the region has been normalised and that the people have been able to exercise their sovereignty."
"In fact, there is no such sovereignty."
"It is a matter of urgency that the EU should finally condemn Russia, clearly and in no uncertain terms, for its handling of the war in Chechnya."
"It will not be possible for the reconstruction of this wounded country to begin until after the Russian forces have withdrawn and full peace has been brought to the region."
"Only genuine political negotiations may enable the way to be opened to a process of democratisation and reconstruction, in which Europe must play a major role by exercising much stronger pressure upon Russia."
"Why not in the framework of the partnership agreements?"
"Another possibility might consist in supporting the UN’s provisional administration plan in Chechnya."
"Such an attitude should not be interpreted as going against Russia or the development of the partnership between the European Union and Russia but, instead, as placing ourselves at the service of a peace and security awaited by both peoples."
"Mr President, I think that, when we talk of Russia, we are all obliged to turn something of a blind eye, or I at least have the impression that, since the fall of the Wall and the collapse of the Soviet regime, everyone feels obliged to turn a blind eye."
"At the time, we were very pleased about the democratic development under Mr Yeltsin, and we obviously did not see the unbelievable corruption developing in Russia."
"Today, we are very pleased about the advances under Mr Putin, and we do not see the deliberate farce of the media monopoly."
"I shall not for the moment talk about the arbitrary arrests and of Chechnya, to both of which I shall return at the end of my speech."
"Why are matters like this?"
"Because the fact is that Russia is a huge power at our borders, and no one knows exactly how to take the bull by the horns, all the more so because everyone wants to have Russia on its side."
"Mr Poettering, I know it is difficult to criticise one’s friends when they make mistakes."
"You knew, moreover, how it pained me to see my Foreign Minister constantly beside Mr Putin defending a just position concerning Iraq."
"In other words, the Chechens were sacrificed for Iraq."
"On the other hand, it is obvious that the Americans were doing exactly the same thing."
"If the Americans said ‘yes’ to Iraq, it is because the Chechens no longer interested them either."
"It is therefore the same situation on both sides."
"I believe there is a fundamental problem here."
"If we believe – on the pretext that we need, as indeed we do, a strategic link with the Russians – that we have to indulge them, then we are mistaken."
"We are mistaken, moreover, because the results will never be commensurate with what we expect."
"We say ‘yes’ to the democratic process in Russia, but when extremely significant problems arise and the President in charge of Europe is happy to say to Mr Putin, ‘But what you are doing in Chechnya is fine; your arresting people is not a problem; as for the media monopoly, that too is fine’, then the evil has been done, notwithstanding the host of resolutions you may subsequently produce."
"Moreover, the evil has been done for a long time to come, because no one in Russia will dream of saying, ‘Yes, that is true. There is the European Parliament."
"Yes, that is true, there is Mr Verheugen and the Commission’."
"These things do not count, because they know that, when problems arise, the need to manage them will carry the day."
"‘We need you, Mr Putin.’"
"To summarise, any fuss made by Parliament and the Commission does not bother them, which means that, when it comes down to it, the situation in Russia will not change."
"That is why I tell you that, if we do not clearly denounce the massacre of a whole people that is being organised in Chechnya, Mr Putin will never listen to us."
"When Mr Putin moralises, perhaps with good reason, about Iraq, he does not think about what we are saying, because it is of no consequence to him."
"He is using Iraq as a tool, as he needs to use everything as a tool, in order to establish his power in Russia: a totalitarian power."
"– Mr President, Paragraph 10 of the joint resolution is close to my heart."
"In it, Parliament has asked the Council and the Commission once again to take the fate of Arjan Erkel, the abducted staff member of , to heart."
"His father has visited me, and many other fellow MEPs, here in Strasbourg."
"Let us put ourselves in his heartrending situation."
"I have three children of my own."
"This is why I am totally behind Parliament’s urgent appeal to the Council and the Commission to emphatically urge the Russian authorities to provide a clarification of this long-lasting abduction, which has now lasted for more than 460 days, and to sort this matter out."
"Last night, an authoritative Dutch paper reported that in the Council meeting of the Foreign Ministers, some harsh words were being exchanged about the Italian Presidency protecting President Putin."
"I am very pleased to hear it."
"I also welcome the newspaper report to the effect that the Council has agreed to Commissioner Patten’s proposal to set down in writing an unambiguous policy for the EU’s relations with the Russian Federation."
"Needless to say, as rapporteur for the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, I am highly intrigued by the way in which the Council mandates the European Commission to make a recommendation to it concerning EU-Russia relations."
"Does the Commission have any idea when we can look forward to its ideas taking effect?"
"One thing with regard to the Chechen tragedy is evident: on no account can this be described as providing a basis for common values shared by the European Union and Russia."
"Similarly, the case is causing us great concern."
"When high representatives of the European Institutions attempt to cover up, or even justify, these two situations, they encourage the Kremlin to follow the wrong political course."
"This does not at all serve the interests of Russian society, or those of the European Union, for that matter."
"In short, Moscow should not be left in any doubt about what Brussels exactly stands for in the mutual relationship, including where the European Union has its priorities: a good neighbourly relationship which presupposes joint action with regard to problems such as cross-border crime, nuclear risks and illegal migration; the promotion of human rights and the constitutional state, as well as urgent improvement of the nigh hopeless situation in Chechnya; joint action with regard to so-called ‘frozen conflicts’ in the southern Caucasus and a solution to the issue of Transnistria; deepening and broadening complementary trade and economic interests."
"True European commitment should be met by Russian reciprocity."
"Putin and his cronies will therefore need to abandon the traditional attitude of wanting to operate both within and outside of the partnership."
"You cannot be in it and out of it at the same time."
"This should, above all, be the clear message from Brussels to Moscow at this time."
"– Mr President, the approach that Mr Berlusconi has taken to this issue of human rights and the need for Russian politics to adapt to the canons of our concept of democracy has been dictated, I believe, not just by deeply-felt ideals, which we all share, but also by a healthy realism and a strategic view of European interests, if we adopt General De Gaulle’s prophetic vision of a Europe stretching from the Atlantic to the Urals."
"Indeed, from a strategic viewpoint, how could we not recognise that it is in the vital interests of the Russian Federation, a country that we all regard as an essential partner for the European Union, to stabilise a region that is crucial as regards access to the oil from the Caucasus?"
"It is certainly no coincidence that the Chechen guerrillas’ primary target is not Russian military posts but the infrastructure of the oil industry."
"It is fair to ask, therefore, what interests, apart from ethno-religious motives, lie behind Chechen terrorism and what drives them on."
"Should we not think about the danger posed by the constantly smouldering fuse of the most aggressive and extremist armed factions of international Islamic fundamentalism?"
"Is it or is it not true that, in November 1998 in Islamabad, the eighteenth assembly of the Islamic Group of Pakistan indicated Chechnya as one of the main axes for the worldwide , together with other areas like Kosovo?"
"As for human rights, I would remind you that one need only download the images disseminated throughout the world by Osama bin Laden’s networks from the Internet to see the severed heads of Russian soldiers."
"This, too, is a matter of human rights, if I am not mistaken."
"– Mr President, how can one not share in the commitment to defend human rights or to uphold the right of peoples to self-determination?"
"How can one not defend the right of the Chechen people to express their own opinion?"
"That is why I stand behind the words of the President-in-Office of the Council and support the position of the European People’s Party."
"Nevertheless, although I endorse the general thrust of the compromise resolution on which this House is to vote tomorrow, I cannot agree on one point, where it gives a specious and inaccurate interpretation of the position expressed by the President-in-Office of the Council of the European Union – something that a few Members have also done in this House."
"The truth is not what is maintained in this report; the truth is not what Mr Watson has said or what Mr Cohn-Bendit has said; the truth is what the GUE/NGL Members have said."
"I refer back to the well-known press conference that has been mentioned, because it is only fair that we should also remember what the President of the Russian Federation, Mr Putin, said, to the effect that during the talks, the awkward questions and the doubts about our policy came from Mr Berlusconi himself."
"This was written by an agency that is certainly not in line with the government’s positions."
"The press agencies still maintain that it was the Italian Prime Minister who raised the Chechen question."
"I therefore believe that what happened at the summit should be interpreted very carefully and accurately, especially the spirit and willingness that characterised the efforts of the current Presidency of the European Union."
"Any other interpretation will be open to use for political ends, especially within Italy."
"– Mr President, let me begin with three statements: the war in Chechnya is not Mr Putin’s private affair; the war in Chechnya is not a war against terrorism; and the war in Chechnya still spawns daily acts of violence on a massive scale against the human rights of the civil population."
"We can only talk to President Putin about advancing the partnership between the European Union and Russia on the basis of these three premises."
"For this reason, we strongly support the criticism contained in the resolution on which Parliament will vote tomorrow directed at the current President-in-Office of the European Union, for the inadmissible statements made by Mr Berlusconi supporting Mr Putin’s policy in Chechnya."
"These statements – and I am addressing the under-secretary, Mr Antonione – were utterly unacceptable and totally devoid of any connection with the policy expressed by the European Union up to now."
"As Mr Poettering has reminded us, the European Union regards Chechnya as an open wound."
"Mr Berlusconi’s affinities and personal friendships cannot and must not jeopardise the rigor with which Europe must demand that President Putin put an immediate end to the abuses and violence in Chechnya and seek a political solution to that conflict."
"Mr President, 3000 deaths since the beginning of the year, 300 people missing, 50 mass graves discovered and elections known to be a farce: this is the balance of the war in Chechnya, and a story of long-standing impunity: the Italian Presidency really ought to call President Putin to account over this."
"We would have expected some words of regret from Mr Antonione about what has happened and some plain speaking about what will happen in future."
"We note, Mr President, that these words have not yet come."
"Mr President, despite the progress that has been made, our relationship with Russia still seems to be burdened with mistrust, as we have heard in this Chamber."
"If we are seeking integration and a peaceful Europe, we will not be able to do it without, let alone against, Russia."
"Russia is and will remain an important political, economic and military factor in the world."
"We need cooperation, not confrontation."
"Russia could be an even more effective strategic partner and good neighbour if the EU states would look beyond supplies of oil and natural gas and if the EU would do more to help strengthen economic and social stability, which are essential if democracy is to take shape and develop in a country."
"The problem of Chechnya is a serious one, but there is only a political solution and we ought to show more commitment in achieving one."
"If the USA has a strategic interest in maintaining tension on Russia’s southern borders, that is its own affair."
"It cannot be in the interests of the European Union."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that none of us questions the strategic importance of the European Union-Russia relationship."
"What we are criticising – and our criticisms are directed at both the Council and the Commission, which have both been pressing ahead with the same policy – is an uncritical policy towards Russia, a thoroughly blind policy that does not see the decline in the freedom of the press, which does not see the decline in the independence of the judiciary – the case of Mr Khordokovsky is a clear example – a policy that pretends that a little country called Chechnya just does not exist."
"Has there not been a massacre in Chechnya? Two hundred and fifty thousand people – how often do we have to say this? – out of one million people equals extermination and something very close to genocide."
"This is not tolerable; it is not tolerable that the Commission has not had the courage to send its Commissioner for humanitarian aid to Chechnya and that Mr Prodi has not been there either."
"There is something I must say, and I hope Mr Antonione will pass it on to Mr Berlusconi: it is unacceptable that Mr Berlusconi should call that a myth, and I think many in this Parliament and in the European Union expect Mr Berlusconi to correct what he has said when he comes to this House during the next part-session in December."
"As for the future, we can do what we did for Yugoslavia: pretend that the Caucasus issue does not exist."
"The Chechnya problem is a colonial problem and must be resolved as such."
"What is happening in Chechnya is infinitely worse than what was done in Algeria and in so many other countries in Africa."
"The way forward, then, is for Chechnya to join the European Union, and for Georgia, which is another strategic part of the European Union, to join too."
"This should be the programme carried forward by the Commission and the Council."
"– Mr President, Parliament has, in the past, adopted a two-track policy with regard to Russia, and it has done so with total conviction."
"This translates, on the one hand, into cooperation, where possible, across the board, particularly in all the areas where it can help bring about the cultural change in Russia in order to move towards a constitutional state and more democratic relations."
"This also, however, entails criticism, where necessary."
"This is why we must state our opinions in no uncertain terms."
"This policy, therefore, embraces not just one, but both elements."
"Listening to the President-in-Office of the Council, I have to say that we in this House have already achieved many of the things he lists, and now they are again included in the resolution."
"Why is it that you now sound so very different from what we remember from the summit?"
"What strikes me in particular, is that you have specifically mentioned Moldova, and the timeframe for the withdrawal of the troops."
"You have also spoken about Arjan Erkel."
"I am very indebted to you for raising this issue and bringing it here today."
"That is extremely important."
"From the press and your statement, however, it seems that Chechnya has not been given much attention."
"You have given a justification for this."
"Yet, this is very dangerous, for the public at large is interested in your summit meetings and wants to know what is on the agenda, whether the ideals and values of our European citizens have been mentioned and have determined your conduct."
"This is why I would have preferred what you have stated here to also have been included in your statement."
"We would probably also have responded in a slightly different way."
"I have to say that I find the Commissioner’s approach very clear."
"For a very long time, the Russians have insisted on a very specific and practical approach, preferring cash on the nail to grand ideas."
"I think that the Russians are right in this, and that we, while continuing to adopt our two-track policy, can tackle very specific issues, particularly in the area of contacts among scientists."
"Cooperation with Russia in that field has not always been easy."
"In my opinion, however, this scientific cooperation is extremely important in the light of Russia’s cultural change."
"I hope, therefore, that the Council will continue along these lines and that the impression that has been created by a few personal remarks will soon change, for otherwise your presidency will be placed in a bad light."
"Mr President, it is more than three years since President Putin came to office and it is time to take stock."
"What has happened since then?"
"The FSB secret service, the successor to the KGB and which Mr Putin once ran, is now three times larger than when President Putin came to office."
"Politics has been increasingly neutralised."
"The same is true of the media."
"There are hardly any really independent large media left."
"Now it seems to be the turn of business, to judge by the goings on surrounding the so-called oligarchies."
"Those are serious danger signals in Russia itself."
"Looking at Chechnya, we find that in 1999 Mr Putin unleashed the second Chechen war of the post-Soviet era, part of the most bloody election campaign in recent history, or in history at all."
"This war has seen hundreds of thousands driven from their homes in Chechnya and tens of thousands murdered."
"Many speak of almost one fifth of the Chechen population."
"That would be as many as under Josef Stalin."
"These are not trivialities, they are very serious events and Europe needs to be concerned with them, especially when an important partner is involved."
"We all know that Russia cannot develop a Swiss democracy over night."
"But Russia has set strict criteria for itself."
"It has joined the Council of Europe."
"It has entered into a special partnership with the European Union."
"That means it has itself agreed to be judged by democratic standards and the rule of law and it must try to live up to those standards, but I fear it has increasingly failed to do so over the last few years."
"Of course things are better today than in the days of totalitarianism, but we are currently witnessing a trend not to more but to less democracy and rule of law, as Yelena Bonner, the widow of our prize-winner Andrei Sacharov, has made clear."
"So far as Chechnya is concerned, President-in-Office, I have only one thing to say: you are confining the Chechnya problem too much to the subject of terrorism."
"The Italian word for what is essentially going on in Chechnya is not but ."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank you for the contribution you have made to the discussion of this item on the agenda."
"I think it is fair to underline the fact that all your speeches have touched on something which for us had been a major priority, the need to have a strategic relationship with Russia."
"I believe this objective should be placed on record as a joint objective."
"On the path we are treading to achieve this objective, I have noted and I appreciate the spirit of collaboration and the sincerity you have shown in your speeches, which highlight differing and critical positions on how to reach our destination."
"I should like to point out the aspect which for me is the most important and most positive of all: it is, I repeat, having a strategic relationship with the Russian Federation, in view of its importance for the European Union."
"I shall, of course, make sure I pass on all your observations, contributions and even criticisms, which will form an important store of information not only for our own work but also in general for the Council as a whole."
"I have received six motions for resolutions(2) tabled in accordance with Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be on Thursday."
"The next item is the report (A5-0378/2003) by Pasqualina Napoletano, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on 'Wider Europe Neighbourhood: A New Framework for Relations with our Eastern and Southern Neighbours (COM(2003) 104 2003/2018(INI))."
".– Mr President, this report deals with three Commission communications: the first has the title ‘Wider Europe - Neighbourhood: a new framework for relations with our eastern and southern neighbours'; the second is the communication entitled 'Paving the way for a new neighbourhood instrument'; and the third is 'Reinvigorating EU actions on human rights and democratisation with Mediterranean partners - Strategic guidelines’."
"In Parliament’s view, this new policy must involve the 25 countries of the Union as it will be soon - in other words, those with which, on whatever basis, full integration with the Union has now been agreed, although at different times - and our eastern and southern neighbours."
"This is a coherent proposal applying to a complex geopolitical area stretching from Russia to Morocco, which, on the basis of its history, cultural relations and geographic proximity, may be defined as a pan-European and Mediterranean region."
"It is in this context that Parliament proposes soon to include the south-eastern dimension in this policy, that is, the countries of the Caucasus, and to look a little further in that direction at the other Middle Eastern countries, which cannot yet be included in this strategy."
"The report concentrates on the policies to be developed, as we believe that these policies should serve today, for the present time, first and foremost to build a common security area, provided we do not think of security only in military terms."
"Indeed, we are delighted that relations with neighbouring countries have been placed as the first item in the new security strategy submitted by the High Representative for European security, because our security is their security and this is an area that we can build together."
"Alongside this, there are a wealth of relationships to build, which should lead us to share with the countries in question mutually beneficial policies founded on a political and institutional dialogue that is backed up with appropriate instruments."
"The report thus establishes a clear distinction between this strategy and that of future enlargement, confirming without any ambiguity the decisions to close the negotiations with Romania and Bulgaria by 2007, to assess by 2004 the possibility of opening negotiations with Turkey, and the prospect of accession for all the Balkan countries."
"We do not hide the fact in this report that there are other countries, such as Ukraine and Moldova, which make no secret of their aspirations to become members of the European Union."
"Even though this is not the strategy that will decide their admission, we maintain that taking part in this strategy can only bring this prospect closer and will certainly not make it less likely."
"The report also looks closely at the specific features of such a vast, diverse, complex area."
"Russia was being discussed just now, and the document expresses our awareness that relations with Russia cannot be confined merely to a neighbourhood relationship."
"You will find one paragraph, however, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy had no hesitation in adopting, where the problems of democracy and the tragedy of Chechnya are highlighted as currently being obstacles to the normalisation of our relations."
"Lastly, the Action Plans provide the Commission with a flexible instrument for establishing multilateral, regional and bilateral relations with these countries, just as the cross-border instrument will serve not to build walls along the new frontiers but to achieve an understanding and an enhancement of the local dimension."
"The institutional question is also addressed in the report."
"These countries certainly cannot and should not share the Union’s institutions, but we insist that, in a dialogue between equals, there must be a place for governments, parliaments, local authorities and society itself, and the report includes recommendations to this effect."
"We also call for the human rights policy to be fully incorporated into this strategy."
"We believe, however, that there is as yet no fixed European policy on this subject, even though the Commission’s communication makes useful proposals and represents a step forwards."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council is working with the European Commission on developing a series of new initiatives addressed to the eastern and southern neighbours of the enlarged European Union within the framework of the ‘Wider Europe’ initiative."
"These initiatives, which will be taken forward alongside the existing instruments for relations with these countries, will be tailored to fit the specific circumstances of each country concerned."
"Since the beginning of the year, and even more so during our six-month term of office, the Presidency has been actively following the development of the European Union's new strategic approach to its neighbours to the east and on the southern shore of the Mediterranean."
"I will, of course, leave it to the Commission to illustrate the potential of this initiative in greater detail; my own intention here is just to make some brief points."
"On 11 March, the Commission adopted the communication to the Council and the European Parliament entitled ‘Wider Europe – Neighbourhood: a new framework for relations with our eastern and southern neighbours’, which describes the new series of neighbourhood policies that the enlarged European Union should adopt with the countries sharing its direct land and sea borders."
"This is the new concept of a ‘ring of friends’ by which the Union offers, essentially, to share ‘everything but the institutions’. The communication also describes the possible measures that could be made available to neighbouring countries as incentives to adopt and apply the necessary reforms that would enable them to benefit from access to the European Union's internal market."
"The new neighbourhood policy will be implemented through national and/or regional Action Plans adopted by the Council on the basis of a Commission proposal."
"These plans should contain specific objectives and benchmarks, in addition to an implementation timetable for the progressive application of the measures for participation in the internal market."
"This will enable the Union to assess the practical implementation of these measures periodically. To do this, it will apply an ongoing monitoring mechanism to verify whether the conditions are being fulfilled and to assess the progress made by each individual country towards achieving the objectives set by the new policy, as well as the effectiveness of the Community instruments."
"In the future, these Action Plans could become the main policy instruments for the Union’s external relations with these countries, and could eventually replace the common strategies adopted thus far."
"On the basis of the work carried out by the Commission and the Council, as the rapporteur has reminded us clearly, these last few months of 2003 will be devoted to the preparation of the Action Plans."
"In January and February 2004, a series of exploratory consultations will be held with the interested countries, on the basis of which by the end of spring 2004 the Commission will finalise the draft Action Plans for submission to the Council for Ukraine, Moldova, Morocco, Tunisia, Jordan, and Israel."
"The Action Plans that will be put to consultation with the third countries will include five elements: enhanced political cooperation, internal market, JHA cooperation, communication and environment networks and measures to facilitate people-to-people contacts."
"One final point I would like to mention is that the forthcoming Ministerial Conference of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership in Naples on 2 and 3 December will provide an important opportunity to take forward and develop the consultations with our southern neighbours."
". Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has already informed Parliament in detail about the strategy and individual elements of the neighbourhood concept."
"I do not want to repeat that today but rather to report to you on what has happened in the meantime."
"Our neighbours have welcomed this initiative, all of them in fact: our East European neighbours, Russia, Ukraine, Moldova and our Mediterranean neighbours."
"We are already in more or less intensive contact with all of them with a view to achieving this initiative’s objective."
"The aim is to exhaust the potential for cooperation as much as possible while stopping short of membership, specifically in the field of economic cooperation, which we interpret very widely."
"I must make clear to you that the Commission’s ideas for the long term extend far beyond the idea of a free trade area."
"We envisage being able to incorporate individual countries fully into our system of economic integration, including the four freedoms: movement of capital, movement of goods, movement of services and movement of persons."
"That will not happen with every country simultaneously."
"For some it will take longer than others, but I am confident that ultimately we really will have this large common economic area with more than a billion people and the European Union at the centre."
"It is not just about economics, it is about the environment, it is about cooperation in domestic and legal policy for joint defence against dangers and threats and it is of course in return also about developing political, economic and social reforms in the countries with which we operate this strategy. We are also expecting something from these countries."
"We are not in a position to be only giving all the time, but we would like in return political and economic reforms, democracy, the rule of law, respect for human rights and protection for minorities, so that the whole area around us can achieve the same level of political and economic stability, and one day also prosperity, as the European Union itself."
"I will say very precisely why."
"Because we would be greatly deceiving ourselves if we believed that things can go well for us in the European Union in the long term if they do not go well for our neighbours."
"It is therefore in our own interests to ensure that our neighbours can open up."
"As I said, responses have been positive."
"In Russia I spoke about it with the president, the foreign minister and many members of the government, the same in Ukraine, I have spoken with a number of foreign ministers from the Mediterranean countries and I will be visiting all of those countries before the middle of next year."
"The Commission will be presenting concrete action plans for a whole number of countries to the Council by the middle of next year; compared with previous strategies, these will have the advantage of being joint action plans, negotiated documents, which we intend to implement jointly."
"In that regard it has therefore begun quite well."
"The Commission is also already working on the development of a financial instrument with which we shall also be able to underpin this neighbourhood strategy financially after 2006."
"We shall after all have to be able to provide financial support for cross-border cooperation between our new Members and our new neighbours on the one hand and among the new neighbours on the other."
"I am very grateful to Mrs Napoletano for her report."
"We are on the same wavelength."
"I do still have concerns about one point, Mrs Napoletano, and I would ask you to think again whether it is really wise to say that Turkey and the western Balkan countries should be included in this initiative."
"With regard to Turkey, I would like to say that Turkey would consider it an extraordinarily negative signal."
"It would regard it as a downgrading if we were to say that a country which we are currently preparing for commencement of accession negotiations is now included in an initiative expressly intended for countries to which we have not extended any prospect of membership."
"I must make that quite clear. The countries included in this initiative are not considered prospective members, at least not for the foreseeable future, and in Turkey’s case that would provoke an extraordinarily negative reaction and, Mrs Napoletano, would even endanger the reform process in Turkey."
"I know you well enough to know that you certainly do not want our policy to halt the positive human rights developments in Turkey."
"So please think this point over again."
"As to how we should proceed, we agree that it is important that we should make clear to the public and to our neighbours what we can and what we cannot do."
"We can ensure that enlargement does not create any new borders in Europe."
"It would not help us at all to re-erect the iron curtain just a few hundred kilometres further east."
"Neither would it help us, when the Mediterranean countries of Malta and Cyprus have joined the Union, to cut ourselves off from the countries of the southern Mediterranean."
"We must offer as much cooperation as we can manage in the foreseeable future."
"But we must also make clear, especially to Russia and Ukraine, that no doors are being closed here, that no unalterable decisions are being taken, but rather that a process is being set in motion which at some point will reach its goal."
"Then it will be possible without more ado to set ourselves new objectives and reach out towards new horizons."
"At any rate, I think it is very good – and I think we can be proud of it – that we now have an idea, perhaps for the very first time, of the political shape we want to give to Europe and its neighbourhood in the years ahead, that for the first time we have a clear strategic vision of what Europe is to look like and how it is to interact with its neighbours."
"That at any rate is a great step forward."
"I am extremely grateful to Parliament for being willing to go the way the Commission has proposed."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this communication is the Commission’s response to the European Parliament’s request to present its thoughts and ideas about new neighbours and privileged partnerships."
"Many points are made, but essentially this is simply about applying the original idea behind the European Communities in a new context, namely identifying common interests to enable the Union and its neighbours to enjoy stability, respect human rights and to face future challenges together."
"Commissioner Verheugen, you have just mentioned strategic visions and that is my first point."
"We will also have to discuss again whether all of the visions in this paper are actually feasible and that is why we must not neglect to consider what is realistic and what will really happen in practice."
"I should like to make it clear that there are a whole series of questions that the Committee on Budgets obviously wishes to clarify."
"Before we initiate programmes, I think that we should consider how well the existing programmes, such as TACIS and MEDA, have worked."
"I might for example remind you that we still have considerable outstanding commitments amounting to billions in Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean."
"This also prompts my question about how practicable the ideas are that have been put forward so far."
"The communication explicitly mentions increased financial assistance, but we first need to know how it is envisaged to implement these programmes in practice, and I mean in each individual country, not in general."
"I wish to make it clear that we support the proposal as part of this initiative to set up a New Neighbourhood Instrument to promote cross-border measures, which are proving problematic because of the different financing instruments that are currently used."
"In addition, we have said that we think it would be appropriate if at least the CARDS part of funding under such a Neighbourhood Instrument could be financed for example under Heading 7."
"On the basis of past experience, I think it is also important to explain in detail how the Action Plans recommended for each country differ from the Country Strategy Papers that we have today and in what respect they constitute greater added value."
"I should like to make one final comment on the European constitution because we discussed it this morning: clearly, at all times in the procedure we must also ensure that Parliament’s right to shape and decide on legislative and budgetary matters is respected when drafting these definitive strategies."
"– Mr President, may I first thank the rapporteur very warmly for being so willing to discuss, cooperate and compromise throughout the drafting of the report."
"This also made it possible for the report to be adopted unanimously in the committee with just a few abstentions."
"The enlarged EU needs to consider the practical implications of the new problems that will arise in connection with its eastern neighbours because of the new and longer external border."
"We must also devote the same attention to the southern shore of the Mediterranean."
"But devoting the same attention does not mean applying the same models of policies and instruments to both the East and the South, because the challenges are very different."
"The States of North Africa are in general characterised by a lack of democracy, economic and structural problems, high levels of corruption, significant social tensions, high population growth and the danger of increasing Islamic fundamentalism."
"As a direct consequence of this situation, together with the pitiful living conditions endured by the majority of the people there, we are forced to confront increasing illegal immigration and the danger of terrorist attacks."
"A further consequence is that the potential for cooperation cannot be fully exploited."
"We have of course already seen this with the resources that we enter in the budget for the Barcelona Process and the MEDA Programme, which remain unutilised."
"It is important to extend the political dialogue with this region, amongst other things by including a parliamentary dimension, something with which we in Europe are of course already familiar in the Council of Europe and the OSCE."
"My group therefore supports the proposal in this report to set up a parliamentary assembly of Mediterranean countries."
"I am convinced that this has the potential to engender a new quality of political debate, which will deal with problems and situations of conflict openly and in a different way from the usual government negotiations."
"To the east of the new external border, it is true that at first sight the problems appear to be similar: corruption, social tension and illegal trafficking in human beings."
"The essential difference is, however, that these societies are avowedly in a continuing process of transformation; they see themselves as being in a transitional phase."
"The path of most of these eastern neighbours will, if they so wish, lead to the EU, regardless of whether we have already officially acknowledged as much by conferring candidate status on them."
"Contrary to North Africa, this does however give us an opportunity to exert greater influence to develop the rule of law and democracy, foster economic cooperation, extend the infrastructure by building trans-European networks and foster cross-border cooperation, which facilitates the everyday lives of people living on both sides of the border."
"I was rather surprised that the President-in-Office mentioned unprompted the four market freedoms yet again."
"I would expect this from the Commission, because it is of course in the Commission communication itself, but I had thought that the discussion in the Council would have moved on by now."
"Sharing everything but the institutions essentially means that we are practically offering membership of the internal market without membership contributions."
"In any case, I really cannot imagine – even as part of a very ambitious vision – our allowing freedom of movement for workers from North Africa."
"At least not in my lifetime."
"I would therefore ask the Council and the Commission not to awaken false hopes."
"Let us not run before we can walk!"
"I therefore call on the Commission to implement its programme step by step and perhaps concern itself less with visions than with what it is actually possible to achieve in a manageable and realistic timeframe."
"Mr President, I would first of all like to congratulate Mrs Napoletano on her wonderful work."
"Europe has changed."
"The map of Europe is growing and this means that we have new neighbours and we are faced with the need to create a policy for this enlarged Europe, the composition of which coincides with the Council of Europe, and also a policy of neighbourhood, and I will refer specifically to the policy which must be created in relation to the countries of the southern side of the Mediterranean."
"This report does not talk about the free movement of people in the Mediterranean, but it is clear that we must establish cooperative relations with the countries of the south of the Mediterranean, which differ from us naturally in terms of demography and the level of income per capita, based on systems of cross-border cooperation, which can be summed up in four ideas: knowledge of our neighbours, understanding them, trusting them and then, when we trust each other, we will be able to establish cooperation and work together."
"Mr President, I think that the Commission communication touches on a very interesting issue and that Mrs Napoletano's report also has very good ideas and proposals."
"Nonetheless, there is a general question which I think has also been touched on by other Members."
"Can we reduce all the countries which surround us to the east and south to a common denominator?"
"Can we take the same approach to Russia, which is a major world power, as we take to countries such as Moldova, Armenia, Georgia or Azerbaijan, or as we take to the countries of northern Africa where, possibly, the main question we should raise is that of democratisation?"
"It is a serious question, just as the question of where Europe stops is a serious question."
"Because I think Mr Verheugen was right to point out that, if we put the Western Balkans and Turkey in this category, these countries will obviously feel undervalued."
"But I see that, in the proposal made by the Commissioner for external relations on the Ukraine, we are discussing the possibility of its future integration."
"Why not Armenia? Why not Georgia?"
"And why not even Russia, which is also in the area of the European Union and some governments have proposed as much?"
"That is why I fear this uniformity."
"I think that we should find some common rules but, more importantly, that we should formulate global policies for the large entities around us."
"I repeat that the countries of north Africa need to make a special effort on issues of democracy."
"We have tolerated the violation of democracy and we have often supported it – remember events in Algeria and Egypt – due to our own strategic objectives and due to the wish for there to be stable regimes, whatever they may be."
"As regards Egypt in particular, I want to say that there are a great many European citizens shut up in its gaols today and who are paying this price with their lives."
"So I believe that we need to launch the issue of democracy for these countries."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the wider Europe strategy was a good idea."
"This initiative is sensible and necessary, but it has been ill-conceived."
"Commissioner, you know my views on this. The wider Europe strategy is a mixture of the Barcelona Process and our plans for our eastern neighbours."
"The result is a collection of instruments that in any case already exist, but there is no strategy – I would reiterate this – there is no big new idea, and that is what we need to structure our cooperation with our various neighbours, each of which has its own particular situation."
"The neighbours that want to join the European Union themselves have been treated in just the same way as the countries of North Africa."
"No consideration has been given to the real problems that 2004 will bring: the problems at the border, the fact that people are really worried about a new wall being erected, and the fact that there is already good cross-border cooperation there that is not being taken into account."
"These regions are facing very many problems that stem from the last two world wars."
"Individual groups are making huge efforts to restore understanding and then an initiative comes along that leaves them dumbfounded."
"None of what is really needed in this region is included in this initiative."
"I welcome the fact, Commissioner, that you have acknowledged this failure, and the differentiation approach in the Commission document gives grounds for hope."
"The New Neighbourhood Instrument also contains very good ideas."
"I think it would be very useful if it could be in place before 2004 so that we can achieve what we need to achieve, which is to give hope to the people on the external border that they are not being forgotten."
"In my opinion, general action plans are not enough here."
"Above all, the Neighbourhood Instrument must be earmarked for cross-border cooperation, because that means something to the people on the ground."
"In addition, a condition for inclusion in the neighbourhood concept as a whole must be to recognise and apply the democratic rule of law and to recognise human and minority rights."
"All of the measures must take this into account."
"I would refer here once more to Parliament’s criticism of Russia."
"The Chechnya problem is not a secondary issue."
"It is the central problem in our relations with Russia."
"– I can only applaud the fact that in the framework of next year’s enlargement, a policy of good neighbourliness is being developed."
"If both our new eastern and southern neighbours can make progress in the field of economic development, security and human rights, this will ultimately be to our benefit."
"Unfortunately, the proposed policy is somewhat vague in a number of essential, concrete points."
"First of all, there is the issue of the common external borders and potential immigration problems."
"The rapporteur hopes that the new Schengen borders will not constitute any barriers to trade, cultural exchange or regional cooperation."
"This is a legitimate concern, but we must, above all, ensure that the concept as a whole does not spark off another immigration wave."
"Given high unemployment and high social costs, that is probably the last thing we need."
"If we see that, last week, the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, declared in the Burkina Faso Parliament that a wider Europe entails that we, ‘from Moscow to Rabat’ – I am quoting him – will be sharing everything, apart from our institutions, then there is cause for concern."
"The second problem is the position of Turkey, for during the discussion of the report in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, it transpired that the Commission does not envisage Turkey featuring in the policy of good neighbourliness, because it is an EU candidate."
"That is, however, in conflict with the report, which clearly specifies that subsequent EU membership of the participating countries is not in any way ruled out."
"It should, by now, be apparent to everyone that Turkey’s chances of meeting the accession criteria next year are as good as non-existent."
"Turkey is not a European country, but it is a friendly country and a military ally."
"It is therefore of the utmost importance for our relations with Turkey to remain optimal and for that country to be included in the new policy of good neighbourliness from day one."
"– Mr President, this report by Mrs Napoletano is extremely important and we are pleased that certain amendments, including our own, that were adopted by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy have rounded it off and improved it further."
"The role of the countries which are about to join the European Union is now crucial in promoting an effective neighbourhood policy with the countries that will remain outside our new borders."
"Many of these countries also aspire to join the Union; not straight away, as Commissioner Verheugen has said, but the door is still open."
"This neighbourhood policy certainly depends on us and on Brussels, but it also depends greatly on them."
"As a rapporteur, I have paid close attention to Poland and I have seen how successive governments on the right and left have for years been using great initiative in addressing problems in their relations with neighbouring countries, particularly Ukraine, in the run-up to enlargement."
"Many Members of this House have already mentioned problems such as cross-border traffic – local traffic that drives a considerable, albeit hidden and underground, economy – and the efforts that Poland has always made to keep Ukraine on its side, on our side, on the side of the West."
"A short time ago, I was talking to some Polish colleagues who have been pursuing this policy in the Warsaw parliament."
"In my view, Poland is an example of what the new countries should and will have to do so that those countries that remain outside Europe’s new borders will not feel excluded, as Mrs Napoletano has said."
"I should also like to mention Moldova, perhaps the poorest country in Europe. As the report points out, we are pursuing a rather inconsistent policy towards it."
"We should help this country more, both economically and above all politically, to protect it from a growing and worrying Russian influence that is filtering in through the Transdniestrian enclave."
"This is an appeal that we have heard from many friends that our group has in that country, and one that we very much hope will be answered."
"– Mr President, I should first like to say that Mrs Napoletano’s report is quite excellent, not only because she is a member of my group, but also because she has put a great deal of work into the report."
"I am also delighted that Commissioner Verheugen has taken over the wider Europe dossier, because I am convinced that he will oversee it just as successfully as he did enlargement itself."
"The Commissioner touched on a key issue, namely how we should treat the candidate countries in this strategy, the countries that have a prospect of membership."
"I understand his fears."
"Nevertheless, I am convinced that the wording that we have chosen is right, and we can certainly continue to work on this."
"This House is divided into three distinct camps on this issue."
"There are those who say that this is our golden opportunity to bid a permanent, or at least prolonged, farewell to Turkey and perhaps also the Balkan countries as candidates and to push them into a different category."
"And there is the Commissioner’s proposal to leave them out of this initiative."
"Mrs Napoletano’s report, that we adopted by a majority in the committee – we will of course see what the result of the vote is here in the House tomorrow – rules out neither one nor the other."
"I understand what the Commissioner said, but we do not know what will be decided in 2004."
"If, for example, we do not open negotiations with Turkey, then it would be in a different, perhaps even worse position than other countries, with whom we would be reinforcing the wider Europe concept of building good relations with our neighbours."
"In the Balkans, which, like Turkey, I know very well, we have countries with whom we are not going to be able to talk about membership for years to come."
"If, obviously on the basis of the Commission’s work, we can together give Croatia a clear signal that we can negotiate – and I hope we can – then we are actually saying to all of the Balkan countries: there is nothing stopping you joining the European Union if you meet the same conditions as Croatia."
"In the meantime, I think it would be very sensible – and this also supports Mrs Napoletano – for us to involve them in this initiative."
"It may be possible to create a special status precisely for those countries that have definite membership prospects, so as to make it clear to them that the one does not exclude the other."
"I fully support Mrs Napoletano’s report, as it stands."
"– Mr President, after the votes in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, Mrs Napoletano’s report can surely be adopted by us all."
"On the other hand, the report has become too broad in scope and too detailed."
"The basic problem with it is the way it confuses concepts, which is due to the fact that the Commission has combined the Wider Europe policy and relations with our neighbours in the same initiative."
"In practice the Wider Europe policy covers relations with our eastern neighbours which are in Europe."
"Our southern neighbours on the other hand are the non-European countries of the Mediterranean region and the Middle East."
"The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party has endeavoured to clarify concepts with its Amendments 15 and 16."
"The Union would have a Wider Europe policy which would be supplemented by our policies known as the Northern and Southern Dimension."
"The new Neighbourhood Policy and the new Neighbourhood Instrument would be implemented in respect of all our neighbours, in the east, south and north."
"I hope these amendments will be adopted."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office, there are two points that we need to take into account here."
"Firstly, we need to have good relations with our neighbours because it is in the interest of our foreign policy to do so."
"Secondly, how can this be arranged so that it is commensurate with the interests and capacities of the European Union?"
"These two aspects need to be considered together."
"We must realise, after all, that to a large extent everyone has their own here."
"How can we develop an automatic procedure to bring these countries – or a number of these countries – almost directly into the European Union?"
"If we continue, covertly, to operate the system, then we will be well on the way to destroying the European Union, because the European Union cannot cope with this."
"We are currently undergoing the arduous process of producing a constitution, which may just be capable of setting out a reasonable way to organise the internal affairs of a Union of 25 or 27 countries."
"Mr Verheugen, what will we do with Turkey if it does not meet the conditions for opening negotiations in 2004?"
"Surely in that case we will have to make a second offer, alongside full membership, at least for a certain period of time."
"That is why I think it is absolutely essential for the wider Europe concept to be improved in respect of our neighbouring countries in Europe, making it a ‘European Economic Area plus’. This would create a second multilateral ring of countries with whom we maintain close relations, but where full membership is not the only option."
"This consequence of a multilateral order has not so far been elucidated sufficiently clearly by the Commission."
"We must ensure that this also includes those countries whose future may lie in the Union, but which will not be able to become members of the European Union in the next ten years, for whatever reason, and we must ensure that they are not left out."
"This applies to some of the countries of the western Balkans, just as it does to Moldova, Ukraine or, for example, Turkey, if a decision of the kind that I have just described were to be made next year."
"Obviously this also means that we need another strategy, but one that is equally weighty – I do not wish the Members from southern Europe to misunderstand us – for the Barcelona Process and the Mediterranean countries."
"The objective in this case is not to provide a possible opening to membership, but to forge a close neighbourly relationship of a different nature."
"In any case, the discussions so far both in this House and in the Commission have lacked the necessary systematic approach that will make this a viable policy in practice."
"– Mr President, firstly I wish to congratulate Mrs Napoletano on her excellent work."
"I am pleased that in her report she has treated the east and the south equally."
"It is and must be in the interests of the EU to have balanced neighbourhood relations along all its external borders."
"A major challenge for us is that we do not build a fortress around us whilst strengthening shared values and the workings of the internal market."
"That is why the approach outlined in the communication on Wider Europe, with its emphasis on interdependence, is especially welcome."
"We must not limit growth in prosperity just to the area within the Union’s borders."
"Promoting democracy, good governance, human rights and sustainable development in its neighbouring countries works to everyone’s benefit."
"On a practical level, border region cooperation will open up new opportunities for investment and innovation on both sides and will reinforce direct cooperation between people."
"This will increase regional prosperity and stability."
"We should follow the example set by forms of cooperation that work, such as that which exists between Finland and Russia, and for neighbourhood policy to actually get some wind in its sails we have to set aside adequate resources."
"Mr President, when the wider Europe neighbourhood concept was first floated, I was largely sceptical of the bunching together of countries as disparate as Libya and Russia in one document."
"However, as the PPE-DE Group's shadow rapporteur for the Ukrainian section, I now believe that sufficient differentiation has been achieved in Mrs Napoletano's report to produce a politically coherent document which provides a constructive approach through action plans for the challenges which lie ahead over the next five years as we digest the economic and political consequences of a Europe of 25 countries and as the EU borders move eastward."
"I particularly welcome the recognition of Ukraine's potential for eventual membership and the mention of Article 49."
"This could equally apply to Moldova, which is desperate to be given a helping hand by the EU to sort out the Transnistria question be granted access to the stabilisation and association process."
"Russia will be key here and I welcome the recent summit which aims to develop our relations with the strategic partner country through a series of four common spaces."
"Although I strongly condemn human rights abuses in Chechnya, I believe we have a vested interest in a stable Russia under the firm leadership of President Putin and a common cause in fighting international terrorism."
"However, with due respect for the rule of law, it is a pity that criminal law is being used to rein in the power of the oligarchs, whereas a financial settlement to redress the questionable privatisation of the early 90s would have been far preferable."
"I also welcome extending the remit of the EIB to the Western NIS."
"Belarus remains a problem, but we must engage in limited but constructive engagements in areas of mutual concern."
"I was delighted by the fact that my budget amendment to increase funding to the victims of Chernobyl was passed by this House."
"Lastly, I agree with Mr Gahler that European public opinion would not support freedom of movement for the peoples of north Africa for the foreseeable future."
"Mr President, the initiative of the Commission and of the European Union in general on a broader Europe is a right step if we are to unify and communitise our policy."
"The excellent report by Mrs Napoletano shapes an interesting political strategy framework for the actual area encircling the European Union."
"This strategy allows both planning and objectives; at the same time, however, it maintains the flexibility needed for each area around us, based on its peculiarities."
"Our basic priorities are predicated on good relations, peace and economic and political cooperation."
"We entertain no thoughts whatsoever of new walls or new divisions."
"The Commission document proposes the economic element."
"The report by Mrs Napoletano proposes the political element, which means initiatives for peace in the Middle East, the Caucasus, the Balkans and elsewhere."
"However, as the European Parliament, we too can take initiatives by stepping up our efforts."
"Within this framework, I believe and I propose that, as it has done in order to cooperate with other regions, the European Parliament should appoint a joint parliamentary committee with the countries of the Black Sea Cooperation, which already has a parliamentary conference, intergovernmental cooperation, a development bank, a permanent secretariat and, most importantly of all, to which 13 countries belong."
"They include members and candidate members of the European Union, the countries of the Caucasus, the Balkans, Russia, Ukraine, Moldova and, generally speaking, countries with a particular political interest in the European Union."
"Mr President, we are now in the middle of the greatest ever enlargement of the European Union."
"In a year or so, Bulgaria and Romania will join, and membership negotiations are being entered into with Turkey and Croatia."
"This has given rise to increased interest in the EU in the world around us."
"We can expect new applications for membership and new requests for close cooperation in the future."
"I think we should be proud of this interest in participating in European cooperation."
"It also means that we can support, and make demands upon, surrounding countries so that they respect human freedoms and rights, comply with the principles of the state governed by law and observe basic economic principles of free trade."
"I personally do not understand the talk of European borders now needing to be defined."
"The EU must, in the future, be open to new members from our part of the world, irrespective of whether or not they follow old school maps’ demarcation of the European continent."
"With modern technology and telecommunications, the Bosphorus, Gibraltar and the Caucasus are becoming evermore imaginary frontiers, while, in other parts of the world, freedom, human rights and democracy – and, naturally, their opposite, oppression – are becoming evermore real for us all."
"Moldova is a small and poor country in the EU’s future border area."
"I believe that a proposed stabilisation pact comprising Belarus, Ukraine and Moldova would not be a successful solution."
"Moldova belongs historically and culturally to South-Eastern Europe."
"It is my hope that the Commission will try to establish a form of cooperation with Moldova that takes account of this and opens the way to future Moldovan membership of the EU once Romania and Bulgaria have joined."
"– Mr President, after the second world war, the people of Europe had the vision of integrating their countries, and more than 50 years on the EU is the result."
"Today our great Europe needs to have the vision of a neighbourhood policy, in the East and in the South, and I am grateful to Mrs Napoletano for her report, which provides many ideas."
"We have a whole arsenal of instruments with which to put flesh on the bones of this neighbourhood policy: economic, political and technological."
"We should also use the other institutions, the Council of Europe and the OSCE, which have a contribution to make to this neighbourhood policy."
"I believe that a strategy of neighbourhood agreements for individual countries or groups of countries might be helpful, like the Schuman declaration of 1951, only then it was for coal and steel."
"It is a model that we can still use today for sectoral agreements with our neighbours."
"A technological agreement with North Africa on solar hydrogen, for example, would be of huge importance for both us and them."
"We do not want a fortress Europe, but an open Europe, and this policy should help us to achieve this."
"Mr President, I agree with the Commission’s proposal and Mrs Napoletano’s report."
"As I understand it, it is a question of recognising that enlargement is not, cannot be and will not be the Union’s only instrument for structuring Europe and the Euro-Mediterranean region."
"That is the issue."
"Enlargement will have a limit."
"Twelve new countries are going to join; we also have Turkey and others will join in the future."
"Once that limit has been reached, we must not be able to say that we lack the political, economic, security, cultural or human instruments to structure Europe."
"In other words, we are giving shape to a more extensive architecture which complements the instrument of enlargement and which also requires the deepening which the Constitution we are currently dealing with represents."
"If we do not create these new policies of good neighbourly relations, we would be falling short and, at the end of the day, we are taking up proposals made by people with a profound knowledge of the European situation, whom I naturally support."
"Mr President, I would like to warmly welcome the proposal from the Commission and the report Mrs Napoletano has produced."
"There is breathtaking ambition involved here."
"It would be quite easy for the European Union to say it has enough on its hands dealing with enlargement and bedding down the enlargement process."
"However, it would be extremely short-sighted to do that, and the current idea of pushing forward with a policy in the context of developing near neighbours is extremely important."
"I was struck this morning by something the Irish President said when talking about near neighbours - people who live next to each other but do not know each other, at either a local or an international level."
"That ignorance of each other breeds fear and distrust and eventually will breed conflict."
"Therefore, this near neighbourhood policy is extremely important, not only for our security but also for the security of those countries who are our neighbours."
"Let us not go down the road of saying we cannot have freedom of movement from North Africa."
"We have freedom of movement from North Africa, we simply do not recognise it."
"– Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur on her report on the difficult neighbourhood issue."
"It is good that it emphasises the importance of the political, social and economic stability of our neighbouring regions for our security, and I might even say our future."
"For that reason, I warmly support the idea of a common free trade area."
"That way we can promote democratic development."
"Our maturity, however, is measured by our skill in averting and preventing conflicts."
"We must support the Commission’s idea of Neighbourhood Programmes."
"Let what we export be stability, so that we do not have to re-import instability."
"Let us remember, however, that there are not just gulfs between countries but gulfs too within states, and these are growing all the time."
"That is a real yardstick for measuring the success of our societies, including our very own."
". – Mr President, I should like to comment on just a few issues."
"Firstly, differentiation, which is of course a key component of the Commission proposal."
"Our approach is based entirely on differentiation, which means that each country is treated individually."
"It is not a multilateral project, but a bilateral one, tailor-made for everyone, and that is why Russia is not treated in the same way as Libya; that would simply be impossible and quite frankly it would be foolish even to attempt to do so."
"This also means that the scope and substance of the common ground will vary quite considerably, at least at the outset."
"At some point in the distant future it may be possible for all of the trains to call at the same station, but for a long time there will be differentiation."
"Obviously, the idea of our concluding a free movement of workers agreement with the countries of North Africa in the foreseeable future is just as inconceivable to me as it is to Mr Gahler."
"But no one has mentioned this possibility either."
"My final point is this: several speakers complained of a lack of conceptual clarity and consistency."
"I am rather surprised by this."
"I think that the concept is actually quite clear."
"We want to have a policy that is designed for all those countries that will be our next-door neighbours after enlargement, whether through shared land or sea borders."
"As Romano Prodi rightly said, these countries stretch from Russia to Morocco."
"Obviously it would be an easy matter to draft an overall strategy for all European countries and all neighbouring countries outside Europe, who are not Members of the European Union, by quite simply combining the strategies and policies that are already in place – in fact I could do this over the coming weekend if you wished."
"But it would do nothing to change the fact that we would have to apply different instruments in the western Balkans and Turkey, for example, from the ones that we need to apply in say Libya or Syria, because our objectives in respect of the western Balkans and Turkey are quite different."
"Mr Brok’s attempt is honourable, and I will not hold it against him either – I know exactly what he wanted."
"Mr Brok will certainly agree with me when I say that writing an alternative to accession for Turkey in a formal Council or Commission document at this stage would amount to announcing the end of the common strategic approach."
"You can certainly demand this, Mr Brok, but the Commission is unable to comply."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be tomorrow at noon."
"Certainly, words like ‘new impetus’ declare the ambition of having closer relations."
"There is talk of a ‘Common Space’, but with no common construction."
"We are, indeed, a long way from such a space, listening to Mr Prodi talk about political and progressive integration into the economic and social structures of the European Union."
"The question may be asked as to whether the word ‘neighbourhood’ has not replaced that of ‘partnership’."
"The EU’s objective is the integration, pure and simple, of these countries into the sizeable European market, but without any financial compensation in terms of the aid from which the candidate countries for accession benefited, even if the conditions were drastic and unjust."
"Another aspect is that the Commission’s entire communication is characterised by a very security-minded approach to relations."
"This is far from the hope of an EU open to the world."
"Freedom of movement for goods and capital, but not for people, is not only inhumane but also totally illusory and cynical."
"If the EU wishes to respond to the expectations that continue to be placed upon it by many peoples and to establish a notion of the world radically different from that of the United States, there is every reason for forging new links with our neighbours, particularly our Mediterranean ones."
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the Northern dimension."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the first Action Plan for the Northern Dimension in the external and cross-border policies of the European Union for 2000–2003, adopted by the Feira European Council on 19 and 20 June 2000, will expire by the end of this year. Therefore, in order to pursue the Northern Dimension policies beyond 2003, intensive preparatory work was launched a year ago."
"In particular, I recall that the guidelines for a new Action Plan were set out at the Ministerial Conference on the Northern Dimension and the Arctic Window in Greenland in August 2002, and the subsequent Foreign Ministers’ Conference in Luxembourg in October of that year."
"In line with these guidelines, the Commission established contacts with all the relevant actors, including regional organisations and associations and representatives of the private sector, with a view to preparing a working document on the new Action Plan."
"On 11 June this year, the Commission submitted to the Council the working document ‘The Second Northern Dimension Action Plan, 2004-2006’, which incorporated a number of suggestions presented by the relevant actors and took into account experience gained with the first action plan as well as the new demands for the coming years."
"This document was then examined by the Council on 29 September 2003 and later endorsed by the European Council at its meeting on 16 and 17 October 2003 in Brussels."
"On that occasion, it was underlined by the Heads of State or Government that the Northern Dimension will assume increasing importance in the context of the Union’s enlargement and will have an important contribution to make in carrying forward the Union's new neighbourhood policy throughout the region."
"The Action Plan for 2004–2006 lays down the guidelines for the next three years."
"In this respect, it guarantees the continuation of the Northern Dimension of the Union’s policies, defined in the document as a ‘horizontal concept that applies within the existing financial and institutional framework in the relevant region’."
"The Northern Dimension is particularly important for certain priority sectors in which potential added value is greatest, such as the economy, business, infrastructure, human resources, education, culture, scientific research, health, the environment, nuclear safety, natural resources, cross-border cooperation and regional development, as well as justice and home affairs."
"The common framework for the promotion of political dialogue and practical cooperation that the Northern Dimension provides will cover a broad, diverse geographical area around the Baltic Sea and the North Atlantic."
"Special consideration will be given to regions with specific needs, such as Kaliningrad and the Arctic region. In the context of the Northern Dimension, increased interaction at all levels between Russia and the EU will therefore be essential."
"The Commission will keep its overall leading role but all relevant actors, whether at national, regional or local levels, from the business community or from civil society generally, will be called upon to play an active part."
"Specific activities in the five broad priority sectors just mentioned - the economy and infrastructure; education, culture, research and health; the environment, nuclear safety and natural resources; cross-border cooperation and regional development; justice and home affairs – need to be carried forward in a cooperative spirit based on inclusive participation for all, subsidiarity and complementarity, with an effective division of labour and overall coordination and monitoring."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Northern Dimension of the European Union’s external relations and cross-border activities is an important policy area for the Commission and it will become even more so with the forthcoming enlargement."
"The Commission continues to work actively on the Northern Dimension."
"In parallel to implementing the measures in the First Northern Dimension Action Plan, the Commission has played a decisive role in drafting the Second Action Plan for the region."
"This Second Action Plan covers the period 2004-2006."
"As a follow-up to the preparatory work done by the Danish Presidency last year, the Commission carried out an open and integrated consultation process in the first half of 2003, involving the most important partners."
"This proved to be a very useful exercise."
"The Commission also took account of the European Parliament’s resolution of 16 January 2003."
"In June 2003, the Commission transmitted its proposals for the Second Action Plan to the Council."
"After discussing these, the Council adopted the final version of the document, which was approved by the European Council at its meeting in Brussels of 16 and 17 October 2003."
"The main objective of the Second Action Plan is, in the interests of both sides, to provide an instrument for regional cooperation with our neighbours, the Russian Federation."
"In addition, the intention is for the Northern Dimension to address the opportunities and challenges that might arise from the forthcoming enlargement."
"In other words, it is intended to contribute to promoting stability and prosperity in this region, both inside and outside the borders of the European Union."
"The Northern Dimension policy will also contribute directly to achieving the aims that we have just discussed in our debate on a wider Europe and the new neighbourhood."
"Finally, the new Action Plan will make a contribution to the sustainable development of the Arctic region and the indigenous peoples who live there."
"In addition, the Commission has been working hard on the continued implementation of the First Action Plan."
"It should of course be concluded by the end of this year."
"In this context, several of the results that have been achieved most recently are worthy of mention, for example: the implementation of the first projects in the Northern Dimension Environmental Partnership, the signature of the Multilateral Nuclear Environment Programme in the Russian Federation and the extension of cross-border cooperation as part of the drafting of the first neighbourhood programmes following the Commission communication of July 2003."
"Neither should we forget the large number of projects and specific initiatives implemented by the Commission that have already been completed or are still underway as part of Community programmes, which also contribute to making the Northern Dimension a reality."
"The 2003 Annual Progress Report on the implementation of the Northern Dimension Action Plan will provide a complete overview of all of the sectors in the First Action Plan."
"The Commission will be publishing this report in the coming weeks."
"Finally, we should also remember the significant contribution made by other players, for example the Member States, regional organisations and regional and local authorities."
"Only with the active support of all of the stakeholders in the region can the Northern Dimension be a complete success."
"This is an aspect that we have particularly highlighted in the Second Action Plan."
"The Commission will obviously continue to keep Parliament informed about the implementation of the initiative, and we hope that Parliament will play an active part in the monitoring and review initiatives that will take place in the near future."
"– Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Verheugen, one can, if need be, always relate good and bad news on the topic of the Northern Dimension."
"The good news is that the Council and the Commission say the Northern Dimension is alive and well."
"The bad news is that nothing much is happening within its framework, except that Parliament, the Council and the Commission are vying with one another to try and extend and at the same time dilute the concept, so that soon it will surely cover the whole of the northern hemisphere."
"In the region of the Baltic basin and northwestern Russia, however, there are things happening all the time in which the European Union should also be economically involved."
"The issue of maritime security, or non-security, is one of them."
"The Union is enlarging and in four months the border between Russia and the Union will have doubled in length."
"The agreement over Kaliningrad is in danger of becoming a major quarrel as no one seems to be telling Lithuania what is happening or if anything is happening at all."
"It was amusing to read in the minutes of the EU-Russia Summit about a fast-track feasibility study being made by the end of 2003."
"That is now six weeks away and the Lithuanians, at least according to what their former president said yesterday, know nothing about it."
"The northern gas pipeline is probably going to start being built within two or three years which is to go from the Arctic Ocean, past Finland and via the Baltic to Central Europe."
"Its route from the Arctic to the Baltic lacks infrastructure and it will also presumably pass through primal forest that needs protecting."
"The Russians will not manage alone in this."
"A big fuss is made from time to time in the Union about the risks associated with nuclear waste and nuclear power stations in northwestern Russia."
"Within the framework of the TACIS programme, however, there is a substantial amount of unused resources set aside for nuclear safety projects – some EUR 180 million."
"Why, then, are these not used for cleaning up nuclear waste in the sea at Litsa Guba and Murmansk, by which I mean decommissioned nuclear submarine reactors and nuclear waste on the shoreline, or ensuring that the power stations at Sosnovibor and Kandalaksha are safe to use?"
"The Northern Dimension Environmental Partnership, which is coordinated by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, is an excellent tool."
"It should also be used elsewhere than in just one project."
"The St Petersburg Southwestern Wastewater Treatment Plant is just the tip of the iceberg with regard to what is needed."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the fact that the Northern dimension still remains on virtually only a verbal level is by no means the fault of the Community."
"I point the finger at Finland’s present and former governments, for example, for which cooperation in the neighbouring regions does not seem to have been or be worth the bother of initiating any powerful lobbying to spur the European Union into action."
"– Mr President, I would, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists like to thank the Commission and the Council for the EU’s Northern Dimension having become an ongoing and consistent part of European Union policy."
"Its continuity is demonstrated by the fact that we are discussing the Second Action Plan."
"The Northern Dimension, however, as was said earlier on, has been criticised as being shapeless and accused of lacking in anything concrete."
"This forthcoming programme for the period 2002 – 2006 will hopefully eliminate these problems."
"The programme promises to put in place a coherent operational framework for all Northern Dimension policy by creating strategic objectives and priorities."
"The Northern Dimension will not acquire sufficient credibility until it helps to improve the life of people in the EU’s northern regions and those areas bordering on them."
"This means developing the economy by exploiting the potential offered by trade and the sustainable use of natural resources."
"In northern regions environmental questions are also vitally important."
"After enlargement the Baltic will become an internal sea of the EU, and its protection will require swift action not only in the European Union but also in Russia."
"It is good news that the Russian Prime Minister on his visit to Finland this week gave his support to European Union efforts to discontinue the use in the Baltic Sea of single-hulled oil tankers."
"Environmental cooperation must be continued in order to improve nuclear safety, and wildlife in the Arctic also calls for special attention."
"Plans and agreements made in the area of health and social protection must also be turned into projects of concrete cooperation."
"The New Neighbours initiative, which was being discussed here just a short while ago, will give strength to the EU’s Northern Dimension."
"Added value will be afforded in particular by the new financial instrument proposed in it which, for example, will reduce bureaucracy in border cooperation."
"The Northern Dimension nevertheless also needs sufficient new financial resources for it to be implemented."
"– Mr President, enlargement of the European Union will strengthen the Northern Dimension."
"When the Baltic countries and Poland, which have been major partners in EU external relations, join the Union they will give the Northern Dimension strength both in the EU’s internal development work and its external relations."
"The enlarging EU is reorganising external relations with its eastern and southern neighbours by creating the Wider Europe and new Neighbourhood Policy."
"The Northern Dimension’s future crucially depends on how well we can link it with this wider scenario."
"Within the framework of the Wider Europe Policy, the EU will still enlarge and develop its relations with its European neighbours."
"Added to that are the Northern Dimension and the Southern Dimension aspects of EU policy, which also extend outside Europe."
"It is natural that the New Neighbourhood Policy and the new neighbourhood cooperation finance scheme should also be implemented in northern regions."
"It is precisely in the north that the new finance scheme could be applied as a pilot project before it is adopted generally, as is proposed in Mrs Napoletano’s report."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, the EU’s Northern Dimension is not the Union’s internal market policy but a neighbouring regions and foreign policy."
"The question is above all about cooperation with those areas of Russia which are close to the EU’s borders."
"As far as our group is concerned, we wish to focus attention on the word ‘cooperation.’"
"There is a need to foster cooperation among people as well as just companies."
"Besides money we also have to export social welfare and democracy to the northern neighbouring regions."
"Our group supports projects to prevent the sexual exploitation of women and children and to combat the disease and social problems that poverty brings with it."
"Poverty causes sickness."
"We are not pleased with the way the Commission has handled the issue of the EU’s Northern Dimension."
"It has to be more than just a policy on Russia."
"The Commission has been unable to create any substance to the projects recorded in the programmes."
"The same unfortunately has to be said for the countries to hold the presidency this year."
"Neither Greece nor Italy mentioned the Northern dimension in their list of priorities."
"They have pulled homewards in the direction of the Mediterranean, even though the country to hold the presidency has an obligation to create projects throughout the Union as a whole."
"Prime Minister Berlusconi has been interested more in Russia’s warmongering dimension rather than peace, ordinary cooperation with people and their social well-being."
"There is a danger that the special features of the EU’s Northern Dimension will be trampled underfoot by the new Wider Europe – Neighbourhood Policy."
"Nature dictates different preconditions for life in the north from those further south and those regions need their own distinctive policy."
"The draft resolution jointly proposed by the political groups is comprehensive and only needs implementing, which is the Commission’s responsibility."
"– Mr President, with ‘big’ issues like Italy’s domestic policy dominating the EU debate, other points of the compass can get pushed into a corner."
"It is for such reasons that the Northern Dimension is still awaiting its big breakthrough."
"Its importance is revealed, however, when we look for example at the risks associated with nuclear power in our neighbouring country, Russia, or its recent internal policy."
"The stability of Wider Europe depends, furthermore, very much on whether we can achieve effective regional and cross-border cooperation."
"As has been said here, when the EU enlarges, the Baltic Sea will grow in importance and hopefully at the same time so will opportunities for more solid cooperation in order to enhance its ecological and political future."
"I would just like to remind everyone here of the perils associated with Russian oil consignments, which are very much on the increase."
"This action plan is a useful survey of the key regional challenges but it is completely lacking in any strategic view of the areas of focus that should be promoted, in particular concrete and measurable short- and mid-term objectives, or how cooperation with the various intergovernmental, NGO and other existing forums should be exploited to achieve them."
"Finally I would like to raise the separate matter of the status of the EU’s only aboriginal people, the Sami."
"They should have considerably more political influence than they do."
"The original means of livelihood and way of life of the Sami should be protected, which also means resolving local issues of land ownership and use in a manner that is satisfactory, as hard as that might be or painful to do."
"Will is the crucial element here too, however."
"Mr President, I hesitate to intrude on what is almost an all-Finnish debate, but I would like to welcome this second action plan and draw attention to two points."
"I was privileged to attend on behalf of Parliament all three ministerial meetings that helped prepare this action plan, and there are two points which seem to have been overlooked."
"The Northern Dimension has to do with EU-Russia relations, but it also has to do with something much wider than that across the whole of the high north and the Arctic."
"We held one of the ministerial meetings in Ilulissat, Greenland, and I thought the window on the Arctic had been highlighted, but it seems instead to have been slammed shut."
"The Arctic environment and its people concern us all."
"They are part of a global challenge which we have to answer and which we ignore at our absolute peril."
"We had the chance in the EU to show leadership in this by working with and through the Arctic Council and also, more importantly, by forging a partnership with the US in this area of the globe where we could work together."
"The second point that is missing is that of parliamentary and representative involvement at all levels."
"The first ministerial meeting foresaw the creation of a Northern Dimension forum."
"I was at a Nordic Council parliamentarians meeting yesterday in Warsaw, where the same point was made."
"We need parliamentary involvement at all levels to champion, advocate, scrutinise and move this policy forward so that it does not remain a phantom policy but becomes a reality."
". – Mr President, I should first like to turn to Mr Suominen. You are of course quite right that the Baltic basin is one of the most dynamic regions in Europe, if not the most dynamic of all, economically speaking."
"But it is also a fact that after 1 May 2004 all of the countries bordering the Baltic Sea will be Members of the European Union apart from Russia."
"There will only be one single Baltic Sea country that is not in the European Union and that will be the Russian Federation."
"All of the others will be in. All matters relating to Baltic policy will in the future be EU-Russia policy."
"There is no escaping this."
"I think that in this respect the initiatives that we have developed vis-à-vis the Russian Federation significantly strengthen the Northern Dimension."
"Then you mentioned Kaliningrad."
"I admit that I am more than surprised by what you said here!"
"The issue of access to and from Kaliningrad was not negotiated by the EU and Russia, but first by the EU and Lithuania and then with Russia."
"Each individual step was agreed with Lithuania."
"The study on the possibility of a fast train link is something that we arranged with Lithuania, and the Commission negotiated the conditions for such a study in great detail with the Lithuanian Government."
"I personally informed the Lithuanian President about the results of this work."
"The Lithuanian President cannot have told you that he was not aware of it!"
"That is quite impossible."
"I would ask you to check your information once more, because I am very keen to avoid the impression being given here that we are doing anything that affects Lithuania’s sovereignty in direct relation to Russia."
"We are not negotiating anything with Russia that affects the sovereignty of Lithuania, our future Member State."
"I can offer you full reassurance here."
"There is no one who is more attentive to this than I am and I found the comments that you made on this quite astounding, to put it mildly."
"As far as the Arctic region is concerned, which was addressed at the end, I should like to point out that the Second Action Plan, which I have reported on to you, makes specific provision for a major new initiative and activity on the Arctic Window; this will be one of the two major activities in this plan."
"This is decided; it is down in black and white."
"I do not quite understand therefore how you can say that the window has been slammed shut again, because the opposite is the case."
"The window is in fact wide open and I can promise you that the Commission will do its utmost to ensure that all of the opportunities offered by this initiative are fully exploited."
"I have received five motions for resolutions(1) tabled in accordance with Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be on Thursday."
"The next item is Question Time (B5-0414/2003)."
"The following questions are addressed to the Council."
"The Italian Presidency of the EU is putting forward a proposal for a Council decision, on the basis of Article 2.2 of the Schengen Agreement, under which a Member State organising a Summit Conference or event of similar importance will be able to re-establish temporarily its internal borders."
"At the same time, Member States are required to provide all information which may assist in tracking down individuals who are known to have created disorder or similar situations and to pass on the names of those individuals with their records of public order offences during demonstrations in the past."
"Can the Council confirm the existence of the above proposal?"
"If so, does this not completely abolish the civil liberties which are enshrined in the Union's Charter of Fundamental Rights?"
". Article 2(2) of the Schengen Convention states that where public policy or national security so require, a Contracting Party may, after consulting other Contracting Parties, decide that for a limited period national border checks appropriate to the situation will be carried out at internal borders."
"If public policy or national security require immediate action, the Contracting Party concerned shall take the necessary measures and shall inform the other Contracting Parties thereof at the earliest opportunity"
"For the application of these provisions, the Schengen Executive Committee of 20 December 1995 adopted the decision on the procedure for applying Article 2(2) of the Schengen Convention."
"In line with the aforementioned texts, that is to say OJ L 239, 22.9.2000, p.133, the Joint Action of 26 May 1997 with regard to cooperation on law and order and security (OJ L 147, 5.6.1997, p.1) and the Council Conclusions of 13 July 1997 on security at European Council meetings and other comparable events (document 10916/01 JAAI 82), the Italian Presidency promoted a draft Council resolution on security at European Council meetings and other comparable events."
"The draft resolution does not abolish the civil liberties laid down in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union of 7 December 2000 (OJ C 364, 18.12.2000, p.1); in particular, it contains specific provisions regarding protection of personal data for exchange."
"I thank the Minister for his reply, which troubles me of course."
"I would like to ask him the following supplementary question: what is the fate of this draft resolution; in other words, has it been accepted in principle by the other 14 and which are the basic provisions contained in this proposal for a resolution?"
". I am not in a position to reply in detail regarding these further points."
"I will therefore, if necessary, send a written answer to Mr Alavanos concerning his further requests."
"Can the Council say which Member States amended their national law by 6 September 2003, the deadline laid down in Article 42 of Decision 2002/187/JHA?(1) What are the terms of these laws and the main differences between them?"
"What national rules have defined the status and the powers of national members of Eurojust since the entry into force of the decision?"
"What are the terms of these rules and the main differences between them?"
"The Council has not received any information from the Member States regarding the implementation of Decision 2002/187/JHA setting up Eurojust."
"The Council would like to draw the honourable Member’s attention to the fact that the decision does not require Member States to communicate such information to the Council."
"It is, nevertheless, aware of the fact that the Commission is drawing up a report on the implementation of Decision 2002/187/JHA; it has been informed that the Commission intends to present this report to the Council by the end of the year."
"Since there is a lack of information on the rules for national transposition, the Council cannot provide the honourable Member with details of the national rules defining the status and the powers of the nations that are members of Eurojust during the period from the entry into force of the decision to date."
"The Italian Council Presidency did, however, organise a meeting on the issue, which took place in Rome on 13 and 14 November 2003."
"– As far as we are aware, only eight Member States have replied to date, whereas the planned deadline for replies was 6 September."
"The issue is extremely tricky because, in the meantime, Eurojust is operational and personal data, some of which is very sensitive, is being exchanged."
"I believe that the problem, regarding Eurojust, is that the cart has been put before the horse, that is to say that this bureaucratic structure to aid cooperation has been created without rules and guarantees and without making sure that these rules could be complied with by the deadlines laid down."
"It is enough to mention the Möllemann case – in which Eurojust was involved, with data exchange – of a German Liberal representative who committed suicide precisely whilst a police and judicial operation was under way involving several Member States."
"The question remains: what rules did the German delegate apply in exchanging information in the Möllemann case, since Eurojust maintains that German rules were applied, whilst the Germans claim that Eurojust rules were applied?"
"As you can see, Mr Antonione, there is a problem that urgently needs resolving."
"The 6 September deadline was not respected: urgent measures are called for."
"Two years ago, harsh sentences were handed down in the US to five Cubans who had infiltrated exiles' organisations in Miami linked to terrorist acts perpetrated in Cuba, in which a number of people, some of them European, had died."
"The trial was marked by the most scandalous irregularities, as denounced by such organisations as Amnesty International."
"The conditions of detention of the prisoners and the difficulties placed in the way of their contacting their families are in clear breach of both American and international law."
"Given the Council's well-known concern over the human rights of the Cuban people, can it state whether it is aware of this case?"
"Will it call on the US authorities to show an attitude at least comparable to that which is being demanded of the Cuban Government as regards human rights and international law, with reference to the relevant legislation, judicial procedures and the treatment of prisoners?"
"As has already been stated, in October in response to oral questions H-0544/03 and H-0549/03 on the same issue, the Council is aware of the trial and detention of five Cuban citizens residing in Florida since 2001 and the concerns that have also been voiced by human rights NGOs, not least, as regards the conditions of detention."
"The Council has not discussed the conditions of the trial."
"As regards the general attitude of the Council and the Commission regarding Cuba, I refer the honourable Member to our debate in this House at the beginning of September."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, my question does not relate either to the trial of the Cuban prisoners or to their current detention."
"My question essentially relates to respect for the rights of families, who are being prevented from seeing these prisoners, despite the fact that these rights are enshrined in international law and in the law of the United States."
"It relates specifically to two women, who for more than four years have not been authorised to visit their husbands, and to a very painful situation which is once again being reported on in the media: today one of the wives has once again been refused a visa to enter the United States in order to see her husband."
"What I want to know is whether the Council considers this to be an issue worthy of its attention or not."
"I must apologise to the honourable Member because, clearly, my reply was not appropriate, so to speak, given the requests."
"I will commit to carrying out further checks and to replying – as far as I am in a position to do so – in writing to the honourable Member."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I must insist on this issue, since in October the President-in-Office of the Council promised us that he would reply in writing to all the questions we presented, and this has not happened."
"So far we have not received any reply."
"I would like – also with regard to this issue – to table a supplementary question, since when there has been a situation of insufficient respect for rights, you have quite rightly acted as the Council in relation to Cuba, but nevertheless, in relation to this other very serious violation of the rights of families, the Council has taken no action."
"My supplementary question is this: have you put this specific issue which we raised a month ago on the families of the five Cuban prisoners who are in Miami to the Council?"
"I believe that Mr Frattini represented the Council last month, but I would ask Mr Antonione to take very good note of these questions and to bear in mind the commitment he has given."
"What are the Council and the Member States doing in the context of the transatlantic dialogue to persuade the United States to promote human rights by avoiding undermining the International Criminal Court and by granting a fair trial or release to Guantanamo Bay detainees?"
"As regards the International Criminal Court, the Council would point out the importance that the Union attaches to preserving the integrity of the Rome Statute."
"We must leave no stone unturned in our endeavours to promote universal signature of the Rome Statute and its full enforcement though national legislation."
"The Member States should become party to the agreement on the privileges and immunity of the Court and ensure that national implementing legislation is enforced."
"They should also refrain from making statements expressing reservations that are permitted under Article 120 of the Rome Statute."
"To this end, the Union has promoted a whole raft of initiatives – political dialogue and other initiatives – to persuade third countries, including the United States, to sign the Rome Statute."
"The Union believes that universal signing-up to the Rome Statute is essential for the International Criminal Court to be fully effective and, to this end, considers that initiatives should be encouraged, which increase acceptance of the Statute, provided that they are consistent with the letter and spirit of the document."
"The Council would like to mention that it has, on every possible occasion – common positions of the Union, guidelines and various initiatives undertaken by third countries – clearly and consistently stressed its position as regards bilateral agreements on non-surrender negotiated or concluded with the United States."
"The Member States to whom the USA has proposed agreements of this kind immediately asked for a common approach from the Union on these proposals within the framework of the Council."
"Since the beginning of the process, the Council has identified a clear political objective for this common approach."
"The basis for any solution that takes into account the concerns of the United States must preserve the integrity of the Rome Statute and must not jeopardise the functioning of the International Criminal Court."
"I would refer you, in particular, to the Union guidelines annexed to the Council conclusions of 30 September 2002, in which the Council confirmed that, according to the current wording, signing bilateral agreements with the United States would be incompatible with the obligations that the Statute of the International Criminal Court imposes on States Parties, as it could also be incompatible with other international agreements to which the said countries are also States Parties."
"Furthermore, the solution adopted should provide for an appropriate system, which would mean that anyone who has committed a crime falling within the remit of the Court could not go unpunished."
"This system should ensure that national judges conduct appropriate investigations into persons brought before the International Criminal Court and, where there is sufficient proof, set the appropriate legal proceedings in motion."
"In any case, the solution adopted as regards the citizenship of those people who are not to be surrendered should only affect people who do not have citizenship of a State Party to the International Criminal Court."
"As regards the scope, this should only cover people that are in the territory of the State to which the application has been made because they have been sent there by another State, and being surrendered cannot be interpreted in such a way as to include transit."
"As was confirmed by the Council in the common position of June 2003, the Member States are continuing, where appropriate, to draw the attention of third countries to the Council Conclusions of 30 September 2002 on the International Criminal Court and on the Union principles annexed to it, regarding proposals for agreements and conventions relating to the conditions for surrendering persons to the Court."
"It states that the 10 accession countries supported the Union’s common position of June 2003, to which the associate countries, such as Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey, and the EFTA countries, also conformed."
"As regards Guantanamo Bay, as the European Parliament knows from the replies given by the Council to a series of written questions on this issue, the Council has not formally discussed this subject with the United States."
"I must say, moreover, as an aside, that, just yesterday, in the meeting held between the General Affairs and External Relations Council and the US Secretary of State, Mr Colin Powell we were able to raise this issue as well and to discuss it directly with him."
"I will, of course, delay going into greater detail on this aspect because it was raised only yesterday."
"In this regard, it must be assumed that the protection of the rights and interests of the citizens of Member States outside the Union is, according to the Vienna Convention on consulate relations, the sole competence of the individual Member State concerned."
"The Member States whose citizens are detained in Guantanamo Bay, are, therefore, adopting measures, which they deem necessary to ensure that their citizens’ rights are respected in the context of the relevant bilateral agreements with the United States."
"The Council is not in a position to provide details on the nature of these measures and any requests for information should be addressed to the Member States concerned."
"As regards the question on the United States’ request for passengers’ personal data, the Council is taking the grave concerns voiced by Parliament, most recently in the resolution adopted on 9 October 2003, very seriously."
"The Council has fully supported the Commission in its sustained efforts to achieve a definitive solution which complies with the clear provisions of the law by the end of the year."
"I would like to thank the Council for its answer and I now have a supplementary question."
"In the light of the deplorable attempts by the US to undermine the International Criminal Court and the rights of the Guantanamo detainees to a fair trial, will the Council raise these matters with the US administration at every opportunity and place them on the agenda for the next US-EU summit?"
". I am not currently in a position to make such a commitment because, as you know Mr Andreasen, it clearly depends on the other Member States of the Council as well."
"I can tell you that on this matter there has already been, as I had occasion to mention just now, an exchange of opinions during yesterday’s lunch and during the Troikameeting I therefore believe that such an issue could also be resumed in light of the commitments made publicly by Colin Powell when replying in a press conference to a journalist, to the effect that, on his return to the US, he would look into the issue further and attempt to remedy any difficult situations."
"I hope that there will be a positive development and that it will no longer be necessary to address this issue."
"On 16 and 17 October 2003, the European Council examined the state of the peace process in the Middle East, discussing possible ways forward."
"It was stressed that the European Union expresses its firm commitment to the clear objective of two States – Israel and a viable, and democratic Palestinian State – living side by side in peace and security in the framework of comprehensive peace in the Middle East, as laid out in the road map."
"Furthermore, the European Union reiterated its determination to contribute to all aspects of the implementation of the road map and stressed the importance and urgency of setting up a credible and effective third-party monitoring mechanism."
"The European Council said that it is deeply concerned by the situation in the region and noted that, despite support given by the international community to the quest for a just and lasting solution, insufficient effort has been made by the concerned parties to seize the opportunity for peace set down in the road map, underscored by the recent Quartet Ministerial Statement issued on 26 September 2003."
"On the contrary, rising violence is bringing increasing suffering and death for both the Israeli and the Palestinian peoples and putting at risk security in the region and beyond."
"The European Council therefore called on both parties, Israel and the Palestinian Authority, to live up to the commitments they undertook at the Aqaba summit on 4 June 2003."
"The European Council urged all sides in the region to immediately implement policies conducive to dialogue and negotiations."
"The EU relationship with those who take steps to the contrary will be inevitably affected by such behaviour."
"The Union will take every opportunity to make these positions accepted by both sides."
"The EU-Israel Association Council, which took place on 17 and 18 November 2003, gave the Union a good opportunity to give a clear political message to the Israeli Government."
"In particular, the Union stressed its concern at the route of the so-called security fence and the continued expansion of settlements, and reiterated the need for Israel, in the fight against terrorism, to avoid civilian casualties and destruction so as not to exacerbate the plight of the Palestinian people."
"Furthermore, the Council stressed the importance of the Union playing an active role in the peace process."
"As regards the specific question from Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, the Council believes that the Geneva Agreement is a positive contribution to the debate on resolving the crisis in the Middle East, in accordance with the Union’s position in this regard, expressed most recently by the European Council of 16 and 17 October 2003."
"The European Council welcomed initiatives from civil society on both sides and said that it is ready to further assist in the effort to promote , confidence-building and the search for a lasting peace."
"The steps for reaching a definitive, comprehensive solution to the Israeli-Palestine conflict are set out on the Quartet’s road map."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you have acknowledged that the Roadmap is in serious crisis."
"Everybody seems to acknowledge this."
"And this is helping the radicals on both sides to achieve their objective, which is that the Roadmap be broken, and we want the Council now to establish something which you have mentioned: the specific repercussions which have to be applied to those who do not comply with the Roadmap."
"We would like you to explain to us what these repercussions would be."
". I am not in a position to go into details on what measures might be adopted where there is non-compliance with what the European Union has called for;"
"I can only say that the policy and the will are there."
"Clearly, decisions as to the specific, practical stance to be taken must be taken when the time comes, not least as regards any choices made subsequently by the countries that have not complied with our requests."
"I thank the President-in-Office for his reply."
"Of course, I noticed the repetition of the objectives and commitments we have heard numerous times, together with an impression of the tragic situation in the area."
"I would like to ask more specifically: does the Council believe the observations in Israel during the meeting of the Association Council to be sufficient?"
"Does the European Union see that there is at the moment any margin for its greater involvement within the framework of the road map or in supporting the Geneva initiative?"
"I should like to hear something more specific, which is also why I tabled the question."
". I am sorry to disappoint the honourable Member but my reply is basically what I am currently in a position to say."
"I cannot make any other commitments other than what I stated in my reply to your question."
"Article 9(1b) of Council Regulation (EC) 2369/2002 of 20 December 2002(2) amending Regulation (EC) 2792/1999(3) laying down the detailed rules and arrangements regarding Community structural assistance in the fisheries sector states that public aid may be granted for the modernisation of fishing vessels only where such vessels do not exceed 400 GT."
"In addition, Article 1(3) of the same regulation states that the measures adopted 'shall not increase fishing effort'."
"Certain fishing fleets, in view of their particular characteristics and those of the surrounding zones (ocean-going vessels, freezer tuna vessels, etc.), cannot possibly operate in an even minimally profitable fashion using vessels under 400 GT."
"Nonetheless, the fisheries sectors concerned have expressed genuine interest in the modernisation of their old vessels, without asking for any corresponding increase in capacity."
"In view of the above, can the Council state whether, under Regulation (EC) 2369/2002, the possibility exists of granting public aid, up to the maximum corresponding to 400 GT vessels, for the modernisation of fishing vessels of larger size and tonnage, provided the remaining criteria under the regulation are met and the modernisation does not entail any increase in the fishing effort?"
"Thank you, Mr Ortuondo Larrea, for tabling this question."
"The Council would, first of all, like to stress that, in the discussions of December 2002, particular attention was given to structural measures for fleets that needed to be adapted to reflect the reform of the common fisheries policy."
"In this regard, the Council was fully aware of the need to ensure consistency between the restructuring policy for the sector and other aspects of the common fisheries policy, in particular the objective of achieving a stable, enduring balance between the capacity of the fleet and the fishing opportunities available in and outside Community waters."
"As a result, the decision adopted in December 2002 on aid seeks to concentrate Community financial support on a series of measures that the Council deemed to be a priority within the new framework."
"As regards constructing new vessels, Regulation No 2369/2002 states that public aid in this sector will continue to be available up until the end of 2004, but, from now on, will be given for fishing vessels not exceeding 400 GT."
"Leaving aside the issue of whether certain fisheries activities carried out with fishing vessels not exceeding 400 GT are sufficiently profitable, it must be stressed that the Council regulation does not allow for construction aid, for the types of shipping vessels that you mentioned, Mr Ortuondo Larrea, equal to that laid down for shipping vessels under 400 GT."
"Nevertheless, as regards direct investment for safety at sea, working conditions and the quality of products, Regulation No 2369/2002 provides for aid for equipment and modernisation after 2004 without applying the 400 GT limit."
"Any similar measure to the one suggested by Mr Ortuondo Larrea would, however, require a proposal from the Commission."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, thank you for your reply."
"Certainly I am in favour of respecting the idea that a minimum stock of all possible species of fish should be maintained in order to guarantee their survival and continuity, and the fishermen themselves are the first to have an interest in this resource not being exhausted, since it represents their way of life."
"That is why I raised the question of whether, while respecting the fishing effort, while respecting the maximum catches laid down, it would be possible to also authorise financial aid for the renewal of fishing vessels which, as a result of their specific characteristics, cannot have less than 400 GT."
"I am grateful for the information you have given me, but I do not know whether this covers the needs for the modernisation of the fleet for all types of fisheries."
"In this regard, I would like to stress that we cannot treat seafaring workers as second-class workers."
"The renewal of the fleet is something vital not only for the survival of companies, not only for the environment, but also for safety and the working conditions of workers."
"Will the Council bring pressure to bear on the French authorities over the continued detention of political prisoners without trial?"
"I refer in particular to the case of six Breton nationalist campaigners – four of whom have been imprisoned without trial for over three years and one, Alain Solé, for over five years."
"Arrested in 1999 for alleged participation in bomb attacks, Alain Solé's health has deteriorated seriously as a result of his unlawful incarceration."
"He is now an insulin-dependent diabetic following the lack of adequate medical care in the months following his arrest."
"Each time his release has been ordered in accordance with French law, he has been linked to separate criminal charges and has remained in provisional detention."
"The prisoners' detention is in clear violation of Article 5(3) of the European Convention on Human Rights."
"Will the Council commit to examining this issue in light of international standards governing the rights of those in provisional detention to trial within a reasonable time?"
". I must remind the honourable Member that the Council cannot adopt a position on the way individual criminal cases are dealt with by Member States."
"I base my supplementary question on Article 5(3) of the European Convention on Human Rights, which states that: 'Everyone arrested or detained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1(c) of this Article shall be brought promptly before a judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power and shall be entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial."
"Release may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial.'"
"Member States must adhere to directives laid down by the EU, and France is clearly contravening, rather than adhering to, directives that are laid down in law."
"Would the Council representative therefore pursue this matter in the Council and consider bringing France before the Court of Human Rights?"
". I must repeat what I have already said: the Council cannot adopt a position on the way individual criminal cases are dealt with in Member States."
"This is the case on this occasion too, always assuming that the situation is as Mr Eurig Wyn claims, which is not certain."
"The position cannot change."
"I believe the Council is wrong here."
"The Nice Treaty laid down provisions that followed on from the time the Council took action against Austria for breaching fundamental rights."
"France is clearly breaching national fundamental rights here."
"There is now provision in the Nice Treaty for action to be taken against France."
"I believe that there is an obligation on the Council and the European Union as a whole to ensure that France respects fundamental rights."
"Clearly that is not being done in this case."
"I will make a note of the comments made by the author of this supplementary question."
"Frankly, I believe that the position that I have expressed is correct, but given the further request, I will undertake to check if the situation should be other than what seems correct to me."
"If necessary, I will make a further investigation but, as I understand the situation at present, I can only confirm what I have already said."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in view of your reply, rather than asking the question I had planned to ask, I am simply going to make a suggestion: read Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty and then reply."
"The ongoing conflict in Chechnya has produced two full-blown wars and taken more than 150 000 lives over the past decade."
"Yet despite consistent calls for international intervention from human rights organisations, Chechnya has been recently taken off the agenda of the international community and relegated to a Russian internal matter."
"Many have seen this as an attempt by the US to secure Russia’s cooperation in the war on terrorism and improve access to Russia’s energy resources as an alternative to Gulf oil."
"European leaders also appear to be more concerned with Russia’s stability and uninterrupted supply of natural gas and oil to the continent than with human rights violations."
"What, if any, proposals does the Council have for raising and treating this matter within the EU?"
"The Council is very concerned about the situation in Chechnya, in particular as regards human rights, and it regularly stresses the need for a genuine reconciliation in its meetings with the Russian authorities."
"The Council has, on many occasions, stressed to the Russian authorities the important role of international organisations in promoting and implementing a process for a political solution in the region."
"Furthermore, it has called on the Russian authorities to independently investigate violations of human rights perpetrated by both sides and to bring those allegedly responsible for such acts to trial."
"On 8 October 2003, the Presidency, on behalf of the European Union, issued a statement on the presidential elections in Chechnya."
"The Union expressed serious doubts about the fairness of the electoral process and grave concerns at the conditions in which the elections took place, but it also expressed the hope that these elections would lead to significant subsequent efforts to achieve a genuine reconciliation and peace."
"On a domestic level, the Union has discussed Chechnya in many meetings at all levels."
"In all recent political dialogue meetings with Russia, Chechnya was on the agenda: the meeting of political leaders of 12 September in Moscow, the EU-Russia Cooperation Committeeof 20 October, the Ministerial of 28 October in Moscow."
"The issue was also raised at the EU-Russia Summit of 6 November 2003 in Rome."
"It is deplorable that the vested interests of America and the European Union have allowed this issue to be pushed off the international agenda and turned into an internal Russian issue, which it clearly is not."
"During the Irish presidency, I would like to see the Council give support to the Irish, because in the national parliament the European Affairs Committee has actually appointed a rapporteur on Russia to look at the issue of Chechnya."
"During the Irish presidency there will be two meetings, the first in Dublin, during the visit by the Foreign Minister, the second the EU-Russia summit to be held in May."
"The Council needs to put strong pressure on the European Union."
"We need the EU to push at Council level for unfettered international human rights monitoring of Chechnya."
"This issue has to be put back on the international agenda."
"It is completely unacceptable that over 150 000 people have died over the last decade and appalling human rights abuses are taking place."
"People are willing to turn a blind eye to what is going on in the interests of oil and resources."
"I would remind the honourable Members that this is a Question Time and not a time for statements."
"I would like to draw the Council's attention to a case where a child suffered serious injury after falling through a glass panel housing a fire hose reel in a hotel lobby."
"A Council recommendation on fire safety in hotels quite rightly requires that such fire safety equipment is visible, well maintained and in working order."
"However, I would ask the Council to comment on whether in the interest of public safety such equipment should not also be made of safety glass where there is a risk of it shattering?"
". Of course, the Council shares the concerns expressed by the honourable Member as regards fire safety in hotels and the need to adopt effective measures in order to conform to Council Recommendation 86/666/EEC."
"The Council would like to draw attention to the Commission report of 27 June 2001 (COM(2001) 348), on application of the aforementioned recommendation, which examines the state of its implementation in Member States."
"The Council believes that the recommendation and the Commission report constitute a sufficient basis for Member States to assess to what extent further specific provisions could be called for, including the treatment of fire safety equipment in order to further improve fire safety in hotels."
"My question has been partially answered, President-in-Office, because you talked about the current recommendation."
"The problem, however, is that the recommendation does not include any provisions about the need for safety glass."
"It deals with the maintenance of the equipment, but in this incident a young child nearly had a very serious accident because he fell through the glass."
"You are coming to the end of your presidency."
"Will you ask the Irish presidency and the Commission to look at the provisions of this recommendation to see if they cover all the things that they need to?"
"For example, this should be toughened safety glass as it would be in the UK but apparently not in Spain."
"It is not covered by the recommendation at the moment, nor by health and safety directives."
"This safety glass issue is currently a grey area and therefore I would ask you to take the issue up with the Irish presidency and the Commission."
". I will take good note of these comments, which I believe to be important contributions."
"I would ask the honourable Member, if possible, to present a brief memorandum on the issue in question, which could be more useful for the Commission than for the next Presidency – in so far as measures are adopted by the Commission, with the full cooperation of the Council – precisely so that we can deal proactively with some situations that have, perhaps, not yet been looked into because the potential for real tragedy has been overlooked in particular cases."
"On the occasion of a meeting with the Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar in Madrid on 19 October 2003, Turkish Minister of State Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned of ‘a splitting of the Mediterranean into a Christian and a Muslim club’."
"At the same meeting Erdogan, in his capacity as Prime Minister of the applicant country Turkey, also made the following statement: ‘We would not like the EU to become a Christian club’ (Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung of 20 October 2003)."
"One of the questions being considered at the ongoing Intergovernmental Conference is whether the preamble to the planned EU constitution should contain a reference to Europe’s Judeo-Christian roots."
"To what extent does the Council consider that a reference of this kind to a historical fact could in any way make future EU membership for Turkey more difficult?"
"Given that the Bible constitutes Holy Scripture for Christians, Jews and Muslims alike, to what extent could the Council imagine supporting a formulation such as ‘Europe’s biblical heritage’ as a way of describing the core texts of Europe’s religious heritage, in order to include these three world religions in the preamble?"
"The Council does not have an opinion on the point raised by the honourable Member."
"This issue relates to the Intergovernmental Conference, in which the Council, as an institution, does not play any part."
"Mr President, I suppose I must thank you for your answer, but I cannot say I am happy with it."
"If anyone has a role now, it is the Italian Presidency."
"Europe Minister Mr Buttiglioni is one of the members of the Italian Government most committed to having the Preamble to the Constitution specify the religious, cultural and historical heritage."
"The Italian Presidency, which is represented in the Chamber, presses the issue of specifying the fact that Europe’s religious heritage has Judaeo-Christian roots."
"I would therefore expect them to be able to envisage wording that refers to Biblical roots or the Biblical heritage."
"In that way, scope would be given for Christians, Jews and Muslims all to feel affirmed by this Constitution."
"Non-believers too could feel that the Bible is a literary and cultural treasure for the whole of Europe."
"Is it not important for the Italian Presidency to find a solution that satisfies everyone?"
"– Mr President, I am well aware that an Intergovernmental Conference is currently underway, which, as we know, consists of the Council."
"One of the questions on the agenda concerns Christian values and the issue of what message should be given in the preamble about the values underlying the European constitution."
"It would certainly be helpful for us to know what the Italian Presidency’s position is on this matter."
"I believe that I have already answered the previous question with sufficient clarity in saying that the Council, as such, does not adopt a position on issues relating to the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Once again, this has to be my answer."
"What measures does the Council intend to take to support Bolivia's new constitutional government?"
"In its statement of 21 October, the Union, welcoming the appointment of Mr Mesa Gisbert as the new constitutional representative, stressed that it would continue to provide assistance and aid to Bolivia in order to strengthen democratic institutions, the rule of law and respect for human rights, and to establish a climate that is more favourable to social progress and economic development."
"The Union has been and will continue to be a significant source of investment, trade and development aid for Bolivia."
"As one of the major beneficiaries of Community aid in South America, Bolivia has received more than EUR 500 million since 1976."
"Between 1996 and 2002, European Community undertakings reached a total of almost EUR 200 million, whilst payments reached EUR 183 million."
"These figures include financial, technical and economic cooperation, food security, humanitarian aid, cooperation with non-governmental organisations and in the field of human rights, and other horizontal budget lines."
"The national strategy document sets the total provision of European Community financial, technical and economic cooperation at EUR 126 million for the period 2000 and 2006."
"At the recent meeting of the consultative group, which took place in Paris on 8 and 9 October, international donors made further commitments."
"Nevertheless, in the current phase, it has not been possible to give a precise picture of the general commitments and the various forms they have taken, such as loans, subsidies, debt cancellation and swaps."
"On the other hand, the European Union, like other donors, also stressed the need to tackle the causes of the crisis at its roots."
"According to the Union, this calls for further provisions to ensure that the poorest and most marginal groups of society have access to services, including reinforcement of land rights and greater political participation of indigenous peoples."
"The European Union welcomes the commitment made by the Bolivian Government to combat corruption and intends to stress the importance of swiftly approving anti-corruption legislation and of more effective application of the current legislation."
"Furthermore, a healthy institutional structure is an essential condition for an efficient, transparent and fair provision of public services."
"The fact that reform of the public sector remained almost at a standstill last year has, however, raised some concerns."
"Reform of the public sector needs to be stepped up at national and local authority level."
"The European Union and Bolivia have behind them a long history of close, fruitful cooperation."
"Now, the Union is ready to further enhance its support of the government and the people of Bolivia."
"To this end, it intends to give greater support than ever to the Bolivian Government, in order to enhance good governance and to reduce and prevent conflicts through strengthening democratic institutions."
"The competent authorities are currently looking into specific measures."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, thank you for the full explanation you have given me on the aid to the Bolivian Government."
"The President has referred to the European Union’s intention to focus its attention on the causes of the crisis."
"It appears that these causes relate above all to the liberalisation and modernisation requirements in a country which has very serious structural problems, as a result of the international situation."
"Specifically, my supplementary question is whether, in view of the failure of Sánchez de Losada’s experiment in liberalisation, following the formulae of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the European Union and all the international institutions currently governing world economics have considered the consequences of the failure of these policies which we are imposing on them and the need to reconsider a new type of policy with regard to countries such as Bolivia."
"There has not yet been a critical assessment that has given us any reason to adopt alternative measures to those taken thus far."
"We believe that in-depth study of these issues – and thus tackling the roots of the problem – will allow us to understand better how to act with a policy guideline which has yielded good results in other situations and which we believe can be a useful instrument as regards the situation in Bolivia too."
"In the case in point, it is all too clear that these detailed questions will have to be looked at specifically."
"I would request your attention, ladies and gentlemen."
"The President-in-Office of the Council tells us that he must leave at 7 p.m."
"The agenda proposed by the Conference of Presidents and approved by plenary establishes that Question Time lasts until 7.30 p.m."
"I can tell you that the President-in-Office of the Council informed us that he could not be present beyond 7 p.m. and following deliberation by the Conference of Presidents it was decided to maintain the agenda."
"I cannot offer you any solution."
"Today the Bureau is going to deal with the problems relating to Question Time."
"A series of proposals will be examined and we will try to ensure that these problems do not arise in the future."
"– Mr President, I have been in this House for some time now and even before I was elected in 1994 I worked here."
"I remember, for example, the last Italian Presidency and the one before that, amongst others."
"On those occasions, the Council spent the night here and Question Time was held in the night sitting."
"I just wish to remind us of this."
"Out of consideration for the Council we subsequently moved Question Time to the afternoon, with the result that it has not worked since."
"I really would like to make a plea for Question Time to be moved back to the night sitting, enabling the Council to spend the night here in Strasbourg in the future – there may still be the odd hotel room available."
"It is a beautiful city and I think that for the six months concerned it would not be too inconvenient for representatives of the Council Presidency to spend a night here from time to time."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I often take part in this Question Time and I find it shameful that recently this has become a routine excuse: the representative of the Council informs us in advance that they must leave the Chamber urgently."
"Since it has become routine, this sounds – it shames me to say it – a little like a kind of subterfuge by know-alls."
"I therefore support the proposed agenda of the Conference of Presidents, which sets the length of Question Time in accordance with our Rules of Procedure: an hour and a half."
"I am going to put my supplementary question, since I have the right to do so, which relates to Question No 17, relating to an enormous tragedy."
"My supplementary question..."
"Mrs Izquierdo, the Council is not present."
"Within the meaning of the Rules of Procedure I have the right to put it."
"It relates to Question No 17 and says: Mr President-in-Office of the Council, following this tragedy, has the European Union acted in relation to Morocco in view of the fact that the Kingdom of Morocco has reacted positively through the measures it has adopted recently?"
"Yes, Mr President, I obviously support the opinion of the two previous speakers that it is indeed deplorable that the Council is treating Parliament – if you will forgive my putting it like this – in a rather offhand manner."
"This situation is all the more regrettable because we all have obviously very important questions to put to the Council and because we are awaiting its reply."
"I shall not repeat my question about the banning – improper, in my view – of a Basque newspaper, issued nine months ago by a judge, apparently under the influence of the Spanish Ministry of the Interior."
"For nine months, there has been no sense of urgency at all about discovering the reasons behind this obvious infringement of freedom of expression in connection with a newspaper – the only daily in the Basque language which, I would point out, is the most ancient language on our continent."
"Such a situation seems to me to have disastrous implications for freedoms."
"The concept of security is taking over our European Union, to the detriment of freedoms, and that is something I deplore."
"I should have liked the Council to have provided some explanations regarding this point."
"They would certainly have said to me in reply what they said to my fellow MEP, Mr Wynn, in which case I should have reminded them of what my colleague, Mrs McKenna, pointed out to them on the subject of the Treaty of Nice."
"Mr Mayol, the Council will reply in writing, as it is obliged to do."
"– Mr President, one reason why I would ask that we be given statistics on the Council’s attendance during the course of the last Presidencies is that I believe that the press would find it very interesting to see with what assiduity the Council attends the sittings of this House."
"I am almost certain that we will deal with your request because it is positive and welcome that we should have statistical knowledge of the situation."
"I would remind you that in the Bureau of Parliament this evening from 7.30 p.m. we are going to hold a debate on Question Time and also the Conference of Presidents will have news."
"As the time allotted to questions to the Council has elapsed, Questions Nos 13 to 32 will be replied to in writing (4)."
"That concludes Question Time to the Council."
"(5)"
"The next item is the debate on the second report (A5-0370/2003) by Mr Queiró, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions European Defence Industrial and market issues Towards an EU Defence Equipment Policy (COM(2003) 113 2003/2096(INI))."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, given that the Union’s Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Defence launched the European Arms Agency at the beginning of this week with considerable media coverage, I am sorry to see how discreetly our Parliament is promoting this important debate, which has been incomprehensibly moved to the quiet of this cold Thursday night."
"This is a contrast in which, as a Member of the European Parliament, I take no pride."
"Having said this, I wish, of course, to express my thanks to my colleagues from the other political groups for the spirit of cooperation and collaboration that I was shown from the outset in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy. This approach enabled us to adopt a balanced, coherent and, therefore, credible report."
"The only reason I cannot claim to be totally satisfied is because the amendment I tabled to have the report’s fifteenth and final paragraph removed was not successful."
"I believe that Parliament would do well to acknowledge that defence is an enormously sensitive field in political terms and currently falls directly within the competence of the Member States."
"Calling for codecision for industrial policy in the field of defence equipment is not realistic and affects the balance reached in the committee."
"I would therefore ask my fellow Members to accept the proposal that I tabled to have the paragraph removed."
"Mr President, despite the fact that the European Union has already demonstrated its willingness to assume, in addition to the financial contribution it makes, further responsibilities for managing and undertaking peacekeeping operations – as we are currently seeing, for example, in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, in Bosnia-Herzegovina and in the Democratic Republic of the Congo - weaknesses and shortcomings still remain."
"Like the conflict in the Balkans, the war in Afghanistan clearly demonstrated the disparities that remain between the United States and Europe in the field of military capability and of defence technology."
"This difference in capability must, therefore, be reduced, in order to achieve a more balanced transatlantic cooperation, thereby increasing stability and security in the euro-Atlantic area."
"Increasing the Union’s military capability does not, however, mean that we need, straightaway, to create new structures and devote more financial resources to developing this policy in practice."
"We all know that the overall spending by Member States on defence is around half of what the USA spends, but that, in terms of military capability, this percentage falls to around 10%."
"In this context, one might conclude that the budgetary resources the Member States allocate to defence capability are insufficient."
"On the contrary, because the Union does not have the same needs or the same strategic objectives as the United States, it is in a position to meet its needs with the financial means it has currently."
"This is primarily a question of Europe’s making better use of the financial resources available to it, and I will tell you how this can be done."
"Major changes have already taken place or are now taking place in the national defence-related industries in various European countries, in a concerted effort to improve the management of their industrial arms policies."
"The European Union, therefore, has an obligation to promote these attempts at approximation with the aim of ensuring the interoperability of means both at intra-European and transatlantic levels, in order to avoid pointless and wasteful duplication and overlapping."
"Furthermore, prudent harmonisation between regulations for the defence equipment market and for the civilian market is desirable, particularly in the case of the countless companies that produce for both markets at the same time."
"It is clear, however, that defence equipment is not a product like any other and should be treated differently."
"A first step in this direction could be to simplify the administrative formalities governing intra-Community transfers of defence products, and gradually to harmonise national licensing systems."
"If these attempts to streamline are to succeed, there must be better coordination between Member States."
"Therefore, as I said at the beginning of my speech, we welcome the decision that has just been taken by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Defence to accept the objective of making the European Arms Agency operational as of June 2004."
"To bring my speech to a close, I shall take this opportunity to summarise the main conclusions of the report that we will be voting on tomorrow."
"These are: increasing European military capability, so as to ensure the credibility of its foreign and defence policy objectives; improving the interoperability of defence equipment, at both intra-European and transatlantic levels, with a view to guaranteeing the security and stability of Europe and of the Atlantic area; establishing, in this framework, conditions favourable to developing a competitive and viable European defence equipment industry; better use of public monies in this field, in particular to prevent overlapping, by promoting industrial and technological interdependency and research linked to this sector; involving the new enlargement countries in this process of industrial reconversion; promoting adequate rules governing competition and security of supply while taking account of the gradual opening up of the arms markets; creating financial support measures for new defence equipment, in particular to develop equipment to protect the Union’s external borders, including its maritime borders; and, finally, the need to improve parliamentary monitoring and follow-up mechanisms for security and defence policy at both levels at which it is implemented - the European and the national levels - with the appropriate involvement of the respective parliamentary representations."
"In today’s world, which is threatened by terrorism, security has become a global and indivisible concept, quite different to traditional concepts of security."
"The obligation incumbent on the European Union and on its Member States is, consequently, in cooperation with their allies, to streamline their military and arms capabilities and at the same time increase resources for diplomatic cooperation, for the information services and also for police and judicial cooperation in a genuine synergy of national and trans-national policies."
"This report on the defence industries seeks to contribute to enhancing the climate of collective security that we would all like to see."
"Support from my fellow Members of this Parliament will give it the political clout needed to bring about the changes it recommends."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Mr Queiró for his excellent report on the Commission communication on issues related to the defence industry and market."
"In its resolution of April 2002, the European Parliament urged the Commission to address industry- and market-related issues in the context of the European defence industry."
"Developments in recent years, such as the gradual piecing together of a European security and defence policy, and changes in the industry itself have set the scene for a re-evaluation of the issue, which a few years ago was considered premature."
"The Commission is perfectly aware of the sensitivity of this area and of the specific characteristics of the defence sector."
"Consequently, we adopted a cautious approach, focusing on the prospects for developing Europe’s industrial and technological potential in the long term and stating our determination to make a substantial contribution to the efforts of the European Union, wherever possible."
"As everyone knows, we presented proposals for practical action, in particular on research in the field of security and defence and on developing a European defence equipment market."
"Our proposals were well received by the Member States and I am pleased because the Commission has now been implementing some of these decisions since March of this year."
"In this context, I should like to emphasise that an impact assessment study is currently being conducted on the issue of simplifying intra-Community transfers of defence equipment."
"As regards the issue of calls for tender, a Green Paper is being prepared to open the debate on a set of adequate rules for the profitable acquisition of goods and services by the Member States’ defence procurement agencies and by the future European Agency in an entirely compatible and integrated way."
"The joint efforts in the field of standardization with the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) in order to draw up a European manual that can be applied to defence contracts are continuing; the principles for undertaking economic control of the defence industry and market in the enlarged European Union have been delineated; and there has been a change of approach to controlling the export of dual-use products, in the broader context of European Union strategy and of the action plan to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction."
"With regard to research issues, I should like to inform you that the Commission is putting the finishing touches to a communication on preparatory action for increasing European industrial potential related to research in the field of security for the period 2004-2006."
"At the beginning of next year, a call for tender will be published."
"A group of experts has been set up with the aim of advising and assisting the Commission in this task, which we hope will contribute to a substantial European research programme in the field of security, from 2007 onwards."
"Mr Queiró’s report broadly supports the Commission’s approach of strengthening the European defence base in industrial and technological matters, by gradually establishing a European defence equipment market and by promoting research in the field of security."
"He welcomes, in particular, the proposals for standardization, the rules for public tenders and for intra-Community transfers, emphasising as regards the latter the link with controlling arms exports at the Union’s external borders and, in particular, Parliament’s proposals for an EU code of conduct."
"The report welcomes the idea of pilot projects to be undertaken in research and development in the field of security."
"All of these suggestions encourage the Commission in its action and we also feel encouraged by the favourable opinion of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on the creation of the common European market for defence equipment and its explicit support for various proposals by the Commission in this area."
"As far as the creation of an agency in the field of defence is concerned, following on from the mandate given by the Thessaloniki European Council, the Member States, through the Council, asked the Commission to clarify how the Community could work with and/or within the future agency so as to maximise synergies in pursuing common objectives."
"The Commission reacted favourably to this request and can today confirm its desire and willingness to contribute to this task, using the means already presented in the communication of March of this year, which is the subject of today’s debate."
"In this spirit, the Commission plans to be involved in the Agency’s development and operations, to help it to achieve its objectives, as defined by the European Council."
"To conclude, I should like to emphasise the Commission’s appreciation and hopes for the European Parliament’s support for Mr Queiró’s report, and for close collaboration with the Member States, in order to move ahead in an area that presents many challenges."
"European citizens and taxpayers are entitled to hope that we are moving towards greater effectiveness in the defence sector and towards greater credibility for European security and defence policy."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is no coincidence if, on the eve of the vote on the resolution prepared by our estimable fellow MEP, Mr Queiró, we are able, as he has just reminded us, to share his delight at the announcement last Monday of the decision by the External Relations Council to create the European Defence Agency and to ask a team responsible for establishing this Agency to propose the relevant legal, institutional and financial arrangements."
"Thanks to the impact of the Iraq crisis, we have in fact been able, throughout last year, to see a new convergence between Parliament’s, the Commission’s and the Council’s approaches to common foreign and security policy."
"We may therefore begin to hope that, in this area at least, the progress made by the Convention will not be fundamentally called into question by the expected decisions of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"That being said, I include among these instances of progress the resolution to make a better job of spending the funds allocated by the various Member States to their defence, avoiding the present dissipation of effort in terms of research, development and the production of equipment necessary to the modernisation of the armed forces."
"With this in mind, we must hope, Commissioner, that, as our rapporteur requests, the Commission communication entitled ‘Industrial and Market Issues – Towards an EU Defence Equipment Policy’ will present – as I hope, and am sure, it will do – a favourable framework for increased cooperation."
"I think it important to emphasise the fact that the opening up of national markets, which will thus have been made necessary, must be aimed not only at bringing about greater savings – which goes without saying – but also at guaranteeing security of supplies at national and European levels."
"I am well aware that this is a difficult need to satisfy, particularly for states which – like my own country, France – have so far made sure they retained as much independence as possible in this area."
"One of the Agency’s priorities should consist of proposing, for this purpose, the necessary changes to the current Treaty provisions."
"That being said, let us be very wary of being satisfied with the impact of creating this much-vaunted Agency."
"Let us not forget that, prior to this, there existed OCCAR – the Organisation for Joint Armament Cooperation – which, at least to my knowledge, has never been able to be very active, for want of possessing the minimum Community budget needed for it to be effective."
"Let us be aware, ladies and gentlemen – particularly those of you in the Committee on Budgets – that, if we wish to progress beyond vague desires, we must lose no time in reflecting upon these issues and amending the 2004 budget to include the sums required if the Agency’s activities are to take off."
"Nor must we forget to provide our High Representative with the resources he needs in order to take action since, according to the Council’s proposal, it is he who will assume the direction of the Agency."
"I was happy to hear, Commissioner, that, like ourselves, you are convinced of the need to give priority, in the area with which we are concerned, to research and that it is perhaps at this level that we could undertake the type of pilot project you mooted."
"In order to give our enlarged Europe the place expected of it on the international scene, it has, finally, to be given the resources for taking action."
"As we have said, we need, therefore, to make a better job of spending, but we shall also definitely need to spend more."
"It is not easy for someone with political responsibility to acknowledge this truth, particularly at a time when it is so difficult to balance the budgets."
"I would therefore take this opportunity to salute the courage of the rapporteur and of all those within the committee who have backed his report by having written, or agreed, that the persistent refusal of many Member States to increase their defence expenditure is in danger of jeopardising the European Union’s military capability and the very coherence of its action within NATO."
"As I have said before in this House, Mr President and Commissioner, let us not forget the old French adage about false economy, widely heard in pre-Revolutionary France: no money, no Switzerland."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Queiró’s report and the Commission communication are along the lines of our previous parliamentary resolutions, adopted since 1984, on European security and defence policy."
"The Commission communication and this report have come at a good time for continuing the progress it has already been decided should be made by the ESDP, notably since the Cologne European Council in June 1999."
"Since then, new bodies have indeed been put in place: the PSC (Political and Security Committee), the Military Committee, the Military Staff and others placed variously alongside the High Representative responsible for foreign policy."
"It has been decided to set up a rapid reaction force of 60 000 men."
"Several conferences have been held to evaluate our military capability and deficiencies."
"Throughout this period, a lot has therefore been done, but an observation, remarked upon many times, has also been made, namely that our defence industries are in great need of reform, without which we shall continue to waste funds by using them to no purpose."
"I shall not refer again to the various analyses and wishes expressed both by the Commission and by our rapporteur."
"I share them unreservedly, Mr Queiró, apart from your desire that we vote in favour of your Amendment 1."
"I cannot help but like paragraph 15, and I shall therefore vote against your wishes, for which I am sorry."
"Allow me to emphasise one point, because it is important and also because it is topical, as pointed out before me by Mr Queiró and Mr Morillon."
"It concerns the creation of the European Armaments Agency."
"For a long time, the European Parliament has – inevitably, given what has just been said – expressed its support for creating such an Agency."
"We shall again express our support tomorrow by voting in favour of this report and of an excellent amendment tabled on this subject, that is to say the Agency, by Mr von Wogau."
"Matters have, I am very pleased to say, proceeded quickly, however, especially since good news from Europe is pretty rare at present."
"Last Monday, a joint decision by the foreign ministers, including those of the new Member States, in fact launched this Agency, which had been decided upon in principle at the Thessaloniki Summit and which must therefore begin its work in January 2004."
"That is good news."
"Let us hope that, despite the inevitable obstacles and resistance, this Agency will be a success."
"It should, I hope, go beyond the OCCAR – the Organisation for Joint Armament Cooperation – which was a big disappointment."
"This European Agency will have a broad range of tasks."
"It will have to concern itself with military capability, in terms of armaments and equipment, but also – and it is my turn to be emphatic – with research, which is a vital sector, to say the least, but one that has been rather neglected, not only by the European Union but also by its Member States."
"I listened to you very carefully just now, Commissioner."
"I hope that the Commission will continue in the vein you have just indicated."
"In its favour, this Agency has the political will of those who are creating it and placing it alongside the Council of Ministers."
"What it also has in its favour is support from industrialists, who are perfectly aware of the need to work together at European and intra-European levels and who have already, moreover, begun to combine of their own accord."
"The Agency is supported by the European Parliament and the Commission."
"In short, a lot of good fairies are present at its birth."
"It will need their help in order to grow and have the prosperous life we wish for it, as well as for European security and defence policy as a whole."
"Mr President, the Green Group very much opposes the idea that military research projects should be financed by the EU budget."
"We feel it is totally unacceptable to propose that European citizens should be asked to pay even more for military expenditure, when we should be going in the opposite direction and ensuring that European citizens' money is used for the good of society and mankind as a whole, not for destruction."
"We have tabled amendments to that effect."
"We firmly believe that this report, and the Commission communication on which it is based, are being pushed forward by the vested interests of the European military industrial lobbies, who are clearly the real policy makers."
"They have the unquestioning ear of the EU institutions, which appear to jump to their commands and do what they want."
"This report supports the European Arms Agency, established last Monday by the Council of Ministers."
"The military industrial lobby has even succeeded in having this agency included in the draft EU Constitution."
"The inclusion in any constitution of a military agency whose aim is to promote common military procurement and to improve the arms industry's efficiency just beggars belief."
"Regardless of whether one is in favour of or against an EU Constitution, there is absolutely no justification for the inclusion of an agency that promotes the tools of death and destruction."
"There is also the question as to why this particular agency was selected for inclusion in the draft Constitution rather than, for example, a conflict prevention agency, which my group would have supported."
"At the EU summit in Thessaloniki, the Irish Prime Minister, Mr Ahern, gave his backing to the establishment of this EU arms agency."
"I was shocked that the leader of a so-called neutral country, in which there is strong public opposition to the immoral arms trade, could give the go-ahead for such an agency."
"The decision could not have been adopted without the agreement of all the Heads of State."
"Our government clearly failed to stop this very dangerous and unacceptable decision, even though it had it within its power to do so."
"It was clear from the presidency's conclusions that one of the main objectives of this decision is to strengthen the EU arms industries and make them more competitive on the global stage."
"It beggars belief that, at a time when EU leaders are talking about reducing the threat of weapons of mass destruction and making the world a safer place, they could agree to such a strategy."
"The presidency conclusions stated that this agency, which will be subject to Council authority and open to participation by all Member States, will aim to develop defence capabilities in crisis management, promote and enhance European armaments cooperation, strengthen the European defence industrial technology base and create a competitive European defence equipment market, as well as promoting, in liaison with the Community, research activities, where appropriate, aimed at leadership in strategic technologies for future defence and security capabilities, and thereby strengthening Europe's potential in this area."
"This is heading in totally the wrong direction."
"It is clear that these decisions are geared towards the vested interests of the European arms industries and that progress and research are going to be diverted away from useful aims towards products that kill and destroy people, rather than products that make the world a better place."
"The Irish Government's failure is a national scandal and one of the worst decisions that any Irish government leader has taken since 1990, when our Minister for Finance backed increased low-interest loans to the nuclear industry."
"Another point I would like to raise during this debate is the issue of low-frequency active sonar."
"My Group tabled two amendments on this report to underline that, apart from being against the development of weapons in general, we are very much against the development of military technology, the use of which is damaging to the environment."
"We firmly believe that, as was proposed last year, a ban should be put on the use of high-frequency sonar to detect submarines, but this very advanced technology is currently being used by the navies of NATO countries and the US in European military exercises."
"There are major problems, even at the experimental phase."
"The noise of these sonars kills whales and other species of marine life because it disturbs their orientation systems."
"This is completely unacceptable."
"EU research money should be used for ecologically responsible peaceful projects, rather than for this."
"I shall finish with a comment on the EADS, which is the European Aeronautics Defence and Space Company, the second largest aerospace and defence company in the world."
"Its CEO bemoans the fact that the US already invests six times as much as Europe in armaments and research."
"Whilst research budgets in the US continue to rise, those in Europe remain stagnant."
"Why people have to criticise this is beyond me."
"This is something we should be welcoming."
". Mr President, I wish, pursuant to the Rules of Procedure, to have the opportunity to defend my honour."
"Mrs McKenna said that this report was the product of the defence or arms industry lobbies and I wish to state that, as far as I and indeed my colleagues are concerned, no lobby..."
"I would say to the rapporteur that the Presidency will give you the floor at the end of the debate."
"This is not the appropriate time for you to speak."
"I take note of your request and I will give you the floor at the end of the debate."
"Mr President, it is clear that if we want to develop credible cooperation in the field of defence in the future I will not anticipate here the form it will take, its limits or its future legal status it will be necessary for the States involved to provide each other with mutual support in the field of military equipment."
"However, the Commission's communication of 11 March 2003 on this subject is disappointing for three main reasons."
"Firstly, it deals with the issue of the arms industries essentially from the point of view of the market and competition, because it is obviously in this field that it has a degree of competence."
"This is, however, an extremely reductionist point of view, because in this area security concerns are and must remain predominant."
"Lower costs in the acquisition of equipment is an important consideration, certainly, particularly in a period of budget deficit, but it is not the only one, far from it."
"For the sake of their security, the States must remain the sole masters of their considerations."
"This has always been recognised within the meaning of Article 296 of the EC Treaty, which is retained in the same form, I would remind you, in Article 342 of the third part of the draft European Constitution."
"Secondly, the Commission communication shows an excessive tendency towards communitisation, with codecision, and also by creating a Community framework for defence equipment which would apparently centre on the Arms Agency."
"Such communitisation is in no way in the interests of cooperation in the field of defence, which requires intergovernmental relations and variable geometries, under the control of national parliaments, so that the Member States are not discouraged from participating in it."
"I am pleased, incidentally, that this Arms Agency, which is in the process of being launched, finally, on the basis of Article 17 of the EU Treaty, is of an intergovernmental nature."
"Thirdly, I have found in paragraph 6 of the report by Mr Queiró – and I congratulate him very warmly on this – a key notion, which is absent from the Commission communication, and also from the draft European Constitution, which is the notion of Community preference."
"Frankly, ladies and gentlemen, I do not understand how we can both want a European arms agency, intended in particular to promote and coordinate harmonisation of military equipment, and not at the same time commit the Member States to buying this equipment."
"This European preference must clearly remain flexible, since high-tech military equipment is not the same as agricultural products and, as I have already said, the States must retain control of their security."
"Therefore, even if this cannot be laid down in a strictly legal sense, there should at least be a statement of intention to this effect somewhere."
"I would thank Mr Queiró once again for having stated this clearly."
"Mr President, Mr Queiró's report has to some extent been overtaken by events, in that on Monday the Council took the decision to create an EU Defence Capabilities Agency."
"I wonder if this might not prove to be a contradiction in terms, as I see little evidence that many European countries have the political will to improve their defence capabilities or to provide the necessary additional financial resources for this."
"As so often in Commission communications and reports in this House, the solution that is offered to a particular problem is to extend EU competence."
"That is our fundamental objection here."
"The emphasis, as always, is on creating the institutions of an EU defence industrial policy, rather than meeting military equipment needs and industrial requirements."
"The consistent failure of many European states to spend more on defence not only undermines the transatlantic alliance, but also damages our defence industries."
"Our armed forces need the best state-of-the-art interoperable equipment for their difficult tasks."
"Defence industrial link-ups and collaborations should be with the most advantageous partners, wherever they might be."
"I am therefore very suspicious of any mention of Community preference when it comes to activities by European countries in this field."
"There are serious deficiencies in the equipment and organisation of the armed forces in many European countries."
"The argument that there is duplication of effort among individual European countries and that economies of scale, as well as improved interoperability, would inevitably follow from a more harmonised EU defence procurement system is therefore seductive."
"But where is the reassurance that this is the motivation for an EU role in defence procurement, rather than - in terms of Western solidarity - a divisive intention that lies at the heart of ESDP?"
"Given that just six countries in Europe account for more than 90% of Europe's defence industrial capabilities and 98% of all R[amp]D expenditure, it is a peculiar logic to suggest that the representatives of 15 countries - let alone of 25 - should be involved in decision-making and monitoring in this area."
"The Queiró report insists on the need for the EU to endow itself with military capabilities so as to ensure the credibility of its foreign and defence policy objectives."
"Is this not the true aim of the agency and an EU defence equipment policy, rather than the improvement of European defence industries and the development of our military capabilities?"
"Heaven forbid that the British armed forces should come to rely on obtaining their vital munitions and combat equipment needs from sources under the direction of Brussels."
"Mr President, it is true that tonight's debate comes after Monday's Council decision in favour of a European Defence Capabilities Agency but I welcome that decision, as I welcome Mr Queiró's report."
"I am pleased that the report reaffirms that NATO is the cornerstone of Europe's collective defence, recognising that 11 of our existing EU Member States - 19 in the enlarged EU from next year - are members of both bodies."
"But if we want the EU to make a serious military contribution to the Petersberg task of peacekeeping and peacemaking, the European security and defence policy needs to be underpinned by a credible ability for EU nations to conduct military operations when NATO as a whole is not engaged."
"For those who want a greater EU role in global affairs vis-à-vis the United States, it is absolutely right to state that Europe is tied to US support for every military initiative and operation."
"That is why it is important in this debate to support the creation of a European Defence Agency, an agency that should be primarily focused on developing European military capabilities and establishing a framework for measuring them."
"Importantly, in the context of tonight's debate it will also have a wider commitment to promote cost-effective procurement and competition."
"I say to the previous speaker from the British Conservatives, who sees in every action a conspiracy to increase EU competence, that it is in Britain's as well as in Europe's interests to create a truly competitive, internal defence market."
"British industry has always been one of the most competitive and open."
"There are many examples, such as the recent A 400 M contract, where simpler and clearer administrative procedures for procurement would have been welcome."
"I look forward to firms and employment in Britain, including in my region, the east of England, which is the second most defence-dependent in the United Kingdom, benefiting from this opening up of markets."
"That brings me to my final point."
"Although tonight's debate focuses on defence equipment industries and procurement, we must not forget the importance of increasing civilian capabilities for the prevention of conflict."
"The importance of trying to build a sustainable peace also requires serious action on conflict prevention and post-conflict strategy."
"I am very pleased to see progress on this aspect too and its inclusion in the Council conclusions from Monday."
"At times, it is said that when the European Union cannot create a policy it creates an agency, and this is the risk that we are facing: tackling military and defence policies from a business and competition perspective."
"If, then, we act from a European protectionist standpoint, the risk is even greater."
"The objective should be to draw up, as Europe, an innovative security and defence policy promoting stability and peace and opposing dictators: this should be our policy."
"The rapporteur mentioned the need to control the export of arms to third countries, and I am thinking in particular of dictatorships."
"This type of control is not being carried out at present in Europe: on the contrary, we are giving arms to dictators the world over."
"Another point regards civil expenditure."
"The European Union is not doing enough about this; indeed, it is doing almost nothing."
"The Commission maintains that we must not copy the United States."
"Of course, but so as not to copy the United States, it would mean seeing if we could convert our military expenditure and structures into civil expenditure and structures, which could, perhaps, complement – not compete with or be an alternative to but complement – those of the United States."
"Mr President, like my colleague, Mr Van Orden, I am not persuaded of the necessity or the efficacity of European defence."
"However, we must recognise one fact: sooner or later Joe Public in the United States is going to wake up one morning and ask why it is that 3.2 cents of every dollar he pays to Uncle Sam goes to European defence."
"It is a good question."
"If I were an elected representative in Washington I would find it hard to answer."
"It seems we are all agreed that we have to take greater responsibility for our defence, whether as independent nation states, or under the banner of Europe, or as partners in NATO - which I favour."
"Whatever the route, we will have to increase defence spending."
"If we were to continue procurement as we do now, we would have to increase tax by between 3% and 4%."
"As an elected politician, I would prefer not to have to tell that to my voters."
"It comes down to more bang for our buck."
"In order to do that we must rationalise our defence spending, as Mr Queiró's report has pointed out."
"However, we must face two realities: first, the best and biggest bang may involve buying outside the EU."
"For example, the A 400 military transport may be a worthy successor to the Hercules, with a greater capability, when it flies, but the only long-range heavy lift aircraft in Europe today are the Boeing/McDonnell Douglas C17s leased, not owned, by the Royal Air Force."
"I am sure that all the various attack helicopters have their good points, but spending money on developing four of them wholly or in part is folly."
"And the list goes on: communications equipment, next generation missiles, remotely piloted vehicles, etc."
"The Eurofighter Typhoon is a superb aircraft."
"Millions of euros have been invested by four European countries and the weapons systems built around it."
"But it is not the only European fighter on offer."
"Dassault is selling the Rafale."
"Why am I not surprised that it is the Rafale that meets the requirements of the ?"
"I am sure that it has nothing to do with supplying the many air forces of the world that have purchased Dassault Mirages with the next generation fighter, at a price that would not be so low were it not for the purchase by the French Air Force."
"We must be honest."
"We must have a proper evaluation of the role and requirements of our armed forces before we can develop a capability to meet them."
"It is only under NATO that this honesty and lack of national partiality can be achieved."
"Of course cooperation and economics go hand in hand, but we know that for our troops the equipment and the training are what count."
"Hard training makes for easy battles."
"We must give our troops the best, both in equipment and training."
"We owe them nothing less."
"I would say to the rapporteur that, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, the President can give him the floor at the end of the debate and it is given for one minute and a half, but the debate must not be re-opened, ladies and gentlemen."
". Mr President, I do not wish to reopen the debate;"
"I simply wish to respond to Mrs McKenna, who claims that this report represents a victory for the arms industry lobbies."
"The offensiveness of this claim does not deserve a response, but the slur on my good name that it represents forces me to protest."
"I have nothing, of course, against Mrs McKenna’s opinions, which are bound to differ from my own."
"What I cannot accept, however, is her insinuation that I have supposedly acted subserviently to the interests of this sector or even that I represent these interests."
"I am quite aware of what to do in the event of a conflict of interest."
"Apart from being offensive, this insinuation is false and completely inappropriate to the serious political context in which this debate has taken place."
"Mrs McKenna’s claim and the disgraceful lack of ethics that it reveals therefore reflect on the person who uttered it."
"."
"Mr President, I would like to welcome very briefly the fact that this House to a large extent, I believe, supports the Commission's communication."
"I would like to stress that the Commission's initiative in this field relates to 1996 and 1997."
"At the time it failed precisely as a result of certain arguments that I have heard once again today in this House."
"I would like to draw your attention, however, to the fact that the initiative taken by the Commission following the request from the European Parliament and the Council must be based on the Treaties as they exist at the moment."
"While it is true that we are concerned to stress the importance of an economic and industrial basis for the development of this sector at European level, it is also important to stress the responsibilities of the Commission in the field of research and, above all, that this research strategy hinges on the concept of security."
"It is not therefore a form of research hinging on the concept of defence."
"This is why the Commission is rejecting certain considerations concerning the nature of this research."
"I would like to add that even when the debate involves crisis management or conflict prevention, we must not forget that the credibility and effectiveness of crisis management action within the framework of a conflict depends to a large extent on the capacity for military support allowing crises to be managed."
"We do not live in an ideal world in which everybody would welcome humanitarian action just like that."
"No, humanitarian action, in order to be successful, requires the support of force and it is on this basis that we are in the process of creating a foreign security and defence policy."
"The Commission's initiative takes this precise approach, which is our approach, which is the European perspective and which is taken up by the Convention in the draft Constitution."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0397/2003) by Mr Lagendijk, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the Stabilisation and Association Process for South East Europe: Second Annual Report (COM(2003) 139 2003/2094(INI))."
". Mr President, I should like to clarify three points in my report."
"The first point, and probably the most politically controversial, is the final status of Kosovo."
"That is a hot potato, which everyone, including Parliament, has preferred to avoid."
"Following various discussions in the region, but also with a large number of people here, I have concluded that it is no longer an option to wait any longer, thus delaying the definition of the final status."
"If you see what problems Kosovo has now, it becomes increasingly evident that, for example, the socio-economic problems can only be solved if Kosovo’s final status becomes clear."
"After all, many investors refuse to invest in Kosovo, because it is uncertain what status that country has."
"It is also becoming increasingly clear, sadly, that a process has been started in which the international community, once hailed as a liberator, is increasingly being regarded as an occupier."
"This is very close to my heart, because I believe that the work that was done there was sound."
"This is, however, the reality in Kosovo and I think that Parliament should also base its conclusions on this."
"It is the EU’s responsibility to take the lead to ensure that within a period of – as far as I am concerned – two years, there is clarity with regard to Kosovo’s final status."
"It is quite clear to me that this will be a difficult choice."
"I also think that the European Union need not make that choice yet, but the Kosovars do need to know that a decision will be taken on their status in two years’ time."
"I therefore have a double message to give to the Kosovars: we are prepared to give you clarity about your final status in two years’ time, but you have to prove to us that you are able to manage your country in a proper manner, that is to say in a manner that embraces a decent minorities policy, including respect for the borders as they currently stand."
"If the Kosovars are able to do this, I think that we should say that in two years’ time, we are prepared to take a decision on their final status."
"I should therefore like to ask the Commissioner whether he can confirm once again what the Commission has already said in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, namely that the European Commission is pleased about – and, as such, is in agreement with – the fact that the European Union is taking the lead in drafting a roadmap, a timeframe – whatever you want to call it – as long as it becomes clear at the end of it what is going to happen with Kosovo."
"My second point is about Serbia and Montenegro."
"I think that two years ago, Mr Solana had good reasons for trying to keep those two countries together."
"That was necessary then to avoid chaos in the region."
"Two years have now passed and after trying for one year, those countries have another two years to try to see whether things work out."
"I think that now, the conclusion can, and should, be drawn that it is not working."
"Nobody, neither in Montenegro, nor in Serbia, is prepared to invest in this new federation, in these new structures."
"I think it is therefore appropriate for the European Union to say: we will no longer try to force you into something that neither of you want."
"We will adopt a neutral position."
"We will leave it up to you to decide, which also means that if we spend our money in Montenegro or Serbia, we will spend it on areas that need to be improved anyway."
"There are many of those areas, both in Montenegro and in Serbia, that need funding, irrespective of whether those countries become independent or carry on together."
"In conclusion, the final topic."
"Now that the committee has reached agreement on the above two points, the following point is now at risk of becoming the controversial point in plenary. It is about the fact that a number of countries in that region, three to be precise, have concluded a bilateral agreement with the United States to exclude American citizens from the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court in The Hague."
"It is very clear what the report states in this connection."
"We regret that Macedonia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Albania have concluded an agreement of that kind."
"In our view, this should not have happened."
"We applaud, however, the fact that Croatia has not concluded such an agreement."
"Moreover, it is laid down that ultimate EU membership of those countries at some point in the future is not compatible with such a bilateral agreement."
"Accordingly, my message to you is that you will need to discontinue those bilateral agreements in a few years’ time."
"However, does that now mean that we need to penalise Albania and Bosnia for concluding such an agreement?"
"I would specifically address Mr Swoboda in this respect."
"He has tabled an amendment by means of which, in my view, he seeks to penalise Albania and Bosnia for making that mistake in the past."
"Indeed, he wants to rule out an agreement of any kind with those countries, as long as they have this agreement with the United States."
"Mr Swoboda, I think you have made a big mistake by saying this."
"Like you, I am angry with the United States for having forced those countries into concluding such an agreement, but I do not want to penalise the Albanians and Bosnians for that reason."
"In my opinion, we should not hold a competition here in Parliament about who is the biggest fan of the International Criminal Court."
"I would remind you that the NGO coalition in favour of the Criminal Court did not ask for this either, and to be honest, I think you are asking too much."
"What should matter to us is to strike the right balance between, on the one hand, our criticism of the United States and of those agreements, and, on the other, recognition that we also want to bring those countries closer to Europe in the next couple of years."
"We will need an agreement for this."
"We must not allow them to become the victim of pressure from the United States."
". Mr President, first of all I would like to thank Mr Lagendijk for his excellent report on the annual report on the stabilisation and association process produced by the Commission in March 2003."
"The Commission and the Council need the full support and commitment of Parliament in our efforts to help these countries with their reforms and in bringing them closer to the European Union."
"Mr Lagendijk's report touches upon some of the essential issues in our current relations with the Western Balkans."
"We have taken note of all the suggestions made in the report and will consider them carefully."
"I would like to comment on some of the specific points raised in the report."
"Firstly, financial assistance."
"We are grateful for the support expressed in the Thessaloniki agenda for the Commission's proposal to increase the CARDS budget by more than EUR 200 million for the period 2004-2006, and welcome the fact that the Commission's proposal for the 2004 budget has been approved at first reading."
"We will also need to reflect carefully on financial assistance for the Western Balkans, in view of the next financial perspectives starting in 2007."
"Concerning the visa regime, the peoples of the region attach great importance to this issue."
"The Commission will hold discussions with the countries in due course, within the framework of the SAP."
"This is a long-term issue, however, and has to be put in a broader context."
"Any progress in this area is also linked to the country's ability to implement major reforms in areas such as the rule of law, combating organised crime, corruption and illegal migration, as well as improving administrative capacity, border control and the security of documents."
"As regards the Thessaloniki commitments, I believe that work is well under way on implementing our part of the commitments made in Thessaloniki."
"I am pleased to report that the framework regulation, which will provide the legal base for the European partnerships, was adopted by the Commission last week."
"These partnerships will help the countries to focus their attention on priority areas and will thus contribute to speeding up the European integration process."
"Twinning, which involves using the human resources of Member States to help the countries of the Western Balkans, is already being used."
"TAIEX, the Technical Assistance Information Exchange Office, which will help these countries harmonise their legislation with the , will be operational in the near future, and preparations to open up participation in Community programmes and agencies are ongoing."
"I am pleased to inform you that the feasibility study on the opening of negotiations for a stabilisation and association agreement with Bosnia-Herzegovina was adopted by the Commission yesterday."
"The study points to both progress and continuing weaknesses."
"Against this background, the Commission thinks that it should be able to recommend to the Member States the opening of SAA negotiations when Bosnia-Herzegovina has made sufficient progress in meeting a number of short-term priorities that are central to the implementation of such stabilisation and association agreements."
"Croatia's application is being dealt with in accordance with the usual procedures."
"We received, within the deadline, more than 10 000 pages of answers from Croatia and if all goes well we hope to finish our work on the opinion by March or April."
"We also hope that Croatia will be able to improve in areas which are, by the way, indicated in paragraph 37 of the Lagendijk report."
"I note the suggestion of a neutral stance on the relationship between Serbia and Montenegro."
"The policy of the European Union is to support the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro for the period of the three years provided by the Belgrade agreement."
"The terms of the agreement are that at the end of that period, it is up to Serbia and Montenegro whether they wish to stay together."
"The Commission has begun work on a feasibility study for Serbia and Montenegro."
"This will be a thorough objective assessment designed to determine whether the countries are ready to start negotiations for a stabilisation and association agreement."
"As things stand today, we need to see further substantial progress on key issues such as the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, cooperation and development in the Serbia and Montenegro internal market and a single trade policy, as well as political and economic reforms."
"As regards the process leading to the decision of the final status of Kosovo, let me recall that the European Union supports full implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1224 and the 'standards before status' policy."
"Like the Council, we welcome the intention of the Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General, Mr Harry Holkeri, to set out more concrete guidelines for progress, and to implement the 'standards before status' policy on the basis of a work plan to be coordinated with the European Union's monitoring of standards."
"We have taken note that the first opportunity for an overall review will be in mid-2005."
"2004 is, therefore, an important year for Kosovo's provisional institutions of self-government to consolidate a truly multi-ethnic and democratic society."
"Let me reiterate one key point."
"Whatever the final status, the people of Kosovo will have their place in Europe."
". Madam President, within the framework of the second report on the stabilisation and association process for South-East Europe, the opinion of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy supports the Commission proposal and I should like, of course, to congratulate the rapporteur."
"We believe that, within the framework of the commitments made by the Thessaloniki European Council in June 2003, launching European integration partnerships for the Western Balkans merits setting a medium-term objective based on an action plan – this is our proposal – setting out the measures and actions which need to be undertaken by the countries of the Western Balkans and the European Union."
"The action plan should contain an enhanced support for institution-building, of course, but also for infrastructure projects and regional trade and economic cooperation projects."
"In other words, priority should be given to structural and economic reforms leading to functioning market economies and sustainable development."
"The rate of integration into the European Union will obviously depend on the countries themselves."
"Nonetheless, I want to emphasise that the stabilisation and association process is the institutional framework for the course towards Europe of the Western Balkans and marks a shift in the centre of gravity from stabilisation to association with the European Union."
"– Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as was laid down in Zagreb and only very recently reconfirmed in Thessaloniki, each of the countries of South-Eastern Europe has its own individual prospect for accession."
"It follows that we are right to adopt the strategy of commencing negotiations towards a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with each country one at a time."
"It also follows, however, that preparations for accession are primarily in the hands of the governments in those countries."
"While all the countries listed in the report have problems specific to themselves, there is much that is, more or less, in equally poor shape in all of them."
"That is why they have to join with us in stepping up the fight against trafficking in human beings, which actually amounts to trafficking in women."
"They have to combat crime, arms dealing and corruption."
"Their justice systems are developed to differing degrees, ranging from the just about acceptable to the utterly inadequate."
"Education and training are key areas in which these countries also have to make progress or else have no future, as their young people will otherwise leave."
"No satisfactory solution has yet been found to the problem of refugees returning to Bosnia-Herzegovina."
"Hardly any of the Croats expelled from the are returning to it, which makes the return of Serbs to Croatia and the restoration of their property there more difficult."
"A creditable number of Serbs are returning to Croatia, but implementing the restoration of property to Croatia’s Serbs is still not progressing in a satisfactory way."
"There is, moreover, a great deal of anti-Serb sentiment in several regions, especially in the hinterland of Zadar, and this results in major problems on the ground."
"In contrast, co-existence in Eastern Slavonia around Vukovar is characterised to a much greater degree by cooperation."
"There is a good law on minorities, which community leaders must now put into practice."
"Croatia is cooperating properly with The Hague; even archive documents have been handed over to the tribunal."
"Indeed, it was in Croatia itself that three accused persons, including a General, received lengthy jail sentences."
"One accused person, General Gotovina, is on the run."
"Let us not ask for the impossible; the state has offered a reward for his capture, but so far have not managed to track him down."
"He is a member of the French Foreign Legion and holds a French passport; heaven knows where he is now."
"If the international community could not get its hands on Karadzic or Mladic despite SFOR having been present in Bosnia-Herzegovina for seven years, then we should not, in this regard, apply the wrong standard to the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina and to the Croats."
"Serbia and Montenegro have demonstrated their willingness to cooperate with The Hague."
"Things could get even better."
"They handed Milosevic over, thank God, as well as the three butchers of Vukovar, but many more are still awaiting extradition."
"It is in Serbia’s interests to be allowed to sentence some war criminals in Serbia itself."
"It would help the Serbs’ understanding of the situation if the KLA leadership were also, at last, to stand trial in The Hague for their crimes."
"There is an absolute need for improvements in the poor economic state of much of the region, and so the CARDS programme must facilitate more infrastructural measures than before, or else there will be no recovery there."
"There have been improvements in Bosnia-Herzegovina’s development at State level, but there are still many deficits."
"I would also like to take this opportunity to point out that the High Representative does not always make use of the powers he possesses."
"The metaphorical sword of Damocles hanging over Bosnia-Herzegovina would be unnecessary if the EU were – as Commissioner Vitorino has just said – to make demands that Bosnia-Herzegovina can actually meet."
"I ought also to say something about Albania, but I shall skip that; everything is in the report, and I assume that everyone has read it."
"My congratulations to Mr Lagendijk."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first to congratulate Mr Lagendijk on his report, which is, as always, a very comprehensive and balanced one. I do not, admittedly, agree with all the points he makes, but that is the way of things in politics."
"As far as Kosovo is concerned, I am right alongside him when it comes to getting a final decision on its future as soon as possible."
"Any demand for one must be addressed to Kosovo’s government rather than to the Commission, for just as the report states and as we had confirmed to us recently in discussions in Albania, I am firmly convinced that the authorities in Kosovo are not doing enough."
"I am not saying that they are doing nothing, but they are not doing enough to make it clear that Kosovo is a multi-ethnic state, one that wants to adhere to European standards."
"Commissioner Vitorino also referred to the issue of ‘standards before status’, which should be given practical expression by such things as the stipulation of more precise deadlines; it is, though, above all for the Albanian authorities in Kosovo to take the necessary action themselves."
"Whilst I personally favour independence, something has to be done to make it happen; it will not just be presented on a plate."
"Turning to Montenegro and Serbia, I do in essence take the view that nobody can force them or anyone else to stay together."
"We have to consider whether the existence of so many small states there will make the process of integrating them into the European Union any easier."
"It will not be made any easier for the states, but, if that is what they absolutely want, then that is their decision, and they have to know what its consequences will be."
"Finally, let me address a point to which Mr Lagendijk alluded in connection with one of my amendments."
"Had we been even only half as courageous, determined, and willing to implement our own decisions as the United States of America, we would have achieved more in the Balkans."
"Our problem is that we say things like ‘please’ and ‘if you would be so kind’ and ‘do something’, whereas the Americans lay down stringent conditions and say ‘yes’ or ‘no’."
"That is why I do not think we can accept the evident willingness of some states to comply with these conditions."
"As Mr Lagendijk himself mentioned, Croatia has not concluded the treaty that the United States wanted of them."
"We must state loud and clear our view that we cannot simply relegate to the background the International Criminal Court, the case for which your group put to this House with such vigour."
"If you read the amendment, you will see that I do, in any case, draw a distinction whilst sticking to the view that membership is not a practical option, but saying no more than that one ought not actually to conclude any agreement."
"That is just an opinion of this House rather than an explicit condition."
"If we get to the point where draft treaties in respect of these countries are put before us, then we will in any case have to take a decision on their individual merits."
"I do not think it right that we should retreat so far from a position of this House as made explicit in a motion, but I am still willing to accept a compromise."
"We should send the clear message that we attach great importance to this International Criminal Court especially in a region in which crimes are committed against human beings and contrary to human decency and that we ask all the states in this region not to play down the issue of war crimes and crimes against humanity, but to unambiguously affirm their political responsibility."
"Madam President, I would like firstly to congratulate Mr Lagendijk on his report on the development of the current stabilisation and association process and on the future challenges in the Balkans."
"I believe this is a full and exhaustive report which truly deals with the whole range of problems affecting this region."
"On behalf of my parliamentary group, the Liberal Group, I would like to stress the following points: we fully support the process of integration of these countries of the south east of Europe and we highlight the need to fulfil the political and economic criteria laid down by the Union."
"Furthermore, the history of these countries – and specifically what took place during the final decade of the last century – has been very important and this demands cooperation from all of them with the International Criminal Court for the Former Yugoslavia – as other speakers in this debate have stressed – and this should be demanded of all the States."
"I would like to point out, in this regard as well, that the signature of bilateral agreements with the United States clearly restricts the effectiveness of the International Criminal Court for the Former Yugoslavia, and is not in line with the European Union's approach."
"What should the European Union do in these cases?"
"Clearly, it should not accept any process of integration."
"The signature of agreements is an arguable issue and it would be good if on the basis of the discussion which has just taken place the compromise solution could be reached which would indicate that the European Union is not prepared to accept any agreement unless certain conditions are met."
"Furthermore, I would like to point out our group has presented certain amendments, suggested by a Slovenian observer Member, on Kosovo, on the responsibility of the Albanian population in Kosovo, so that it can decide on its future by means of the free exercise of the right to self-determination."
"We have also presented another amendment on the issue of fishing in the Adriatic."
"I would like to point out finally, Madam President, that the report analyses the situation of all the States and, if in any case it appears excessively critical – as we have been told by the representative of Macedonia, for example – it should not be understood as a lack of support on the part of the European Union, but as a contribution to constructive dialogue aimed at improving the situation of these countries."
"– Madam President, I would firstly like to thank Mr Lagendijk for this report and his spirit of cooperation and receptiveness to a series of suggestions made in committee."
"We agree with the ultimate objective of the report, which is to aid the democratic and economic recovery of this region and its possible integration into Europe."
"However, we believe that some of the problems have been due to the development of Europe’s own dynamic and also to the fact that at that time we lacked a coherent, constructive and democratic foreign policy and, with our support for ethnic or religious identities, we have created a problem whose consequences we are now paying for."
"All the aspects pointed out in the report are positive."
"I would like to stress the need to support cooperation with the International Criminal Court for the Former Yugoslavia, the criticism of the possibility of signing agreements with the United States, outside of the International Criminal Court, the support for the return of the refugees and displaced persons and, above all - perhaps the most important aspect – the fight against corruption, the fight against organised crime, against the trafficking in women and children, the fight against all trafficking – of drugs, of arms etc. – which is a cancer which is eating away at this region."
"We believe that we must offer effective help, that the current financial support is insufficient and that therefore we should review the financial perspectives, in order to provide more resources to assist the region in the necessary manner."
"We believe that the points made on the different countries are absolutely correct – as Mr Vallvé has said – and the European Union must therefore consider them."
"I am referring to respect for national minorities and the management of borders in Albania."
"In the case of Bosnia, it is important to build state structures and promote cooperation with the war crimes tribunals."
"In relation to Croatia, the importance of national minorities and cooperation with them should be stressed."
"In Macedonia, the Albanian National Liberation Army must be dismantled and corruption combated."
"In the case of Serbia, there must be cooperation with the international court in The Hague."
"We do not agree with the insinuation in the report of possible independence for Kosovo, because we believe that what was agreed in the United Nations resolution should be respected, making Kosovo a province of the Republic of Serbia and Montenegro, and we see the UN as an international reference body."
"– Madam President, we all bite off more than we can chew at times, and that applies to politics too; that is what both the European Union and the countries of the Western Balkans risk doing during that region’s Stabilisation and Association Process."
"Concerned internal and external Balkan experts have expressed this warning."
"According to them, the European Union is trying too hard to copy the success of the process of the ten accession countries in South-East Europe."
"By doing so, the European Union is making excessive demands of states that are not ready for this."
"The result is that the Stabilisation and Association Process is threatening to degenerate into feigned developments in the countries in question."
"A simpler, realistic approach to moving closer to Brussels would avoid mutual disappointment."
"Moreover, it would give the governments of the Western Balkans a real opportunity of scoring political successes in the direction of Europe."
"This is certainly not insignificant from an electoral viewpoint."
"Does the Commission share this opinion and is it prepared to help give this shape?"
"Allow me to be very direct and specific."
"These days, I am picking up vibes that, generally speaking, the educational level in the Western Balkan is dropping to a worrying level."
"This applies to primary, secondary and university education alike."
"I would ask the Commission whether that is true."
"If so, then here lies an opportunity for us to offer a helping hand by providing the Western Balkans with free access to European education programmes."
"In that light, Mr Lagendijk’s useful report offers ample opportunity for European self-reflection."
"Allow me to make three observations."
"First of all, in paragraph 10, does the rapporteur not turn matters on their head in connection with the present visa regime between the European Union and the so-called SAP countries?"
"It seems more logical to me to link a possible easing of the visa regime to a number of EU conditions."
"This has nothing to do with the humiliation of Balkan citizens to which the rapporteur refers."
"Interestingly enough, in paragraph 42, Mr Lagendijk urges the European Union to play a role of neutral mediator between Serbia and Montenegro."
"It is irrelevant to him what form the relationship between Belgrade and Podgornica will take at the end of it."
"As far as I know, the European Union has to date not practised such neutrality and, as far as I can see, will not attempt to do this either."
"My third observation concerns paragraphs 51 and 52."
"In paragraph 51, the rapporteur is still cautiously positive about the start of direct talks between Belgrade and Pristina, with good reason."
"Incidentally, with this, the UNMIK itself is putting the principle of standards before status under time pressure."
"That is by the by."
"Mr Lagendijk subsequently proposes an extra-fast time frame for a final solution to the thorny political issue of Kosovo."
"Within the next two years!"
"It seems to me that the Serbian-Albanian race for Kosovo is certainly not served, nor helped, by such a political march at top speed."
"Moreover, we should not overlook the direct regional effects of any actual attempt to address the Kosovo issue."
"Think of the Albanians in Macedonia and the Serbs in Bosnia."
"Political stability in the Balkans remains for the time being a precarious matter."
"Madam President, I should like first of all to congratulate my honourable friend Mr Lagendijk on his well-documented report."
"It is a balanced and detailed piece of work which covers the issue objectively and gives an overall picture of the situation in the area and in the individual countries."
"It points out the particular conditions which prevail in each and evaluates the more specific data which document the various manifestations of their cooperation with the European Union."
"Within this framework, the report – correctly in my opinion – stresses the serious importance within the priorities of the European Union of preparing the countries of South-East Europe for future integration into the European structures."
"It stresses that the progress of each country, as far as its accession is concerned, will depend on the degree to which it meets the Copenhagen criteria and the terms of the stabilisation and association process."
"In fact, irrespective of the anticipated peculiarities that characterise the countries in question, the basic principle must remain that all are dealt with and judged in the same way when weighing their virtues and their shortcomings, as regards the possibility of full integration into the European family."
"I should also like to agree with the rapporteur that the 'hot potato' in the area is the Kosovo regime, but I believe that any rushed decision or action must be avoided in order to first safeguard the necessary preconditions for smoothing out the situation, with respect for the rights of all interested parties and for the related United Nations resolutions and the principle of safeguarding the external borders of the countries in the area."
"Allow me to take this opportunity to refer to the particular subject touched on in paragraph 21 of the report and to expressly state that the European Parliament regrets the flagrantly unacceptable manner in which the recent local elections were conducted in Albania."
"Unfortunately, the sad irregularities and the blatant violation of democratic procedures and values which provoked this clear remark on the part of the rapporteur – with which my honourable friend Mrs Pack agreed on behalf of my political group – were repeated, to a more acute degree, with a plethora of clashes, acts of violence and undermining of the democratic morale of citizens and candidates in the repeat elections just three days ago."
"I want to hope that the Albanian authorities will understand the message which Parliament is sending them via the Lagendijk report and will strengthen their commitment to ensuring the smooth operation of democracy and the rule of law in their country, so that relations between Albania and the European Union and the successful completion of the stabilisation and association agreement are not adversely affected."
"Madam President, when debating the Lagendijk report, we undoubtedly note that the present situation in the Western Balkans, in the Stability Pact countries, is clearly better than it was a year ago."
"It is a serious step in the success of the policy applied in the region by the European Union which, basically, has the main responsibility for the area."
"Already, Croatia has applied to join the European Union."
"The new constitutional institutions in the FYROM and the new form of Serbia with Montenegro appear to be starting to work."
"There also appear to be signs of economic mobility."
"However, the situation is far from qualifying as stable from every side."
"None of us should entertain any false notions."
"The Stability Pact is being applied to an area which continues to be politically fragile and unstable."
"The only line of approach of our policy must be the interest of the citizens and peoples in the area."
"There can be no thought of special benefits or interests."
"Insistence on democratic procedures, human rights, regional cooperation, respect for minorities, the return of refugees, the jurisdiction of the Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in The Hague and, generally, the full application of all the UN Security Council resolutions is the only way forward."
"I should like to mention here with both regret and seriousness the unacceptable conditions in Himara – and elsewhere in Albania – during the recent local elections, when every concept of electoral procedure was violated by the official authorities, as was respect for the rights of the Greek minority."
"It would be good if the Albanian authorities helped their country to improve its democratic institutions if they want to proceed positively in the twenty-first century."
"There are some who speculate about the future of crisis areas such as Kosovo and others who hint at either the creation of a new state entity or broad autonomy which will basically be equivalent to independence."
"They must realise that the constitutional and state regime, be it in the FYROM, be it in Bosnia-Herzegovina, be it in Serbia-Montenegro, is based on fine balances, with concealed nationalisms, and that time is needed for the new institutions to stabilise and mature."
"It is positive that there is contact between Belgrade and Pristina within the framework of the UN and this must be supported."
"However, every new superficial movement will result in a new domino effect with unforeseeable consequences."
"In all the countries of the Stability Pact, there are close ethnic minorities which are the local majority and border other countries in which the corresponding ethnic groups are in the majority."
"All the states should protect their minorities living within them."
"They are also their citizens."
"All the state borders should remain stable."
"Care must be taken not to expound theories which lead to concepts such as city-states, or may even go as far as state-neighbourhoods or state-families."
"We must prevent the mobilisation of forces by neighbouring countries to protect national minorities inadequately protected by the countries of which they are citizens."
"We must insist on 'peace, democracy, security, cooperation, stability' and the only message to all the countries is that the European Union is waiting for them, they just have to speed up their efforts."
"And now, a comment outside my speech."
"There is a technical issue. On certain sides, the official name of the FYROM is not used correctly."
"It would be good if the texts were corrected as usual."
"Madam President, I am very displeased to see that in this resolution, cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia - ICTY - is one of the conditions for further Western Balkan engagement with the EU."
"That condition must be in respect of progress on association agreements rather than financial assistance."
"I will join my Socialist colleagues in voting for that change tomorrow."
"It has emerged from repeated meetings between the European Council and the ICTY Chief Prosecutor, Carla Del Ponte, that this cooperation is still not occurring, which is seriously jeopardising future integration."
"She has said that even the most basic cooperation, such as access to documents and witnesses, as well as arrests and the transfer of fugitives, is still not satisfactory."
"A large number of indicted war criminals are still at large in Serbia-Montenegro, including Ratko Mladic, who was responsible for killing 7 000 people in the genocide at Srebrenica."
"Of particular concern is the case of Croatia."
"I join others in welcoming Croatia's European aspirations."
"However, requests for cooperation from the tribunal are taking up to a year to process, which is totally unacceptable."
"For example, there is the matter of General Ante Gotovina, ICTY's third most wanted man, who was responsible for arranging the killing of at least 150 Serb civilians and the expulsion of 150 000 others in 1995."
"Miss Del Ponte has outlined information that he is still in Croatia, with reports that he is being sheltered by people working for the Croatian authorities."
"He is reported as: 'enjoying his summer holiday, sailing on a yacht'."
"Until further moves are made towards Gotovina's arrest, Croatia is still not fully complying with UNSC Resolution 1503."
"There can be no serious moves towards EU accession until this essential step is taken."
"Thank you, Mr Howitt."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at noon."
"The next item is the report (A5-0390/2003) by Mr Swoboda, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Foreign and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council Regulation amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1080/2000 of 22 May 2000 on support for the United Nations Interim Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and the Office of the High Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina (OHR) (COM(2003) 389 – C5-0325/2003 – 2003/0142(CNS))."
". Madam President, the European Union has assumed a leading role within the Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe."
"This Pact has proved a valuable framework that complements European Union policy towards the region as it endeavours to support the countries in that region in their efforts to foster peace, democracy, respect for human rights and economic prosperity, and also to achieve stability in the region as a whole."
"The proposal being examined by Parliament today, under which the Stability Pact would be included in the scope of Council Regulation (EC) No 1080/2000, will provide the Pact with a sound and solid basis on which to fulfil the crucial mandate given by the international community."
"The Stability Pact is specifically designed to further foster regional cooperation, as was underlined by the Thessaloniki Agenda endorsed on 20 June 2003 by the European Council."
"It will thereby complement the stabilisation and association process engaged with the Western Balkans."
"The Commission therefore welcomes the positive opinion on the proposal and hopes that Parliament will share the objective of having this new financial framework fully applicable as of 1 January 2004."
"The Commission regards Amendment 1 to Article 1(2) as superfluous, since the principle of cost-sharing by Member States is implicitly contained in Article 2(2) of the regulation, and given that budget line 19 07 04 is an integral part of the budgetary discussion."
"With reference to Amendment 2 to Article 1a, as well as Amendments 4 and 6, the Commission can support the proposal that the appointment of the special coordinator of the Stability Pact be renewed on an annual basis."
"The Commission also agrees with the wider objective of closely associating Parliament in following the work of the Stability Pact."
"Nevertheless, and bearing in mind the need to keep the appointment procedure as straightforward as possible, the Commission cannot accept Parliament's proposal, in Amendment 2 to Article 1a, to include formal consultation of the relevant European Parliament committee."
"Neither can it accept the insertion, in the form of a new Article 1b proposed by Amendments 3, 5 and 7, of a hearing before the committee."
"However, the Commission agrees with Amendments 4 and 6, with regard to ensuring that Parliament is informed of the appointment proposal."
"The Commission is happy, although it is not possible to include it in the new regulation, to make the commitment before Parliament to arrange for an association with Parliament in practice."
"In particular, the Commission will, well in advance of the appointment decision, inform Parliament, via the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, of its appointment proposal."
"The appointed special coordinator will appear before the Committee on Foreign Affairs as necessary, and at least twice at year, to report on its activities."
"The Commission would be grateful if Parliament could adopt a positive opinion during the present part-session, since it is eager to embark on the implementation stage immediately after the new regulation enters into force, in order to provide the special coordinator of the Stability Pact with the timely support that will allow him to fulfil his mandate in 2004."
"On behalf of the Commission I wish to express special thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Swoboda, for the quality of his preparatory work and the very good relations he has maintained with the Commission."
"– Madam President, I am obliged to the Commissioner for his statement."
"Whilst we are, of course, convinced that our amendments are absolutely right and proper, what the Commissioner has said does at least, in terms of its content and of what is meant by it, go in the direction we want, that Parliament should be capable – albeit informally – of changing its mind about the appointment of the special coordinator of the Stability Pact."
"This statement by the Commission makes that clear."
"I would ask you, Commissioner, to thank the services, especially Mr Priebe, for the very good cooperation that we have had in this matter."
"I would also like to state that, whatever our concerns may have been, a desire to make life difficult for Dr Busek in his capacity as the special coordinator has not been one of them."
"I take the view that Dr Busek is one of our most outstanding co-workers in the broader sense of the word, who is committed to the region and knows what is going on in it."
"You can be sure that, if he were again to be nominated, he would certainly receive this House’s full support."
"If someone else is nominated, then we will of course give the matter due consideration and state our opinion."
"I wish to accept the proposal that the Commission has made, and I will, tomorrow, be recommending to the House that we proceed to a full vote."
"Then you, Commissioner, and the Commission would be able to do what you want to do and get things up and running with effect from 1 January."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Swoboda’s report on the Stability Pactfor South-East Europe has two essential objectives, one being to make the Stability Pact more stable, and the other to take Parliament’s views into account and involve it in the process of appointing the special coordinator."
"On this I am in full agreement with Mr Swoboda."
"Hitherto, the Coordinator has been appointed for only six months at a time, but now he is to hold office for a year."
"We regard this as progress."
"Parliament’s involvement in the appointment process as a budgetary and political authority is also to be welcomed."
"It would be desirable if this process of appointing the coordinator of the Stability Pact each year were to be a speedy one, and what the Commissioner has said leads me to believe that there is the will to make it so."
"In every instance, the parliamentary dimension must be built up, and in saying that I am referring not only to the European Parliament, but also and especially to the regional parliaments in the countries to which the Stability Pact applies."
"We can never do enough to involve members of the regional parliaments in the important work of stabilising the Western Balkans."
"The Stability Pact and its present coordinator Erhard Busek have already had a great effect – something that has been noted with appreciation, and rightly so – on both trade and investment, or in the use of several infrastructural measures to combat crime."
"Much, though, remains to be done, and I believe that the Swoboda report, to the content of which we will be giving our full support tomorrow, will make an important contribution to this."
"Thank you, Mrs Stenzel."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at noon."
"The next item is the report (A5-0398/2003) by Mr Coelho, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, with a proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on the second-generation Schengen information system (SIS II) [2003/2180(INI)]."
". Madam President, Commissioner Vitorino, ladies and gentlemen, in 1990 the Schengen Agreement was signed and the need was acknowledged to step up controls in order to prevent threats to our citizens’ security, such as organised crime, terrorism, trafficking in human beings and drugs and illegal immigration, amongst others, from entering the Community."
"Applying the principle of free movement and abolishing controls at national borders has heightened the importance of controls at our external borders."
"We know that free movement within the territory of the Schengen States is a freedom that in return requires not only a strengthening of our external borders but also a rapid and efficient exchange of information under border controls and police cooperation."
"In this context, the Schengen Information System (SIS) has played quite an important role, which we are attempting to extend even further by creating a second generation of the SIS that has been designed for SIS II."
"The SIS operates as an information system that enables the competent authorities in the Member States to investigate and receive alerts on persons and on objects."
"The system currently operates in thirteen Member States and in two other States - Iceland and Norway - and it is hoped that it will soon become partially operational in the United Kingdom and in Ireland."
"The SIS is the largest database in Europe and has a dual function: it contributes to maintaining public order and security and to immigration, by supporting the measures intended to compensate for the free movement of persons."
"The proposals presented to us for the creation of SIS II are intended to extend the system’s capacity and to introduce new technical and research possibilities, taking advantage of the most up-to-date developments in the field of information technology."
"The Council’s plan is that the system should be up and running in 2006."
"This new system is being created in order to address three major issues."
"Firstly, enlargement, so as to be able to integrate the new Member States, which will require the capacity to integrate more users, more Member States, and also new categories of users."
"There is already agreement in Council on allowing new authorities to access SIS, but it is not yet known what these authorities will be."
"The second development is that the current system has functions covering two categories of information (persons and objects). The intention is not only to increase the number of data categories that will be included, that is, new objects and functions, but also to increase the capacity to process this information, to interlink alerts, to modify the duration of the alerts, and to store and transfer biometric data, especially photographs and fingerprints."
"The Council has taken no decision on what new categories of objects or persons will be included."
"The third and last issue – that of economy – is that, despite having more functions and more users, the system must be more homogeneous, more flexible, more secure and perform better. It must also be manageable and cost-effective."
"We are, therefore, right to consider that we are no longer talking only about a limited measure of compensation, introduced to facilitate the free movement of persons, as set out in the Schengen Convention, in Articles 92 and 102 to be specific."
"Indeed, a document issued by the Presidency in February 2002 even suggested that the SIS could be used for the purpose of police information in the broadest sense."
"The nature of the SIS consequently underwent a metamorphosis, albeit an imperceptible one; the issue of precisely what the SIS’s objective is to be in future or how this ‘broadest sense’ referred to by the Presidency can be defined remains open."
"In my opinion, only when the question about the definition of the objectives of the SIS is answered in a clear and politically acceptable way can the debate on issues such as new functions or new users be properly answered."
"Consequently, discussions are ongoing on proposals for the introduction of new functions, new users, a new architecture, new synergies, in particular with the visa information system, and new management."
"Discussions are still taking place on the location, too. These amendments, which we hope will be accepted, obviously have repercussions for data protection and for the protection of citizens’ fundamental rights."
"We reiterate that any decision taken must always be accompanied by the highest data protection standards, specifically the requirements stipulated by Article 118 of the Schengen Convention, in a constant attempt to achieve the right balance between security and freedom."
"I hope that this report will help to make the debate on SIS II more transparent, to accentuate the need for Parliament to monitor the process, to emphasise the need for its management to be supervised by Community bodies and to ensure that greater effectiveness always goes hand in hand with the desirable and necessary reinforcement of the issues of data protection and of safeguarding citizens’ rights."
". – Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to thank Mr Coelho for his report, which clearly highlights the fundamental challenges presented by the second generation of the Schengen Information System, known as SIS II, and I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate him personally on the initiative that he put forward for the hearing on 6 October in the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on this matter, because this hearing directly reflects his concern to give the citizens detailed and clear explanations of the usefulness of the work that has been undertaken on the Schengen Information System, with which the Commission fully agrees."
"I should like to reiterate the fact that the Schengen Information System is a key instrument for the principle of abolishing internal border controls and that, naturally, its development and day-to-day running must take place with scrupulous regard for the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals."
"As to the issue that the rapporteur raised, concerning the nature of the Schengen Information System, I should like to recall that, since the very beginning, police authorities have been authorised users of the System, in particular in the context of their monitoring activities within EU territory."
"The Schengen Information System must now, however, be set in a different context – the context in which it came into existence."
"Initially, the system was designed as a measure of compensation for the abolition of internal borders, set in a clearly intergovernmental framework."
"Since the Schengen was integrated into the European Union, the Schengen Information System has been central to the area of freedom, security and justice."
"The acceptance of the United Kingdom and Ireland’s partial participation in the Schengen system without these countries abolishing controls at their borders confirms this development."
"The Spanish initiatives to extend the functions of the existing system and which provide for Europol and Eurojust having access to some of the system’s data – I stress, to some of the system’s data - also form part of this development."
"As regards SIS II, the Council has to date confined itself to accepting its existing functions and to providing broad guidelines on new functions."
"The debate on precisely what new functions of the system will be implemented in order to enhance its effectiveness and whether these will further alter the nature of the existing system is still to take place."
"I therefore welcome the fact that Parliament wishes to play an active role in this crucial debate, which must be as transparent and wide-ranging as possible."
"As you all know, the Commission was given the mandate to develop SIS II, but the current Schengen Information System, known as SIS I+, is managed by France, under the terms of Article°92 of the Schengen Convention, and does not, therefore, fall within the sphere of the Commission’s competence."
"Mr Coelho’s report on SIS II is based on the Commission’s work to develop this new generation, and the Commission has given a commitment to adopt, in the near future, a new communication to Parliament and the Council detailing the state of the work on developing SIS II in the first quarter of 2003, as well as the important issue the rapporteur highlighted, concerning the technical synergies that will be possible with the future visa information system, known as ‘VIS’."
"To give you a brief overview of the work that has been undertaken, I should like to remind you that the results of the feasibility study conducted by the Commission were immediately conveyed to Parliament, in the Spring of 2003."
"Currently, the project to develop SIS II is at the stage of publishing the call for tender."
"The Commission services have spent the last few months drawing up the specifications for this tender in close cooperation with the Member States and have kept the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs informed on a regular basis."
"In his report, Mr Coelho highlights the fundamental challenges in terms of data protection and the importance of involving the authorities responsible for data protection in the development of SIS II."
"The Commission is fully aware of these challenges, both as regards the system’s development, and concerning the preparation of its legal base."
"This legal base will include rules on data protection that will also cover access by private individuals."
"The Commission is also holding regular and intensive meetings with the Joint Supervisory Authority, and has included specifications on data protection in the tender."
"Finally, Mr Coelho’s report refers specifically to the need to harmonise the principles of data protection."
"Although this call for harmonisation goes beyond the issue of SIS II, the Commission intends, in the course of next year, 2004, to propose a legal instrument on rules for the protection of personal data under the third pillar."
"I therefore wish, once again, to emphasise the importance the Commission attaches to Parliament’s full involvement in the debates that will take place, which I hope will be as transparent as possible, and to which this report will certainly make a decisive contribution. I hope that this report wins the support of this House,"
"( We have heard, both from the rapporteur and the Commissioner, that we are dealing with a Schengen Information System which is of a decidedly new generation that is very different from the first and which therefore has a new and different significance for the European citizens and a new and different responsibility towards them."
"SIS I was set up as a compensatory measure to allow free movement of people, but, in recent years, it has started to be seen more as an instrument, which is also useful in terms of police cooperation."
"The data from SIS II and SIS I can, in other words, now become a useful resource for purposes other than those initially intended."
"Furthermore, the enlargement of the European Union means that it is necessary to develop a second generation information system by 2006."
"Consequently, the Council framework decision on the European arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between Member States also provides for recourse to the SIS and, therefore, for the need for it to be updated in due time."
"On the basis of all this, it is necessary for the Council to promote a public debate on the nature of SIS and on the political objectives to be achieved with SIS II to ensure that the development of this system takes place in a transparent and democratic way."
"An assessment will, of course, be made on respect for fundamental rights, and it will therefore be necessary to entrust the strategic management of this and other information systems to an extremely reliable European agency: an agency run by an administrative board composed of representatives of the European institutions and the Member States; an agency that is, moreover, financed by the European Union budget and, therefore, subject to Parliament’s control."
"A swift decision is therefore needed by the SIS centre on the location, if possible the definitive location."
"In addition to this, a study needs to be carried out on the possibility of amalgamating the various databases that exist today or will be launched in the coming months and years – the SIS banks, Europol, VIS, Eurojust and so on – on the basis of a single technical platform, in order to create a comprehensive, integrated information system across the European Union."
"To this end, a great deal of attention needs to be paid to the potential implications of a system of this kind for privacy, human rights and the risks involved in including biometric data."
"Citizens should, therefore, be well informed so that nasty surprises are avoided."
"I would like to conclude with a point which could seem somewhat out of place, relating to the immigration emergency."
"Everyone can see that the illegal entry of immigrants into the Union’s area of free movement calls precisely for SIS II to carry out an unexpected role: a role of managing data and security that was not conceivable when the first generation Schengen Information System was launched."
"Madam President, the proposal for a recommendation to the Council on the second generation of the SIS gives us the opportunity to express significant concerns about developments in the Schengen Information System."
"The SIS was originally set up as a compensatory measure to allow for the free movement of persons."
"It is, however, gradually becoming an instrument of police cooperation, because the Council is seeking progressively to confer new functions on it and to allow various authorities to access its database."
"As the Schengen Joint Supervisory Authority states, the proposals to develop the SIS and the creation of SIS II constitute a sea-change in the nature of the system itself: whereas the SIS only alerts the relevant authorities in the event that an individual, whose details are on file, crosses the Schengen border, SIS II will probably become a multifunctional research tool."
"This would represent a shift from an approach of reactive security to an approach of active security."
"The prospect of a new system that would enable the authorities to share information on millions of individuals for different purposes, probably using the most advanced technologies including biometric data analysis, forces us to consider the impact that this new system could have on citizens’ rights, freedoms and guarantees. In particular, the right to the protection of personal data recently confirmed in Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and integrated into the draft European Constitution drawn up by the Convention."
"It is true that the need to improve cooperation in the fields of justice and home affairs and, in particular, the linking and cross-referencing of information between different databases is one of the objectives of the European Union that the Member States are obliged to pursue."
"We all understand the need for efficient information systems that are capable of meeting the challenges laid down for us by international terrorism and by cross-border crime, but this action must never endanger the fundamental principles on which the Union is founded as a Community ruled by law."
"The balance between privacy and security must not be altered by adopting information and communication technologies that have been created by governments as a response to the increased risks posed by new and dangerous criminal phenomena."
"When the available technologies constitute a threat to the integrity of personal information that should be protected, we are obliged to adopt appropriate legislation that provides for any potential abuse."
"The report by Mr Coelho, and I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate him, contains a set of proposals that move broadly in the right direction: the need for a genuine public debate on the objectives of SIS II; the need to develop SIS II in a democratic and transparent way, enabling the citizens to access more information about the system and giving people whose personal data are kept on the system to access and correct this data; merging the various existing databases, which will enable us to create a coherent and comprehensive data protection system, which will enable detailed analysis; new authorisations for granting access to the SIS to new authorities; the creation of a European Agency for the Strategic Management of the SIS, monitored and subject to control by the European Parliament."
"Madam President, this report and this debate in Parliament are, from a political point of view, quite meaningless."
"What we have here is a non-binding recommendation in an area outside Parliament’s competence."
"This lack of real significance is in sharp contrast, however, to the importance of the underlying subject."
"The subject is frighteningly important."
"It has to do with nothing less than national, supranational and international police authorities’ uncontrolled use of the information and monitoring systems forming part of what is termed the second generation Schengen Information System, known as SIS II."
"I am able to say that George Orwell’s nightmare visions of Big Brother pale in comparison with this state of affairs."
"The systems are to a large extent secret, particularly for those implicated."
"Evermore extended use is being made, officially and unofficially, of the information collected."
"In reality, there is no democratic, parliamentary and judicial control."
"The original rationale behind the Schengen Information System, or what was known as SIS I – namely nothing more nor less than the securing of border controls – has long since been replaced by an ambition to collect police information in the broad sense of the term."
"Involving more and more information on more and more subjects, the Schengen Information System, or SIS, and, for that matter, Sirene are outside the domain of the law and not subject to controls."
"I am unfamiliar with my fellow MEP’s, Mr Coelho’s, background and motives."
"I have no reason to doubt his concerns."
"What I contest is the realism and usefulness of the proposals."
"I am more in agreement with the premises of the minority statement which, in my purely personal opinion, should have emphasised still more strongly that we are not concerned here with the mere dangers of misuse and of a legal vacuum."
"The misuse of such a legal vacuum is an almost inevitable consequence of the police state factors that are already present and that have been approved."
"Commissioner Vitorino, I could, perhaps, as usual, raise the issue of the fact that these developments regarding SIS are happening without common rules on data protection."
"There is, therefore, a gradual shift from compensatory instrument for free movement to an instrument for police cooperation."
"Instead, I will use my speaking time to simply ask you for a Christmas present: for you to bring us, by Christmas, a nice chart including an exhaustive list of the data that has been handled and the way in which it has been handled within all of these data bases, the categories of data, the legal basis, the method of handling each type of data, the rights of the individual to access and correct data regarding them and abuses concerning them, and the method used for each type of data for transfer outside the European Union."
"Commissioner, I do not know if I am particularly inattentive or incompetent on this subject, but I have not yet succeeded in finding a source, a document, which indicates what data has been transferred, how, where and according to what rules."
"When we have this document, we will all, at last, know what we are talking about."
"Madam President, we have a double reason to refuse this recommendation on the second generation Schengen information system."
"We refuse to approve this electronic database for personal information, a system which the author wishes to update, since it is a tool of police repression, and we reject even more the policy which this tool is intended to serve."
"The States for whom the fight against terrorism serves as a universal justification want this database to receive supplementary data and to be combined with the system managing visas."
"The ability to consult it would be extended to judicial authorities which have not so far had access to it."
"This tool of repression is drawn up personally against migrant workers, preventing them from coming to the European Union while at the same time threatening the freedom of everybody."
"To spend millions of euros on sophisticated surveillance equipment and on a system for sharing information on people who crossed a border which was open to them and which is now being slammed in their faces is scandalous."
"This is the way to create and perpetuate the dramatic situations in which unscrupulous smugglers prosper."
"We are opposed to the policy of a fortress Europe, surrounded by barbed wire, whether electronic or simply legal."
"This is a retrograde, reactionary and inhuman policy."
"The destiny of the peoples of the south of the European Union has forever been linked to that of the people of the other side of the Mediterranean, from Morocco to Egypt."
"The populations of the new member countries of the east of Europe have thousands of links with the populations of the countries of the ex-Soviet Union."
"To restrict the freedom of movement between the European Union and the neighbouring countries is a cruel blow against these people."
"We reject it and we will vote against."
"– Madam President, if one considers the SIS in the light of history, it represents Europe’s further development of Germany’s racist Central Register of Foreign Nationals, which has for years listed every foreigner living in Germany, and if we are to talk, in this House today, in terms of freedom, then the state is free to examine its human material and to sort it into categories, and at the same time has the task of doing so."
"To an overwhelming extent, most of the personal data stored in the present-day SIS relates to people who have been refused entry into the EU."
"The development of a second-generation SIS is not just, though, about building up its storage capacity and fortifying the new borders in the East; what is even worse is that its operations are being extended by the introduction of new database categories and search options, the aim being to facilitate the use of SIS II for manhunts."
"This amounts to a fundamental change in the database’s character."
"What was a racist index of persons barred from entering the EU is becoming a powerful instrument in the hands of the state’s apparatus of repression, enabling it to track people down."
"This SIS is the first satellite in Europe’s ‘star wars’ programme to monitor immigration; we can reject it and, for that reason, we must."
". Madam President, I have the greatest respect for those who are critical of the Schengen Information System."
"To be honest, however, I do not think that demonising the Schengen Information System is the best strategy, but everyone is responsible for his or her own political positions."
"What I would say to you quite clearly is that the Schengen Information System is essentially a system for managing the European Union’s external border and that this is a prerequisite for safeguarding freedom of movement within the European area."
"Consequently, if we wish to continue to guarantee the principle of abolishing our internal borders, we must be able to assume our responsibilities by better monitoring the external borders."
"This issue does not only concern entering and leaving European Union territory; it also concerns guaranteeing security within the EU."
"The political option that I wish to reiterate here is of a different nature."
"I believe that the crucial issue facing us consists of recognising the advantages of the Schengen Information System."
"I have a Christmas present for Mr Cappato, but this is not it."
"I have something else to give, but [let us wait for Christmas], because this would be a less exciting present."
"No, it is something else."
"On the issue that Mr Cappato raised, I wish to say two things: first of all, there are no plans for any form of transfer of data from the Schengen Information System to third countries."
"Access to the Schengen database is reserved exclusively for the Member States of the European Union."
"As regards the type of data to be included in the system, I believe I answered this point in my speech when I said that the debate on what specific data is to be included in the system is yet to take place."
"We conducted a feasibility study, which we forwarded to the European Parliament, identifying the requests made to us by Member States."
"The proper identification of this data has not yet taken place and the Commission is currently preparing a communication that it will publish by the end of the year, in which we will make an assessment of the state of the current debate."
"I understand people’s doubts and fears, but I do wish to say one thing: there is a considerable difference between the fact that I, as Commissioner, am talking to you here about the Schengen Information System II and the fact that, in relation to the first system, there was no Commissioner to give an answer here, about what was being done."
"Therein lies the difference between the first and the second Schengen Information Systems and this difference has only been possible precisely because the system has been integrated into the entire Community , with the support of this Parliament on which, incidentally, I hope I will be able to count for a favourable vote on Mr Coelho’s report."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at noon."
"The next item is the Commission statement on the EU-Canada Summit which will take place in Ottawa on 17 December 2003."
". Madam President, the next summit meeting between the European Union and Canada was scheduled to take place on 17 December 2003 in Ottawa."
"The timing of the summit has now been called into doubt."
"The Commission understands that the presidency has difficulties with the date proposed."
"The Commission attaches very great importance to this summit with Canada and is ready to do anything it can to ensure that it takes place."
"Since this difficulty has arisen, Prime Minister Jean Chrétien has announced his intention to step down from office on 12 December."
"It therefore seems unlikely that the date of 17 December can be maintained."
"However, the Commission remains hopeful that a solution can be found so that our final summit meeting with Prime Minister Chrétien can indeed take place before his retirement."
"We have put a lot of work into preparing for this summit, which will be the last hosted by Prime Minister Chrétien, a long-standing true friend of Europe."
"We intend to use this occasion to demonstrate the strong ties that bind the European Union and Canada, and to signal our common intention to strengthen those ties still further in the coming months and years."
"In this context the Commission welcomes the statement issued by the Chairman of the Canada-Europe Parliamentary Association, on the occasion of the recent EU-Canada interparliamentary meeting in Ottawa."
"The Commission was gratified to note the great degree of consensus between the chairman's statement, the recent conclusions of the Council of Ministers and the Commission's own communication of May 2003 on EU-Canada relations."
"As the chairman's statement observed, the EU and Canada agreed at last year's Ottawa Summit, to undertake a comprehensive review of the bilateral relationship during 2003 and to report back to the December summit this year."
"The Commission is working hard, alongside the presidency and with our Canadian counterparts, to finalise a joint report to go to the summit."
"This report will take up many of the themes developed by the Commission, Council and Parliament in their contributions to the review."
"A driving force behind the review is the changing nature of the EU-Canada relationship."
"Given the changing nature of the European Union itself, Canada was the first industrialised third country to enter into a formal relationship with the European Economic Community in 1976."
"As a result, the EU-Canada relationship has tended to focus on trade and economic issues."
"However, Canada and the EU's common interests extend far beyond the commercial arena."
"We share similar social models and global interests."
"Canada, like the European Union, is a staunch advocate of the United Nations, the multilateral system and the international rule of law."
"By way of example, Canada voted with the European Union 96% of the time during the current UN General Assembly, on those occasions when the European Union had a common position."
"We want to find ways of working together more systematically in the field of security and foreign policy so that we can be more effective in carrying forward those policies where our objectives coincide."
"We also want to improve our dialogue in other policy areas where we often share common values and face similar challenges."
"These areas include education and culture, the environment and justice and home affairs."
"We have also maintained our focus on the very important economic relationship that exists between Canada and the European Union."
"The EU is Canada's second most important trading partner after the United States."
"We are the second source of foreign investment in Canada."
"In parallel with our comprehensive review of all aspects of EU-Canada relations, we have also been developing the framework for a new type of bilateral trade and investment agreement, with the aim of facilitating trade and investment flows between the EU and Canada."
"Commissioner Lamy and the Canadian Trade Minister, Mr Pettigrew, will report to the December summit on the results of their analysis into the potential scope of such an agreement."
"We expect talks to begin immediately in 2004."
"The European Commission believes that an intensified dialogue between European and Canadian parliamentarians is essential to maintain the good health of our relationship."
"The Commission is grateful for the work of Parliament's Canada delegation and hopes that other Members and committees, working on specific policy areas, will also give consideration to increasing contact with their Canadian counterparts."
"The relationship between the EU and Canada is very healthy."
"The European Commission is resolved to do all it can to keep it that way."
"We want the summit to lift this relationship to a new plateau, at a challenging time for the international community and in preparation for major changes taking place in Canada and within the European Union in the coming month."
"– Madam President, Commissioner Vitorino was right to refer to the very special relationship we have with Canada, which is in the process of being raised to a higher level."
"You mentioned, Commissioner, that our models of society are identical or very similar."
"It is indeed the case that Canada is a large country endeavouring not only to permit but also to promote cultural diversity within itself, and so certain analogies with the situation in the European Union present themselves, since our structure differs from, say, the United States of America."
"Cultural diversity is present in our European Union too, a diversity that will become even more marked following the accession of new countries next year."
"You also mentioned, Commissioner, that we have the same global interests, and this goes hand in hand with the other aspect you mentioned, our shared social model."
"Our global interests are in the field of foreign and security policy."
"Particularly after 11 September, we have to engage in a global cultural dialogue, for a clash of civilizations, a will get us nowhere."
"In the final analysis, international terrorism cannot be fought by military means."
"This leads me to mention another aspect, which is that although Canada, that great country, is in North America, it is one in which French is spoken."
"Intercultural dialogue, especially between the United States of America and the Islamic world, grinds to a halt if it is conducted only in English."
"I think there is great potential if France joins Canada in promoting such dialogue."
"Canada can be a mediator between the USA and the Islamic world."
"Not least is this in the interests of our most important partner, the United States of America."
"Let me conclude by adding that I believe that our relationship with Canada functions as a model."
"Now that the Iron Curtain has ceased to be, we are quite right to work towards a balanced relationship with Central and Eastern Europe and also with those Eastern European countries that will very probably never belong to the European Union, especially with Russia."
"We must never forget, though, that we must continue to look westwards; not only to the USA, but to our great ally Canada."
"Together with Canada, we must work towards global equilibrium in a multipolar world, and I believe that a productive relationship with Canada in this process is something the significance of which cannot be overestimated."
"Madam President, it is interesting that we are discussing EU-Canada relations on the same day as Mr George Bush is visiting the United Kingdom and trumpeting the so-called special relationship between the United Kingdom and the United States of America."
"In the corner of the UK that I come from, the special relationship is not with the United States of America but with Canada."
"There are very few Scottish families that do not have a relative, however distant, living in Canada."
"So the ties that bind Scotland and Canada are much stronger, I would argue, than the ties that bind the United Kingdom and the United States of America."
"That is also true for other parts of the European Union."
"As Mr Schröder, rightly says, the French have a natural affinity to Canada, the Irish also, and when with enlargement on the horizon, the Poles and the Baltic States too have many relatives and many connections with Canada."
"So the EU's relationship with Canada is extremely important and we should do everything possible to nurture it."
"It was therefore with some sadness I heard the Commissioner inform us tonight that the summit looks like it could be cancelled."
"I know from my contacts with Canadians that Prime Minister Chrétien, a very good friend of Europe, believed that holding this EU-Canada summit would be one of the crowing points of his final few weeks in office."
"It would be a slap in the face to a good friend of Europe if this summit does not go ahead in some shape or form."
"It does not matter to him, to me, or to the Commission whether that summit is held in Europe or whether it is held in Canada."
"The important thing is that it happens before 12 December."
"Canada is important for a variety of reasons and I shall be telegraphic in saying this because Mr Vitorino and Mr Schröder have already outlined some of those."
"The links that we have are important for cultural and historical reasons."
"I was hoping that the summit would nurture further exchanges between young people so that we can retain those existing links and build upon them for the future."
"The EU and Canada are natural partners on the world stage."
"We both value, in a way that some other countries do not, the multilateral institutions of the world and we value the international rule of law."
"Much is to be gained by working with our Canadian partners on issues as diverse as the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol, the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice, and the Doha trade negotiations."
"Again, as the Commissioner rightly outlined, our economic and trade relations are good."
"Importantly, they are good in a two-way sense: it is not a one-way trading relationship."
"Canada's willingness to reach an agreement on trade in wine and spirits demonstrates the goodwill that characterises our relationship with the Canadians."
"Finally, on justice and home affairs, we have a common approach to issues as diverse as terrorism, migration, asylum and border controls, as well as issues of the integration of migrants."
"I hope - and I address this to Commissioner Vitorino - that we can find a solution to Canada's desire to have a longer visa period for Canadian citizens visiting the EU."
"In conclusion, I share the Commission's view about the EU's relationship with Canada."
"I hope that this House will join with the European Commission in stressing to the Council the importance of the summit going ahead in some shape or form."
"Madam President, I share the views expressed by my colleague, Mr Martin."
"We would be forgiven for thinking over these last months that Europe has only one transatlantic relationship, so often do we use that term to describe the link between our Union and the United States of America."
"The Canadian Prime Minister, Pierre Trudeau, once said that living next to America was like 'sleeping with an elephant'."
"Even its smallest movements were likely to keep you awake at night."
"Europe's own sensitivity to the movements of the current American elephant can all too easily overshadow our relations with its northern neighbour."
"The EU-Canada summit is a chance to renew this relationship."
"The European Union and Canada have a long history of productive cooperation to build on."
"We share the same views on the best strategy for defeating international terrorism and international organised crime."
"We are common supporters of NATO, the UN and the ICC."
"We share a strong commitment to Third World development assistance and environmental protection."
"Both the EU and Canada have ratified the Kyoto protocols, and led the call for others to do so."
"The Ottawa Land Mines Convention expresses our joint abhorrence of these weapons and our determination to act."
"There was a time when Canada sought actively bilateral trading links with Europe as a way of reducing its dependence on trade with the United States."
"It would be facile to see NAFTA as Canada's surrender to economic destiny."
"Canadians continue to invest significantly in Europe: almost EUR 65 billion last year."
"In return, we provide over a quarter of foreign investment in Canada."
"We take almost 20% of Canada's service-related exports."
"The Commission's strategy document dwells rightly on the good will which exists between us, but identifies rightly that very little positive action flows from it."
"We must deliver such action."
"High level meetings between Canada and the EU have too often lacked clear objectives."
"This summit should re-launch our relations on much more proactive terms."
"The presidency has recognised this, in making the negotiation of an ambitious new accord one of the priorities of its tenure."
"For this reason, it is extraordinary that the President-in-Office of the Council has chosen not to accompany his delegation."
"I have been told by Canadian diplomats this evening that Mr Berlusconi's tactless decision has led Canada to consider cancelling the summit altogether, or to reschedule it for a European venue earlier in December."
"Given the importance of this summit and its established place in Europe's diplomatic calendar, Mr Berlusconi has shown an unacceptable willingness to offend our friends in Ottawa."
"For the second time in as many weeks he has embarrassed the Union, and in this case offended a valuable ally."
"The ELDR urges strongly that the summit goes ahead in December as planned, preferably in Canada, and in Europe only as a last resort."
"Even in Mr Berlusconi's absence, this summit must deliver an agreement that takes away regulatory barriers to closer trade and investment."
"Given the importance of our large store of common North Atlantic values, this summit should assert that Canada and the EU will henceforth cooperate proactively in foreign and security policy and on environmental questions."
"This means aligning our positions before major international meetings."
"The summit must also produce concrete proposals for a steering group to assess the future management of our relationship."
"We need more formal meetings at official and expert level, and a much more focused relationship."
"As soon as a Constitutional settlement is achieved, the 1976 Framework Agreement with Canada should be updated."
"In conclusion, it is time to equip our other transatlantic relationship for the new century."
"Thank you, Mr Watson."
"The debate is closed.(1)"
"Colleagues, this is a special day for me, as an Irish European."
"I would like to alert colleagues to put on their headphones and permit me briefly to speak in our ancient Irish tongue."
"A Uachtaráin, is mór an pléisiúr agus an onóir é fáilte a chur roimh Mháire Mhic Ghiolla Íosa, an chéad Uachtarán ar Éirinn as Cúige Ársa Uladh."
"De réir pobalbhreitheanna a rinneadh le déanaí, is í an phearsa pholaitiúil is measúla í i bPoblacht nahÉireann."
"A Uachtaráin Mhic Ghiolla Íosa, cuirimid céad míle fáilte romhat chuig Parlaimint na hEorpa."
"Madam President, six years ago you were elected the eighth President of the Republic of Ireland."
"Your election was the ultimate symbol of the healing and reconciliation that was taking place between divided communities on our island."
"The theme of your Presidency, 'building bridges' between traditions, cultures, communities and, most of all, between people, was not an abstract theme."
"In the course of the past six years you, through your work and dedication, have demonstrated the benefits of bridge-building, partnership and connection."
"It is this ability to connect that has served Ireland so well."
"30 years ago we, as Irish people, began our journey from the edge to the heart of Europe."
"We left behind isolation and stagnation to embrace openness and connection as the foundation of our modern prosperity."
"This transition afforded opportunity to a new generation of Irish people that previously was only available to our substantial emigrant community."
"I hope, President, you will not object if I quote to you part of a speech that you made in the United States in May 2003 - words which sum up very well the positives of Ireland's European experience: 'the little impoverished island off the west coast of Europe, which became an unremarkable member of the European Union thirty years ago, has become the symbol of the Union’s potential, the place with the economic success story that everywhere else wants to imitate."
"The country that up to 35 years ago offered the liberating key of education only to a small elite has felt the surging energy of its greatest natural resource - the genius of its own people - empowered through widened access to education.'"
"You went on to say 'the country that has known outward migration for 150 years has suddenly become a place of net inward migration, coping with the complexities of multiculturalism and the challenge of asylum seekers'."
"And so President, just as your Presidency marked a healing in our sometimes divided country, the Irish presidency of the European Union will mark and celebrate the healing of our old European continent."
"Next year we will be building bridges on a continental scale as we formally welcome our friends from the ten new Member States."
"We, in the European Parliament, have worked diligently in this process of bridge-building and are proud of our contribution."
"We are confident that under the leadership of the Irish presidency we will celebrate the fruits of that labour."
"President McAleese, for me as an Irish European, it is an enormous pleasure to invite you to address the House."
". Mr President, distinguished Members and guests, I am delighted to accept your invitation to address this Parliament and indeed to have the privilege of doing so at what is a remarkable juncture in the evolution of our European Union."
"This House, I know, is home not just to many political perspectives but to many cultures, languages, identities, traditions and heritages."
"You speak many different languages and you particularly understand the connection between language and culture, so I know you will be a particularly receptive audience if I too take this opportunity to speak in the Irish language for a moment."
"Is mór an onóir dom an deis seo a fháil labhairt le Parlaimint na hEorpa."
"Is ó shaoránaigh na hEorpa a eascraíonn údarás na hinstitiúide seo agus dá bhrí sin tá áit ar leith aici i gcroí an Aontais."
"Is léir dom go maith go bhfuil baill and fhorais ag obair go dícheallach chun an Eoraip seo againne a neartú."
"Glacaim uchtach as seasamh daingean na Parlaiminte agus í ag cur tuairimí mhuintir na hEorpa chun cinn."
"Ireland will assume the presidency of the Union in January 2004, so it seems right that today I should briefly address some of the major agenda items that will feature during Ireland's presidency."
"The Taoiseach, our Irish Prime Minister, will of course deal with them in considerably more detail when you meet in January and you can be sure that he and the Irish Government are looking forward to that."
"This Parliament gives power to the hugely diverse voices of men, women and young people throughout Europe."
"Along with the Council and the Commission, it forms a crucial part of the institutional checks and balances through which the European project has succeeded so well on behalf of all of us."
"Naturally, I take a particular pride in the fact that we have two Irish Presidents today in this Chamber."
"But perhaps more important than our shared nationality, is the continuing reassurance to small nations which your election, Mr President, brings - the reassurance that our Union truly respects, in its practices, the principles of equality and merit."
"I should also say that your term in office has been very widely admired, and nowhere more so than in our native home."
"The strength of this Parliament's voice has grown as the Union has grown."
"Now transformed from a consultative into a legislative body, a transformation indeed well supported by the Irish people, this Chamber demonstrates the central place of democratic politics right at the heart of the Union and in its debates bears witness to the expanding areas of cooperation within the Union - so much greater today than those early preoccupations with trade and the economics alone."
"The valuable role played by Parliament's representatives to the European Convention is a further recent manifestation of the extent to which you are the shapers of the future of the Union."
"As the directly elected representatives of the Union's citizens you are particularly well qualified to inform the debate on bringing Europe closer to its citizens, an issue which has taken centre stage and which will form a special focus for the Irish presidency."
"The Union's founders knew the devastating wasteland from which this exciting adventure in democratic partnership developed."
"They knew the price that had been paid for its birth."
"It is an infant still, a robust infant but an infant nonetheless in the scheme of human history and it needs champions to keep reminding us how lucky we are that it was conceived at all."
"Infanticide by disinterest or neglect is simply not an option and all of us who believe in this Union are challenged to generate in its citizens a passion and a zest for its continued development and growth - that is what the Irish presidency hopes to do."
"I represent, as you know, a country which has arguably changed more in the three decades of membership than at any time in our history: our economy has grown stronger, our population decline has been reversed; our self-confidence has increased; our relations with our nearest neighbours in Britain have never been better; and our standing in Europe and beyond is one of which we can be proud."
"Although geographically situated on the periphery, Ireland has had a very distinctive and unique European outreach over many centuries and indeed has played an important part in the cultural, religious, educational and social development of many parts of our continent."
"Virtually every time I visit a Member State I am reminded that an Irish saint got there first many centuries ago!"
"It is not going to be any different with the accession countries."
"When we joined the Union there was, therefore, something of the homecoming about it but in Ireland there was also a courageous facing up to the future and an acknowledgement that past insularity and protectionism were dead-weights holding us back."
"Through membership we first realised our true potential."
"The European Union is probably the world's best example of learning from past mistakes."
"This continent paid an outrageous price to learn that collegiality is infinitely more humanly decent than colonialism, that cooperation is better by far than conflict, that peace is essential to prosperity, that difference does not have to mean disdain."
"To the Union table we each bring our national sovereignty, our differences, our national identities and our histories."
"Through respectful dialogue and a shared belief in partnership we dare to forge a working team of neighbours, each of whom loves his or her native land and yet each of whom shares a devotion to our common European continental homeland."
"This Union is living proof that humanity can comfortably carry a range of identities, that they can complement and enhance each other and that we can deliver a better future for our people inside the Union than outside it."
"When Ireland's presidency of the Union begins in a few weeks' time we will bring to it the enthusiasm of very committed Europeans and the gratitude of a country which has manifestly benefited from that commitment."
"We know that this will undoubtedly be our most challenging presidency to date but we also know that we will have your support as we attempt to be an effective and an impartial arbiter in search of practical and even-handed outcomes in the interests of the European Union as a whole."
"The needs are very simple: the Union must be effective internally, influential externally and must equip itself for the future."
"The solutions, of course, are not quite so simple and they will be greatly testing of all our ingenuity."
"Yet we have no lack of ambition in this Union, no fear of added responsibilities."
"The most important moment in Ireland's presidency will, of course, be the formal accession of ten new Member States on 1 May 2004."
"It is an awesome, positive answer to the challenge laid down in this very forum just under a decade ago by Václav Havel, whom I had the great pleasure of welcoming to Dublin last week."
"He rightly declared then that 'history has thrown down a gauntlet - we can, if we wish, pick it up."
"If we do not do so, a great opportunity to create a continent of free and peaceful cooperation may be lost.'"
"The gauntlet has been well and truly lifted."
"The citizens and leaders of the European Union, including this Parliament, have shown themselves equal to the mammoth task of preparing both the Union and the applicant countries for enlargement."
"The citizens of the accession countries have endured the painful reforms required for membership and thanks to their determination they stand on the doorstep of the Union much more quickly than anyone could have anticipated."
"Where not long ago totalitarian regimes reigned, now, respect for the rule of law, democratic institutions, human rights and fundamental freedoms have put down deep roots again."
"If the war graves of Europe could speak they would tell us we are living a miracle - a radical transformation of human history is being wrought by a relentless process of sheer hard work and utter fidelity to the vision of the transcendent power of cooperation which is at the heart of the Union."
"And, of course, the enlargement process does not conclude on 1 May 2004."
"During the Irish presidency, the accession negotiations on Bulgaria and Romania will be pursued, based on the same principles that have guided all the enlargement negotiations to date, with a view to a target date of 2007 for their accession."
"In addition, the Irish presidency will monitor very closely developments with Turkey, in advance of the key decisions on opening negotiations to be taken in December 2004."
"The new Member States will be ambitious for their futures and we want to see them prosper as they put the opportunities of membership to good use."
"They rely on the continuation of that very strong support from existing Member States which has brought them safely thus far."
"Now it is our common challenge to ensure the success of a Union of 25 Member States."
"The Italian presidency is demonstrating its determination to do all in its power to reach agreement in the IGC by next month, and Ireland, naturally, is strongly supportive of this aim."
"The new Treaty will inject fresh excitement into the Union, transforming its unfortunate bureaucratic image, re-energising its relationships with Europe's citizens, making them feel like insiders and not spectators."
"The draft text produced by the Convention is a huge step forward in this regard."
"Naturally, however, a number of questions remain to be fully debated and finally resolved, including the issue of a reference to God in the preamble to the new Treaty."
"The Irish Government has indicated that it would welcome such an inclusion if consensus can be reached on suitable language."
"At the end of the day the Union does not live by words alone but by actions which make those lofty words real in our lives."
"How we manage economic and social development in the new Europe, how we harness the real potential offered by enlargement, how we breathe life into those words - these are, therefore, vital questions that Ireland will seek to address during our presidency."
"A key task during Ireland's tenure will be to advance the Lisbon agenda of social, economic and environmental renewal."
"At the Lisbon Summit of 2000, the Union set itself the ambitious objective of becoming the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world by the end of this decade."
"That strategy was agreed at a time of rapid economic growth across Europe and a lot has been achieved so far."
"But these are much less buoyant times, made all the more challenging by enlargement and if we are to achieve our targets we need to increase the pace of reform."
"The Irish presidency will seek to increase the relevance of the Lisbon agenda by focusing on areas that affect our everyday lives, because there can be no doubt that economic competitiveness, growth and investment, job creation, social protection, social inclusion, and sustainable development are all critical issues for the quality of life of Europe's citizens and for the relevance of the Union in their lives."
"The European citizen is also deeply concerned about world affairs, because ours is an increasingly interdependent world."
"The Union has both a duty and an opportunity to exercise its influence in the wider world, in pursuit of our shared values and, of course, our shared interests."
"The Union's external relations agenda is simply vast."
"It reflects the influence and the respect that the Union garners in all parts of our world."
"I experienced this personally during a recent State Visit to China, whose leaders greatly value the development of closer links with the Union."
"And, of course, with enlargement will come even greater authority."
"Ireland's presidency will be taking place at a time of deep global insecurity."
"War, terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, famine, disease and organised crime are all vying for places on the international agenda alongside issues of trade, tariffs, global economics and global relationships."
"External relations, therefore, will be another key aspect of the Irish presidency."
"There is a variety of means by which the Irish presidency will continue to address these and other issues, including the power of our own particular history which makes us an especially effective bridge to the United States, home to so many of our Irish emigrants."
"Ireland is also a special bridge to the developing countries, adopted homelands for thousands of Irish nurses, doctors, teachers, missionaries and aid workers who have made common cause for generations with the poorest of the poor."
"Underpinning international peace and security is a vital network of multinational organisations and multilateral organisations of global, bilateral and regional relationships."
"A stronger European Union makes that network stronger and it makes much louder the voice that champions the cause of peaceful coexistence and the fundamental human rights of every human being."
"Close and direct cooperation on bilateral and regional issues will be a feature of our presidency, whether it is in Africa, Asia, the Americas or, closer to home, in the neighbouring countries to the Union's east and south-east - our new borders."
"Nowhere is the call for the responsible exercise of power stronger than in the conduct of our relationships with the developing world."
"The Union is the global leader in the provision of development assistance and this generosity of spirit is a badge we can wear with honour."
"The European Commission and the Member States collectively contribute over 50% of global Overseas Development Assistance: over EUR 25 billion per year."
"The European Union is the largest donor to multilateral debt relief."
"It is the largest donor to AIDS programmes."
"It is, by far, the biggest donor to Africa."
"I have been fortunate to see with my own eyes the practical benefits of this aid in countries such as Uganda and Kenya and the real hope it gives to lives otherwise blighted by despair."
"However, we cannot escape the fact that the overall level of development assistance from the rich countries has dropped to an unacceptably low level."
"Even if we were to ignore the altruistic aspect of development assistance - which, of course, we should not - the single global civilisation in which we all now live highlights the myopia of such an approach."
"The human misery caused by endemic poverty should shame us, but the instability engendered by it threatens all of us."
"Poverty reduction rather than simply poverty management, is fundamental to Europe's future security strategy and we are in an ideal position to champion and end the poverty, disease, corruption, the oppression, the wasteful conflicts and post-colonial malaise which are denying so many human beings the right to a decent life."
"Perhaps this is the new gauntlet that should be thrown down to the 25 Member States of the enlarged Union."
"A Europe that has healed its own divisions can advocate its values with genuine credibility on the global stage."
"Yet the recent conflicts in Yugoslavia and my birthplace, Northern Ireland, and the relentless misery of the Middle East should keep us humble and alert to the dangers that still lurk on or close to our own doorsteps."
"It is chilling to realise that people can live literally right next door to one another and yet live in dangerous ignorance and fear of one another."
"We Europeans must ensure that inside each of our nations and between our 25 nations, our children are taught respect for others so that they can grow up completely at home, comfortable, in a world of difference and diversity and be an example to the rest of the world."
"The historic Good Friday Agreement was in many ways inspired by the European ideal."
"Its institutional architecture was strongly influenced by the experience of conflict resolution in Western Europe."
"One Member of this distinguished Chamber has been a tireless and persuasive advocate of the European model and he was, without a shadow of doubt, a key architect - if not key architect - of the Good Friday Agreement."
"I refer, of course, to the great Derryman, Irishman and European, your colleague and Nobel Laureate, John Hume."
"I am very privileged to be here today to salute with gratitude your vision, your courage and your achievements, John."
"In Northern Ireland the European Union's Peace and Reconciliation Programmes, which are generously supported by the European Parliament, have benefited many previously alienated and excluded communities and given a renewed sense of hope and optimism about the future."
"Together with the United States, the European Union has also been a very generous contributor to the International Fund for Ireland, which has worked right at the coalface of economic regeneration and reconciliation."
"Now all that work is paying off and it is clear that the will for peace is the strongest impulse in the vast majority of hearts."
"Elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly will take place on 26 November 2003 and it is my fervent hope - and I am sure a hope shared by many of you here - that the choices made will help my birthplace become what I know it is capable of becoming - a showcase of partnership, tolerance, equality and peace."
"A Uachtaráin, is mór an méid atá déanta ag Parlaimint na hEorpa chun pobal na hEorpa a threorú ar bhóthar a leasa, agus áirim mar chuid den treorú sin méadú an Aontais."
"Is mór an onóir don tír s'againn féin gur le linn Uachtaránacht na hÉireann a thiocfaidh an méadú seo chun críche."
"Is aisteach agus is iontach é gurb é an Stát is faide siar a chuirfidh fáilte roimh na stáit is faide soir - cruthú eile, má's gá a leithéid, gur I dteannta a chéile is ea a dhéanfaidh muid ár dtodhchai a fhí."
"There is a saying in the Irish language - - 'our strength is in partnership'."
"It could be the motto of the European Union."
"Its truth has been revealed many times over since the Union was founded and nowhere is its truth more evident than in my own country."
"Now, a new generation, probably the most privileged ever to inhabit this continent, will have a chance to see what great strength is created when 15 becomes 25, when the restless energy of a half a billion people, working with each other and for each other, is harnessed to the task of writing Europe's best and happiest chapter yet."
"Irish luck places us in the right place at the right time."
"We intend to honour it well."
"I thank the President on behalf of the House."
"I should like to say to her that this House is deeply committed to gender equality."
"You are a splendid example of female political leadership."
"The formal sitting is closed."
"Mr President, on a point of order, I want to report to Parliament that at the September part-session this Parliament passed a report on the Lloyd's petitions, setting a deadline of 15 November for the Commission to provide information to Parliament about its regulation of Lloyd's of London between 1978 and 2001."
"I have to report that by 15 November no such communication had been received from the Commission."
"As rapporteur, I still am not aware of anything having been received by Parliament, although I am assured by Mr Bolkestein's services that his letter is in the post."
"I hope that will be received in due course, but the deadline was not respected."
"I shall raise this matter in writing, but I just wanted to put it on record."
"Mr President, it is now 14 years since the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Convention on the Rights of the Child, on 20 November 1989."
"Unfortunately, our economies still operate in a way that fails to take account of children’s needs."
"Child labour still takes place, in Portugal too, where it is estimated that over 4% of children work in various sectors, due to the precarious economic situation of many families."
"We welcome the important initiatives condemning such practices and protecting children’s rights, specifically the global fight against child labour."
"I would therefore urge everyone, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, to demonstrate greater commitment to ensuring that a child’s smile signifies hope for a fairer world, in which child labour does not exist."
"We take note of your remarks, Mrs Figueiredo."
"The next item is the joint debate on three Community action programmes:"
"- the report (A5-0384/2003) by Mr Sacrédeus, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council decision establishing a Community action programme for bodies promoting reciprocal understanding of relations between the European Union and certain non-industrialised regions in the world (COM(2003) 280 C5-0350/2003 2003/0110(CNS))"
"- the report (A5-0368/2003) by Mrs Rühle, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision establishing a Community action programme to promote active European citizenship (civic participation) (COM(2003) 276 C5-0321/2003 2003/0116(CNS)) and"
"- the report (A5-0396/2003) by Mr Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a Community action programme to promote organisations active at European level in the field of equality between men and women (COM(2003) 279 C5-0261/2003 2003/0109(COD))."
". Mr President, since this is a joint debate, the bad news is that I shall have to speak at some length, but the good news is I will be as quick as I possibly can whilst not avoiding responding to the detailed issues that have been raised by honourable Members in their activities, which I know reflect the hard and intensive work they have been doing."
"As this House knows, the three European institutions worked together to secure a new Financial Regulation in 2002 that will come into effect on 1 January 2003."
"The regulation provides inter alia a clear framework for subsidies through which we support a large number of European organisations in the dialogue with European citizens, and it also stipulates that each financial decision should have a legal basis to ensure its justification."
"That requirement is particularly relevant for those subsidies which have been financed from lines whose position in the budgetary structure the so-called A-part of the budget meant that they could be assimilated into administrative expenditure and consequently be incurred without a clear legal basis."
"The modification of the budgetary structure introduced in the new Financial Regulation has brought to an end this assimilation of administrative expenditure, meaning that a legal basis for the subsidies in question is now required."
"It is this new obligation which led the Commission in May 2003 to present seven proposals for new legal bases."
"These were accompanied by a communication from Mrs Schreyer, which underlined the common context and presented identical solutions for common problems."
"The Commission welcomes this report by Mr Sacrédeus and appreciates the priority which the drafters and Parliament have given to dealing with the Commission’s proposal."
"With Parliament’s opinion it should now be possible to have the decision in force in 2004 and following a call for proposals, to go ahead with the selection of beneficiaries for operating grants for next year."
"The goal agreed between Parliament and Council during the conciliation of 16 July was the entry into force, by 2004, of the legal bases for grants which did not have that coverage."
"The legal base presented today, together with the six other proposals covering grants, is important because it is a direct consequence of the innovations concerning grants in the new Financial Regulation and is firmly anchored in the basic principles of transparency and equal treatment for potential beneficiaries."
"Most of the amendments proposed in Parliament's resolution are acceptable to the Commission and in keeping with the spirit of the Commission’s proposal."
"However, the Commission thinks it appropriate to limit the amount of the grant to 70% of the eligible costs and not 80%."
"Similarly, the Commission is of the view that a digressivity rate of 10% per year is preferable to 2.5%."
"Our view is that both of these requirements are safeguards which will go some way to ensuring sustainability and encouraging beneficiaries to be active in seeking alternative and complementary revenue streams."
"One point which should be mentioned is the need to ensure coherence between the proposed Council decision and the budget."
"In the Preliminary Draft Budget the Commission proposed one budget line to regroup amounts which, in the 2003 budget, are distributed over four lines in Chapter A 30."
"The future legal base for this single line, as required by the new Financial Regulation, is the proposed decision which is before the House today."
"This decision provides for the selection of beneficiaries following a call for proposals in accordance with the principles of transparency and equal treatment."
"At first reading, Parliament replaced the single line with five lines."
"The title of each line is the name of an Institute."
"There is a clear incompatibility between the future legal base and the division of the budget line in this manner."
"The Commission hopes that the adopted budget will correspond to the PDB proposal, so permitting us to execute the proposal and appropriations in full compliance with European Law as defined by the new Financial Regulation adopted by this House and the Council."
"I now turn to the report by Mrs Rühle on the proposal for an action programme to promote civic participation."
"I am grateful to Mrs Rühle for having acknowledged the urgency of this matter and for having ensured speedy adoption by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs."
"This has been immensely helpful."
"The Commission's proposal before the House seeks to ensure harmonious transition from the old system to the new arrangements and continuity in the activities being supported."
"We have endeavoured to produce a text which, to a large extent, extends the 2003 implementation procedures while incorporating the requirements of the new Financial Regulation in terms of sound financial management of public funds."
"This proposal for a legal basis should therefore be considered a technical adjustment."
"There is, nevertheless, a great and understandable temptation to grasp the opportunity to add innovations and suggest improvements."
"Parliament, as ever, is immensely helpful with this creativity."
"This may, however, be risky particularly if such additions compromise the subsequent adoption of the proposal by the Council."
"The Commission's proposal has therefore been formulated in what we consider to be a measured way, with the essential objective of continuing what has already been accomplished and by providing a legal structure which is consistent with the new Financial Regulation."
"I would consequently invite honourable Members not to distance themselves too much from the Commission's proposals and to do their utmost to ensure that this legal basis is adopted as quickly as possible."
"Furthermore, in the case of the legal basis for active civic participation, the margin for manoeuvre is even more limited because unanimity is required in Council."
"All avenues for compromise must be explored if we are to succeed in completing this procedure as speedily as possible."
"In fact, as from 1 January 2004, in the absence of this legal basis, it would quite simply not be possible for us to provide financial support to all the organisations which participate actively in the promotion of European citizenship."
"We would greatly regret that, and doubtless Parliament would too."
"I shall now outline the position of the Commission on the amendments contained in Mrs Rühle's report."
"The Commission can accept in full Amendments 1, 4, 7, 9, 11, 12, 15, 16, 13 and 31, which provide useful clarifications to the text."
"While recalling the need to apply the new Financial Regulation, the Commission sees no objection to Amendment 45 on the simplification of administrative procedures."
"It goes without saying that the Commission will impose an obligation on those who have received a European subsidy to provide adequate publicity."
"While entirely agreeing with Parliament on this point, as outlined in Amendment 48, we feel that it would be more appropriate to list this obligation in the conventions to be signed with the beneficiaries."
"The same holds true for Amendment 49 on the dissemination and availability of results."
"The Commission agrees with Amendment 47, which underlines the need for regular exchanges of views with the beneficiaries."
"The Commission can partly accept Amendment 25."
"Since the amendment does not alter the substance of the Commission proposal, we can accept the proposal to specify that the budgetary appropriations scheduled after 2006 are subject to an agreement of the budgetary authority on the financial perspective beyond 2006."
"However, the Commission is willing to accept the same duration for all seven proposals in the package until 2006 if that helps to find a compromise for all the proposals with a view to having them adopted in time for implementing the budget in 2004."
"As this proposal has to be seen in conjunction with the other proposals in the package, the amendments on 'earmarking' and the possibility of an executive agency also have to be settled in the broader context."
"The Commission cannot accept, in the same amendment, a reference to the total amount allocated to the programme since this is not consistent with the legislative procedures provided for in the consultation procedure."
"The Commission can also partially accept Amendment 28."
"We have no objections to sending reports on implementation of the programme, but we cannot accept transferring the content of the Annex to Article 8a, which would not be in line with the usual format of legal texts."
"The same applies to Amendments 20, 21, 22, 29 and 30, which the Commission rejects."
"The Commission understands the view of Parliament on the matter of focusing on potential enlargement of the scope and objectives of this proposal."
"However, it is our intention to guarantee the continuity of the activities already supported by the Commission in the past, so we have to refuse Amendments 14, 40, 41, 42 and 43, with a view to reaching a unanimous position on our proposal in the Council."
"Amendments 6 and 33, concerning the European Movement, are rejected as well as Amendments 32, 34, 35, 36 and 37, which add new organisations to the list of beneficiaries."
"With a view to ensuring the continuity of funding currently allocated, the Commission does not consider it appropriate to open a discussion on the list of organisations contained in Part 1."
"In accordance with the Financial Regulation, we intend to launch a call for proposals which will be open to all organisations active in this area."
"However, to facilitate the transition from the system of 'earmarking' to the system of calls for proposals, and taking into account the time left before the programme enters into force, we consider it more appropriate to apply the model of earmarking for 2004, and to publish an open call for proposals as from 2005."
"This would be a reasonable compromise since it would be technically impossible, under the procedures laid down in the Financial Regulation, to launch a call for proposals after the adoption of this legal base which would still allow for financing as from the beginning of 2004."
"As a consequence, the Commission can, in principal, accept the application of a system of 'earmarking'."
"We consider, however, that this approach should be restricted to 2004 and the operating rules should be laid down in the Annex rather than in the text of the programme."
"Therefore, for technical reasons, the Commission cannot accept that part of Amendment 23 relating to Group 1."
"The part of the amendment relating to Group 2 and aiming at the incorporation of organisations having a different perspective of the policies of the Union is considered quite superfluous, and therefore cannot be accepted."
"The last part of the amendment is not in line with the usual format of legal texts and is also rejected."
"On the possible involvement of an executive agency for the management of part of the programme, particularly in relation to management of the large number of projects in the town-twinning part of the programme, the Commission emphasises that such an approach conforms to Article 55 of the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities."
"In fact, the Commission envisages the setting-up of such an executive agency in the area of education and culture."
"Subject to the conclusions of a cost-benefit study currently under preparation by an external consultant, the Commission could propose that such an agency should be partly involved in the management of this programme."
"Before reaching a final decision, the Commission will submit this proposal to the Executive Agency Committee of the Council."
"The Commission is therefore not in a position at this juncture to accept Amendment 46."
"The Commission rejects Amendments 2, 8, 10, 17, 19, 24 and 50, which are considered superfluous because the issues are already sufficiently detailed in the existing text or covered by other texts."
"The reference to full employment in Amendment 3 is rejected because it is deemed to be over-ambitious."
"Amendment 5 which refers to the draft Constitution is premature since it may still be modified."
"We consider that the proposal to carry out regular evaluations of the organisations listed in part 1 referred to in Amendment 38 would be far too cumbersome to enact since these organisations are listed as recipients for the whole duration of the programme."
"A modification of the list would therefore require a new Council decision."
"Amendment 39 is unacceptable because it goes against the very essence of the action programme which aims to foster European networks."
"Amendment 40 concerning the media is also rejected because it may jeopardise applications from grass-roots organisations"
"The Commission rejects Amendment 44 which represents unacceptable interference with the Commission's implementation powers."
"The information of national parliaments, as suggested in Amendment 27, is not appropriate and the Commission considers that any evaluation of the programme should be based on a two-year reference period and therefore rejects Amendment 26."
"Amendment 51, which was tabled after the adoption of Mrs Rühle’s report in committee, is unacceptable to the Commission since it cannot guarantee the implementation of programmes before the legal basis is adopted."
"In conclusion, on this particular response, of the 51 amendments tabled by Parliament, the Commission accepts 14 in full, partially accepts 2 and rejects 35."
"I invite the House to do everything possible to ensure that the support provided by the European Union to the creation of a European citizenship is not derailed."
"If the system is to be put back on track at the beginning of 2004, an agreement at this stage in the procedure will be decisive as I know honourable Members fully understand."
"I am grateful for the attention of the House."
"I have one short set of further points to make before I conclude."
"This relates to the decision of Parliament and Council establishing a Community programme to promote organisations active at EU level in the field of equality between women and men."
"First of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, and the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities for their work and achievements on this dossier, which have been considerable in all respects."
"I am pleased that progress has already been made in Council and in Parliament on this basic act which is designed to provide a legal base for continuing funding support for organisations active at EU level in promoting gender equality."
"I welcome most of the 20 amendments in Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou's report adopted on 3 November 2003 by the Committee on Women's Rights, because they add precision and clarity to this basic act."
"However, the Commission is not in favour of some amendments relating to aspects of the duration of the programme and its evaluation."
"The Commission proposed a duration of two years 2004 and 2005 because it will include this topic in the overall reflections on the future of the equality strategy after 2005."
"The Commission cannot, therefore, agree with the extension of the duration of the programme until 2008 as proposed in Amendment 8."
"As a consequence, the Commission does not accept Amendments 6 and 7 on degressivity, Amendment 9 on increase in the financial framework, or Amendment 10 on budgetary authority agreement post-2006."
"As far as the evaluation of the programme by the Commission is concerned, the Financial Regulation provides the solid framework that is necessary."
"Amendment 11, which suggests that this evaluation should be based on an external report, is therefore unnecessary and seems disproportionate to the small amounts involved in this programme and its duration."
"The Commission cannot accept Amendment 19 because it considers it better to keep the themes general rather than specific."
"Finally, the Commission cannot accept Amendment 20 because it would impinge on the Commission's role in executing the programme."
"The adoption of this basic act in a short timeframe is very important in order not to disrupt the Community's financial support for those organisations, and notably the European Women's Lobby."
"To sum up, the Commission can accept Amendments 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 and it rejects Amendments 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 19 and 20 for the reasons I have given."
"I am grateful to the House for the patience extended to me in making a rather long contribution."
"Mr President, Commissioner Kinnock, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, life and the world do not stop at the European Union’s external borders."
"That is why dialogue between civilisations and cultures must be strengthened."
"Following the entry into force of the new Financial Regulation, a basic act or new legal basis is required for actions covered by subsidies from former chapter A-30 of the budget and by subsidies provided under certain B lines."
"In this context, the Commission has therefore presented a total of seven proposals establishing new action programmes."
"A dialogue between cultures and civilisations is, now more than ever, of crucial importance when it comes to guaranteeing peace and stability in the world."
"That is the special contribution and addition that I, in my capacity as rapporteur, wanted to make to the report on establishing a Community action programme for bodies promoting reciprocal understanding of relations between the European Union and certain non-industrialised regions in the world, a report adopted unanimously by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy on 4 November 2003."
"The centre, institute or network specialising in the analysis of relations between the European Union and certain regions helps promote dialogue between cultures and civilisations."
"It is a dialogue that is fundamental and absolutely crucial on this earth and in this world that it is our common responsibility to manage and care for."
"Dialogue between cultures and civilisations must promote the generally applicable and universal value of human freedoms and rights and the defence of human dignity."
"The view of human beings upon which the European Union is ultimately based means that every person is of equal, unique and inviolable value."
"This common basis of values we possess and this shared view of human beings must also operate as a guarantee of respect for different cultures and civilisations."
"The general objective of this programme shall be to support the activities of these bodies."
"According to the Commission’s proposal, the activities should consist of those in keeping with the annual work programme of a centre, institute or network."
"The activities supported must contribute to increasing understanding and dialogue between the European Union, the regions covered by the ALA, MEDA, TACIS and CARDS Regulations and the candidate countries."
"Here too, we in the European Parliament wish to add words to the effect that the activities must also – and I emphasise this – contribute to reinforcing social, cultural and human partnership and meeting places."
"We also wish to extend the duration of the programme to 31 December 2008."
"Publication of the Commission’s evaluation report is accordingly to be moved forward to 31 December 2007, and the appropriations after the year 2006 are subject to an agreement of the budgetary authority on the financial perspective beyond 2006."
"To achieve the objective of strengthening reciprocal knowledge and understanding, the bodies entitled to subsidies must be deeply acquainted with the cultural, historical, socio-economic and religious characteristics of the regions concerned."
"That is something I wanted to emphasise in the report."
"These activities should contribute both to political cooperation and to developing genuine partnership between people."
"The EU is now already providing financial and technical aid to other parts of the world."
"In the Council of Ministers, the governments of the Member States said that they attach great importance to these activities and expressed their desire to increase reciprocal knowledge on the part of the EU and partners receiving assistance, as well as to find a legal basis within the EU for doing this."
"The dialogue and the aid must be supported by bodies and organisations specialising in relations between the EU and the regions concerned."
"Examples of the activities of such bodies are studies and analyses of EU policy, together with seminars, round-table discussions and publications."
"Now already, there is a spectrum of bodies and associations engaging in regional cooperation and dialogue."
"It is therefore becoming more and more important to ensure that these activities are coordinated so as to prevent duplication of effort."
"Life and the world do not end at the external borders of the Member States or the European Union."
"That is why dialogue between civilisations and cultures must be strengthened."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful for the good cooperation over the recent weeks;"
"I would particularly like to thank the secretariat of our Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs for their support, without which my report could not have been processed on time."
"As the Commissioner has already mentioned, we are working to a very tight timetable, as the continued funding of many European institutions, and the support for non-governmental organisations, associations, trade unions and educational institutions in the next financial year cannot be secured without passing a legal act."
"Following the introduction of activity-based budgeting in accordance with the new Financial Regulation, these institutions need a legal basis."
"Although these institutions’ payments were previously covered by the A 30 line, these can, in future, no longer be made from the administrative part of the Commission’s budget."
"A legal basis is needed to ensure that the payments can be made."
"Such is the purely technical background to my report, and I do of course fully agree with the Commission that adaptation is an important primary concern."
"I am obliged to the Commissioner for his wide-ranging appreciation of my report, but I nevertheless want to contradict him on one point."
"We take the view that technical adaptation would not go far enough."
"The European Union has great challenges ahead of it, the first being the enlargement on 1 May 2004, and the poor turnout in the accession countries’ referendums has reinforced my view that more initiatives are needed if we are to press on with European integration."
"The second challenge is the debate on the new constitution and the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which also presents us with new challenges, and, last but not least, there is the harmonisation of the European legal area, in relation to which I will just mention the debate about the European Arrest Warrant."
"My aim has therefore been to help reduce the democratic deficit and develop a coherent picture of the concept of European citizenship and civic participation, and this has also been the overall motif of the report."
"So I particularly regret the fact that the Commission has not mentioned, and will not endorse, my Amendment 35, since I believe it to be very necessary that we should start to cooperate better with the Council of Europe’s Venice Commission, which brings structure to constitutional case law."
"There is an urgent need for the database to be expanded in order to give us better access to case law in European constitutional law."
"I also think it very important to support the ‘Agora’ website, thereby developing a virtual forum in which legislators at national and European level can consult each other."
"The same is true of the network for the training and further education of judges and public prosecutors."
"If we are to talk in terms of a European arrest warrant, then judges and public prosecutors urgently need more knowledge of European lawmaking."
"Right across Europe, we need better interaction between judges and public prosecutors."
"Although the Commission’s report is the ambitious essay that I would expect it to be, I also note deficiencies in the way it is set out."
"These led us to pay close attention to the simplification of procedures, to the reduction of red tape, and to customer-friendly access to European support grants."
"One proposal, therefore, envisages access as a two-stage procedure, which would mean that the purely formal aspects would be scrutinised first, followed at the second stage by examination of the content."
"That would simplify the examination overall and make for speedier decisions for the non-governmental organisations in question."
"We also want more transparency in the way Europe provides support."
"If a non-governmental organisation is in receipt of grants from Europe, it should also make that clear."
"Public access to the results of the work must also be ensured."
"For my final point, I would now like to turn to the question of earmarking, which has been a cause of great controversy in this House."
"In the first draft of my report I argued in favour of doing away with earmarking, but was obliged to take note of the fact that Parliament took a different view."
"I have come to share the view of many Members that we have to have a serious dialogue with the Commission, and that this will happen after 2004."
"Although I welcome the offer to continue earmarking after 2004, how, then – to take one example – is the call for proposals in relation to the Info-Points and in other areas to be implemented in 2005?"
"We can see a lot of question marks hanging over this, and I would like to have a dialogue with the Commission about it."
"This has led me to refrain from withdrawing the amendment, which I would prefer us to vote on today."
"I also think there has to be some fundamental rethinking of the issue of the executive agency and its objectives."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by expressing both our satisfaction with the Commission proposal establishing the programme in question and our vindication, if I may say so, because efforts to provide the facility for funding for a variety of European women's organisations through the budget started with our political group."
"Thus, for us, the objective of the present programme must be the facility for the European Women's Lobby to continue its work and, at the same time, the facility for other women's organisations to function and develop integrated activities within the general framework of equality between men and women."
"That is why we are calling in our amendments for funding to be directed not at special actions which cannot guarantee the permanence or standard of the programmes or the viability of organisations, but at funding operations, as is the case with the European Women's Lobby."
"Besides, we should not forget that special, specific actions, as proposed in the Commission draft, can be funded under other programmes or within the framework of Community policies with the annual priorities – equal pay, reconciling work and family life, participation in decision-making, changing stereotypes – every year there is this facility for women's organisations."
"As far as the period of application of the programme is concerned, I share your opinion, Commissioner, that it should apply until 2006, precisely because we cannot forecast requirements as of now, especially once the new countries join."
"Besides, it is a pilot programme and we need to see how it progresses."
"We can continue to extend it after the evaluation."
"As regards the application of the gradual 2.5% reduction after three years in application of the programme, I really cannot understand the logic of the rapporteurs who proposed this amendment."
"The European Commission expressly exempts all women's organisations in this programme from any such gradual reduction on the basis of the provisions of the Financial Regulation."
"Why should we apply it, especially to women's organisations other than the European Women's Lobby?"
"Especially at a time when the European Women's Lobby has other priorities within the framework of funding."
"It is discriminatory treatment of the organisations which does not even stand up on the basis of the Regulation."
"We also consider the proposal adopted by the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities to differentiate the percentage of funding for women's organisations to be discriminatory treatment."
"We cannot ask for 90% cofinancing for one organisation, such as the Lobby, which has preferential treatment, as I have said, such as funding for operations without submitting invitations for expressions of interest, and to ask for 80% from other organisations which do not have permanent funding and are selected following invitations for expressions of interest."
"As regards our amendments to do with transferring the European Women's Lobby from the articles to the Annex, this is for technical reasons at the Council's suggestion, precisely because we believe that we need to try to achieve a uniform format for all Community programmes which fund action by non-governmental organisations."
"And the precise aim of our amendments is to bring us closer to a final agreement."
"We are trying, Commissioner, with our amendments, to keep to Community standards, precisely in order to speed up the immediate application of the programme, a programme which, however, does not limit the action of women's organisations to specific areas or specific groups or direct it to specific philosophies."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, society is developing."
"Standards are changing, women's aspirations are constantly becoming richer and broader."
"It is up to us to show that we are able to administer this variety and give our society and, more importantly, the job of women, the opportunity to express its pluralism."
". Mr President, Commissioner, today we are going to vote on three more reports from the package of seven."
"They are all aimed at providing a legal basis for the various subsidies in the former lines known as A-30, and on Monday 24 November we will hold a conciliation meeting with the Council, in which we will try to reach a consensus which allows us to approve all of these proposals before the end of this year, so that they may be executed in 2004."
"In fact, the most serious problem we are facing now is ensuring that the appropriations intended for these subsidies can be executed during next year."
"I would therefore address the European Commission, which, in its communication to the Council and European Parliament, when commenting on the proposals, spoke of transitional measures in the event that the basic instruments are not approved before the end of this year."
"It appears that the transitional measure in question consists of extending the time limit for approval until the end of January 2004, which in truth does not solve the problem, because both Commissioner Schreyer and Commissioner Reding have said very explicitly that, if the legal bases have not been approved before the end of January, the appropriations will not be able to be executed."
"I would therefore like to remind the Commission of its own words and I quote: ‘In the event that this objective is not achieved, the Commission will propose, in due time, exceptional transitional measures which will allow subsidies to be allocated in 2004 while awaiting the adoption of the basic instruments’."
"It is clear that extending the time limit until the end of January 2004 is not a transitional measure, since it does not allow execution if these basic instruments have not been approved."
"Parliament has made an effort to work very quickly in order to make it in time, but we do not know what is going to happen in the conciliation procedure and, if it fails, the commission is obliged to stand by its word and seek a solution – and I would repeat its own words – in order to ‘allocate subsidies in 2004 while awaiting the adoption of the basic instruments’."
"With regard to the conciliation of 24 November, the fundamental issues to be negotiated are going to be, firstly, the financial contribution for each programme, their duration and the application of degressivity – which has already been mentioned – but, above all, it is the issue of the application of the pre-allocation in what we call ear-marking which will undoubtedly be the main stumbling block, Commissioner."
"I will therefore expand further on this point."
"The pre-allocation relates to the proposal on culture and citizenship, and Parliament wishes to maintain its right to this prerogative, and this is something it is going to defend before the Council."
"I would like to say once again that I have never been in favour of pre-allocation, but, like Mrs Rühle, I must recognise that, recently and above all thanks to the Commission's attitude, I am beginning to change my opinion, because, when I see the Commission's unwillingness to find a solution for the executability of the subsidies in 2004, when I see the Commission's attitude to the executability of pilot projects and preparatory actions adopted by Parliament at first reading, I begin to ask myself many questions, Commissioner, and if the Commission simply places obstacles in the way of all of this Parliament's initiatives in the budget, it has no choice but to fight harder to defend its prerogatives."
"And the Commission should not tell me that its proposals already provide for pre-allocation; the Commission is completely convinced and knows that, in any event, we were going to have the stumbling block with the Council."
"Mr Kinnock, I am very sorry that the Commission is taking no notice of my appeals, but I have been surprised and irritated to see that the Commission published in the Official Journal of the European Union of 18 November, that is to say, the day before yesterday, the invitation for proposals for 2004 for organisations which promote mutual understanding in relations between the European Union and certain non-industrialised regions of the world, in other words the Sacrédeus report, which we are going to vote on today from 12 noon."
"It seems to be very serious that the Commission has allowed this invitation to be published before Parliament has approved its position and, naturally, before the Council has adopted its decision."
"In other words, there is currently no legal basis for this invitation."
"It may be the case that by doing so the Commission wanted to speed up the procedures in order to facilitate the execution for 2004 but I sincerely believe that it has exceeded its powers."
"In any event, with all the problems we still have to resolve on Monday 24, I hope, Mr President, that Parliament and the Council can negotiate all of this successfully."
". Mr President, Commissioner, as draftsman of the opinion for this report, I must acknowledge that I agree on many of the aspects highlighted by the main rapporteur, Mrs Rühle."
"Article 49(2) of the new financial regulation, approved last year, lays down that, except in relation to institutional prerogatives, pilot projects, preparatory actions and operational appropriations for each institution, all other operational expenses will require a basic instrument for their execution."
"As has already been pointed out, this means proposing legal bases for these subsidies which are currently in part A, as in the case of the report we are dealing with."
"Nobody here will be surprised if I say that the work of preparing this report has been particularly delicate, since the economic interests of many bodies working to promote active European citizenship are at stake."
"This proposal includes ten budget lines which I am not going to repeat and whose objective is to stimulate the bodies defined in the different budgetary lines so that they may contribute to the promotion of active and participatory citizenship."
"This is the common objective of these subsidies, that is, to enhance the role of these organisations and to promote actions which in turn strengthen the European message."
"The most controversial aspect is undoubtedly the earmarking which some Member States are opposed to, as has been pointed out."
"But we represent the interests of the citizens and this report, together with another establishing a Community action programme for the promotion of bodies active at European level in the fields of culture, youth, education and training, are of key importance in terms of the European Union's credibility, and by means of them it is possible to communicate the fundamental message of our work, which is to build Europe with the participation of the citizens."
"I would therefore call on the Council and the Commission, within the framework of the new legislation, to act in favour of this interest, removing procedural obstacles which are overly complicated."
"Finally, let us not forget that, as Salvador de Madariaga said, Europe will exist when it exists in the conscience of all its citizens."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate all the draftsmen of the reports that we are discussing today, specifically Mr Sacrédeus and Mrs KratsaTsagaropoulou, although I shall use this speaking time in the joint debate on the subsidy package to discuss Mrs Rühle’s report and the creation of a Community action programme to promote active European citizenship."
"I congratulate Mrs Rühle on her work, and we broadly support her proposals."
"I thank her for the willingness she demonstrated in the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, to accept the amendments that I tabled, together with Messrs Hernández Mollar and Marcelino Oreja."
"I agree with the rapporteur when she insists that the fact that the programme’s main ambition centres on reducing the democratic deficit must be clarified and emphasised."
"Some reports that this Parliament has adopted clearly underline the need to strengthen and enhance the idea of European citizenship which, to judge by the levels of participation in the elections to this Parliament, needs to be promoted as a matter of urgency."
"I also agree with the need to give greater visibility to the obligation for transparency."
"Organisations that receive funds must clearly state that they have done so and also quote the amounts, both in the publications that they promote and on the websites that they own or contribute to."
"We must also call for the results of these programmes to be disseminated: the use of European taxpayers’ money must be counterbalanced by an evaluation of the practical benefits of the actions receiving funds."
"I also add my voice to that of the rapporteur and that of the previous speaker Mr Ojeda Sanz, when they call for bureaucratic procedures to be simplified."
"These must be reduced to the absolute minimum."
"Commissioner, the Commission must ensure that payments are made on time."
"Unjustifiable delays in transferring grants often compromise the effectiveness of the actions, damage the European Union’s image and create difficulties for the organisations which, in good faith, work together with us on disseminating this ideal."
"This programme is about strengthening the bonds of European citizenship, boosting civic and democratic participation and raising awareness of the European ideal and the workings of its institutions."
"There is no doubting the need to promote active citizenship, both by supporting organisations working in this field and by promoting actions with this aim."
"This is, therefore, an attempt to bring the citizens of the European Union closer, involving them in a direct or indirect dialogue with the Union and its institutions."
"I also agree with the need to adopt exceptional and provisional measures to ensure the funding and implementation of actions in 2004."
"For all of these reasons, taking into account the amendments that we tabled, we will vote in favour of this report."
"Mr President, the Sacrédeus report as presented to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, was adopted unanimously without amendments."
"My group warmly welcomed this report, which would have put an end to the shameful lack of transparency with which grants had been awarded to various bodies in the world over many years."
"Meanwhile, however, in the context of the budgetary procedure for 2004, Parliament has once again pronounced itself in favour of earmarking funds for various bodies that are dear to some of the Members of this House. Personally, I deplore that pronouncement."
"This situation now compels us to accept amendments tabled by Mr Salafranca, which are entirely out of tune with the spirit of the original report by my honourable colleague Mr Sacrédeus."
"Nevertheless, we rely on the Council, in its wisdom, to take the right decision in order to ensure that the future budgets of the European Union are transparent."
"We need to guarantee fair competition among the regional bodies and to identify those that can best contribute to the propagation of knowledge about the European Union."
"Mr President, in purely formal terms, the three reports we are debating today concern the issue of the legal basis."
"The general attitude has, therefore, also been that it was not the budget and its contents that were up for discussion. Rather, it was a matter of needing to put the legal basis in order."
"Of course the legal basis must be put in order."
"In the case of two of the reports, this happens with the help of Article 308, and this, in a way, shows the importance of Article 308."
"We are obliged to have such an article in case matters were suddenly to arise that, for example, needed to be put right."
"On the other hand, the same article must not of course be abused, as there has perhaps been a tendency for it to have been."
"In reality, however, the reports are much more than just a question of formally getting the legal basis right."
"In reality, it is a question of something that is extremely political: firstly, a power struggle between the EU institutions and, secondly, our relations with people in the European democracy within and outside Europe."
"Quite a lot has already been said about the first matter."
"I wish, in any case, to make a general remark, however, namely that it is striking that the women’s programme is the shortest one."
"Excuse me, but I do not think that the Commission has produced a particularly good explanation, for everything that has been said about the candidate countries can justifiably be said about all three programmes."
"I therefore take the view that, as the work continues, some thought might be given to why on earth women, as usual, have to be in the most vulnerable position."
"That, I have to say, is the attitude as I perceive it."
"Regarding the second matter, I should like to say that I come from a country that has been a member of the EU since 1972. We have tested public opinion on the EU from time to time and have had quite a lot of referendums, and we know that, if we do not arrange for people to be more actively involved in the EU, both in terms of internal democracy and also in relation to other countries, then the project will not succeed in the long term."
"It will be something beyond people's ken, and we may be in danger of their ending up feeling poorly disposed towards the project."
"It is therefore incredibly important that we set to work on involving people in this work."
"I am slightly annoyed that women, specifically, have been given the shortest programme."
"I would say again that experience from my own country shows that it is women who are most sceptical towards the project."
"There may be a variety of explanations for this, but that is not something I can go into now, because I do not have the time."
"Precisely for that reason, however, it is incredibly important that the women’s organisations too have a stable situation in which to work so that they do not have to spend all their time just finding the money for their work."
"I shall just comment on the individual reports."
"The first of these is concerned, as the rapporteur also emphasised in the report itself, with an incredibly important subject, that of the EU’s relations with other countries, and we can see on a day-to-day basis that it is becoming more and more important to increase this understanding of the fact that there exist cultures other than the specifically mainstreamed culture that is most widespread in Europe."
"In that context, I simply ask myself whether this programme would enable the candidate countries in actual fact to join on the basis of those criteria."
"I should like to ask the Commissioner responsible to look into this, because we know that the candidate countries basically use their development aid to benefit neighbouring countries rather than countries farther away."
"There is not therefore perhaps so much basic material to work on in the candidate countries when it comes to relations with third countries."
"The second report concerns the issue of citizenship, to which I have already referred. I just want to emphasise, however, that this must be developed all the time so that we ensure that not only the NGOs but also people in general are given the opportunity to participate in this work."
"In that way, we can increase understanding of the good things the EU has to offer."
"In that context, it is incredibly important that there not only be traditional organisations involved, but also organisations that take very broad cultural initiatives."
"I believe that this is one of the ways in which to make things happen."
"Finally, the issue of the programme for women."
"I engaged in some constructive cooperation with the rapporteur prior to the publication of this report, but there is considerable disagreement in the committee."
"There are therefore also a number of us who are in actual fact voting in favour of extending the programme and in favour of various other amendments that I had heard the Commission had rejected but for which we nonetheless hope a majority can be created."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, without wishing to engage in polemics with our rapporteur, I must emphasise that European lobbies, in my view, are an excellent source of information and coordination on a number of issues that arise in the countries of the European Union."
"I therefore wish to pay tribute to the work of those lobbies."
"Given my desire to avoid entering into an argument on this point, however, I shall begin by stressing the following point: regardless of the usefulness of the European Women’s Lobby, if some Members – and I agree with the previous speaker here – are calling for the extension of the programme for women, it is because they know from their dialogue with the relevant associations that the main problem lies in the way they work."
"For any association to work properly, it has to know where it is going, and it must be able to organise itself."
"This is why I strongly emphasise how important it is that we do not finance a particular event organised by an association or group of associations; on the contrary, we should use our funds to ensure that these associations operate in favourable conditions."
"Let me add that opening up to the new Member States and to third countries is also of fundamental importance in this context."
"When I look back on my experience of the past four years as a member of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities, I realise that we have widened the scope of our concerns quite considerably. This is another key dimension."
"We have moved into new areas of activity not only through the reports we have compiled on our own initiative but also because, as the Charter of Fundamental Rights states, the issue of women’s rights is relevant to every domain of activity."
"I have therefore seen us deal with reports on women’s health, on women and sport, on the information society and on violence against women."
"All of these reports demonstrate the need for us to take an interest in the development of the funding of associations, because each of these new areas on which we are now focusing is also undergoing development."
"This is why and this is my final point, which is addressed primarily to the Commissioner, I am still absolutely astonished that the European Commission did not endorse Mrs Diamantopoulou’s proposal for a directive implementing Article 13 of the EC Treaty, as amended by the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"Three years ago, the Racism Directive was adopted on the basis of Article 13."
"The directive on discrimination against women has just been undermined at the very time when we are in the process of broadening our horizons."
"I do not understand how the Commission can be so reticent, particularly with regard to the media, a sector in which we certainly need the associations and their support in order to combat all forms of discrimination."
"Mr President, as you know, numerous opinion polls have revealed how remote Europe is from its people and how much remains to be done to bridge that gap."
"Community initiatives designed to promote European citizenship do exist, but of course they are still inadequate."
"The decision to establish a five-year programme of subsidies to promote active European citizenship is a good thing."
"Promoting the idea of European citizenship so that the people assume responsibility for Europe and equip themselves with the means of exercising that responsibility is certainly the aim of this proposal, which should strengthen the democratic legitimacy of the Union and enhance its transparency."
"To that end, however, we must also simplify procedures with a view to ensuring that the largest possible number of associations can benefit from this new instrument."
"Moreover, it is observable that a hierarchical structure is developing among these organisations, a structure for which, I regret to say, there is not always any justification."
"Objective criteria should be defined by the European Commission for funding the operation and activities of the various NGOs, particularly those that are directly involved on the ground in practising the solidarity to which we are pledged."
"Let us not forget that it is thanks to them that social cohesion is maintained in the socially deprived areas of Europe where exclusion and discrimination are rife."
"How can we convince young people that Europe is a reality, how can we give them confidence in Europe, if Europe takes no practical action to combat discrimination?"
"People in the field have been heard to say that the Commission maintains special relationships with particular associations."
"If this assertion were true, such a situation would be unacceptable."
"On the other hand, while the social dimension is accentuated, for which we thank our rapporteur, we cannot choose to disregard the political dimension, which is indispensable if the present democratic deficit is to be reduced."
"So what citizenship are we discussing?"
"The report specifies that citizenship of the European Union complements and broadens national citizenship through the recognition of common rights."
"It derives from the need felt by the members of this Community to share their common democratic values in the process of constructing the Union."
"How long can we go on talking about a European construction process that excludes those 15 to 18 million residents of Europe who are nationals of third countries?"
"By virtue of their active participation in European integration, they are no less European citizens than anyone else, and their associations and NGOs are also actively engaged in the effort to promote Europe."
"We undoubtedly want a Europe of the people, a truly democratic Europe where solidarity prevails. To that end, we must renew and enhance this European citizenship."
"Now that we have free movement of capital, goods and persons, it goes without saying that the people of Europe must be able to assume their responsibilities and enjoy their rights in whatever European country they have chosen to live."
"Europe cannot accept a tiered system of citizenship in which some of its inhabitants are more equal than others."
"Everyone who shares this one European territory must be able to enjoy equal rights in his or her country of normal residence."
"To this end, the European citizenship we create must no longer be based on nationality but on residence."
"Too often in Europe, nationality and citizenship are indissolubly linked."
"In this respect, we can benefit from the interesting experience of the acceding countries, which distinguish between the concepts of citizenship and nationality."
"We want our old Europe to draw inspiration from this injection of fresh impetus in order to create a new definition of European citizenship, based on residence."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have come to feel that European citizenship has been consolidated through a set of events such as the introduction of the euro or the elimination of the Community's internal borders."
"In situations such as these, we see how the existence of European citizenship can complement national citizenship."
"There are, however, areas in which it is harder to discern this achievement."
"The structures created by the Community with the intention of promoting this European citizenship receive Community funding and might even have carried out work but do not reach the majority of the citizens."
"The lack of knowledge about the work undertaken in the various institutions is profound but, due to a lack of transparency, to bureaucracy and to the visible gulf between Europe's citizens and the institutions that supposedly represent them and the organisations set up to serve them, there is no real knowledge of what goes on."
"Only recently we were surprised at the results of surveys that demonstrate the complete ignorance of the European citizens about the work of the Convention, despite the considerable resources that have been invested in informing them."
"I myself, two years ago, was rapporteur on the euro, an extremely important Community service, essential to mobility and to promoting cross-border employment, and I became aware of the widespread lack of knowledge among the public about the euro."
"Two years on, even though this was one of the areas strategically identified in the resolution we adopted, highlighting the need for a major awareness-raising campaign, the situation remains more or less the same, due to the shortcomings of the Commission and to the lack of interest of the Member States."
"It is, therefore, crucial that measures are adopted."
"On the one hand, greater transparency must be demanded of organisations receiving Community grants."
"I agree with Mrs Rühle on the need for the investments that the European Union makes in informing its citizens and promoting citizenship to be made public, in particular on the websites of the organisations that benefit from this funding."
"This is one way of dispelling the idea that Europe is only for eurocrats and is far removed from the citizens, letting them know that this Europe works for all of us directly on a day-to-day basis and also offering citizens real participation at the social and political levels."
"The Community institutions are not entirely blameless and can improve their performance by simplifying procedures for submitting applications for Community funds earmarked for civic promotion, by promoting easy access to documents through user-friendly systems, by strengthening the intermediate structures between institutions and citizens, by really listening and genuinely opening up."
"This is furthermore the right time to encourage citizens’ participation in the construction of the European Union."
"The Intergovernmental Conference is preparing the new Treaty with constitutional aspirations that will have enormous repercussions for the future of European citizens."
"I therefore issue a universal challenge: promote real European citizenship now and make it compulsory for all Member State governments to hold referendums on this new Treaty, as many have already decided to do."
"Consultation on the subject of the future Treaty must take place in all the Member States."
"In this way, we will all be able to contribute to the genuine exercise of active European citizenship."
"There is no point in telling our fellow citizens that we are European citizens too, but continually telling them to ‘shush’."
"It is not right, having proclaimed European citizenship for ourselves in Maastricht, that we then ensure that nothing at all is said about it by imposing a strict vow of silence on the people."
"We cannot accept the idea that European citizenship is all well and good as long as the citizens do not commit the sin of asking permission to speak."
"Let us, then, give a commitment to active European citizenship."
"Mr President, the Community action programme to promote active European citizenship uses a pretentious name to camouflage a nefarious scheme to legitimise illegal subsidies granted by the Commission to its cronies."
"In fact, subsidies have been paid for many years to associations with an allegedly ‘European mission’ without any legal basis. They are often concealed among the appropriations made under Part A of the budget, in other words they are merged, with the aid of creative accounting, into the administrative expenditure of the Commission."
"Every year we protest against the selective granting of these subsidies to organisations promoting a federal Europe – the Jean Monnet Association, the International European Movement, diverse federalist think-tanks, etc."
"Every year we have refused to vote for them. Every year an overwhelming majority of this House has approved their renewal."
"Now, following observations made by the Court of Auditors – and oh, how justified they were – the new Financial Regulation that entered into force in 2002 requires the specification of a legal basis – which, of course, does not exist."
"Hence the proposal presented by the Commission today, which is designed to provide this basis for some of these outgoings, packaged together into what is called the ‘Community action programme to promote active European citizenship’."
"This approach speaks volumes about Community customs and practices, and indeed the comments it evokes could fill several books."
"I shall confine myself to six of these comments."
"Firstly, even if a legal basis were provided now, what would be done about the subsidies that have been paid in the past without any legal basis?"
"Secondly, it is a complete mockery to launch an action programme defining objectives on the basis of which grant applications will be assessed when everyone knows full well from the outset which associations will ultimately be selected."
"Thirdly, the subsidised associations have a European mission, at least as defined by the Commission."
"The others are, by definition, anti-European."
"When will the Council intervene in this business, either to stop all these subsidies or to distribute them equitably among associations with different visions of the future of Europe?"
"Fourthly, the European institutions are meanwhile trying to establish a system for the funding of the self-styled European political parties from the public purse."
"As these subsidies pile up, do you not think that taxpayers will eventually have had their fill of this recklessness?"
"Fifthly, the list of eligible associations contained in the report reveals a motley assortment of organisations, many of which have nothing to do with European citizenship, such as the European Council on Refugees and Exiles."
"In addition, since it is all so simple, the European Parliament could not resist adding to this list through its amendments."
"I also wonder, by the way, about the Association of the Councils of State and Supreme Administrative Jurisdictions of the European Union."
"How can it be that an association of leading judges who are supposed to be part of an entirely independent judiciary can receive money to promote active European citizenship?"
"My sixth and final point is that the only legal basis which anyone was able to find for this programme was Article 308 of the Treaty Establishing the European Union, the selfsame wretched article that we have often tried to have repealed, because it provides the Community with scope to stretch the limits of its powers."
"The report presented today will not change our minds on that point."
"It is true, however, that the said article requires the Council to act unanimously, and so I ask the following question: will there be a single government that is honest enough to oppose this concocted programme in the Council, a programme whose underlying principles are tinged with totalitarianism, because a sense of European citizenship, ladies and gentlemen, should be spontaneous, born of affection for Europe, for the European Union and its achievements."
"Mr President, the Commission has presented a felicitous initiative to our Parliament under the codecision procedure, an initiative that should lead to a decision establishing a Community action programme to promote organisations active at the European level in the field of equality between men and women."
"Having spent ten years at the head of such an organisation, namely the European Centre of the International Council of Women, which has affiliated organisations in the European Union, in the new Member States, in Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey, the EFTA countries and in other countries too, I am better placed to assess the real value of this programme, which is intended to help the numerous women’s organisations that are active at the European level in the domain of sexual equality."
"These organisations will be eligible to benefit from subsidisation from an appropriation that, according to the proposal, will amount to EUR 2.222 million."
"Our Committee on Budgets, for its part, has proposed an allocation of EUR 5.5 million covering the period from 2004 to 2008. This is not a huge amount, but women’s organisations, be they national or European, are used to living and operating on small budgets."
"The main reason why I welcome this initiative is that it puts an end to the monopoly on operating subsidies that has been enjoyed by the European Women’s Lobby ever since its creation."
"Having been one of the women activists who dreamed up and created that lobby in my capacity as president of CECIF, the organisation I referred to a moment ago, and since I am still president of a national organisation affiliated to the EWL, I must surely be immune to any accusations of seeking to undermine the EWL, whose work I greatly appreciate."
"The Commission has clearly understood that, in this as in all other domains, monopolies are unhealthy."
"Unfortunately, however, it did not take that principle to its logical conclusion, because the draft presented to us still reserves privileges for the EWL in the new framework."
"I do not wish to question the payment of an operating grant to the EWL, which is an established subsidy, but other organisations that are active at the European level in the struggle against all forms of discrimination, particularly discrimination on grounds of sex, should be able to benefit from financial support in the framework of the aforementioned appropriation in the form of operating subsidies designed to guarantee the continuity of their activities."
"Our rapporteur had judiciously amended the Commission’s proposal for a decision."
"Unfortunately, within the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities, the dogmatism of the Left triumphed once again over equality of treatment and opportunity for all the relevant women’s organisations."
"This is regrettable."
"Since the draft programme was totally distorted, Mrs Kratsa and other members of my group voted against it."
"If our efforts to restore the balance between the EWL and the other women’s organisations should fail, I shall vote against the report again, while still helping to prepare the ground for the second reading."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, may I begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mrs Rühle, on the work that has been done on the basis of her report, which is, I believe, a useful complement to the work of the European Commission."
"We know that citizenship of the Union should serve to involve more and more of the people of the Member States in the common project for European integration."
"Sadly, it is an undeniable fact that there are still many obstacles to overcome before European citizenship can become a reality."
"This is why the Rühle report, in its technical aspects, is actually an eminently political report, because it provides a channel through which we can support those bodies that are working to promote active European citizenship."
"It is absolutely essential that the public is better informed about what the European Union is doing to harmonise national policies and what it will be doing in the context of enlargement."
"Efforts are also needed to improve the promotion of current initiatives. This applies, for example, to the European Info-Points, whose networked operations meet with general satisfaction."
"Let me declare most solemnly here that the European Parliament has tried to deal with the financial threats facing the Info-Points and that a solution must be found quickly."
"I believe that this is now being done, but nothing is absolutely certain yet."
"The concept of European citizenship must therefore be applied in all its dimensions: political, administrative, judicial, social and economic."
"We must therefore continue to work towards the removal of those obstacles – and they do still exist – which are preventing the people of our countries from exercising their rights as European citizens."
"In the year 2000, as has already been mentioned, the Charter of Fundamental Rights finally put the citizen at the heart of the process of European integration process."
"Public involvement in the creation of the draft European constitution is another step in this direction."
"It was high time, for how is it possible to engage in politics at the European level, and indeed nationally and locally too, without making people the focus of all deliberations, of all welfare measures and of all social planning?"
"The public must become active players rather than mere passive spectators, as is still too often the case."
"It will obviously be even more difficult to communicate with the citizens of Europe when the population of the Union rises to almost 500 million from the present figure of 370 million, but that is precisely what we must do, using all the facilities that will enable us to conduct and enhance that dialogue."
"I shall conclude by recalling that one of the points highlighted by the report is this very lack of information, resulting in the stunted development of a sense of European citizenship."
"This is reflected, and regrettably so, in the turnout for European elections, which averages less than 50% a shocking state of affairs."
"As the red-letter days of June 2004 draw near, it is therefore more essential than ever to strengthen the information and communication policy of the European Union by every available means."
"The challenge is truly formidable: it is a matter of building a genuinely political Europe, a genuine people’s Europe."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteurs for their constructive work."
"I shall start with the Kratsa-Tsagaropoulous report."
"As Mrs Dybkjær says, it is of course symptomatic that the gender equality programme is the least comprehensive, but that is something to which we are fairly accustomed, Mr Kinnock."
"Equality between men and women begins in the home."
"The liberal challenge regarding gender equality consists in ensuring that women are given more power over their own lives."
"Even I as a liberal can say that it is a question of identifying structures that present obstacles to women being given the same opportunities as men."
"I am convinced that you, Mr Kinnock, are especially knowledgeable about this area."
"Equality between women and men has of course been one of the EU’s basic principles since the Treaty of Rome."
"That principle was reinforced in the Treaty of Amsterdam and has gradually gained in prominence."
"It is therefore clear that we especially welcome this action programme and the legal basis that give the women’s organisations financial opportunities to do better work."
"I think it important to say too that the activities engaged in by the European Women’s Lobby, which was founded by Mrs Lulling, is at present represented in fifteen Member States and has more than 3 000 members, should be prioritised and supported by us in this House today."
"Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou has talked in this Chamber about other organisations not included within the European Women’s Lobby, but they too are included in the action programme."
"I agree with Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou about the importance of diversity and of having organisations at all levels, but I would also give an assurance that the action programme is aimed at supporting both the European Women’s Lobby and other organisations."
"I should like to say to Mr Kinnock that it is important for the EU also to guarantee that the organisations working on gender equality are treated equally and are given financial aid for longer than the two years you propose."
"A two-year aid programme does not provide financial security for any organisation."
"Another reason for supporting the action programme, which extends to 2008, is that we must be able to guarantee that organisations in our new Member States are also given an opportunity to seek aid within this programme."
"I think it important to add, and to emphasise, that it should provide more long-term security."
"Mr Sacrédeus, who unfortunately appears to have left the Chamber, has done a good job concerning the programme covered by his report."
"The programme should help us and exists so that people in the various countries, regions and parts of the world that cooperate might have a better knowledge of each other."
"As a liberal, I fully and entirely support this work."
"I nonetheless want to present three wishes based upon experience, of which I think we should take account."
"The aid must be easy to administer and apply for; it must be unbureaucratic; and it must be obtainable quickly."
"We know that many are reluctant to seek aid from the EU and within the financial framework we have, because there is a lot of red tape and it can be too late when the money is finally paid out."
"It must not be the case that, through these financial programmes partly aimed at making us more European, the European Union is associated with red tape, bureaucracy and tardiness, which are precisely what people do associate it with. That must not happen, and I hope, Mr Kinnock, that, in your continued work, you will ensure that we are given more aid and that there is increased access to these action programmes and to the money, so that they are of use."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, first of all, I wish to emphasise the need for transparency, information and simplification in the field of Community grants."
"Secondly, I should like to highlight the importance of a Community action programme to promote organisations active at European level in the field of equality between men and women, in activities as important as integrating the gender perspective into education, sport, health, social protection, cooperation with women’s associations in third countries, without detracting from the important work of the European Women’s Lobby."
"I would also emphasise the need for more actions to combat violence because this is an obstacle to equality and to the recognition of women’s dignity."
"Lastly, I regret that the funds for these actions are still so limited, which reveals an ongoing lack of respect for the work undertaken to promote equality of rights and women’s opportunities in a huge range of fields."
"I would like a guarantee to be given now that the programme will be extended to 2008, because we must commit to continuing this extremely important work of promoting equality of rights and opportunities between men and women."
"Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to start by congratulating the rapporteurs, Mr Sacrédeus, Mrs Rühle and specifically Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, on whose report I wish to speak. We must always remember that the aim of the programme in question is to support women’s organisations whose primary task is to promote, monitor and publicise Community actions designed for women, with the aim of achieving gender equality."
"The amendments tabled in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities changed the nature of the report and, what is worse, diverted it from the overall objective."
"Consequently, the members of that committee from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, including the rapporteur, voted against them."
"I must, therefore, congratulate Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou on the coherence and persistence of the work she has carried out and which can be seen in the amendments tabled for the vote in this plenary session."
"In actual fact, what is at stake are crucial issues; firstly, the reference to the European Women’s Lobby in the text that is annexed and not in the legislative part; secondly, the intention to award grants for organisations’ operational needs and not for specific actions; thirdly, co-financing and degressivity rates must be identical both for the European Women’s Lobby and for other organisations operating at European level."
"We would certainly not deny the fundamental role of the European Women’s Lobby, but the work of other organisations that share these aims and which undertake their own activities that do not receive financial support also needs to be recognised."
"Consequently, in order to ensure equal opportunities for all of these organisations, their names must be given only in the annex."
"Furthermore, this programme must award operational grants to organisations active at European level in the field of equality between women and men."
"The programme is not intended to subsidise specific actions that could receive funding under other programmes."
"This point must be crystal clear!"
"Lastly, in contrast to the Commission proposals, standard criteria must be adopted for the various organisations as regards co-financing and degressivity."
"Mr President, I would like to welcome the Commission's initiative to establish this Community action programme and I would also like to congratulate Parliament, which in a very short time has had to study and draw up its amendments, on its work."
"I would like to use this speech to defend the fundamental role of women’s organisations in the promotion of the European Union’s equal opportunities policy."
"Without them, without women’s organisations, it would have been very difficult to implement and extend the progress made in the promotion of women’s rights."
"It would also have been very difficult to diagnose the real situation of women in the different countries of the European Union."
"The progress made by the women’s movement stems from the solid work of their organisations."
"Women’s organisations also have the capacity to propose solutions which are very close to the ground and therefore very effective."
"Consequently, I believe that establishing a Community programme to support and promote these organisations is fundamental."
"There are many women’s organisations, each with its own specific nature and importance, all of which have done extremely respectable and useful work."
"But the problem is that not all organisations are equal and egalitarianism, in this case, could lead to clear injustice."
"The European Women’s Lobby is a great organisation made up of many others."
"That is to say, the European Women’s Lobby is a great umbrella organisation containing thousands of women’s organisations, hundreds and thousands of women who work on a daily basis in favour of women’s rights."
"We cannot compare an umbrella organisation with organisations that work individually."
"Therefore, from the outset, the Commission is proposing different treatment for the European Women’s Lobby and for all the other organisations."
"And naturally my group supports that approach."
"Why?"
"Because those of us who come from the women’s movement know that to fragment the movement, to disintegrate it, to break it into tiny pieces, is ineffective, that the most effective way is to work together, because united we are stronger."
"Dividing resources is of no use whatsoever, except to weaken the women’s movement."
"And therefore, defending and supporting each and every women’s organisation which works for equality, we must not treat those which are not equal equally."
"Mr President, we shall vote for the Kratsa report, because we approve of the aim it sets, namely the establishment of a Community action programme to promote organisations active at European level in the field of equality between men and women, even if we have doubts about its scope."
"How can anyone fail to endorse the principles set out in Amendment 13: the participation of women in decision-making, the suppression of all forms of violence against women, of sexual stereotyping and of discrimination against women in the workplace and the integration of the aim of sexual equality into the domains of education, sport, health and social welfare?"
"At the same time, though, how can anyone fail to notice that the European institutions themselves are setting a bad example?"
"Why do they not intervene to put an end, in every country of the Union, to the form of violence against women that consists in denying them the choice between having and not having a child?"
"How can the European institutions wield any influence in the effort to combat discrimination against women at work if they refuse to enact coercive legislation against employers in this domain, as in others?"
"How can equality between men and women, in deeds rather than words, be guaranteed unless sufficient numbers of crèches, childcare facilities and nursery schools are built, an aim which the austerity policies favoured by the European institutions and national governments are making more and more difficult to achieve?"
"So while voting for this report on the basis that some aid for women’s organisations is better than none, I must observe that the European institutions are evading their own responsibilities as far as the promotion of equality is concerned, because they are more concerned with competition, profit and capital than with the lives of human beings."
"Mr President, I would like to support the point raised by Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, the rapporteur, and I welcome the initiative proposed by the Commission to provide a basic instrument to fund and to promote organisations active in the field of equality between men and women at European level."
"As mentioned earlier, many organisations are eligible for this funding."
"We cannot allow a Europe where some are more equal than others."
"We must vote in favour of equal treatment between men and women but also between the European Women's Lobby EWL and other women's associations."
"It is not equal treatment when one organisation can receive funding without needing to make a proposal to the Commission, and yet other organisations must compete against many other worthwhile proposals."
"It is not equal treatment when there is such a huge difference in the proportion of funding received by one organisation as compared to that granted to other women's organisations."
"We know that a great deal of the EWL budget goes to coordination and research, but EWL does not offer financial aid to the associations that make it up."
"These organisations in fact pay for membership of EWL and they do not have permanent financial aid available to them."
"This discriminates against the very worthwhile organisations that need support at European level to make their voice heard and it undermines the appreciation of the high quality of their work."
"I would like to point out that when I was newly elected in 1999, I had no idea what or who EWL was."
"I was contacted by women's organisations in Germany and Spain and I was asked to make a plea on their behalf for equal funding."
"They did not receive funding from the European Union and they could not receive it unless they were part of EWL, which claimed to be the only voice for women throughout Europe."
"I do not wish to undermine the work of EWL it has a legitimate purpose and has a right to receive funding but I simply propose that the funding should also be available to other women's organisations, who feel that EWL does not speak for them."
"Many parties make up this House and sometimes people feel that their voice can be heard perhaps better with one side of the House than with another."
"That is the situation we are in."
"Specific organisations should not be mentioned in this proposal."
"They should be mentioned in the Annex, and there should not be funding for specific actions that can be funded in other programmes."
"This is in line with the Council position."
"– Mr President, I rise to speak on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists on the subject of the programme intended to support women’s organisations and has replaced the Budget line that formerly funded only the European women’s lobby – that being the umbrella organisation for some 3 000 women’s organisations in Europe, including the national women’s councils, such as the , which has about 11 million individual members in Germany, ranging from church groups to autonomous bodies via political women’s associations and trade unions."
"The European women’s lobby has initiated important campaigns, such as the campaign for increased involvement by women in the European elections, has prompted a debate on the constitution, and is monitoring enlargement with a particular eye on equal opportunities issues."
"What the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats now wants is for this line to be dismantled."
"We want to ensure quality."
"We want to speak for women with one voice rather than join in a chorus of many."
"In contrast to the rapporteur, my group wants, from the very outset, to make this a priority and ensure action in the European interest in the equal opportunities field."
"We will therefore reject most of the rapporteur’s amendments in favour of those put forward by the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities."
"We Social Democrats contend that Mrs Dührkop Dührkop has also presented a well-thought out proposal for funding, fully in line with the Budget Regulation, which secures provision of funding up to and including 2008, to the tune of EUR 5.5 million."
"That gives women’s organisations the security they need to plan ahead, and spares us another laborious legislative process once the two years are up."
"The cofinancing arrangement, with 20% for women’s organisations, with the exception of the European Women’s Lobby, which gets 10%, excluding degressivity, is a solution with which all parties can live."
"When enlargement happens, we want the organisations from Central and Eastern Europe also to be included, and we want priorities set."
"It is therefore proposed in Amendment 13 – in which there is a translation mistake that I will bring to the services’ attention – that work and family life be made more compatible."
"We want to encourage women to play their part in the decision-making process; we want this programme, and the organisations, to support the fight against all forms of violence."
"We also want to support the fight against gender-specific stereotyping and discrimination of all kinds, especially in the workplace and in relation to pay, and we also welcome the encouragement given to women’s cooperation in third countries, for example in Amendment 14."
"At the very last minute, the Italian presidency of the Council has attempted to bring influence to bear on us to get us to go along with the rapporteur’s proposals."
"Both my group and I are hoping for a majority in this House, we are not willing to encourage the fragmentation of women’s voices."
"We want unity rather than polyphony."
"Mr President, I have never before had the honour of speaking for three long minutes in this wonderful Chamber."
"Thank you for this kindness and this gift, which I particularly appreciate because I am to speak about women."
"This is an issue which fascinates me, Mr President; it fascinates me because I firmly believe that women’s battle to be accorded at least the same importance as men and to be considered equal to them is right and sacrosanct, and every endeavour must be made to achieve this objective."
"This is why I would like to thank Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou for her commitment in tabling a report on this Commission document."
"Nevertheless, I would like to ask a question: is the money destined for this purpose sufficient?"
"According to an Italian proverb, silence means consent."
"You are silent, Mr President, but I think that you agree with me that it is not sufficient."
"I have calculated that, every year, with this programme for women five thousandths of a euro is spent every day – not EUR 5 but five thousandths of a euro for each woman: that is a very small amount."
"Look around you: what progress have women made in political life, in employment, in social life?"
"In political life, Mr President, how many women vice-chairpersons and chairpersons are there in the European Parliament?"
"How many women have been President of the European Commission?"
"None, Mr Kinnock, either in the past or at present; let us hope that things will change in the future."
"In politics, elected women are in an incredibly small minority."
"Now, I hope that the contributions provided for by the programmes for women will be distributed in a democratic way, not in the way that was so clearly criticised by Mrs Kratsa- Tsagaropoulou and other speakers before me."
"I genuinely hope that they help women to become aware of their potential and capacity to have a full role at the different political levels, irrespective of the political picture: it makes no difference whether the right or the left is in power."
"Women must have political power too, in addition to reigning over our homes."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the Commission’s presentation of these seven action programmes more or less simultaneously has given the impression that they have to be adapted to one another and harmonised, but I would like to emphasise that they have quite different subject matters, so that it cannot be conducive to the programmes’ purpose to approximate them."
"I have to say this about every report that has to do with action programmes, but, as the Commission has been very, very tardy in putting the reports before Parliament, the organisations concerned – including the cultural and educational programmes and of course the women’s programmes – now face the danger that they will get their money in 2004 only after a substantial delay or that the programmes cannot be run at all if – as you have previously stressed – this is not wrapped up by December."
"That is, of course, highly disadvantageous, and I think this an extremely inopportune time for you to launch a major action of this kind."
"On the subject of the transitional stage that you propose in the documents, I would like to ask you what you propose doing if there is no conclusion by December."
"We need a transitional stage in the event of the legal basis not being complete in due time."
"Rejecting thirty-five amendments, you appeal to Parliament’s sense of responsibility, telling us that we should make allowances so that the programmes can yet be implemented."
"When it rejects thirty-five out of over fifty amendments, the Commission cannot be said to possess much in the way either of a sense of responsibility or a conciliatory approach."
"That means that there still have to be some negotiations here."
"Referring specifically to the women’s programme, I would like to add my voice to what has been said by my fellow lady MEPs."
"The European Women's Lobby is an organisation that concentrates on equal opportunities policy and engages in it with determination, being able to show strength by bringing together many organisations."
"I do not understand why it is sought to erode this strength by putting it on an equal footing with many other organisations."
"I therefore endorse the special status of the Women's Lobby and stress that it should be maintained."
"I would, finally, like to address the subject of enlargement and take this opportunity to urge that special account be taken of the financial conditions for it, for an additional ten Member States also means that we have to do much more work on women’s issues, and one look at the number of women on the lists will make clear what we mean by that."
"It is here that we have to work harder, and for that we need more funding."
"The same financial conditions cannot apply to 25 Member States as did to 15."
"– Mr President, I would like to deal with the report by my colleague, Lennart Sacrédeus, and at the very outset thank him for the excellent work he has done in drafting it."
"The amendments proposed in the report will make it easier both to support projects that are important for the European Union and to monitor them."
"The Commission proposal only loosely defines who will be affected, and quite a number of possible target countries are not at all non-industrialised."
"In my opinion it is important that this project should apply specifically to those countries and their internal regions which can otherwise be more difficult to reach and with which the European Union can be considered to have an obvious need to develop mutual understanding and cooperation."
"What I think is a particular problem is that cooperation agreements made with non-industrialised countries can easily focus just on promoting economic development."
"In this situation we should remember that improving social conditions has unquestionable value in international cooperation and a clear, albeit indirect, effect too in the way it promotes economic development."
"For this reason I am of the opinion that it is important in the report to stress the importance of dialogue between the Commission and Parliament before issuing a call for proposals."
"Only in this way can Parliament ensure that it has control over how resources are allocated and can also support humane development aims."
"The decisions made by the Commission regarding priority themes take a strong stance on European Union values, and it is very important that Parliament, which in the eyes of the people represents the Union, can influence these decisions."
"– Mr President, the issues addressed by these three reports appear at first sight to be of a technical nature."
"The new Financial Regulation requires specific legal bases, but, as many speakers have pointed out – and I am particularly obliged to the rapporteurs for doing so – this new legal basis does in fact entail far-reaching practical consequences for the individual areas in question."
"I am speaking primarily about the report on active civic participation."
"We talk constantly about giving citizens more information about the European process and getting them more involved in it, but I want now to make it abundantly clear that there is a great danger of us, for the sake of the new legal basis and the Financial Regulation, throwing the baby out with the bathwater, and that we will, next year, be complaining that we have more problems with public information in the year of the European elections than we ever did before."
"I therefore appeal in urgent terms, particularly to the Commission and to the Council, that greater account be taken of how Parliament votes on these issues, especially as regards the conciliation procedure this coming Monday."
"Let me give you just two examples."
"The first is the Info-Points, to which Mrs Rühle was right to make reference, and I also strongly endorse the amendment she has moved."
"It utterly passes my understanding how the Commission is unwilling to support this amendment."
"You are all aware that, in our home countries, the Info-Points serve as points of contact for information on Europe and the European institutions."
"Can you imagine the Info-Points in your region being able to do their job if they were restricted by a call for proposals?"
"This financial insecurity and inadequate institutional backup means that the Info-Points will, in future, be unable to perform their function."
"That is what the Commission is proposing to us in this report, and so I want to forcefully draw your attention to this danger."
"The same is true of town twinning, from which all of you, in your regions, receive support in your work."
"Here too, the bureaucratic process associated with this new legal basis can very much threaten the continuation of the work they do."
"And so, let me conclude by reiterating my appeal to the Commission and the Council. I urge them to take Parliament’s vote on board and arrive at fair compromises that will guarantee rather than imperil public information in the future!"
". Mr President, I would like to respond briefly to this joint debate in order, firstly to thank Members, rapporteurs and other participants in the discussions this morning and also to express appreciation for all the work that has been put into the issues covered by this joint debate."
"Secondly, I would like to clarify the Commission's position on a number of points relating to the three reports and, thirdly, to respond to a number of points that have been raised."
"On the report by Mr Sacrédeus, I sympathise very strongly with the emphasis he put on dialogue between cultures and civilisations as a contribution to peace and understanding."
"I am reminded of Abba Eban's response when asked why he was continually seeking to open conversation with enemies."
"He explained that it was because his friends already agreed with him."
"That is a valid maxim for the conduct of international affairs."
"I am sure Mr Sacrédeus agrees."
"Indeed, it is not a bad definition of the relationship that is sometimes desirable between Parliament and the Commission."
"I would also like to add, in response to Mr Sacrédeus, that I understand that four additional amendments have been tabled which were not supported or proposed by the rapporteur."
"If adopted, those amendments, numbers 16, 17, 18 and 19, would radically alter the Commission's proposal and the effect would be to open the possibility of awarding grants without a call for proposals, thereby undermining the principles of transparency and equal treatment, not to mention the principles of order in Parliament, which is always desirable - though I understand it is difficult when people are coming in."
"Specifically in response to Mrs Dührkop Dührkop's comments about the publication of the call for tenders yesterday in the Official Journal, I have to inform her that the Commission had to do this to comply with the deadlines established by the financial regulation, which requires applications for operating grants to be submitted by 31 December."
"I know she has a forceful point relating to the legal standing of this action."
"If she does not have time to participate in the present debate, I hope she will be able to take the matter up with the relevant Commission authorities to get a clear explanation."
"In relation to the report by Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, I must add that, in order to be consistent, the Commission must also reject the later amendments: 21, 23, 25, 27, 31 and 32."
"In relation to the Rühle report, I am afraid that a gremlin crept into the list we received and I have to say that the Commission also rejects Amendment 18."
"More importantly, I should reply to Mrs Rühle that the reason for the Commission's rejection of Amendments 35, 36 and 37 is that they would jeopardise the speedy adoption of the proposal because of the requirement for unanimity in the Council."
"I know she agrees with the Commission that delay is to be avoided wherever possible."
"Moreover, there would inevitably be a long discussion on the potential beneficiaries to be included in the list."
"Given that the proposal is of an essentially technical nature, the Commission must guarantee the continuity of funding for existing activities, which clearly lack a legal basis."
"Any widening of the scope of this proposal is likely to jeopardise that objective, which I know is shared by Mrs Rühle."
"The Commission understands, however, the rationale behind the amendment and could take account of Amendment 35 when developing a proposal for the possible extension of this programme."
"I know that Mrs Rühle will take the opportunity that that affords."
"To Mrs Prets, who, together with many other speakers in the debate, made a very valuable contribution, I would say that it has been agreed with the Council that we could add a clause in the legal basis to allow retroactivity in financing operational grants for beneficiaries from January 2004 onwards."
"The question of earmarking, mentioned by a number of Members this morning, was discussed at last week's trialogue."
"The Council proposed that the beneficiaries should be named in a list annexed to each programme for 2004."
"From 2005 the call for public proposals open to all organisations will be launched."
"The Commission has decided to align itself with that proposal as a realistic compromise."
"It must be seen in the context of the overall effort to find solutions for all seven proposals."
"The Commission has compromised on the duration of programmes, where we proposed to limit them, until the end of 2006."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at noon."
"I regret to inform the House that earlier this morning Istanbul was rocked by a series of explosions."
"A number of British targets were involved, among them the British Consulate."
"At least five people are reported dead and over 100 injured, and there are staff unaccounted for."
"On behalf of the European Parliament I wish to express our profound sympathy and condolences to the victims and their families, our solidarity with the Turkish authorities in getting to the root of the problem and dealing with the perpetrators of terror, and our solidarity with the people of Istanbul a city that has traditionally been a place of peaceful coexistence but which regrettably now has become a frontline in a campaign of terror."
"I ask you to observe a minute's silence in respect of the victims."
"– I give the floor to Mr Bowis."
"Mr President, on behalf of the British Members of this House, may I thank the President of Parliament, through you, for his words of sympathy, and extend the sympathy of my colleagues and of colleagues across all parties from my country in this House at what has happened in Istanbul."
"We believe there are some 107 casualties; it is known that there are 7 dead so far and 4 British diplomats are missing."
"This is an atrocity that will appal the whole House and the European Union."
"We express sympathy, of course, to all those affected, whether they are British, Turkish or other citizens of Europe."
"I thank the President of Parliament for his sympathy."
"Mr Bowis, I will be sure to inform the Presidency of the essence of your speech."
"I would also like to extend my sympathy to you and your fellow British Members."
"Sadly, this is a time in which many nations are affected by this terrible wave of terrorism."
"Ladies and gentlemen, personally and on your behalf, I would like to welcome the members of the Kyrgyz parliament delegation who are in the official gallery and who are taking part in the fourth meeting of the European Union-Republic of Kyrgyzstan Parliamentary Cooperation Committee, taking place in Strasbourg, and I extend to them a warm welcome to our institution."
"This delegation is made up of four members, headed by Mr Sooronbay Jeenbekov, Vice-President of the Kyrgyz parliament."
"We welcome the continued development of relations between our parliaments, especially following the entry into force of the Partnership and Cooperation agreement between the European Union and Kyrgyzstan in 1999, as well as the progress achieved by this country in combating poverty and consolidating a democratic state."
"I am certain that the work of this fourth Parliamentary Cooperation Committee will be a new and important step in strengthening cooperation between the two parties, which are inspired by the same democratic values and which both attach great importance to the requirements of the rule of law."
"Mr President, considering that, in the Joint Statement on the EU-Russia summit, the versions are not compatible in that they contain different translations – the official version is the English one, which says ‘President of the European Council’, whilst the French and Portuguese versions say ‘Italian President of the Council’ – and, given the fact that the other versions could presumably contain the same error – and thatthe two definitions make the provisions below the aforementioned paragraph meaningless, I would like to ask whether, before proceeding to the vote, it would be possible to have all the versions brought into line, or, if not, if the vote on this resolution can be postponed to the next part-session in Brussels."
"As you said Mrs Muscardini, the English text is the correct one."
"The competent authorities will be informed of the matter and I can tell you that you will be able to have the text in all languages before the vote."
"Mr President, I would just like to know which version will be given to the press."
"The correct one?"
"Or do the press already have the wrong one?"
"We cannot continue to conduct national politics from the Chamber of the European Parliament!"
"Mrs Muscardini, I do not know the answer to your question."
"If you want to initiate formal investigation proceedings then you can."
"If not, we will proceed to the vote."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"Mr President, a decision of mine is at the source of this vote: for some it is a merit, for others a fault."
"The problem is that the European Parliament delegation in the Conciliation Committee was split down the middle: seven in favour and seven against."
"My choice could have been political – to toe the group line – and, in this case, the legislative procedure would have resulted in no action, that is to say no directive."
"However, I based my decision on an institutional need: with the delegation split down the middle, I thought that, as chairman, the decision should be referred back to plenary and I answered no to the question ‘Is it right that a legislative procedure should result in the rejection of measure by such a small margin when the delegation is split down the middle?’"
"It is better for the decision to be taken in a transparent way by Parliament."
"It may well be that this decision – which was, I assure you, a difficult, tough decision to make – is wrong, but I wanted to tell you the reasons why I acted in this way."
"I would like to add, Mr President, that, consistently with the institutional vote, I will abstain today."
"Finally, I would like to thank the European Parliament delegation for its passionate, very discerning work in the Conciliation Committee."
". – Mr President, solely in my capacity as rapporteur, I would like to thank the Vice-President, Mr Imbeni."
"We worked together very well."
"There are differences of opinion as to whether the result is very good or very bad, but I am grateful to the Vice-President."
"Together we tried to bring out what was best for Parliament."
". – Mr President, in view of yesterday evening’s statement by the Commission, which went a long way towards acceding to Parliament’s wishes on this issue, I too would like to recommend that we hold a full vote, including on the legislative proposal."
"– Mr President, with the agreement of the rapporteur, Mrs Rühle, I ask that the network of Europe Houses be included among the activities to be supported."
"Mr President, with these proposals, we wish to see two international agreements implemented on Persistent Organic Pollutants, otherwise known as POPs."
"The term designates a broad range of very harmful substances that are to be found everywhere. They have even been found in Commissioner Wallström’s blood."
"By that I mean they are in everyone, and they affect the environment and our health, even in extremely small concentrations."
"The international agreements we are now entering into are there to ensure that some of the world’s most poisonous substances are phased out through measures to eliminate them and through controls on their use, import and export, as well as on emissions from them."
"I have a couple of comments on the legal basis in the original proposal by the Commission, which recommended both Articles 95 and 175."
"Since the Stockholm Convention itself refers to the environment and public health, the point of departure must be the environment, and we have therefore chosen to bet on its being Article 175, namely the environment article, that will be used."
"I also just want to emphasise that the two binding agreements mean that we must completely eliminate these poisonous substances."
"This means that we must proceed on the basis of the precautionary principle."
"We must ensure that the procedure for adding new POPs to the list of banned substances is as uncomplicated as possible."
"We must ensure that we stick to the existing stocks on the basis of the ‘polluter pays’ principle."
"We must ensure that we do not produce unintended POPs through waste incineration."
"It means that we in Europe must reduce the quantity of waste, partly through sorting and partly through recycling."
"Finally, we must also ensure that the developing countries are in a position to comply with these agreements, which also cover, for example, DDT."
"It means that we must be willing to guarantee research into, and the development of, new substances that can be used and that do not have harmful effects."
"I want to recommend that you vote in favour of the proposal, and I wish to thank you for your constructive cooperation, as well as my fellow MEPs for their own solid and very constructive cooperation."
"(1)"
"(2)"
". After the words ‘neighbourhood policy’ the words ‘is not least’ need to be added."
"I think we all agree on that."
"(3)"
"Mr President, I should like to move an oral amendment to Amendment 2, so that it would read: '... the increase in cooperation and interoperability in the field of European defence...'."
". – Mr President, I simply wished to say that, as rapporteur, I oppose this oral amendment, because the same group tabled this amendment to recital b) of the report."
"I wish to say that either of these amendments changes the meaning of the original recital b), which won the majority of votes in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and which still, therefore, warrants my support as rapporteur."
"I am talking here about the original wording of recital b)."
"– We broadly agree with the criticism made of the proposal for a European Parliament recommendation on SIS II as to its effects on safeguards for citizens’ fundamental rights (protection of data and privacy) and to the growing use of the SIS as a tool for police cooperation, in an increasingly supranational context without any proper checks."
"Our main reasons for rejecting this proposal are:"
"- the extension of SIS II to encompass new areas and functions, allowing undefined users – possibly even private operators;"
"- a confused and obscure jumble, out of which emerges an exaggerated and accelerated (ultra)federalist approach: for example, the prospect of creating a single and centralised ‘EU information system’ – a real ‘Big Brother’;"
"- a dangerous approach to cooperation with third countries, particularly with the USA and its ‘war on terrorism’;"
"- inadequate and poorly-defined data protection."
"What is more crucial for the moment is keeping the system strictly within the limits for which it was created, not providing third countries access to information, ensuring that national bodies protect their data, in line with the national regulations that apply in each State, and opening a debate on the system, by introducing a moratorium."
"–.I voted in favour, although I am afraid that some of the lines suggested for reforming the current management model of the Schengen Information System (SIS) could lead either to excessive monitoring – which would limit citizens’ freedom of movement – or to excesses in the activities of this System."
"I believe that a solution could involve proposing to create a European agency steered by a management board composed of representatives of the European institutions and Member States, and financed entirely from the EU budget and subject to control by the European Parliament."
"This would give us much greater balance between ensuring security and the freedom of movement of persons and goods, and also in the checks carried out by States at their own borders."
"Bearing in mind the new reality that has emerged since 11 September 2001, the proper use of our monitoring and information-sharing mechanisms for monitoring our borders – in particular the new technologies – must be guaranteed."
"One issue of particular concern is the streamlining of the collective security instruments that are the subject of this proposal."
"On this point I have confidence that access for a greater number of authorities to SIS data will be moderate and rigorous and feel certain that only clearly indicated bodies (Europol, Eurojust and Police Authorities) will be able to access it and that the justification for this access will be objective and documented, in addition..."
"– Mr President, formally, the issue of self-handling received the most attentionduring the debate on the Directive on market access to port services."
"This is justified, as it can have a major social impact."
"In the process, however, we lost sight of the fact that the issue of self-handling cannot be considered separately from the policy on authorisations, since the Member States can make self-handling subject to prior authorisation."
"It is regrettable that we have missed the opportunity of communitising authorisations policy."
"A new competitive battle now threatens to be joined between ports imposing stricter criteria and those with less strict criteria, and likewise when it comes to issuing authorisations."
"The draft directive on market access to port services, which was the subject of the Jarzembowski report, was designed to provide a transparent legal framework governing commercial services provided to users of seaports in exchange for payment and to open these services to competition."
"This was an excellent aim, and it should serve to make French ports more competitive."
"Nevertheless, the draft took very scant account of the safety and control matters, which are normally the preserve of the public authorities."
"In particular, pilotage services should not have been included within the scope of the planned directive."
"The final version of the text as it emerged from the Conciliation Committee brought some improvements in this respect, in that the competent authorities could now limit the provision of pilotage services to a single provider for safety reasons, and the limitation of the period of authorisation was abandoned."
"Lastly, the Member States were now free to decide whether or not to set a compulsory limit on the number of authorisations to provide port services."
"Even with these amendments, however, the proposed directive remained unsatisfactory."
"I personally abstained, and the draft was rejected by a narrow majority."
"We have already pronounced ourselves twice on the draft directive for the liberalisation of port services (cargo-handling, passenger services, pilotage, mooring and towing)."
"Hugely important interests are at stake: economic and financial interests, but above all social and human interests."
"Since our first vote on this matter, almost three years ago to the day, the French Socialists have fought to safeguard the public-service character of port services."
"After several amendment battles, we achieved significant progress, particularly in securing the exclusion of pilotage and mooring services from the scope of the directive."
"Having been unable to achieve the same success on cargo-handling, a service provided by dockers, by the time the second reading came round on 11 March 2003, we voted against a draft that is an integral part of the policy of relentlessly liberalising all modes of transport in Europe."
"Today, the draft on which we are called to pass judgment, in the form of the joint text resulting from the conciliation procedure between Parliament and the Commission, represents a very distinct regression on all the points we fought to improve."
"As it stands, this text is unacceptable."
". We welcome the rejection of the directive on ports."
"This result concludes an intense fight by unions in the sector which had our support and that of our political group as could be seen from the enormous demonstrations in front of the European Parliament in March of this year and in Barcelona and Rotterdam, in September, or even this week, with a petition containing over 16 000 workers’ signatures, in addition to the strikes, demonstrations and other actions."
"All of the sector’s unions opposed both this directive and the agreement reached at the conciliation meeting between the Council and Parliament, which has now been rejected."
"This was a further piece of the overall package contained in the so-called ‘Lisbon Strategy’, which seeks to speed up the process of liberalizations and of opening up the markets in various sectors, from postal services to port services."
"This constitutes not only a swingeing attack on the public sector, but also calls into question the very concept of public service."
"The agreement that has just been rejected would, by introducing the principle of self-handling, promote social dumping and the gradual erosion of the salary and working conditions of the cargo handlers."
"The agreement failed to acknowledge the public service nature of port services, and left everything to be determined by the law of the market and by the primacy of competition."
"It did not even accept the system of prior authorisation for service providers."
"For months Brussels and the governments have been indifferent to the fate of the employees of European port services, particularly the cargo handlers in French ports."
"It is the latter, first and foremost, who will pay the high price for this miserable ultraliberal, antinational and antisocial offensive that has been launched against an unjustly stigmatised trade."
"The supposed ‘guarantees’ that have been introduced to restrict the right of carriers to handle their own cargo do not fool anyone; this provision, desired and prepared by the powerful shipping lobby, is designed to ensure the imminent disappearance of cargo handlers from European ports."
"More precisely, the directive that has happily been rejected today would have opened the door wide to mass recruitment of foreign workers from third countries, an influx of cheap labour intended to replace the men and women whose professionalism and devotion to duty guarantee the competitiveness of our ports."
"With the complicity of increasingly antinationalist governments, and especially the French authorities, Brussels is brutally imposing its Euro-globalist ideology of open markets, along with its corollary, preferential employment of foreign labour."
"Anxious to defend the interests of French workers above anything else, the vehemently reiterates its opposition to this scandalous piece of draft legislation."
"This is why the Members from the have voted against the Jarzembowski report."
"The European Commission is pursuing its efforts to construct an area of unbridled global free trade in which the workers of the South, with no competitive advantage but their poverty, are used as a weapon against the workers of the northern hemisphere."
"This regression strategy, which has already hit the men and women who work in our textile, leather, steel, coal and electronics industries, not to mention our rural populations, is now being applied to the service sector – all in the name of ultraliberal globalism."
"This is why Brussels has targeted port services, cargo-handling, pilots and dockers."
"Disregarding the need for safety and prepared to dismantle the social progress achieved through a century of struggles, the ideologists of Euro-federalism and the Talibans of free trade want to man their merchant vessels, many of them sailing under flags of convenience, with immigrant labour from Asia and the developing world that will undertake all the work and services currently performed by French workers in ports from Sète to Bordeaux, from Marseilles to Dunkirk, Le Havre or Anvers."
"And so I, who represent the town of Sète in the European Parliament, and the movement led by Jean-Marie Le Pen say no to this policy of the slave shippers of global free trade, which is the scourge of nations."
".I welcome the outcome achieved in conciliation and declared my favourable vote in writing."
"Throughout this complex process, the text has changed considerably, from one that was very negative on crucial aspects to one that provides balanced solutions that would lead to clearer and more transparent rules on access to the port services market."
"For those who want to access this market, of course."
"The controversial ‘self-handling’ would be restricted to being undertaken only by the ship’s own crew and in coordination with the competent port operator."
"In the case of pilotage, the Member States would be given the necessary leeway for granting the necessary authorisation for tough rules and qualifications."
"Finally, the broad framework of the principle of subsidiarity would be respected."
"Every single port or port facility would be obliged to provide information on its own financial relations, thereby avoiding distortions of competition."
"I therefore believe that this was a positive outcome – of course the outcome that was possible, given the make-up of the interests in question and of the controversy the issue has stirred up."
"I regret that conciliation has been rejected by a slim majority."
"I am afraid that we will return to the worst stage of this process, delaying port development for years."
"I am also surprised that, in the final vote, more than a dozen voting machines – all belonging to Members who were voting in favour – stopped working for some strange reason and that, despite their immediate complaints, the President did not restart the vote."
"The Members from the approve the aim of transparency with regard to access to port services."
"The companies operating in the domain of port services must enjoy full equality of treatment."
"Nevertheless, we remain deeply attached to the safety of our ports."
"In the absence of sufficiently strict rules and sufficiently rigorous selection criteria, a number of operations where safety is of the essence, particularly in the realms of cargo-handling and pilotage, could be entrusted by rather unscrupulous ship owners to badly trained and underpaid crew members, which would turn our ports into veritable ports of convenience."
"Because of our fierce opposition to this aberration, we have voted against the measures proposed by the Conciliation Committee, which are liable to encourage disruption in those services with a direct bearing on the safety of our ports."
"In particular, we believe that pilotage constitutes a public service whose function is to guarantee maritime safety and is not therefore one of the activities whose purpose is the organisation of services with commercial value."
"Barely a year after the wreck of the , we strongly condemn the common attitude of the Commission, Parliament and the Council, which is paving the way for a misguided relaxation of the risk-management effort in our ports."
"By a majority of 229 votes to 209, we have rejected the Jarzembowski report. Had we approved it, we should have run the risk of seeing disasters like those involving the , the or the , which have hitherto occurred exclusively in offshore waters, starting to happen within the confines of our European ports."
"I welcome the rejection of this directive."
"In practice, it would have achieved nothing more or less than a proliferation of ports of convenience and widespread social dumping, to the detriment of safety, the workforce and the environment."
"It would have authorised shippers to use inexperienced, untrained and temporary labour to handle their own cargo."
"It would have undermined the terms of employment of port employees, especially of dockers. The same applies to employees in other trades, such as pilots, tug masters and inshore pilots, the quality and independence of whose services were jeopardised by the draft directive."
"The dockers had put us on guard against the dangers of this directive with a wave of Europe-wide strikes."
"Within a single week, more than 20 000 signatures were collected on a European petition against the liberalisation of port services, reflecting the anxiety of everyone in the sector."
"It is up to us politicians to continue listening to these professionals and to develop public port services on a European scale, which are the only possible guarantor of safety, legality, continuity and quality, of the preservation of past achievements in the field of social welfare and of respect for the environment."
"Let us hope that this defeat for the advocates of liberalism will be decisive and not merely a temporary respite."
"Yes to liberalisation, but on the right terms."
"I am in favour of opening port services to competition, subject to conditions, which ensure satisfactory safety standards."
"I chose to abstain on the compromise that emerged from the conciliation procedure, because the result of the interinstitutional negotiations fail to reflect the work that has been done over a period of more than two years."
"Had the text been approved as it now stands, port services would have been opened to competition on terms which were far removed from the reality of seaport operations and, more seriously, which were detrimental to maritime safety."
"On the issue of self-handling, there should have been a provision designed to guarantee that each of the handling services would be performed by suitably qualified staff, but the draft in its present form contains no such provision."
"I am in favour of gradual opening of port services to competition, and I am convinced of its beneficial economic effects, but all these things have to be properly prepared."
"As the elected representative of a coastal city, I do not consider that the proposed directive was worded in such a way that it corresponded to the actual situation on the ground."
"This radical change in the life of seaports has to be prepared differently. Ideally, each port service should be the subject of a specific instrument rather than being crammed into an ‘all-inclusive’ package like this latest proposal."
"I hope that the Commission’s future proposals will be based on this different approach."
"Mr President, I wanted to mention that the majority of my political group abstained or voted against the report, because the final result was not what we wished for as the continuation of efforts towards a Community action plan for women's organisations in the field of equality."
"The proposal which came from plenary was not what we wanted."
"We want there to be equal distribution and equal rights between women's organisations."
"We recognise that the role and the work of the European Women's Lobby need to be safeguarded but, at the same time, other organisations also need to be given the opportunity to have a viable action programme."
"This did not come out of Parliament's proposal; on the contrary, Parliament maintains that there must be discriminatory treatment between organisations and that organisations which do not belong to the European Women's Lobby should be in a ‘second category’."
"That is not our proposal, which is why we did not accept the final result."
"We consider that this programme is an opportunity to show that we believe in pluralism and in the variety of aims and concerns of women's organisations and to give them the opportunity, on a basis of equality and non-discrimination, to express their richness."
"We believe that it constitutes a basic support for our democracy and our political group will continue to work in this direction."
"The principle of subsidiarity is important to us."
"We want to see a limited and efficient EU dealing with cross-border problems."
"To the extent that equality is a political issue, we believe that it is an area of responsibility for the Member States."
"Consequently, we do not want the EU to use its budget for distributing funds to organisations concerned with gender equality."
"We have therefore abstained from voting on this matter."
"I congratulate Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou on her excellent report on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a Community action programme to promote organisations active at European level in the field of equality between men and women, which I fully support, in particular as regards the need for this programme to ensure that the various women’s organisations undertake high-quality actions that are extended for as long as it takes for them to achieve their aim."
"I also wish to emphasise that implementing this programme must not lead to cuts in other programmes or funds that implement annual priority issues set by the Union in this field, such as wage equality, participation in decision-making and reconciling working life with family life."
"I voted in favour of the rapporteur’s amendments geared towards significantly improving the Commission text."
"I condemn the existence of mechanisms attributing uniqueness, which create situations of privilege and of discrimination that breach fundamental rights themselves, specifically those enshrined in the Charter on Fundamental Rights, since these mechanisms impose conditions on or even run counter to the basic principles of social structures."
"This fact has been referred to by various women’s organisations working in this field at European level and who feel discriminated against."
"In particular, I would highlight Amendment 4, in the hope that the final text of the decision will move broadly in this direction."
"All the rules that give the European Women’s Lobby an advantage over other organisations are politically iniquitous and legally questionable."
"I agree in particular with Mrs Lulling’s speech in the debate."
"I am all in favour of women’s organisations receiving funding, but as in all other sectors, we must guarantee and promote the plurality of specific interests and of a specific vision for women."
"In light of the votes in the specialised committee, I felt bound to vote against the report in the overall vote and will wait for the second reading."
"I voted against the report as a whole and thus supported the rapporteur from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou."
"There is still unfair treatment when it comes to distributing financial aid between those organisations that are part of the European Women’s Lobby and those that have chosen not to join this umbrella organisation."
"Even though, thanks to action by the Christian Democrats, the monopoly situation no longer exists, the European Parliament and the Commission want to continue to discriminate against women’s organisations outside the European Women’s Lobby by imposing special application requirements and by only approving such activities as are carried out by organisations that combat the abuse of women."
"I find that unjust and difficult to understand, and I recommend fair and equal treatment."
"..Like the rapporteur, I believe that transferring the financing of the administrative costs related to the activity of the Special Coordinator for South-East Europe and the corresponding office to the first pillar of the Union's activity should be done with ‘respect …[for] the competence of each Institution and should facilitate reinforcing the political accompaniment and monitoring of the Stability Pact's activity by the European Union institutions, in order to ensure that it will be complementary with the Stabilisation and Association Process.’"
"In this context and given the importance of the task, I support the proposal that the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy should have the opportunity to hold a hearing for the person nominated by the Commission and have the option of ratifying or rejecting this nomination."
"The aim of the amendments proposed is consequently to ensure the participation of the European Parliament in this decision-making process for nominating a Special Coordinator and to establish a deadline for the duration of the term of office of the appointee."
"I am interested in the rapporteur’s proposal that the ‘Stability Pact for South-East Europe’ could become a permanent task for the European Union, with the ensuing creation of new, permanent administrative structures, although the adequacy, proportionality and feasibility of this proposal will need to be evaluated in light of the stated aims."
"I voted in favour."
"We in the Moderate Party have always been of the view that non-profit-making organisations are more efficient than state organisations at the job of combating destitution and hardship in the non-industrialised world."
"Earmarked funds are, as a rule, made better use of through such arrangements."
"The same reasoning naturally applies also to the EU’s development work and reciprocal cooperation with developing countries."
"We have therefore voted in favour of the report."
"Organisations receiving EU aid must nonetheless be selected objectively and without bias."
".I voted in favour of the report because I believe that the amendments tabled by the rapporteur improve the wording of the Commission proposal, by introducing criteria that are feasible, rational and, at the same time, humane."
"Although, on the one hand, there is an attempt to avoid the duplication of spending and to improve the coordination of activities in order to prevent wasted efforts and expenditure, on the other, the report takes particular care to ensure that the dignity of the human person – something that is so neglected in the least-developed regions – is given the respect it deserves, as well as reciprocal knowledge and understanding, factors that should govern all Union policies towards third peoples and States."
"I agree with the rapporteur’s statement that dialogue between cultures and civilisations now, more than ever, has a crucial role to play in ensuring peace and stability in the world."
"The same applies to universal respect for human rights."
"I would emphasise the programme’s geographical coverage, because this should facilitate closer dialogue with the countries of Africa and Latin America (the ALA countries), the countries of the euro-Mediterranean partnership (MEDA countries), the countries of the former USSR (TACIS countries), the countries of the former Yugoslavia (CARDS countries) and the candidate countries."
"The big challenge now faced by the EU is to bring about national understanding for cross-border measures and European cooperation, arising from the insight that a national perspective is not enough where every issue is concerned."
"There must be an integrated approach to the European issue, taking place at European level and within the national parties and civil society, and the issue must, above all, be a part of the political consciousness of Europeans."
"If people’s perception is that politicians and administrators are producing propaganda-style material, this may damage the European idea."
"Understanding should instead be brought about in relation to those issues that people confront in their everyday lives and that they see as being impossible to resolve on the basis of a national perspective."
"There is also always a risk of arbitrariness in determining and distributing this type of public aid."
"We therefore choose to abstain from voting on this matter."
".I congratulate MrsRühle on the report she has drawn up on a proposal for a Council decision establishing a Community action programme to promote active Community citizenship, to which I give my vote, in particular because of the need to support organisations working in the field of promoting active European citizenship."
"I also wish to emphasise that it is not enough to develop the concept of citizenship from a legal point of view in order to exercise the rights permitted by the Community ."
"The citizens must be involved in developing the European project and must be brought closer to the European reality."
"Attaining this objective will specifically require fully and effectively disseminating the Union’s values and objectives, using the media for example and involving the Community’s citizens in discussions and debates on European integration, relying on the multiplier effect of passing on their views."
"I would also like to emphasise that promoting active citizenship must be undertaken for all of the Union’s citizens, by no means overlooking those who live in regions that are far from the centre of Europe, particularly the citizens of the outermost regions."
"–. I supported this report, although I feel that the problem often lies elsewhere and is basically of a more general political nature."
"I already made some observations on the technical aspects in my speech during the debate in plenary."
"I do, however, wish to criticise the blatant favouritism in the process of identifying organisations to benefit from generous Community financial support, which apart from being discriminatory and contrary to a proper understanding of fundamental rights, is totally counterproductive."
"Such an approach alienates the citizens and increases their suspicion instead of bringing them closer."
"The scant interest on the part of European citizens in European issues clearly reveals the urgent need to adapt some variables and to revise fundamental policies and attitudes."
"–.The concept of ‘European citizenship’ must not be an exclusively legal argument."
"Dialogue between the citizens and the European institutions must be enhanced and the intermediate structures linking citizens with the European Union and its institutions - ‘the media, national parliaments’, etc... must be strengthened."
"To this end I would emphasise the need to continue to support town-‘twinning’ schemes between the various peoples of the Union given the important role that these have in promoting civic identity and mutual understanding between the peoples of Europe."
"It is important to ensure that adequate and sustainable funding is provided to support twinning."
"–.As I have said on so many other occasions, I support measures that make an effective and active contribution to raising environmental quality standards."
"This proposal seeks to protect human health and the environment from persistent organic pollutants (POPs), which are chemical substances that remain in the environment, accumulate in living organisms through the trophic network – a complex networked interaction of the food chains – and therefore risk having harmful and particularly prolonged effects on human health and the environment."
"These pollutants are transported far from their source, cross international borders and can even affect regions in which they have never been used or produced."
"These proposals address the integration of these two international agreements into the Community legal framework."
"As regards the Stockholm Convention, on the basis of its signing by the European Union and all its Member States on 22 May 2001."
"This warrants my full support."
"Mr President, on behalf of my Group, I would like to underline that we support this resolution very strongly."
"At the Intergovernmental Conference, different governments have already tabled many amendments to the draft Constitution."
"This is already creating the danger that the draft Constitution will unravel as different bits are taken away by different governments objecting to different points."
"On top of that, sectoral councils different Council formations with different sectoral ministers are suddenly coming in with new proposals half-way through an IGC."
"These proposals focus on the particular sectors of the ministers involved, and do not take an overall view."
"This, for the first time, suggests that the budgetary powers of this Parliament should be in comparison with their current status."
"We consider this to be an alarming and unacceptable way of proceeding."
"These positions were not staked out by any single government either at the beginning or end of the Convention, or at the beginning of the IGC."
"To have sectoral ministers suddenly, in the middle of the IGC, coming up with new points that were not even listed by their own governments as issues for discussion in the IGC represents a new threat and a new danger."
"That is why my Group as a whole vigorously supported the resolution that we have just adopted."
"The European Parliament is furious about the initiative taken by the national ministers of finance, who have asked the Intergovernmental Conference to undertake a radical revision of the budgetary provisions of the draft European Constitution."
"According to Parliament, the ministers want to diminish its powers and restore those of the Member States."
"In fact, there is more reason to be furious about the draft produced by the Convention, which managed, under the tutelage of the European institutions, to enshrine a huge increase in the budgetary powers of the European Parliament in its articles on the finances of the Union, giving it the same powers as a national parliament, with the exception of the power to levy taxes; moreover, it charged the Council to legislate on the ‘modalities’ relating to the Union's own resources, thereby leaving the door ajar for further developments in the direction of tax-raising powers."
"To the extent that the Union is funded by its Member States – an excellent rule – it is only right and proper that they should have the last word on the budget, or at least on the multi-annual financial framework."
"If this were not so, the European Parliament would be free to vote for expenditure matching its inflated perception of its own powers."
"We therefore consider the finance ministers’ initiative to be justified, and so we refused to vote for the resolution of the European Parliament."
". Conservative MEPs and MEPs from the Moderate Party believe that the financial perspective should be decided upon by Member States in unanimity and that the European Parliament should not be involved in this process."
"However, once the financial perspective has been fixed, we believe that the European Parliament and the Council should have an equal say in deciding how the money should be spent."
"."
"We have rejected this attempt to impose a pseudo-constitutional process to legitimise the Convention document and we disagree with the support expressed for the financial provisions it establishes."
"These provisions seek to achieve a major change as regards substance in relation to the existing Treaty, by including the financial perspective and the budgetary discharge in the so-called ‘Constitution’."
"In other words, they wish to transform the current interinstitutional agreement and to ‘constitutionalise’ the financial perspective, erecting a more substantial barrier, not only to its revision or modification, but also making approval of the annual budget dependent on the upper limit of the financial perspective, as stated clearly in the reading of Article 52(5) and Article 54(3) and of the provisions of Article III-308."
"We have always argued for financial perspectives that safeguard the principle of economic and social cohesion in an enlarged EU and we must not forget that today’s budget is the lowest since 1987, in relative terms, in other words, less than 1% of Community GNI, which makes a revision of the financial perspectives necessary."
"As to the amendment relating to the referendum on the results of the IGC, I wish to say that our vote in favour of the referendum is unambiguous and makes it clear that we are against a European referendum or a referendum on the same day as the European elections and that we demand that the constitutional rules of the Member States be respected."
".– EU policy towards the other countries of the Mediterranean is becoming more and more aggressive."
"Its basic objective is to turn these countries into its satellites, penetrate their markets and exploit their people and wealth."
"To be specific, the ΕU is calling for alignment on issues of 'terrorism', judicial and police cooperation, even participation in its actions within the framework of foreign policy and defence policy, offering training for the necessary political and military staff."
"At the same time, it is demanding privatisation and liberalisation, even in the service sector, while promising investments solely in the private sector."
"As if that were not enough, it is trying to force through immigrant expulsion agreements."
"Under these circumstances, talk of dialogue between civilisations sounds ridiculous and we wonder what purpose the proposed parliamentary conference will serve."
"The European Parliament resolution sticks to this line and, while giving lessons about human rights, says not a word about their flagrant violation in Turkey or about the occupation of Cyprus, while Palestine is dealt with in the usual way of sitting on the fence between sacrificer and victim."
"It is more than clear that the development of the Mediterranean will not come about through cooperation with the ΕU."
"That is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the resolution."
".– The issue here is the revival of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership."
"The people who live around the Mediterranean have needed no vote by a European Parliament to establish relations among each other, as they have done since time immemorial."
"For thousands of years, the Mediterranean has not been an obstacle, but a link between peoples."
"It is significant, however, that in this, the twenty-first century, where the means exist whereby humanity may form one united and fraternal community, society is going backwards."
"Now that the Mediterranean is no longer a physical obstacle as such, thanks to modern transport facilities, it is being surrounded by legal and material barbed wire."
"Those who live in the southern Mediterranean, in Morocco, governed by ‘our friend, the King’, in Algeria, governed by the dual dictatorship of the military and Islamic fundamentalists, in Tunisia, which only French diplomats consider to be democratic, find it increasingly difficult simply to come to France despite the fact that there are a thousand links between these peoples of the southern and northern Mediterranean."
"Therefore, if we want to talk about a ‘Euro-Mediterranean partnership’, the least we can do is to allow those from the Maghreb who live in France to live there with dignity, as human beings in the twenty-first century, whether they are there legally or illegally."
"They should be granted all civil rights, in particular the right to vote and the right to move freely throughout the European Union."
"Rather than opening the borders between EU countries slightly only to close them even tighter on the outside, Europe must be an open Europe that shares its resources with the peoples of these countries, which it pillaged, colonised and exploited for so long."
"–.The resolution contains points with which I agree, specifically the aim of establishing ‘genuinely equitable cooperation’ in the Mediterranean, support for ‘those Israelis and Palestinians who are working for a fair and equitable settlement to the conflict’, ‘opposition to the practice of the death penalty’ and establishing a moratorium or the active commitment of the EU to ‘settling the conflict in the Western Sahara’."
"I must emphasise, however, that, amongst other aspects:"
"- the resolution advocates a ‘policy of economic openness and of internal liberalisation in third countries’ and urges ‘extending the processes of South-South cooperation as the sole means of achieving a genuine free trade area’, which is the real dogma of neoliberal capitalism;"
"- it defends the EU’s current repressive policy on immigration, when it suggests as a priority measure ‘stepping up efforts for readmission to countries of origin and of transit’, and rejects amendments tabled by my group condemning the recent creation of ‘European charters’ for expelling foreigners. Let us remember that such action is prohibited under the European Convention of Human Rights;"
"- the resolution does not criticise the Israeli Government’s policy of occupying Palestine and of repressing the Palestinian people."
"Hence my vote against."
".I voted in favour of theresolution on EUROMED, because I believe we should also look to the South, where the Mediterranean, North Africa, and the Middle East are of the utmost importance to the European Union and not only for reasons of geography."
"Our political and strategic partnership must, therefore, definitely go beyond the economic and financial level and attempt to bridge the gulf that exists between current living standards in the various parts of the Mediterranean."
"Contributing to the privatisation of economies, to support for small and medium-sized businesses that create employment, which help to stabilise immigration in the countries of origin, and contributing to eliminating illiteracy, accepting education as one of the most important factors for development, and increasing cooperation in the field of justice, the fight against drugs, organised crime and terrorism, constitute key priorities that add to the dialogue between cultures and civilizations."
"Much, therefore, remains to be done, starting with the institutionalisation of the Euro-Mediterranean parliamentary assembly."
"I hope, then, that the Naples Ministerial Conference is a success."
".– This joint motion for a resolution contains both good and bad."
"There are some protests against the war that Putin is leading in Chechnya but also self-congratulations on the progress made in the area of police cooperation, not to mention the hope that ‘the progress made in Russia to create a positive environment for the development of trade and investment by Russian and foreign companies’ will continue."
"We voted in favour of the amendments that protest against the war in Chechnya and abstained on the remainder of the resolution."
"It should be remembered that while the European Parliament is getting ready to speak out against ‘the human rights violations in Chechnya’, the European Heads of State, from Berlusconi to Chirac, are falling over each other to play host to Putin."
"It is true that ‘birds of a feather stick together’ and that the major Western states have as many and more wars of oppression to their name as Russia."
". Russia is undoubtedly a country of considerable strategic importance, not only in terms of developing democratic values, but also of enhancing the Common European Economic Area."
"We must not, however, allow our view of Russia as a partner or even an ally to prevent us from genuinely addressing any potential problems there."
"Without wishing for a moment to challenge Russia’s territorial integrity or sovereignty, the fact is that there are some issues to which we cannot simply turn a blind eye."
"Our concern at the current crisis in Chechnya, with the steady stream of reports of serious human rights breaches, obliges us to keep this as a special item on the European agenda and to ask the Russian authorities to reopen negotiations with all the parties involved, in order to reach a political solution to the conflict."
"Although this issue was not covered by the conclusions of the latest EU-Russia Summit, its inclusion in the European Parliament motion for a resolution determined my vote in favour, because the paragraph criticising the Italian presidency, which could have turned my final vote the other way, was voted on separately, and I was therefore able to express my opposition to it."
", . – The Commission communication and the Napoletano report follow on from and specify the Solana doctrine presented at the Thessaloniki summit setting the priorities for the Union's foreign policy."
"Following enlargement, within the framework of competition with the USA to divide up the planet, the ΕU is seeking to control its new eastern and southern neighbours."
"The texts impudently talk about creating a 'circle of cooperation' at a time when they contain direct or indirect coercion and the stick follows the carrot."
"For example, for the areas of Transnistria and Moldova, which are seen as sources of instability, ideas are being examined to send even military forces, while in the Ukraine, the carrot of aspiration to join the European Union is offered in order to stop it joining the ΚΕΚ."
"The prospect of creating a Free Trade Area is also offered, provided that they liberalise their markets and join the EU single market, in other words once the western European monopolies have been allowed to penetrate and plunder their economies."
"As far as border security is concerned, the position of the ΕU can be summarised as follows: electrified fences for immigrants and 'terrorists', open doors to trade."
"We are voting against the report, because it endorses the strengthening of the European Union's political and military interventionism, militates against the right of every people to choose their own path to social and economic development and adds new threats to peace."
"With the forthcoming enlargement, the future Member States of the European Union will come into contact with countries which, whilst sharing various strategies and partnerships with the EU, do not have any institutional link of a Community nature with the Union."
"This being the case, the stability and security of the entire European continent depends on better relations being developed between all its States: those of the European Union and its new neighbours on the one hand, and between these new neighbours, on the other."
"A policy of mutual good neighbourly relations is therefore not just desirable – it is crucial."
"Since there are no plans in the foreseeable future for further enlargements, despite the high expectations of many of the new neighbouring countries, and since enlargement is a politically distinct process, the aim must be to create an inclusive strategy for relations with the States neighbouring the enlarged Union which does not yet have an appropriate framework and it is consequently this framework that we are now addressing. As the rapporteur explained, the aim is to move beyond the approach of bilateral relations between the European Union and each of the countries in question, by promoting relations with all these countries as a whole, and at the same time by encouraging all of these countries to develop balanced and mutually beneficial relations amongst themselves."
"Consequently, I voted in favour of the report."
". For many years, Europe has promoted itself as a melting pot of many different cultures, whose constant intermeshing has had an impact throughout the world."
"Europe has grown, developed and finally united as a result of its fruitful relations with peoples and cultures from all over the world, starting, of course, with its closest neighbours."
"I therefore believe this communication by the European Commission to be of the utmost importance, because it is proof of the historic task and duty being fulfilled and I am very pleased to see this."
"I agree with the idea of creating areas of cooperation, as proposed in the report, that include policies devoted to human rights, democracy, civil society, education, research, culture, the movement of persons, judicial cooperation, the fight against terrorism, conflict prevention, the movement of goods, services and capital, employment, infrastructures and information and communication networks."
"The general conditions must therefore be established to enable us gradually to share common values and principles and, of course, well-being and progress with all the countries involved."
"I therefore voted in favour."
"I am delighted that the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, and now Parliament as a whole, has adopted paragraph 15 with its positive wording concerning European states’, especially Ukraine’s, future opportunities to become members of the EU."
"Originally, that was an amendment I tabled in the committee."
"I also welcome the fact that Parliament approved my Amendment 21, supported by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in its entirety and clearly condemning those ‘who use violence in the name of religion’."
"It is especially important to issue such repudiations in these times of Islamicist terrorist attacks such as those as recent as today’s attack on the British Consulate in Istanbul and the attack at the weekend on two Jewish synagogues in the same town."
". In good time, the Commission has submitted its communication on ‘Wider Europe’ and clarified how it might shape its relations with its ‘New Neighbours’ following enlargement in 2004."
"It is regrettable that the region of the Southern Caucasus is not included in it, even though we will have immediate external borders with it when Romania accedes to membership."
"It is not only from televised images of the post-election demonstrations in Georgia or the confusion in Azerbaijan, also following elections, that we know how explosive the situation in these countries is."
"When, too, the European Commission constantly stresses that Europe has more of a presence in these countries, is exerting greater influence and providing more financial support than is generally known, it is all the more surprising that this region is not even mentioned once in such an important document on the European Union’s future relations with its eastern neighbours."
"I am, then, all the more grateful to the rapporteur, Mrs Napoletano, and to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, for remedying these defects and, in their excellent report, making explicit reference to the Southern Caucasus region."
"I very much hope that the Commission will take Parliament’s demands seriously."
"Mr President, my Group voted against this report because we feel that this issue has been pushed and promoted by the arms industry."
"The rapporteur took offence at my saying this, but in reality you only have to look at the report and the conclusions of the Thessaloniki summit to see that it is clearly the arms industry in Europe who is setting the agenda and that everyone else is following."
"This is all about creating a European arms industry that can compete at an international level."
"It is about channelling our precious resources for research into producing weapons that are going to cause conflict in other parts of the world."
"The European Union space policy, for example, is heavily oriented towards security and defence applications such as signals."
"It is quite clear right down the line, that this is basically about promoting and supporting the arms industry."
"The CEO of the second largest aerospace and defence company in the world EADS has actually bemoaned the fact that the US already invests six times more than Europe in armaments research and that while the research budgets in the US continue to rise, those in Europe stagnate."
"That is something to be welcomed rather than criticised."
"We should be channelling our resources into something of greater benefit to mankind."
"He goes on to say that our defence industry is already at a serious competitive disadvantage, but the time has come for that industry to realise that it should move away from producing weapons that cause havoc around the world and start to produce something that will contribute to the betterment of society rather than to its destruction."
"Anyone who challenges my claim that this is basically aimed at the vested interests of the arms industry only has to look at what we voted on today and what the Council decided."
"There is absolutely no argument here."
"It is quite clear that this is at the behest of the arms industry."
"It is also quite clear from the rapporteur's report that this is the case."
"It is unacceptable."
"We believe that this is an incorrect use of resources."
".– The report which we have examined is a monument to warmongering rhetoric which reveals the real intentions of the ΕU to share the role of global policeman with the USA, while at the same time donating billions to the military/industrial complex."
"The text, without any trace of shame, laments the reduction in military orders after the end of the cold war."
"It is concerned about the 'failure of several Member States to spend more on defence', which 'may jeopardise the cohesion of ΝΑΤΟ', which 'remains not only a fundamental guarantee for the stability and security of the Euro-Atlantic area, but also an essential framework for developing joint operations'."
"It therefore calls for the development of a 'European defence equipment industry which is competitive and viable' in keeping with the decision taken at the Thessaloniki Council, the Solana letter and the European constitution, which obliges everyone to improve their military capabilities."
"Let this decision be the EC's answer to all those who deceive the world by saying that the ΕU is the guardian of world peace and that the objective of the common defence policy is to safeguard security."
"For them peace means war and security means repression."
"Needless to add that the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece condemn the warmongers and voted against the report."
".I support the report drawn up by my fellow countryman and friend Luís Queiró, because I agree with the need to adopt measures that will enable us to establish favourable conditions for developing a competitive and viable European defence equipment industry."
"Savings and added value can and must be found in the field of defence, by means of cooperation involving relations of ‘industrial and technological interdependence’ that help to ensure that defence spending is used more effectively and that overlapping is avoided."
"It is not reasonable that the situation seen in all the Member States of the European Union should continue, when their defence spending amounts to 50% of what the United States invests in order to obtain the equivalent of only 10% of the military capacities of that country, which is an ally of ours."
"The inadequacy of the means harnessed by the countries of the EU as a whole is not desirable either for Europe or for our allies in NATO."
"It is worth referring, moreover, to the greater responsibilities for managing civilian and military crises that the EU will have under the ESDP."
". The European Commission and the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy largely agree on a greater military role in the world for a united Europe, that is to say, intervention outside its own borders."
"That role should be backed up by a European arms industry producing standardised products."
"The Member States should spend more money on it."
"This report goes that little bit further again by calling for even deeper integration of the EU and NATO, by demanding money from the Structural Funds – which were intended for regional development – to fund arms programmes, and by proposing that the European arms trade no longer be held back by national controls."
"I note this with horror, partly because the envisaged combination of a strong European arms industry and free-market competition will result in people no longer wanting to remain dependent on European armies’ fluctuating need for new arms."
"New markets outside the EU will therefore be sought."
"A recent example of this is Belgian arms exports to Nepal, which enable the Nepalese army to commit preventive murders of poor farmers who might possibly at some stage be in a position to offer armed resistance."
"Even if employment and economy are allowed to take precedence over everything else, there are better ways to spend our tax revenues."
".I share the rapporteur’s position on Community policy in the field of defence equipment and congratulate him on the balance he has managed to achieve in an area of obvious importance and sensitivity, and which often provides the backdrop to the most deeply held differences of opinion."
"I believe that the approach adopted, which is one of cooperation, not of competition, between NATO and the European Union when it comes to their respective competences is one way of realistically and clearly viewing the common defence effort that, since 1949, has borne fruit."
"It is also a way of respecting the Member States that do not shy away from giving pride of place and importance to transatlantic relations and that wish to cherish the Atlantic Alliance rather than destroy it."
"Strengthening and streamlining the European defence equipment industry with a view to creating a competitive European market for defence equipment is an aim that could be justified by the need to streamline its funding, to harmonise regulations on equipment, to exercise political and parliamentary control and to engage in research and development, provided that, in practice, genuine competitiveness is maintained in the fields of defence and security and provided that we fight against operational centralism and industrial concentration, which would inevitably benefit the countries with the best defence equipment and technologies."
"This report consequently enables us to offer Member States a solid framework for discussion which, whilst taking account of the differing interests of the Member States in ESDP..."
"The overall tenor of the Commission’s proposal is constructive."
"The EU must make a better job of coordinating the production of defence equipment between the Member States."
"Taxpayers would thus get more from their taxes."
"I was unable, however, to support paragraph 12, which says that ‘Community support programmes should be set up to review defence equipment’, and this in a context relating to the EU’s external borders."
"The EU is not at present a defence union, and it must not therefore be described as such, either."
"Parliament also proposes that increased orders of military equipment are needed ‘in order to ensure a safer world’."
"Certainly, international terrorism and other worldwide crime constitute an extensive threat to the Western democracies and to human dignity."
"By definition, this evil must not, however, be combated militarily in all situations, which is why I voted against recital G."
"The coordination of production and research between the EU Member States where defence equipment is concerned will hopefully lead to greater efficiency and better management of resources."
"That may in actual fact lead to the possibility of reducing military appropriations, without weakening military capability."
"Parliament’s conviction is that the appropriations should instead be increased."
"There is a need in the EU for a certain coordination of the use of resources in the area of military capability, and that is a task that we support."
"What, however, I cannot support is increased expenditure and investment in the defence area."
"I am also opposed to the idea of Community support programmes to review defence equipment."
"That is something I do not consider falls within the EU’s area of competence."
"We do not believe that a common body in the defence area constitutes a problem in principle, but it presupposes that cooperation be engaged in at an intergovernmental level."
"Defence issues are, and should be, ones about which the national parliaments have the sole right to take decisions."
".– The Queiró report defends a Europe that is totally at odds with the values I uphold."
"It ‘insists on the need for the EU to endow itself with military capabilities, so as to ensure the credibility of its foreign and defence policy objectives’, affirming that ‘if this project is to be successful, Member States must make a commitment to military expenditure over a period of time’."
"It ‘expresses its conviction that NATO remains not only a fundamental guarantee for the stability and security of the Euro-Atlantic area, but also an essential framework for developing joint operations’."
"It defends ‘the development of a European defence equipment industry which is competitive and viable’ and concludes that it is essential that ‘Community support programmes be set up to review defence equipment’."
"All of this is a vibrant plea for European militarism, defending the interests of arms dealers."
"I, myself, refuse to accept military competition, irrespective of the ‘bloc’ in question."
"I want to promote peace in the world, which leads to better living conditions."
"Those who justify the increase in defence expenditure are doing nothing to meet social needs; their key concern is the interests of their shareholders."
"That is why I voted against this report."
". In the Western Balkans, on the territory of the former Yugoslavia, there are still a great many unresolved problems in relations between the peoples living there."
"External interference in wars has contributed to this."
"Coercion by military means without power of persuasion does not provide the key to a democratic future."
"Foreign troops are still stationed in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia."
"An administrative status for the Republic of Serbia in northern Bosnia, for the areas inhabited by Croats on the south-western fringes of Bosnia, for Kosovo and for Albanian-speaking north-western Macedonia is still being put off until some future time."
"Lasting solutions that have genuine support among the inhabitants must be found, and quickly."
"The admission of areas of the Balkans to the EU while their administrative future is still contentious could potentially suck the whole of the EU into civil wars and their suppression."
"Although I do not subscribe to the approach of the rapporteur, Mr Lagendijk, on the military points, I believe that the strengths of his report lie in its opposition to the undermining of the International Criminal Court by the USA, its demands for equal rights for the Roma and its criticism of the humiliating visa regime."
"I also support his call for a speedy settlement of the permanent status of Kosovo on the basis of far-reaching autonomy or independence."
"Unlike those in my group who are abstaining on account of Kosovo, I support this report."
". The ΕU, having broken up Yugoslavia together with the Americans, is rudely blackmailing the countries which emerged and which are absolutely dependent on foreign aid, countries of a miserable protectorate."
"While they themselves set up the politically expedient International Criminal Court for the Former Yugoslavia, they are demanding that the authorities in these countries play the role of law and order authority and arrest and hand over other 'war criminals'."
"The report calls for agreements not to be signed with the USA which undermine the International Criminal Court, when the ΕU defends broadening trans-Atlantic relations and is currently haggling with the USA as to how and when it will succeed them every time they withdraw a division of their forces from the Balkans in order to turn them against some other people."
"Why this continuing interest on the part of the ΕU?"
"‘The stabilisation and association process countries’, as they are called, ’have become the most challenging test case for a mature and effective European common foreign and security policy’, the explanatory statement cynically admits."
"In other words, the countries of the Western Balkans are simply a test laboratory for the application of the CFSP."
"A laboratory constructed over the dead body of Yugoslavia!"
"That is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the report."
"–.On 16 June 2003, the Thessaloniki European Council adopted the Agenda for the Western Balkans and, a few days later, the Heads of State or Government of the EU, of the future Member States and of the countries of the Stabilisation and Association Process (SAP) issued a Joint Declaration on prospects for the SAP and for the accession of these countries to the European Union."
"This report considers the positions expressed in these initiatives, and its key component is the prospect of the future accession of the countries of South East Europe."
"It also aims to present clear guidelines for countries participating in the stabilisation and association process on the best way of addressing the challenges specific to each of these countries in their attempts to come closer to the European Union and in the context of the negotiations they have embarked on with the European Institutions."
"At a time when criteria are being presented to these States and standards are being set, we would do well to advise the Member States to show the same humility and the same capacity to accept criticism about the issues they raise and to think carefully about them, specifically in relation to protecting human life and to conducting active policies against corruption, organised crime and trafficking in human beings, weapons and drugs."
"The process of stabilisation and association that has been proposed could constitute an ambitious accession strategy, and it therefore won my vote."
".– The Lagendijk report supports the general direction of the Thessaloniki Joint Declaration of June 2003, to the effect that, ‘the preparation of the countries of South-East Europe for their future integration into the European structures is a major priority of the European Union.’"
"The Stabilisation and Association Process is considered to be a decisive stage in this respect."
"I, myself, do not have a ‘closed’ idea of European integration."
"We are steeped in hypocrisy here: should Bosnia-Herzegovina ‘take responsibility for its own development and rely less on the international community’?"
"We are waiting to see the results of the adverse social and institutional effects of an interminable protectorate that is producing what independent Bosnian researchers term a ‘dependency syndrome’."
"In addition, how can we talk about ‘neutrality’ while the EU’s economic, political and military actions have encouraged first Montenegro and then Kosovo to strive for independence, only to urge them subsequently to abandon the idea?"
"The first challenge is to do away with protectorates."
"This requires a critical assessment from the European Parliament, taking account of the opinions of the societies in question, of the choices and responsibilities of the EU and NATO."
"That is not the approach followed in this report, and for that reason I abstained."
"That concludes the vote."
"(4)"
"The next item is the debate on the oral question (B5-0413/2003) by Mr Rocard, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the current situation of the European networks and Info-Points."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, our committee has put down this oral question because our members, the public and the staff of the European Info-Points have learned that the Commission wrote to the Info-Points in September 2003, informing them that, with effect from 1 January 2004, the beginning of the election year, financial support for these information agencies, which are of such great importance to the public, was to be curtailed."
"This course of action amounts to closing down some 270 Info-Points in the European Union, each of which receives approximately EUR 20 000 per annum to support them in their work, but it does not, in principle, affect other Info-Points attached to other, larger institutional structures such as national or regional parliaments."
"I would like to start by pointing out that the Commission did not think it necessary to inform Parliament about this, whether by writing to it or within the framework of the Interinstitutional Information Group, which, as you will be aware, is composed of the chairmen of Parliament’s Committees and the Commissioners responsible for information and communications policy."
"I leave it to you to judge the quality of our interinstitutional relations!"
"In this instance, however, we are not dealing with a simple financial problem, such as often crops up with programmes or projects in other policy areas."
"This, on the other hand, is about a strict interpretation of the new Financial Regulation and about the serious consequences – for us and the Commission – resulting from such a rigorous application of this legal act."
"We are well aware that the new Financial Regulation that we adopted in this House, does not permit operating grants, but a solution must nevertheless be found to this grave problem so that the Info-Points affected can continue to work through 2004 and can continue to inform the public about the activities of the European Union and the work that we do on a daily basis."
"The Commission should be aware that the European elections, although they are often described as a matter for Parliament, are not only that; they are far more a process of active public participation in which the Commission should also join."
"The Info-Points and Carrefours make a substantial contribution to the European Union’s information and communications policy, and their significance should not be underestimated, particularly at a time when enlargement is within sight and in view of the continued and increasing need for information campaigns."
"The European elections and the signing of the EU’s new constitution are almost upon us, and need particular attention in addition to ongoing information on what is going on in the EU."
"These information offices, which are intended to address primarily the local population and people living in the regions, are indispensable, and so I would like to put three questions to you, and I would also like to urge you to answer them."
"What action will the Commission be taking to guarantee that the networks and Info-Points can carry on unhindered with their valuable work in a year that is to see both the European elections and the enlargement of the EU?"
"How will the Commission ensure the future provision of funding for this work? When will the Commission take a decision on the funding arrangements for the future?"
". I regret that Parliament was not informed."
"This is not within my portfolio but I am told it was not intentional, and would not want it to lead to any deterioration in the essential cooperation between our institutions."
"We recognise the acuteness of feelings, especially since the work of the information system and centres is of clear importance not only to Members of this House, but also to anyone committed to developing an understanding of the European Union, what it does and what it stands for."
"The honourable Member has made it clear that she, like many other Members, has criticisms of the Commission's decision to cancel from next year the operating grants hitherto provided to networks and Info-Points."
"I would therefore like to clarify exactly which information outlets we are dealing with, explain the nature, size and impact of the subsidies provided by the Commission to them and update her and the House on the Commission’s latest course of action in direct response to her question and the numerous questions and representations on this issue by Members of this House and others."
"There are currently more than a thousand grassroots public information relays and networks overseen by the Commission’s Directorate General for Press and Communication. They are housed in what are known as 'host structures', which are generally national, regional or local authorities, NGOs or universities."
"They include: 126 rural information and promotion Carrefours; 140 Info-Points Europe IPE in urban areas of the Union; nearly 800 European Documentation Centres EDC generally situated in large higher education establishments worldwide; and a network of around 500 experts in one or more areas of European Union policy as conference or other forms of public speakers known as 'Team Europe'."
"All of these public information relays receive support services in kind from the Commission."
"The main types of support are: free public documentation and publication: around 3 million copies a year and specialised assistance via a dedicated helpdesk at a cost of about EUR 1.5 million a year; free training for relay staff totalling about 800 person-days a year; access to an interactive intranet; and an exchange programme for relay staff with over 3 000 person-days a year."
"These services are designed to help the relays provide their correspondents with quick and up-to-date responses to their questions on EU policies, programmes and funding opportunities."
"They are not in jeopardy."
"It has long been the Commission’s intention not only to maintain such technical assistance but also to increase it."
"Meanwhile, it is important to note, in order to avoid any misunderstanding, that only the 266 host structures of the first two of these relays and networks – the IPEs and Carrefours – have ever received operating grants from the Commission since DG Press started overseeing them in 2001."
"They generally amount to about EUR 20 000 a year or EUR 5.4 million in total."
"In the majority of cases, the money given to the host structures has been supplemented by larger contributions provided from domestic resources."
"As the House is aware, the Financial Regulation that came into force on 1 January 2003 no longer permits direct operating subsidies to be awarded to external bodies without either a call for proposals or the establishment of a legal basis for expenditure."
"I would also add that, in its 2002 Activity Report, the Director-General of DG Press felt compelled to enter a reservation about the management of the relays because it was not possible to guarantee, with the resources at its disposal, proper monitoring and control of a relatively high number of small grants."
"Those misgivings were borne out by the recent findings of the Commission’s Internal Audit Service which recommended first, the development of different working methods and audit practices, second, the introduction of more appropriate management tools, and third, the improvement of the standard of agreements and the structure of the expenditure financed."
"The Commission therefore confirms that the proposal adopted on 29 September 2003 to terminate grants with effect from 2004 complied fully with the Financial Regulation and its implementing provisions."
"It was therefore right, in legal terms and for practical purposes."
"The Commission acknowledges, of course, that the decision provoked sharp reactions and protests from many national relay coordinators, several Member States, and several Members of this House."
"We understand the reasons but we also seek to abide by the letter and spirit of the law of the European Union."
"Further to the amendment to the 2004 draft budget tabled in this House, and placing in reserve the appropriations under three of the budget headings related to the activities of DG Press, the Commission was given the task of trying to reach an accommodation that, as far as possible, satisfied the demands for operational continuity sought by Parliament, whilst also securing financial monitoring and control."
"The Commission is aware of the particular political importance of the year ahead and, in response to the honourable Member’s question, I would make the following points."
"First, at our meeting on 11 November 2003, the Commission noted that we would have to take up the matter of host entities’ grants again, with a view to taking a final decision in the light of the outcome of the budget trialogue of 13 November."
"Second, in order to retain the current system for 2004, there would need to be a Commission decision providing for a waiver to the rule in the Financial Regulation that requires a call for proposals that is accompanied by adequate monitoring and control provisions tailored to the results of risk analysis and backed by a joint policy declaration by the three institutions."
"This solution would be justifiable for one year only, but may provide a kind of bridge that would ensure the continuity the honourable Member seeks."
"That proposed solution was subsequently examined by the budgetary trialogue and will now be formally presented for approval at the Conciliation Committee meeting of 24 November 2003."
"In response to the honourable Member’s third question, the Commission has instructed DG Press to formulate proposals that will ensure the proper availability of comprehensive information for citizens in the Union of 25 Member States."
"These proposals, to be set out in a communication that will hopefully be produced before Christmas, will build on the July 2002 communication on Information and Communication Strategy for the European Union, and will follow four principles for relay management set out in that communication: a more homogenous brand; a more streamlined and decentralised set of information outlets and networks; closer partnership with Member State authorities; and more interinstitutional cooperation."
"The relays act as a uniquely important bridge between the European Union’s policy-making mechanism and the citizens to whom we are all accountable."
"The Commission will therefore do its utmost to ensure that they continue to provide that facility at the dispersed centres throughout the Union, which obviously is one of the features that gives them their greatest value."
"Mr President, Mr Kinnock, I would like to thank you for being here to reply to this question and you will agree with me that certain measures have the virtue of inspiring unanimity, even if, as in this case, the unanimity is in favour of rejection."
"You will not find anybody in this House prepared to defend this removal, you do not do so and the Commission in no way does so, I would say again."
"We are in a peculiar situation, which is curious, because in an atmosphere of budgetary forecasts, such as the one we are in at the moment, with conciliation scheduled for next Monday, we are seeing the story of a lack of budgetary foresight, in other words, that regulation, which enters into force on 1 January 2003 and which has not received the attention of any Commission body until the communication of 29 September in which the issue of subsidies for information centres was considered settled."
"I will not insist on the importance of information centres, since Mr Kinnock himself has pointed it out – in your words, this is an essential element."
"This morning in the joint debate it was expressed by Mrs Rühle and Mrs Hieronymi, it has just been expressed by Mrs Prets and I believe that we should all be in agreement."
"Furthermore, the European Parliament has highlighted it on several occasions, such as in the report on information and communication policy which it was my honour to present to this House."
"In that report I pointed out that information centres were useful in terms of reaching all corners of the European Union and how they could be useful meeting points and instruments for the work of MEPs in their respective constituencies."
"Amendment 42 of the Rühle report, which the Commission opposed this morning, also stressed the importance of these information centres."
"The effects of removal have also been stressed by Mr Kinnock, in the sense that 270 may be deprived of subsidies and some 1000 would be affected."
"I therefore feel it is important to seek a transitional provision, such as that of maintaining a kind of phasing-out of these subsidies during 2004."
"Furthermore, I would like to analyse a certain contradiction between the Commission’s position in the Interinstitutional Group on information and its attitude in relation to information centres."
"On 23 September of this year, we attended a meeting of the Interinstitutional Group on information and we observed once again Commissioner Vitorino's enthusiasm with regard to the need to arbitrate these measures and to coordinate the actions of all instruments in view of the three fundamental challenges facing us; enlargement, the new Constitution and the European elections."
"Six days later, it published the communication we are debating."
"It is difficult to believe that there was no knowledge of it and that there could have been no mention of it in the Interinstitutional Group on information."
"Mr Vidal-Quadras, chairman of that information group, stressed it in a letter addressed personally to Commissioner Vitorino."
"I therefore believe that there is legitimate doubt about what we should believe most, his fine words or the firmness of his actions, and we believe that the two things should be coherent."
"In view of the need to seek a legal basis for the invitations for offers of participation, I would suggest to the Commission that it introduce three principles."
"Firstly, the simplification of the procedure – information centres are small units, they are not multinationals which can dedicate a unit to filling in thousands of forms in order to obtain subsidies or Community funds; secondly, the staff in these information centres should be given professional status, making them true information and communication professionals, and not simply auxiliary staff to hand out brochures – as Mr Kinnock has said; and, thirdly, the criterion of proportionality in order to provide a policy such as information and communication policy, which is essential to the future of the European Union, with sufficient means."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this debate is very important because, in fact, it raises the fundamental issue of the coherence of the European Union’s various instruments."
"It shows clearly that we can imagine the most innovative of policies possible, but when the budgetary machine is established, it is one-eyed."
"Mrs Bayona de Perogordo highlighted this. The assessment of all of us, since there is impressive unanimity on this point, is that we must compensate for the democratic deficit between us and the public."
"To a lesser extent, we should also compensate for the deficit as regards internal communication and information."
"I am a product of adult education and am convinced that knowledge and information are the key instruments of active and responsible citizenship, so I can only welcome the excellent work carried out by the Info-Points Europe."
"They are educational, they are innovative, they have a remarkable capacity for initiative and, above all, they enable us to raise awareness of Europe and to spread Europe’s messages to its citizens of all ages, all areas, and all cultures with a proximity that cannot be matched and that other institutions fail to match."
"I would also like to point out that it is because we provide a financial contribution that this is possible."
"In fact, we call on other powers to carry out this communication role for us."
"These other powers are local powers that are sensitive to the European question, naturally, but that might, if we do not make more effort, wish to return to their initial role and perhaps abandon this vital aspect."
"If the support we are going to be guaranteed for 2004 gave us the time to conceive arrangements for collaboration that enabled this system to continue on a permanent basis, that would indeed be effective."
"It would also enable us, since the other partners also have budgetary contingencies, to continue to operate and to make plans for the coming years."
"It would be insane to abandon these proposals at the risk of losing transparency and, thus, European democracy."
"I believe that the solutions are simple: administrative simplification, respect for work and, what is perhaps also necessary, an audit."
"– Mr President, the decision made at the end of September by the Commission’s Directorate-General for Press and Communication regarding the end to subsidies for the operation of the European Info-Points and Carrefours has given rise to significant disappointment and significant surprise among their managers and staff."
"The citizens of the European Union will also be the losers as a result of this end to operating subsidies for 2004."
"Let us be frank: at a time when Europe is facing enormous difficulties in moving closer to the citizens and raising its profile, an undeniable gap is opening up once again."
"For example, the closure of the European Carrefours is a great loss as regards the information distributed in the most rural regions."
"The decentralised structures are an essential asset and given the immense amount of communications work to be done, these structures must be maintained, or even receive additional funding enabling them to play their role to the full."
"At a time when Europe is at an important turning point in its history, benefiting from a forthcoming enlargement and Constitution, it would be unacceptable to put an end to the necessary and vital aid of the Info-Points."
"In light of this context, we must combine all of our efforts to find a fair solution because we are all worried."
"The Info-Points are, and must continue to be, among the Community’s communication tools."
"Their activity and the efforts made by these structures have proved the effectiveness of their action."
"The Info-Points have always made every effort to carry out the role entrusted to them, in this case acting as an interface for a dynamic platform."
"Close to the citizens, they have made it possible to maintain a European social fabric."
"So are we going to remain deaf and mute in the face of the expectations of the public, who constantly need to be informed of our interinstitutional activities?"
"Being aware of this need and convinced of the important role played by these structures, I call on the Commission to review its decision and to allow these European information networks to continue to perform the functions we have entrusted to them, which are more essential now then ever."
"I thank the Commissioner for being here and, in response to his comments, I will say that it is all the better if there are other documentation centres and forums that have the Commission’s support, but it does not disguise the fact that the information deficit is all too real and not appreciated by the public."
"If a legal basis is required – and this may well be the case – one must be established."
"However, a minimum amount of time is needed to resolve this type of problem and that does not mean four months, Commissioner."
"That seems to be much too short and the Commission’s methods far from courteous, so we hope that the proposal for a trialogue meets with a favourable response."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank the Commissioner for his answer, because I, too, am of the opinion that the abolition of the provincial Info-Points would signify a loss to the image of the European Union."
"First of all, these information centres are close to the citizen, and this can be taken literally."
"The information centres are physically present in the provinces."
"The proximity of the centres ensures that those seeking information do not have to travel a long way, saving them time and money."
"I think that this is the EU’s trump card, and a way of being customer friendly."
"Secondly, the European Parliament has already stated its opinion on the European Union’s information and communication strategy, and, in so doing, has expressed the desire to bring communications as close as possible to the citizen."
"In its motion for a resolution, it expresses the desire to invest more in a well-functioning information network, includingInfo-Points."
"The word is ‘invest’, not ‘abolish’."
"I quote: ‘The European Parliament ... considers that there is a need to introduce measures for administrative adjustment, structuring and staff training, aimed at the effective operation of the external offices and the network of information centres ..., which could also be used by MEPs in their respective constituencies’."
"When we talk about bringing the European Union closer to the citizen and bridging the gap with the citizen – because research reveals that that gap really exists – investing more in the Info-Points is part of the solution."
"I should like to make a plea, then, that we by no means abolish theseInfo-Points, but, on the contrary, improve their functioning, particularly now, in the light of the elections and enlargement taking place in 2004."
"We must not make savings on the promotion of the European Union, a Union that brings peace, security and prosperity to the Member States."
"Mr President, I am sorry that it is Commissioner Kinnock who has to be here this afternoon to take this criticism on the chin, because I in no way regard him as personally responsible for the situation in which we find ourselves."
"I shall put some simple questions to which we all know the answers and on which we are all agreed."
"Is the average European citizen in need of extra information about the European Union?"
"Yes."
"Is information needed in the Member States and locally rather than in Brussels?"
"Yes."
"Do the Info-Points help meet that need?"
"Yes."
"Is next year, with enlargement, with the new Constitution, with elections, a year when the information will be more necessary than usual?"
"Yes."
"Has the Commission got its organisation and priorities right on information policy?"
"That is questionable."
"Of course expenditure must meet legal requirements and if a legal base is necessary then it must be found."
"We employ lawyers precisely to check on those points in good time, advise if there is a problem and indicate a solution."
"We knew about the problem in January and the Commission's solution was to send the Info-Points a letter at the end of September."
"That really is not good enough."
"After all, the amount of expenditure is pretty minimal."
"It has been allocated over a good many years."
"If the Commission doubts the need for Info-Points and the more effective information programme, let me draw attention to statistics in recent polls."
"90% of Spaniards have never heard of the Convention."
"31% of Germans have never heard of the Commission and 25% of Britons do not even know that the United Kingdom is a member of the European Union but 7% of them think that America is!"
"The English language is rich in expressions."
"Let me try and find some that fit this situation."
"The tail is wagging the dog."
"The Commission appears to be unable to see the wood for the trees."
"Experts should be on tap, not on top."
"I could carry on with vulgar expressions about breweries and organising parties in them."
"There is not a major legal difficulty here, it is a technical problem."
"If the Commission had clear and accepted priorities and could see the wood for the trees, we would not be having this debate this afternoon."
"I welcome Commissioner Kinnock's statement, but he knows as well as we do that it has come far too late and it really should not have been necessary."
"Sadly, this is another own goal by the Commission."
"I hope that the letter that will be sent to the Info-Points will contain an apology."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, I am not going to emphasise the importance of the networks and of the Info-Points, on which I think that we all – both the Commission and Parliament – agree."
"For my part, I am going to consider a more financial aspect, that is, the Financial Regulation – the new Financial Regulation."
"I believe that we all agree on that issue too."
"We worked together, Parliament approved it and it has been accepted."
"All that remains is to implement it."
"We also all agree that the procedures under this Financial Regulation must be adhered to, including the procedures that allow for genuine transparency in the implementation of the budget."
"Moreover, if we have understood correctly, the Commission has been given every resource required for this implementation."
"I believe, Mr Kinnock, that this is a key element not only in this case, but also for the future."
"For the implementation of the budget, however, it is also essential for the sums to arrive on time."
"We talk in the industry of ‘just on time’, and that is where the problem lies."
"We are now in a situation where the Commission did not think far enough ahead and where, rather than coming to see us to explain that perhaps there was a problem or further difficulties, it waited until we were alerted by the public and by the networks, and are now extremely worried."
"Not only was the Commission slow in warning us, Mr Kinnock; more important, several things have been covered up."
"For example, when we are told that ‘several structures have agreed not to receive any money’, I disagree!"
"Several structures have agreed to be provided with material resources, but have never said that they did not need any money."
"I find this approach somewhat disagreeable in view of the need for us to be as sincere as possible in our joint work."
"Today, we must find a solution for 2004 and I believe that we will find it on Monday."
"In any event, I hope that we will, so that it can continue through to 2005."
"However, what we need now is for the Commission to assure us that it is going to be able to implement the solution that I am sure we are going to find, without fail and in good time to enable the Info-Points to continue operating."
"This is vital, as we have said, for Europe cannot withstand any further democratic breakdown."
"Europe can continue to work at an administrative level, but without the citizens it will not do so for long, and the Info-Points are one of the key intermediaries in ensuring that we finally have a Europe of Citizens."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking Mr Rocard, who is now absent, for raising this issue in the plenary of the European Parliament."
"Commissioner, it often happens, as Mr Perry has already said, that the wrong people get criticised."
"So, there is no legal basis;"
"I do not believe there is any political will either, or, if there is, it is at least deficient."
"And if the political will is lacking, then what happens – as it has done in this case – is that people try a partial solution of the problem for a short transitional period, without coming up with a proper arrangement for the future."
"We, as politicians whose business is with Europe, know for a fact that national politicians have a very pronounced tendency to project their own defects, errors and inabilities onto Brussels and to heap curses upon it."
"That is easily done, it goes down well, and there is as a rule no risk of them being put straight."
"I believe that information agencies on the European Union counteract this sort of tendency."
"They know how the media report things, and not only in their own country."
"Reporting of the European Union is deficient in other countries too; there too, it needs to be counteracted, and those Info-Points and offices, which are in a position to supply objective information, are the offices that are working for Europe."
"If Info-Points and likewise Carrefours are to be phased out and we now hear that there is the possibility of a transitional period of a year or perhaps even longer, that does nothing to counteract this tendency."
"It is not that we need another year or two because we have elections next year; it is that we need a solution for the future!"
"Commissioner, it is for me a matter of profound conviction that if we talk in terms – as we have done several times today – of pooling strengths, then we must also consider the need to link up the offices of Parliament and the Commission in the Member States with the Info-Points and Carrefours, in order to build up our presence in the territory in question."
"We have to embark on a general expansion of the information services, and we have to change our priorities."
"It is a matter of absolute necessity that we involve the Member States’ voluntary sectors in these information offices and strive towards improving cooperation with local organisations and bodies, making for greater efficiency and better financial conditions."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it so happens that the Commissioner saved himself with this excellent opening speech when he said what we actually wanted to hear."
"This is how a clever and experienced Commissioner obviously operates, but thank you, Neil Kinnock, for what you just said."
"Nevertheless, on that day, 29 September, when the Directorate-General for Press and Communication sent off a letter to all the Info-Points, it was as if a lump of ice had been dropped in the bath water."
"It rocked the boat and people panicked."
"One obviously cannot act this way, and all of us here are proof of that."
"These Info-Points have only been set up in recent years, and the Commission has itself made the excellent remark that these centres had an extremely valuable contribution to make as they had a good deal of experience and could work flexibly and very close to civil society and the people, and that they were a vital tool in the European Union’s information and communication strategy, representing the EU in the field."
"Excellent."
"You yourself provided evidence of this as the Commission, and I believe that in the future too you will ensure that there are information points in the field."
"It has already been mentioned here that the need for information is growing."
"The impact of enlargement will create a continuous need for information in all Member States."
"People have to be informed about the results of the Intergovernmental Conference, in other words the Constitutional Treaty."
"This is a document more than 300 pages long, which so far fewer than 2% of the citizens of the Union have read."
"The parliamentary elections and in particular the attempt to increase people’s interest in voting in them are of course massive tasks, which the points may happily be saddled with."
"Standards of monitoring have to be improved."
"If it is a matter of some points operating slightly dubiously, I would like the Commissioner to comment, but clearly that cannot be allowed to affect the entire network – those sections which have acted properly."
"I am very much in favour of the idea that next year the Commission will seek a better, more workable and more easily controllable solution."
"The need for information is growing as more and more issues are decided upon here, Europe’s central point, and I therefore support the Commissioner in his reforms."
"– Mr President, I would like to thank the Members that have tabled this oral question in the House, although I do find it too mild and vague given the seriousness and the complexity of the issue that is raised."
"The very replies given by Commissioner Kinnock – which were actually too cautious, almost embarrassed – confirm that the instability which we are condemning is real and that the problems are genuine."
"Furthermore, we have already tabled a written question, on 9 October 2003: I was the first to put my name to it, but 48 MEPs signed it from all the political groups."
"This question referred, in a much more detailed, specific way, to the concerns of those working – some for many years – at Info Centres, Info-Points and Carrefours, all the European information points."
"Now, given that we have still not received a written reply – at least not one that I have seen – I will take the liberty of quickly going over the points in this question."
"It began by stressing how the European Parliament, exactly as it is doing today, has often drawn attention to the importance, as regards information and communication policy, of these networks created in more or less all the Member States."
"The Commission, too, stressed a similar opinion, and did so in two official documents: Communication 354 of 2001 and Communication 350 of 2002, which concluded with more or less the same words, saying that Info-Points, Info Centres and Carrefours are invaluable heritage because of their experience, flexibility and immediate vicinity to the representatives of civil society and the citizens."
"Even Mr Prodi specifically praised these institutions in a reply given to another question on 27 September 2002."
"Not least, he said that awareness of the measures proposed and the projects implemented by the European Union is increasing thanks to the information networks."
"This is why we are even more bewildered and saddened to read the letter of 29 September 2003, in which the DG Press, contrary to all these good promises, notified the national structures housing these networks that extending the agreement for 2004 would no longer include the right to a subsidy, whilst, as far as the future is concerned, the Commission will look into – as the text states – new forms of cooperation."
"As Commissioner Kinnock mentioned, this is all because of the entry into force, on 1 January 2003, of Financial Regulations No 1605 and No 2342."
"This is a new and unprecedented situation which places a question mark over the very survival of these networks and, in any case, drastically reduces the capacity for dialogue with the citizens at precisely a time when, on the contrary, such dialogue should be increased."
"There is a great need, Commissioner, an infinite thirst for knowledge – as other Members have said, even from the opposite bench – at this time, as we are approaching the European elections, when the European Constitution is taking shape and when enlargement will soon be taking place, which will certainly mean that this need for information will be even more widespread."
"I would like, however, to stress the need for an immediate reply to the queries contained in the written question."
"What does the Commission intend to do to act in good time, for example to give legal personality to Carrefours and to Info-Points by applying Articles 54, 55 and 185 of Council Regulation No 1605 of 2002?"
"Above all, though, an immediate reply must be given for 2004: it is not enough to say ‘we will guarantee it for a year but for any longer we are not sure’."
"In saying this I am thinking, above all, of the most disadvantaged areas, of these rural Carrefours, especially in mountain regions, that are often the only, irreplaceable sources of information and a sign that the European institution is close to the people, especially in these disadvantaged areas."
"– Mr President, I too want to thank Mr Rocard for raising this important subject."
"The Info-Points Europe in the Member States are a natural and simple channel for the public to acquire information on the European Union."
"Of course that has been said here several times but I feel I have to repeat it myself."
"As a channel of communication they are perhaps not irreplaceable and their work is not absolutely dependent on Commission support."
"They are none the less hugely important."
"In my country the best thing about Info-Points Europe is that they are where the people are."
"If the EU feels a long way off, they at least are not to blame."
"On the contrary, it is these very Info-Points that ease the situation."
"The EU Carrefours are in rural areas and the Info-Points Europe in regional libraries."
"It is easy for people to look for the information they want and so they do."
"For example, everyday in Finland people look for information on the draft EU Constitution in these places."
"We, the Members of the European Parliament, are often the ones the public consults on different issues."
"As, however, it is legislation that we deal with first and foremost, my own work has unquestionably been made easier by the fact that in many cases I can refer people with questions to the services of the Info-Points."
"The turnout has been small at previous European Parliament elections."
"In Finland last time it was only slightly greater than 31%."
"Furthermore, many citizens of the European Union feel the new Constitution is a driving force behind a federalist-style Union and that the administration of the Union is drifting further and further away from grassroots level."
"We have to be able to allay such fears by increasing the amount of relevant information we provide."
"Consequently, I do not think it wise to reduce or announce an intention to reduce direct communication with the citizens of Europe."
"It is absolutely essential that the European elections reach the people through involvement in the voting on the part of the public media as well as the Union’s own organs of communication."
"The combined effect of this will be to get support for the notion of the people experiencing their own election and their own Union, and to establish the idea of a human European Union that is subject to the influence of its citizens."
". Mr President, I shall respond quickly, and I hope perceptively, to the main points made by several honourable Members."
"In the course of this debate, the Commission has been described as discourteous, our action improvised, dysfunctional and laggardly."
"I guess in some ways the Commission provides an open target on which people can vent their complaints, especially when there is cause to believe that some difficulties have been encountered because of accidental not malevolent omissions."
"I would simply underline that there are those who will criticise the Commission when there is any doubt about our conforming as far as Union law is concerned."
"That is a political criticism we have to face."
"However, it becomes difficult to take when we make efforts to uphold the law and in response we are castigated for our inflexibility and dysfunctionality."
"I know this House and certainly the people present at this debate understand the problems."
"To ensure that there is complete clarity on the subject something that did not come through in all the speeches I repeat: taking, if you like, Mr Bayona de Perogordo's suggestion that there should be a transitional approach, I would simply say that we have done rather better than adopt a transitional approach."
"We are not suggesting calls for proposals."
"We have an interim solution which is, as I announced, the waiver for 2004 although, obviously, we will require Council understanding and consent."
"The Info-Points do not depend on us for survival."
"In most cases, and even under the original proposal to end subsidies, the Commission still offered to provide technical assistance in 2004 for those relays that wanted to avail themselves of it."
"I hope no one will leave this debate with the idea that we are thoughtlessly and discourteously abandoning these critical information outlets, or the people who provide that service, to their fate."
"We are certainly not doing that."
"Finally, let me turn to Mr Perry's comments, put with his customary delicacy and charm and all the more forceful because they were wrapped in silk and polished with scented soap."
"He could have quoted a number of other clichés, but they are only clichés because they are true."
"He missed out 'keep off the grass' and 'a miss is as good as a mile'."
"However, in this case it would have been quite legitimate and I fully understand that."
"The whole experience has been a real lesson in the handling of the transitional requirement that arises automatically when we are making very necessary but quite sudden changes in our management and financing relationships."
"I hope the lessons that we have learnt will be properly applied."
"I also hope that the interim arrangements the Commission has suggested will commend themselves to the House."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is the debate on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the Rule of Law."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"- (B5-0490/2003) by Mr Cushnahan, Mr Van Orden, Mr Mann, Mr Bradbourn and Mr Posselt, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on Sri Lanka"
"- (B5-0492/2003) by Mr van den Berg and Mrs Carrilho, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the situation in Sri Lanka;"
"- (B5-0495/2003) by Mr Collins, on behalf of the UEN Group, on the threat to the peace process in Sri Lanka;"
"- (B5-0498/2003) by Mr Andreasen, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the political situation in Sri Lanka;"
"- (B5-0505/2003) by Mr Messner and Mrs Lambert, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on the peace process in Sri Lanka;"
"- (B5-0510/2003) by Mr Vinci, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on Sri Lanka."
"Mr President, anyone who has had the privilege of visiting Sri Lanka is profoundly affected by the warmth and generous spirit of its people."
"That was why there was such universal goodwill and support for the brave steps taken by the current Prime Minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, and the LTTE in launching a peace process to end the terrible conflict in which 65 000 people have lost their lives, many thousands have been maimed, and untold harm was inflicted on the economy and indeed the quality of life of the Sri Lankan people."
"In Tokyo in June 2003, the international community pledged USD 4.5 billion to underpin the peace process."
"It is therefore tragic that a constitutional crisis has occurred between the President and the Prime Minister, threatening to derail the peace process."
"I deeply regret the actions of President Chandrika Kumaratunga."
"I would appeal to her to pause and reflect on the consequences."
"I do so because I am aware that despite the personal tragedies she has experienced at the hands of the LTTE, she courageously initiated moves which paved the way for the current peace initiative."
"She invited the Norwegian Government to become involved as far back as 1997."
"She presented a draft constitution with proposals for devolution in 2000."
"I believe that history will justifiably acknowledge her contribution, if the present negotiations bring permanent peace."
"Bi-partisanship in both the British and Irish Parliaments has been fundamental to the continuation of the Irish peace process, particularly when there were difficulties."
"It is equally important to ensure that similar bi-partisanship exists in its Sri Lankan counterpart."
"Through its actions today, the European Parliament, in sending once again a message of goodwill to Sri Lanka, is also expressing its wish for the President and the Prime Minister to work together in the national interest."
"We remain willing to assist them in the search for permanent peace in their beautiful country."
"– Mr President, the current political crisis in Sri Lanka is having enormous repercussions on the peace process and the country’s economic future."
"The political divides and the rivalry between Sri Lanka’s President and its Prime Minister threaten the island’s stability and prosperity."
"Last week, in fact, three ministers were sacked, the parliament was suspended and a state of emergency was declared."
"The conflict between these leaders is based in particular on the issue of the attitude to be adopted in relation to the Tamil separatists."
"Mrs Chandrika Kumaratunga wishes to suspend the peace talks with the separatists, while the Sri Lankan Prime Minister wants to continue with them."
"It is essential that some understanding be reached in order to put an end to the crisis of confidence that is rife among the population, who are already weary of the conflict involving the Tamil separatists, which has gone on for over twenty years."
"The Sri Lankan people are suffering and have suffered a great deal as a result of the terrorist acts carried out in their country and the climate of insecurity to which these have led."
"They hope for peace in their island and a stable future."
"Those are the facts that the Sri Lankan authorities must consider."
"While the Sri Lankans welcome the progress made in the peace process involving the Tamil separatists, the instability that the President has provoked leaves the country in the grip of a serious crisis of confidence, from both a political and an economic point of view."
"At a political level, the departure of the Norwegian negotiators, who played a key role in the peace negotiations between the Tamil separatists and the Sri Lankan government, is extremely regrettable."
"At an economic level, in the textile industry for example, numerous traders are complaining that many orders are being cancelled."
"Another sector that drives the country’s economy, the tourism industry, is unfortunately also in turmoil."
"The fact is that travel agents are also reporting a number of cancellations."
"Many Sri Lankans believe that the gravity of the situation is directly linked to the attitude of the President, who refuses to continue with the peace talks."
"In light of this climate of hostility, we are calling on the Sri Lankan authorities to resolve these issues as quickly as possible so that they can finally offer their people the stability and the security they deserve."
"– Mr President, the conflict between the Sri Lankan Government and the Tamil Tigers has been going on for thirty years and has resulted in tens of thousands of deaths."
"The negotiations having been suspended in April, the resumption of dialogue at the end of October with the Prime Minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, was a significant step forward on the road to peace."
"Institutionally speaking, substantial progress had been made towards the resolution of the conflict."
"The legal , however, by the President, Chandrika Kumaratunga, which interrupted the negotiations, was a giant leap backwards."
"The proclamation of a state of emergency, the concentration of the most important State posts – Ministers for the Interior, Defence and Information – in the hands of the President, the intervention of the army and the suspension of parliamentary activities all show that the situation is getting worse."
"It could deteriorate rapidly and even result in a resumption of the war and new elections with uncertain results."
"The President’s accusations against the government and the uncertainty surrounding the ceasefire are very worrying."
"We support the efforts of the Prime Minister to engage in dialogue."
"The President must resume contacts with the Prime Minister as soon as possible in order to find a constitutional solution."
"At the same time, the cooperation must be extended to include all the political leaders and all interest groups."
"Whatever happens, the immediate end to the state of emergency is essential if the peace process is to be resumed immediately."
"In this respect, we fully support the Norwegian Government in its role as mediator and hope that it resumes its efforts as soon as possible."
"The situation is particularly worrying in relation to the issue of human rights."
"The emergency regime must not lead to an increase in infringements of fundamental freedoms."
"We are especially concerned about the risk of a fresh upsurge of police and military interventions and, above all, the risk of torture or inhumane treatment."
"In conclusion, we hope that the state of emergency does not slow down the distribution of the aid pledged at the Donor Conference in May."
"It is because we know that the peace process cannot move forward until internal relations are eased that we are calling for an end to the emergency regime as soon as possible."
"Mr President, Sri Lanka has three population groups of differing origins."
"In addition to the Sinhalese majority, Tamils – who are related to the inhabitants of southern India – predominate in the north-east, whilst descendents of Europeans from colonial times live in and around the capital, Colombo."
"Following independence, left and right within the ethnic majority have been fiercely opposed to each other."
"The two parties have alternated in government, and have lost face politically to a great extent in the meanwhile."
"They have been outbidding each other in their aversion to minorities."
"Sinhalese votes can be won by saying that the Tamils must move to India and that European cultural influences must be eliminated."
"It is only after a long, hopeless war of secession that a government has emerged ready to talk seriously with the Tamil resistance movement, which wants its own State."
"Norwegian assistance has played an indispensable part in this."
"It is the quest for self-glorification of the President, who belongs to a party whose origins I find more pleasant in themselves than those of the ruling party, that is now threatening to ruin everything again."
"Europe must give a clear signal that a lasting peace agreement is inescapable, and that resumption of the devastating war is unacceptable."
"Without a lasting solution for the north-east, the country will suffer disruption and people will be uprooted."
"Any illusions the ethnic majority, or the President, may have that things can continue without a solution to this problem will only lead to a repeat of the disasters of recent decades."
"For that reason, the outside world should make it as clear as possible that this is an unacceptable situation and that a peaceful solution really is needed."
"– Mr President, in February 2001, a delegation from SAARC – the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation – travelled to Sri Lanka;"
"I, as its Vice-President, was with them. We met the former opposition leader, who is now the Head of Government."
"We spoke with Buddhists, Hindus and Christians, including Bishop Dr Joseph, who had a mediating role."
"We flew by helicopter to Jaffna, saw the villages that had been destroyed, and demonstrations by the people who wanted to go home."
"The civil war had lasted twenty years, had claimed a toll of over 60 000 dead, and human rights organisations told us that ‘war is an institution’."
"A year later, though, there was a ceasefire, a triumph for the Norwegian peace mission, whose work has always enjoyed our support."
"They are perfectly justified in now closing their operation down in response to the home-made crisis for which President Chandrika Kumaratunga must bear responsibility."
"It was she who took control of three government ministries, she who dissolved the democratically-elected parliament and promptly declared the country to be in a state of emergency."
"She charged the prime minister with making too many concessions to the Tamil Tigers."
"Although the two rivals, meeting in Colombo, agreed two days ago to set up a commission to lay down rules on the basis of which they could cooperate in future, the conflict does not appear to have been resolved."
"For that to happen, agreement is needed, enabling the initial favourable developments to be followed up."
"My party of visitors is well aware of that."
"Significantly fewer people are falling victim to violence."
"The security situation has improved in many parts of the country."
"More people are meeting across the line of demarcation, which was formerly hermetically sealed."
"In economic terms, too, there are encouraging signs."
"Growth stands at around 5% this year."
"More support can be expected from the international community in the shape of USD 4.5 million in reconstruction aid following the Tokyo conference, to which Mr Rod has just referred."
"This is, however, dependent on a peace treaty soon being on the table."
"Progress has also been made in that representatives of the LTTE have, for the first time, agreed to free elections in the North."
"We wish the people of Sri Lanka a speedy end to private feuding in the interests of peace."
"– Mr President, Sri Lanka is in a situation of cohabitation, with a President and a Prime Minister belonging to two rival political formations."
"For twenty years now, each political formation in power has sought to make peace with the Tamil Tigers and on each occasion the opposition has ruined the peace process."
"Thus, when the current Prime Minister was in opposition, he ruined the President’s plan to give greater autonomy to the Tamils in the north-east of the country, where they are in the majority."
"Since he has been Prime Minister, he has made significant progress in the negotiations with the LTTE, with the assistance of the Norwegian mediators, finally achieving a ceasefire that lasted several months and changed the people’s lives while allowing a limited economic upturn."
"For the first time since the movement came into being, the Tamil freedom fighters had just published concrete proposals for power-sharing in a region that, although run by the Tamils themselves, would continue to form part of Sri Lanka."
"These proposals were negotiable, but then the President took upon herself the heavy responsibility of halting this peace process, making the most of the Prime Minister’s trip to the United States and her constitutional prerogatives."
"She thus dissolved the parliament and recalled the Ministers for Defence, the Interior and Information in order to sack them."
"That was the situation up until a few days ago."
"Today, the parliament has resumed its activities and the President is negotiating with her Prime Minister, which is why I feel that we must seize this opportunity."
"A conciliation commission has even been set up between the two arms of the executive."
"Our group sincerely believes that the European Parliament must send a very clear sign to the political leaders in Sri Lanka to encourage them to find a solution to the political crisis, but also, and above all, a constitutional solution that will allow for a lasting agreement with the Tamils."
"We also express our support for the Norwegian mediation team in its efforts to get the peace process back on track."
". – I should like to thank Mr Cushnahan for raising this issue, together with other Members of this House who clearly take a close and committed interest in Sri Lankan affairs."
"The Commission has closely followed developments in Sri Lanka and is greatly concerned by the grave setback inflicted on the peace process by recent events, including the deployment of troops in the capital and the decision to bring the cabinet portfolios of defence, interior, and communications under the remit of the President."
"The Council presidency and the Commission have issued a joint statement with Norway, the United States and Japan expressing our common concern that recent developments in Sri Lanka may jeopardise the spirit of cohabitation between the President and the government, which has proved vital to efforts to sustain the momentum of the peace process."
"The presidency and the Commission urged the two principal parties to continue to work together in support of a negotiated political solution to the longstanding conflict."
"Commissioner Patten has repeatedly contacted the Sri Lankan Prime Minister Wickremesinghe by telephone encouraging him to find a way to return to constructive and functional co-habitation with President Kumaratunga."
"The Commission will continue its efforts motivated by the hope that the tension can be reduced."
"The Commission is closely coordinating any action with Norway, as facilitator of the peace process, and with other co-chair countries."
"Naturally, the Commission remains in daily contact with its delegation in Colombo in order to keep abreast of all developments."
"Commissioner Patten will visit Sri Lanka on 25 and 26 November 2003 as planned."
"The visit will allow him to get a first-hand impression of the situation and discuss the significant issues with all relevant parties, and he will again be seeking to impress and reinforce the views of the Commission and indeed this House which have already been transmitted to all parties in Sri Lanka."
"The Commission is working in a coordinated manner with the Council."
"We welcome a resolution by this Parliament that encourages the Sri Lankan President and Government to return to the co-habitation that had prevailed since the last general election in Sri Lanka."
"Mrs De Keyser talked of the hope for an incipient restoration of normal relations."
"This is a hope that we share and are seeking to reinforce."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place this afternoon following the debates."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"- (B5-0491/2003) by Mr van den Berg and Mrs McAvan, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the situation in the Indonesian province of Aceh;"
"- (B5-0496/2003) by Mrs Sandbæk, on behalf of the EDD Group, on the situation in Aceh;"
"- (B5-0497/2003) by Mr Andreasen, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on Indonesia/Aceh;"
"- (B5-0501/2003) by Mr Bowis, Mr Tannock and Mr Posselt, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on the situation in the Indonesian province of Aceh;"
"- (B5-0507/2003) by Mr Wuori, Mrs Maes and Mrs McKenna, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on the situation in the Indonesian province of Aceh;"
"- (B5-0508/2003) by Mr Di Lello Finuoli, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on Indonesia/Aceh."
"Mr President, this debate comes at a very timely moment in the history of Indonesia, given the very grave situation in the province of Aceh."
"The decision by the Indonesian authorities to extend martial law and carry out a military crackdown is deeply regrettable, and there has been very heavy-handed military action."
"An estimated 45 000 troops have been sent into the province against 5000 rebels."
"As ever in these situations, it is the civilian population which is paying the price, with reports of disruption to food supplies, infrastructure and schools being destroyed."
"Tens of thousands of civilians are reportedly displaced."
"These are only estimates, of course, because the Indonesian authorities are not allowing observers in to monitor the situation."
"This has to stop."
"There is no point in the Indonesian Government complaining when the international community, the United States, the EU and Japan, draft a resolution expressing their concern if they in turn are not prepared to allow international monitors in and are not prepared to allow humanitarian organisations into their country to bring assistance to the civilian population."
"Our joint resolution makes a series of demands on the Indonesian Government and I hope very much that it is listening and that it will heed those concerns."
"It is vital to get both parties back to the negotiating table as quickly as possible."
"Time and time again we hear people telling us that military action is the answer, that it will be a quick military action and that once it is over everything will be sorted out."
"We have heard this so often, but often been disappointed."
"So often we have seen a high price paid in human lives."
"So both sides, the GAM and the Indonesian Government, must get back to the negotiating table, stop the fighting and resume the talking."
"I am grateful to the Commission for what it is already doing as regards Indonesia, particularly Commissioner Patten, who has always taken up issues about Aceh when we have asked him to do so."
"I hope the Council and the Commission will now do everything possible to assist Indonesia in getting back to the negotiating table with GAM and get those talks started as soon as possible."
"This is a matter of some urgency and I am very grateful to colleagues in this Parliament for agreeing to have today's debate and for supporting this resolution."
"Mr President, when President Megawati was a presidential candidate, she stated that the economic, social and political oppression of Aceh's people was the source of their dissatisfaction and the reason for the unrest."
"She also pleaded with them not to let a single drop of the people’s blood stain the earth."
"Today, Aceh is in a state of emergency."
"Violent military operations are under way, and people are being displaced, killed and raped."
"There is no access to the province, and emergency aid is being delivered, contrary to all international standards, by the military."
"Concern about the population of Aceh should be growing for several reasons. In May, the message was that the insurgents would be defeated before long."
"After a six-months’ offensive, 40% of the people are living under the poverty line."
"Now, the state of emergency has, moreover, been extended, and the government has begun to speak about a lengthy war, perhaps of another ten years."
"The situation in Aceh is naturally complicated, involving as it does diametrically opposed political visions, competition for gas and oil resources and a population that, for a long time, has been denied the autonomy promised during the war of independence."
"Support for the separatists cannot, now or in the future, be crushed by the military operations."
"On the contrary, the military’s violent infringements of human rights will lead to still greater support for the insurgents."
"I fear that both parties’ armed forces believe that they can escape unpunished from their misdeeds when independent observers are unable to gain access to Aceh."
"Especially worrying are the latest rumours that a military group suspected of having committed systematic human rights abuses in East Timor in 1999, together with a group of soldiers from the Indonesian army charged with, or convicted or suspected of, serious human rights abuses are now also active in Aceh."
"This is one of the most worrying signals for the Indonesian Government."
"It is therefore crucially important that access to Aceh be given absolutely top priority internationally and in the EU’s dialogue with Mrs Megawati."
"– Mr President, in Aceh, in the extreme north of the island of Sumatra, since the imposition of martial law on 19 May after the breakdown of the ceasefire that had been signed a few months before, the number of arbitrary arrests of civilians by the military and the police has been increasing."
"The situation is very worrying and this climate of violence throughout the province risks ending up in another diabolical spiral."
"Since the end of May, the Indonesian military have arrested or killed almost two thousand people suspected of belonging to the GAM rebel group, a movement that demands autonomy for Aceh."
"Faced with this spiral of violence, we call on the Indonesian Government and the pro-independence movement to resume negotiations in order to implement the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement."
"The populations that are at risk must be protected and Indonesia must quickly re-establish genuine dialogue so as to put an end to this unnecessary fighting, which leads to serious injustices and paves the way for the death of innocent people and poverty."
"In Aceh, where the security forces have for many years been present in large numbers and have been murdering citizens with complete impunity, the climate is getting worse every day and is further reducing the confidence of the province’s inhabitants."
"The Indonesian Government’s passive attitude to the thousands of violations reported in Aceh, the majority of which have been committed by its own security forces as part of the anti-insurrectionist operations in recent years, has fuelled the people’s resentment and created conditions likely to strengthen violent opposition."
"The hope of lasting peace in Aceh will never be fulfilled unless steps are taken to protect the civilian population from the human rights violations."
"Today, we call on the Indonesian authorities, but also the ASEAN countries, the Council and the Commission to ensure that Jakarta makes every effort to defuse the situation in the region and that the flagrant human rights violations are strongly condemned."
"Finally, we believe that the GAM will also have to cooperate in any investigation carried out into the human rights infringements attributed to its members."
"Mr President, for me this is not a debate on the rights and wrongs of those in Aceh who campaign for independence, nor is it a criticism of Indonesia's right to intervene to secure law and order, so long, of course, as that country does not permit human rights abuses to be committed by any of its forces."
"It is a debate about the escalating humanitarian crisis."
"As we know, most of Aceh's 4.2 million people live outside the two main towns."
"For them food, water, electricity and communications have been disrupted."
"Healthcare and education have become impossible."
"Five hundred schools have been burnt down, thousands of people have fled from their homes and Governor Puteh has said that unemployment and poverty are now at alarming rates."
"We worry about human rights and I raise two issues."
"One is the fact that 77 community heads have been replaced by military personnel and the second is that active in Aceh are people like Major General Damiri, Brigadier General Suratman and others who have been convicted of crimes against humanity in East Timor."
"They are on duty in Aceh."
"Kofi Annan has appealed to Indonesia to ensure access to humanitarian aid and human rights organisations."
"He is right."
"The obstacles to this are in Presidential Decree 43/2003, which states that international and local NGOs are not allowed to conduct activities contrary to the objectives of the military emergency conditions."
"That is a catch-all provision that is exacerbating the humanitarian crisis."
"It is not acceptable that all aid has to be rooted through the Indonesian authorities, nor that NGOs are restricted to Banda Aceh."
"Finally, we call on Indonesia to investigate with urgency the disappearance of the human rights defender Abdussalam Deli, and the killing of his colleague, Raja Ismail."
"I hope the Commission and the Council will assist us in these aims."
"– Mr President, the conflict in the province of Atjeh (Aceh) has been going on for 27 years and has already resulted in thousands of deaths."
"The situation deteriorated even further after the breakdown in May of the fragile Cessation of Hostilities Agreement, the establishment of a state of emergency by the Indonesian Government and the closure of the province."
"The imposition of martial law led this House to adopt, in June, an initial resolution, in which we denounced the lack of freedom for the people and of freedom of the press."
"We expressed our concern regarding the fresh upsurge of violence, the daily murders and the increase in the number of arrests and disappearances."
"This condemnation was not sufficient, as martial law has just been extended for six months."
"We regard this decision as unacceptable."
"Our main concern, however, relates to the closing-off of the region and the fact that it is impossible to gain access to the people, and particularly the victims of the conflict, because when there is a state of emergency the military governs the region and distributes the humanitarian aid."
"We call on the Indonesian Government to respect international military law and to allow humanitarian organisations access to the area so that they can provide assistance to the refugees, displaced persons and prisoners."
"We are also concerned about the radicalisation of the conflict and the marginalisation of civil society campaigners at a time when moderate critical voices are needed to move towards peace and reconstruction."
"With the hope of re-establishing dialogue, on behalf of the human rights group of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, I organised, in October, a discussion on the critical situation in Atjeh and Papua."
"Unfortunately, the Indonesian Government’s failure to face the separatist movements and civil society representatives prevented us from making any progress in achieving a peaceful resolution to the conflict."
"Sadly, it is all too clear that the fall of the Suharto dictatorship and the return to democracy in Indonesia have not been accompanied by a significant improvement in human rights."
"In reality, the army is still in power."
"Civil liberties, trade union freedom and the freedom of expression continue to be scorned."
"The tragedy in East Timor does not appear to have served as an example for the Government in view of the demands for autonomy that are coming from Borneo, the Moluccas, Atjeh and Papua."
"There is no doubt that the rise in fundamentalism and in the number of terrorist attacks that are in the headlines of the international press are of grave concern, but it is in the name of national unity and the fight against terrorism where, far from the view of the media, freedoms are treated with contempt every day and a savage repression rages, not only in Atjeh but also in Papua."
"Even though we do not support the armed rebellions, we call on the Indonesian Government to engage in dialogue with the fighters in order to build peace, and we call on the European Union to promote the reconciliation process."
"Mr President, during an earlier debate on Aceh, on 5 June, I pointed out that the borders in the developing world are largely a product of European colonial administration."
"In this case, we are now seeing the result of the conquest of Aceh by the Netherlands a century or more ago."
"Peoples that have been assigned to large, powerful neighbours run the risk of becoming second- or third-class citizens for good, without access to leading positions, without the possibility of active political participation and without having their natural resources at their disposal."
"These peoples can only be protected by a large degree of self-government or by secession."
"The more armies are deployed to prevent such a possible secession by means of terror, the more hated they make themselves, and the more difficult reconciliation between the ruling and the other peoples becomes."
"This is how the breeding ground for those secession movements grows."
"In Indonesia, the failing government is striving for popularity among the Javanese by showing that it is dealing with other population groups firmly and giving the army free rein."
"That is comparable with the situation in Sri Lanka we discussed in an earlier agenda item."
"The President needs this war to keep herself in power."
"Negotiations are alternated with forceful military intervention."
"Refugees from Aceh have told me how hopeless the situation has become."
"Anyone who was present at the peace talks in Japan can no longer safely enter Indonesia."
"In East Timor, we saw the devastating consequences of this kind of policy on the part of a previous president."
"Europe must not resign itself to the current hopeless situation, and it must not put trade relations with Indonesia, particularly the supplies of arms that were resumed in 2001, above human rights."
"This is an alarming situation, and must lead to our ensuring that the autonomy and emancipation of the peoples of Indonesia have their place, and that there is no military victory, oppression or uprooting of these peoples."
". Mr President, I would like to express the Commission's gratitude to Mrs McAvan for raising this issue and indeed to the other Members of the House, who clearly have a close and continuing interest in and knowledge of Aceh."
"The situation in the province is obviously a matter of concern for the Commission, and in a recent statement the European Union presidency and the Commission, as co-chairs of the Tokyo Conference on peace and reconstruction in Aceh, voiced their concern about the extension of the state of military emergency in the province."
"We also expressed the hope that it will end as soon as possible."
"The Commission is seeking to encourage the government of Indonesia to suspend martial law as soon as possible, and in the meantime has impressed upon it the need to carry out its activities with the minimum possible impact on the well-being of the people of Aceh."
"In pursuing such a process we always include references to humanitarian aid, the restoration of civil institutions and respect for the law."
"The Commission is also pressing for improvement in the transparency of the situation in Aceh and continues to call, as honourable Members have, for access to Aceh for international agencies and relevant non-governmental humanitarian organisations."
"While the Commission reiterates its commitment to the territorial integrity of Indonesia, it is also firmly convinced that the conflict in Aceh can only be ended by political means."
"Despite the difficulties of obtaining reliable and verifiable information, our delegation in Jakarta is closely monitoring developments in the province in coordination with Member State missions to Indonesia."
"It regrets that a recently planned mission to Aceh by political councils from several embassies was cancelled at the last moment by the Indonesian authorities."
"The Commission will monitor the situation very closely and continue its efforts to impress upon the Indonesian authorities that they should return to the negotiating table as soon as possible and, in the meantime, allow independent humanitarian aid providers to operate in Aceh without hindrance."
"The cause of decency and humanity is well served by the interest demonstrated by this House, especially in the way in which honourable Members were able to illustrate their concern and arguments by reference to the reality of the wretchedness inflicted on the people of Aceh."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place this afternoon following the debates."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"- (B5-0493/2003) by Mr van den Berg, on behalf of the PSE Group, on religious freedoms in Vietnam;"
"- (B5-0494/2003) by Mr Belder, on behalf of the EDD Group, on religious freedoms in Vietnam;"
"- (B5-0499/2003) by Mrs André-Léonard, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the lack of religious freedoms in Vietnam;"
"- (B5-0502/2003) by Mr Nassauer, Mr Posselt and Mr Mann, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on religious freedoms in Vietnam;"
"- (B5-0503/2003) by Mrs Angelilli, on behalf of the UEN Group, on religious freedoms in Vietnam;"
"- (B5-0506/2003) by Mrs McKenna, Mrs Isler Béguin and Mrs Frassoni, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on the lack of religious freedoms in Vietnam and the deliberate elimination of the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam;"
"- (B5-0509/2003) by Mr Sjöstedt, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on human rights in Vietnam."
"Mr President, I wish to make an urgent request, as I did in May, for attention and action on the part of the Commission and the Council regarding the lack of rights of the indigenous Protestant population of Vietnam’s central highlands."
"Tomorrow’s meeting of the Joint EU-Vietnam Committee in Brussels provides opportunity for this."
"Just yesterday evening I had direct contact with Hanoi by telephone, from which extremely gloomy background information emerged."
"The Vietnamese Government is conducting a vigorous campaign against the Protestant Montagnards via television."
"They are called ‘separatists’ and are a ‘social evil’: at least, that is how the authorities in Hanoi interpret the constant protests of these ethnic minorities against the unabated removal of their social and economic rights – land theft, simply – and the discrimination and religious persecution by the ethnic Vietnamese, the Kinh, who consider themselves superior."
"Incidentally, this same government is screening off the central highlands to outsiders."
"Even local NGOs, backed by foreign co-financing organisations, are saying that they will shortly have to discontinue their aid to the indigenous peoples."
"Against this depressing background, I ask that both Commission and Council show their ability to act."
"After all, they are investing a great deal of money in Vietnamese public-sector projects, so let them then ensure that that aid also benefits the oppressed ethnic minorities in the central highlands."
"Call in foreign co-financing organisations for this purpose."
"Urge strongly that the central highlands be opened up to foreign observers."
"Demand observance of the constitutional principle of freedom of religion on the basis of the international commitments that Hanoi has entered into."
"In the meanwhile, in spite of all the oppression, the number of Protestants in the central highlands is growing unmistakably."
"This is an interesting point for the European Union and Vietnam to reflect on for tomorrow’s meeting."
"– Mr President, the recent events that have taken place in Vietnam demonstrate once again the repression suffered by the monks of the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam, the UBCV."
"The Vietnamese authorities have placed eleven dissident bonzes of the UBCV under house arrest for two years, including the Patriarch of the Buddhist Church, the Venerable Thich Huyen Quang, who has already spent twenty-one years in prison."
"This repression followed the first extraordinary assembly of the UBCV since it was outlawed by the communist authorities in 1981."
"The UBCV, which is an important religious grouping in Vietnam, and was founded decades ago, is still not allowed to exist."
"The Hanoi Government has justified these detentions by using violations of national security legislation as an excuse."
"Vietnamese law authorises local authorities to place individuals under administrative detention lasting between six months and two years, without trial, in cases of attacks on national security."
"In actual fact, through their behaviour the Vietnamese authorities are contradicting their grand declarations in favour of reforms and democracy."
"I should point out that religious freedom is a fundamental right in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the European Union/Vietnam Cooperation Agreement is based precisely on fundamental respect for human rights."
"This policy of repression, not only of the monks of the Unified Buddhist Church but also of the Hoa Hao Buddhist Church, the Catholic Church and the Christian Montagnards must end."
"In fact, all of these religions are outlawed and have no legal status."
"Vietnam is a multiethnic, multicultural and multi-religious country."
"This diversity is a wealth that should not be squandered."
"The Hanoi regime must show good will and implement a series of concrete reforms, beginning with those that guarantee complete freedom of religion, and in this way launch a real process of democratisation."
"Then we will be able to have confidence in them once again."
"– Mr President, in Vietnam, there is a marked gulf between what is claimed to happen and what actually does as regards the freedom to practice a religion."
"The freedom to believe in a religion, or not to do so, is guaranteed."
"That is what Vietnam’s constitution claims; that is what the country has undertaken to do in a number of agreements, for example the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights."
"The reality, though, is something else."
"Worshippers, priests, monks and eminent religious dignitaries are harassed, persecuted and locked up."
"State recognition is denied to such faith communities as the Montagnard Christians or the Hoa Hao Buddhists."
"Vietnam’s United Buddhist Church was banned in 1975; its Patriarch was interned for 21 years and was released only in 1998 following international pressure."
"Much hope was kindled when he met the Prime Minister in April of this year, but, following these conversations, the authorities stepped up their action against the adherents of this church and of other religions."
"In October, the Patriarch and his deputy were placed under house arrest, and many of their followers were sentenced to two-year terms of imprisonment."
"Cooperation between the European Union and Vietnam is founded upon the absence of any restriction on the exercise of human rights, as is stated in our cooperation agreement of 1985."
"The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats strongly condemns the latest acts of repression."
"If the Hanoi Government does not want to jeopardise its cooperation with the EU, legal status must be granted to all churches, and people interned for their religious beliefs must be set at liberty."
"We urge the Council and the Commission to use all diplomatic means to make religious freedom a reality in Vietnam."
"I ask you, Commissioner Kinnock, to use your personal influence to make this issue central to tomorrow’s meeting in Brussels between the representatives of Hanoi and those of the EU’s Commission in the EU-Vietnam Joint Committee."
"We believe that Parliament needs to send a delegation to Vietnam to examine the situation on the ground and have talks with office-holders of all religions."
"– Mr President, freedom of religion is an important indicator that human rights are being enforced: a sort of human rights litmus test."
"If a country’s human rights situation is poor, it is likely to be seen first among religious groups."
"It is among these that we can test to see whether human rights concerning freedom of speech, freedom of association and assembly, and the freedom to practise a religion are in place or not."
"The situation in Vietnam demands the attention of the international community."
"The EU has to send a clear message that discrimination against, for example, the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam, Protestant congregations and dissident groups must cease."
"These members of communities practising a peaceful religion have suffered deprivation of freedom and house arrest."
"Furthermore, the original mountain-dwelling minority Christian community has been continually harassed, arrested and imprisoned by the Vietnamese Government."
"A precondition of economic cooperation between the EU and the communist republic of Vietnam has been a respect for fundamental rights and the principles of democracy."
"In violating these principles Vietnam is violating and harming itself, and the EU must now clearly indicate that."
"It is regrettable that criticism of the Vietnamese communist party is automatically viewed there as a threat to the state itself."
"The practice of fundamental rights such as expressing one’s opinion can even be loosely interpreted as espionage on the basis of specific law on national security."
"From the point of view of human rights it is also worrying that those accused are considered guilty before commencement of trial, and that trials almost without exception are declared secret."
"A state ruled by law needs clear and precise laws that guarantee equality and legal certainty for all."
"In no case can a state ruled by law be built with laws that permit racial, religious or political discrimination."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to start by recalling that only recently, six months ago to be precise, we gathered here, in this Chamber, to address the situation of human rights in Vietnam."
"I would also like to remind you that there was still some hope that the meeting that took place in April, to which Mr Mann has already referred, between the leaders of the Vietnamese State and the patriarch of the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam (UBCV), could lead to greater understanding on the part of the State as regards religious freedom."
"Today, we must clearly accept that these hopes have unfortunately proven to be quite unfounded."
"The situation has not only failed to improve but has actually worsened from all points of view."
"The Buddhist patriarch is under house arrest and, what is worse, the pagodas belonging to the Buddhist church have been locked up, in a blatant attack on the most important principle of the Buddhist church."
"At the same time, the pace of death sentences handed down and of executions carried out by the regime has picked up, and is already more than twice that seen in 2002."
"Given this situation, I wish to reiterate what has been said here and urge the Commission to make our voice, the voice of the European Union, heard loud and clear in Vietnam in order to ensure that religious freedom and the principles of universal human rights are respected."
"Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to welcome Mr Vo Van Âi, president of the committee for democracy in Vietnam, who is in the official gallery with Mrs Volkner, vice-president of the same organisation."
"I believe – and Mr Casaca said this – that Parliament is tired of having to return to the issue of Vietnam, it is tired of lies and promises from the Hanoi Government, and I do not feel we can continue in this situation."
"Yesterday, the US congress adopted a very similar resolution to that which we will vote on in a few moments, and I feel that is another demonstration of weariness from the other side of the Atlantic."
"The issue is in the Commission’s hands."
"We are quite aware that there are problems in the Council, in which one State known as ‘the birthplace of human rights’ is cultivating some imperalistic nostalgia, is paying a great deal of attention to the sale of and harbours extremely bizarre anti-American opinions."
"This is an established fact, which should be clarified."
"I am sorry to say that the Council and the Member States are often absent from this House."
"There is still the issue of the Commission: tomorrow the Joint Committee is meeting – the Commission and the Hanoi authorities – and it should be then that the Commission, which has a programme assigning tens of millions of euros in aid for legal reform in Vietnam, raises the issue of the legal status of the Unified Buddhist Church and other churches."
"The Commission should make the Hanoi authorities understand that if there is no progress in this specific area then cooperation aid will be suspended immediately."
"I believe that without a strong gesture from the Commission in the meeting tomorrow, this umpteenth Parliament resolution will be useless."
"I expect a very specific reply from Commissioner Kinnock on the approach that the Commission is going to take tomorrow in Brussels."
"– Mr President, a few minutes ago, over in the Robert Schuman Room, we presented Otto von Habsburg and Raymond Barre with the Franco-German Paneuropa Prize, and we recalled how, for ten years under Otto von Habsburg’s leadership, this House took debates on topical and urgent matters like this one as an opportunity to fight for Greater Europe, for freedom in Central and Eastern Europe, and for human rights behind the Iron Curtain."
"Even then, there were many who told us that the work we were doing had no prospect of success whatever, that it was pointless, and that what we were doing would get us nowhere."
"Today, there are among us observers from various countries – Mr Landsbergis was also at the ceremony earlier – who can tell us that debates like the one we are having today changed the practical conditions under which they were held as political prisoners, and that, most of all, they gave them hope in political terms."
"Today, too, we are on the threshold of the enlargement of the European Union."
"Let that give us courage when we debate Vietnam."
"It is a topic that we have often discussed, and, alas, the people named in the resolution – some of them important religious leaders, are still in jail; human rights activists are still being suppressed, and peoples are still enslaved."
"We should, however, recognise that the time is coming when the wind of freedom will blow through Vietnam."
"We in this European Parliament must not relent in campaigning for human rights and for the freedom of religion, even if there are those who tell us that this is unrealistic and bid us talk business instead."
"We are under the great obligation of living up to our tradition and our name as Europe’s Parliament."
"We appeal to the Commission and the Council not to fail at this hour."
"Vietnam is an important partner, both in political and in economic terms."
"As a country, it has suffered appallingly through wars, intervention by outsiders such as Europeans, Americans and the Soviet Russians."
"Like Germany, it was a divided country; it endured a Communist regime and suffers its effects to this day, but it will be able to become a stable partner to the European Union only when it has become, no longer merely an economic factor, but a free state under the rule of law, a democracy in which freedom of faith and conscience prevail, and we ask you, tomorrow in Brussels, to employ your energies without reserve so that it may become that!"
". I thank Mr Belder and his colleagues for again raising the issue of Vietnam in this House, at a particularly apposite time."
"I also echo what Mr Posselt said, that no one in this House or anywhere else should fail to understand the critical importance of free people in free institutions, communicating their concern about those who are not free and who suffer because of their efforts to observe or assert their own opinions and beliefs."
"Everyone in this House, myself included, has had many encounters with people who have suffered grievously for the beliefs they hold and for resisting oppression."
"It always comes as a great inspiration to hear from them that, even in the darkest hours, in the deepest jails and in the worst conditions, they had their spirits lifted by messages from outside."
"The admired Socialist philosopher Aneurin Bevan said that each freedom is only made safe by adding another to it."
"So, when we strive for freedom in Vietnam, we are striving to secure our own freedoms and those of other people around the world."
"It is always encouraging to see the enthusiasm and energy Members of this House devote to that cause."
"The Commission has an overall policy towards Vietnam, with which the House is familiar."
"It is to encourage and support continued progress, with respect for human rights and democratisation, and to raise concerns where abuses occur or where the situation is evidently deteriorating."
"The Commission works closely with the European Union Member States in monitoring human rights developments in Vietnam and participates in all EU Troika approaches to the Vietnamese Government on human rights issues."
"I can assure the House that the Commission and the Member States have repeatedly urged the Vietnamese Government to respect political and religious freedoms and strengthen economic and social freedoms."
"Article 1 of the European Commission-Vietnam Cooperation Agreement of 1995 states that respect for human rights and democratic principles is the basis of our cooperation."
"As we informed Parliament on 15 May, this allows the Commission to discuss human rights issues with Vietnam, for example in joint Commission meetings held under the agreement."
"Since that debate six months ago, the Commission has proposed further reinforcement of the EU's human rights dialogue with the Vietnamese Government, in the light of the EU's experience with dialogues in other countries."
"That proposal, which has been accepted by the Vietnamese side, aims to encourage and support the continued commitment of the Vietnamese Government on human rights issues."
"So far agreement has been reached on the dialogue, which will include all departments with responsibility for human rights-related matters, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Public Security and the Office of the Prime Minister."
"While the Commission cautions that sweeping changes cannot realistically be expected, we look forward to further incremental steps that start to meet our concerns."
"The human rights dialogue with Vietnam is taking place on two different but complementary levels: the EU-Vietnam dialogue on human rights between EU Troika missions in Hanoi and the government, which will next convene on 26 November, and the EC-Vietnam Joint Commission, which is to take place tomorrow."
"We also note that Vietnam’s parliament, the National Assembly, has expressed an interest in entering into a constructive dialogue with this House on these and other issues."
"Far be it from the Commission to suggest how Parliament should respond, but I know it will seize eagerly on any opportunity."
"As regards the state of religious freedom in Vietnam, the Vietnamese Constitution as Mr Mann reminded us enshrines the freedom of religion as a basic freedom of the Republic."
"However, that freedom is limited and some would say contradicted by other specific laws."
"We hope that these restrictions will be relaxed and we have made that case explicitly and repeatedly to the Vietnamese authorities."
"As Mr Belder mentioned, there are reports of increased harassment of some Christians especially Montagnards and Hmong Christians since the uprisings in the Central Highlands in 2001."
"It is alleged that local authorities have tried to force highlanders to renounce their deeply held beliefs."
"If they looked at history, they would see how fruitless such efforts have been throughout the centuries."
"The House is aware of the renewed detention of some leaders and members of the unrecognised Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam."
"The European Commission and Member States have expressed their concerns over these events, and have called upon the Vietnamese Government to resume the dialogue initiated earlier this year between the UBCV and important members of the Vietnamese administration, including the Prime Minister, to restore the hope of a solution acceptable to all parties."
"I conclude by emphasising that it is clear to the Commission that Vietnam would be best served by continued and more rapid progress in the country’s reform programme, so that the administration learns to deal with a wider range of views and appreciates the value of accommodating dissent."
"Those vital elements of liberation still have to be secured in Vietnam."
"– Mr President, I think that there is ambiguity here."
"We do not understand."
"There is no progression; rather, there is regression in Vietnam."
"The question is simple: is the Commission prepared to introduce tomorrow as ‘conditional’ in the negotiations with Vietnam the issue of granting legal status to the churches that are not recognised?"
"There is no freedom of religion in Vietnam."
"We must therefore take a stand."
"You are encouraging the lack of reforms with millions of euro from European taxpayers."
"We cannot continue like this."
"Either money is provided for reforms, and the reforms are implemented, or else none is provided."
"I think that that is the question to which the Commission must respond."
". Mr President, I shall respond very briefly."
"I know that Mr Dupuis is, quite justifiably, passionate about this issue."
"I would simply say to him, without softening the attitude of the Commission at all, that in our efforts to try and secure protection for human rights and progress towards greater democracy, the setting of litmus tests is not always well advised."
"I can certainly see the direct and straightforward arguments for setting such tests."
"What we have to evaluate is whether that would help achieve the greater objective of bringing about the advances we all want to see."
"Meanwhile, European taxpayers' money is going into development and cooperation in Vietnam."
"That is because people's lives would be blighted and even endangered if that aid was not provided."
"Consequently, whilst I understand the argument for conditionality and in many cases would take that to its logical conclusion, the Commission cannot be certain that that approach would, in these circumstances, lead to the outcome that Members of this House and of the Commission would want."
"This requires very delicate judgment."
"We have to continue to exercise it in the fashion familiar to the House."
"That ends the joint debate."
"We will now proceed to the vote.(1)"
"That completes the agenda.(1)"
"I declare this session of the European Parliament to be adjourned."
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 20 November 2003."
"I should like to inform the House that at the beginning of tomorrow's sitting, the President of Parliament would like to pay a personal tribute to the Spanish servicemen who were killed in Iraq last weekend.(1)"
"A corrigendum to the agenda of the sittings of 3 and 4 December, containing the proposals for changes made by the Groups, has been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, yesterday, the European press published the report on anti-Semitism commissioned by the European Monitoring Centre on Racist and Xenophobic Phenomena."
"This is a report whose existence was, until yesterday, denied by the Monitoring Centre itself and the Commission."
"Three weeks or so ago, we had the Eurobarometer, and now we have the extremely disturbing report on anti-Semitism, whose existence had been concealed."
"I would ask you to avail yourself of your rights and demand an explanation from the Commission during the current part-session, or to ensure that a debate can be launched on the matter during the next part-session in December."
"That will be a matter for the next part-session."
"An additional change to the agenda of Thursday 4 December has been proposed: the inclusion in the vote of the report by Mr MacCormick (A5-0421/2003) on the request submitted by Giuseppe Gargani for the defence of his parliamentary immunity and privileges which was adopted under Rule 110a."
"– Mr President, the corrigendum to the agenda was originally meant to include the MacCormick report on the immunity of Mr Gargani, but the Secretaries-General agreed yesterday that we first, of course, had to have the opportunity of examining it."
"We cannot now retrospectively alter the agenda without the groups also having the opportunity to discuss it."
"I would therefore ask that it should not by some means be retrospectively put on the agenda, but that the groups should have the opportunity to talk the issue through, and I believe that other Members of this House feel the same way."
". Mr President, I am a little uneasy about the proposal that my report on the immunity of Mr Gargani be brought forward."
"The Secretary-General of my Group stated that she would have liked to have had the opportunity to discuss that report, along with other reports, at our group meeting before the part-session."
"We understood the report was being deferred until the second December sitting in Strasbourg, and so we did not have the opportunity to discuss it."
"Furthermore, I learned that there was a defect in paragraph 2 of the report as it was adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, but I have not seen any of the adjustments to it."
"As I am the rapporteur, I would have liked to have seen such adjustments."
"On these grounds, with the greatest respect and with regret to my colleague, Mr Gargani, I ask that this matter be deferred until the next Strasbourg sitting."
"That is a very sensible suggestion."
"There is no dispute regarding the principle of this report, and it would thus be a shame if we ended up having a procedural dispute on it."
"I suggest that we postpone it until the December Strasbourg sitting."
"(1)"
"Mr President, I seek your advice as to what redress I have against an inflammatory press release which has caused hate emails to be sent to my office."
"Richard Howitt MEP claimed in a press release that I had directly accused the Turkish Prime Minister of supporting militant Islamist groups, following the atrocious bombing in Turkey last week."
"In fact, I made reference to media reports of a former Turkish Government's alleged provision of covert support to Islamist groups in their fight against the Kurdish PKK, and made no reference to the current Prime Minister, Mr Erdogan."
"Furthermore, Mr Howitt claimed I disregarded the plight of Turkish civilian victims."
"My use of the word 'atrocious' shows this is patently untrue."
"I regret any misunderstanding and extend all my sympathies to those who have suffered, irrespective of race or religion."
"The Member, in his role as Labour's European Affairs spokesman, should have understood the sensitivities in this case."
"I would be grateful for a correction from Mr Howitt, as otherwise legitimate debate on accelerated EU membership for Turkey will be stifled."
"Mr President, I am pleased that Mr Tannock has expressed his regret at the offence caused by the remarks he made last week at a meeting of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy."
"Indeed, I also regret his receiving hate mail, as he described."
"Mr Tannock was very clear in his remarks that he did not regard Turkey as a victim of the terrorist attacks and that the victims were 'British and Jewish' - not Turks."
"Not simply did Mr Tannock go on to criticise the Turkish Prime Minister directly, but I believe his remarks could be regarded as offensive to Muslims and in general to the Turkish victims of the attack, irrespective of their religion."
"I am pleased that my statement has caused him to retract those original remarks."
"The next item is the joint debate on Council and Commission statements on the preparation of the European Council (Brussels, 12 13 December 2003), including the Social Summit, and on the progress report on the Intergovernmental Conference."
". Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by expressing my gratitude to the European Parliament for allowing me this opportunity to illustrate the principal issues that will be discussed during the forthcoming European Council in Brussels on 12 and 13 December."
"This Summit, which will mark the end of the Italian six-month Presidency, is an exceptionally important event for us, not only in terms of the importance of the matters to be dealt with, but also because the decisions adopted there will set the course for the future work of the Union on a number of matters of great importance on the European agenda."
"The European Summit, as you know, will also have to leave sufficient room for the work of the Intergovernmental Conference, as the Heads of State or Government, accompanied by their respective Foreign Ministers, meet for the final phase."
"Given the importance of the matter, I would like to begin my speech with an update on the progress of the IGC, and then return to the preparations for the forthcoming European Summit."
"Just a few weeks off the end of the six-month Italian Presidency I am pleased to report on the developments following the Naples Conclave."
"Firstly, I would like to confirm that the overall stance of the Italian Presidency remains that which my government has often expressed before this House and in the context of the IGC."
"In accordance with that stance, the comprehensive proposal presented reflects our intention to respect the constituent legacy of the Convention, confining ourselves to proposing clarifications or alterations to the Convention’s draft in light of the comments made by the Member States, the European Parliament and the Commission."
"I believe I can safely say that many of the Presidency’s proposals have been welcomed with broad appreciation, which has allowed us to bring the positions of Member States closer together with due regard for the overall balance of the Convention’s draft."
"In addition to the substantial progress made on a number of specific issues, it has become clear that some persisting divergences on specific provisions will be resolved when an agreement on the Union’s future institutional framework is achieved."
"Indeed this is the area in which the greatest disagreement remains, above all as regards the calculation of the qualified majority in the Council and the composition of the Commission."
"Detailed analysis of the results of the Conclave reveals the progress achieved on the following points in our proposal package: the insertion of a reference to equality between men and women and to the protection of persons belonging to minority groups in the provision on the Union’s values; the reaffirmation of the primacy of European Union law; the need to make the acts of the European Council subject to jurisdictional control insofar as the European Council is defined in the Constitutional Treaty as a Union institution."
"Points of convergence have been recorded in the extremely sensitive area of justice and home affairs too, where, in the introduction of qualified-majority voting, the specific features of certain national legal systems will have to be taken into account and safeguard mechanisms considered."
"The various proposals drawn up by the Presidency on the specific policies of the third part of the draft Constitutional Treaty have been the subject of in-depth discussion."
"Differing positions persist in many cases between the Member States on the basis of well-known points of divergence."
"Nevertheless, it is quite clear that various criticisms made in this regard will melt away at the point when agreement is reached on the major themes of the constitutional negotiations."
"The following are issues that will require further debate: the persisting divergence between the countries intending not to make concessions as regards abandoning unanimity voting in matters such as foreign policy, taxation and social security and the Member States that consider the phasing-in of qualified-majority voting in those areas a key element of the future Constitutional Treaty; the manifold, and often divergent, requests of Member States for changes to the provisions concerning the budget, the multiannual financial framework, own resources and economic governance."
"Here, the Presidency is seeking to preserve, to the greatest extent possible, the interinstitutional balance and voting rules proposed by the Convention."
"The idea of a simplified revision procedure for Part III, Title III of the Constitutional Treaty continues to meet with resistance while greater convergence seems to have emerged on the ‘passerelle clause’ on the basis of formulas that involve national parliaments too."
"The Presidency intends to propose further discussions on all these matters in the course of the final meetings of the IGC."
"The Conclave has, moreover, led to significant progress in the definition of the ESDP in the future Constitutional Treaty."
"Indeed, it has been possible to achieve a new draft of Article I-40, part 7 on the mutual assistance clause, a description of structured cooperation in Article III-213 and, most importantly, the presentation of a Protocol containing the criteria for participation in such cooperation."
"This group of texts will be examined anew at the IGC ministerial meeting of 8 December."
"Nevertheless, the exchange of views that took place during the Conclave has revealed the fact that there is convergence on an increasing number of points in this sensitive area."
"The debate on the institutional framework of the future Union has confirmed that this remains the most sensitive subject in the entire negotiations."
"The Conclave was useful for overcoming some points of divergence and, most importantly, for fostering calmer, more constructive dialogue."
"The salient elements of the discussion can be summarised as follows."
"The request by some Member States to raise the minimum threshold of national representatives to the European Parliament was received positively, on the condition that the total number of seats does not increase."
"On the matter of the presidency of the Council formations, convergence was recorded along the lines recommended by the Convention, even though some Member States still have doubts regarding joint presidencies, to which they would prefer elected leaders."
"On this matter, the Italian Presidency reserved the right to reflect on further changes."
"The possible solution is to have three Member States holding the Presidency for 18 months."
"The procedures for implementing these solutions could be the subject of a European Council decision rather than being regulated by a special protocol."
"The reactions to the Presidency’s proposal on an EU Minister for Foreign Affairs – aimed at clarifying several specific aspects of the functioning of the ‘double hat’ formula with due regard for the spirit of the Convention’s draft – have confirmed that the arrangement we have chosen is the only feasible one."
"Indeed, our proposals seek to overcome the criticisms of both those who fear that this new institutional figure may become the Council’s ‘Trojan horse’ in the Commission, weakening the Commission’s powers in matters of foreign policy, and the criticisms of those Member States which would like to free the Minister from the constraints of the Commission’s collegiality by emphasising the Minister’s role as Council representative."
"The middle road we suggested appears to be the only one which can ensure that a compromise will be reached in the end, although it does leave two major issues still to be resolved: the persistent opposition of some countries to giving the Minister for Foreign Affairs presidency of the General Affairs and External Relations Council, and the call from other Member States not to give the new institutional figure the title ‘Minister’ but the more modest title ‘Representative’, which is a clear retreat - and not just a symbolic retreat - from the provisions of the Convention’s draft."
"The lengthy debate on the composition of the Commission after 2009 saw the renewed proposal of positions and arguments already known."
"In the course of the negotiations, there will have to be reconciliation between those who advocate a streamlined, agile, efficient Commission unhampered by intergovernmental constraints and those who favour a Commission which is representative of all cultures and national viewpoints, and thus composed of one Commissioner with full voting rights for each Member State."
"The proposals on the table will have to be examined in a long-term perspective with a view to the institutional needs of a Union that, in 10 to 15 years’ time, is likely to be even larger and will, therefore, have to be endowed with decision-making abilities that are adequate and easy for the citizens to understand."
"The debate on the issue of the calculation of the qualified majority in the Council has made the range of positions in the field even clearer and more distinct: some States ardently defend the Nice system; others consider the transition to double-majority voting indispensable."
"Of these, a number of countries would prefer a totally symmetrical double majority, in other words, 50% or 60% both of the Member States and of the Union population."
"In the face of positions which still differ widely, we will need clear thinking and farsightedness."
"To this end, to reiterate what I said before, I would underline the need for the various proposals to be examined with a view to the long term after 2009."
"The IGC ministerial meeting of 8 December 2003 and the bilateral meetings which the Presidency will be stepping up in the coming weeks will therefore have to concentrate, first and foremost, on the institutional issues in order to make the best possible preparation for the final Conference meeting at the level of Heads of State or Government scheduled to open on 12 December 2003."
"The success or failure of the constitutional negotiations will very likely determine the progress of the process of integration for the coming years as well as Europe’s ability to play an authoritative role on the world stage at a time of major political and economic challenges."
"For this reason, and considering the importance of what is at stake, the approach to the constitutional negotiations will have to be characterised by ample flexibility on the part of all the actors called upon to lay the foundations of the Union for the twenty-first century."
"With due regard for the principle of equal dignity of all Member States – also recognised at the Naples Conclaveand rightly so – it is necessary that we abandon all particularist behaviour and stop thinking in terms of ‘fair exchange’, where each individual concession is made in an attempt to gain something of equal value."
"This approach is contrary to the very concept of European integration and, if systematically applied, would jeopardise the principles underpinning the Union."
"Although fairness is an essential condition for any constitutional agreement, no one can now halt the current developments in the process of integration."
"Anyone who wishes to do so will have to stand accountable before the European partners, before their citizens and before the history of the integration process."
"Political systems are developed through dialogue and the actions of men and women, and those same men and women are fully accountable for what is said and done."
"From this point on, we must be aware that the adoption of the new Constitution will be ‘a success for all or a failure for the Union’."
"There is now, no longer, any substantial difference between national and European interests."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would now like to focus, albeit briefly, on the issues that will be addressed by the European Council."
"As far as the economic issues are concerned, in particular the objective of boosting sustainable economic growth, the European Council will mark the culmination of the long period of work that started with the Thessaloniki European Council and was further developed by the Heads of State or Government at the most recent Summit in October."
"Indeed, the December European Council will be called upon to approve definitively the Growth Initiative, already endorsed by the Ecofin Council of 25 November, adopting specific decisions that will be able to make a substantial contribution to improving the competitiveness of the European economic system and to the full development of the Union’s potential for growth by promoting higher levels of investment in physical capital and the development of human capital."
"The principal objective in this context will be to create – including through the identification of a series of projects on which work can begin in the short space of two to three years – a political catalyst that will make it possible to increase sharply the pace of infrastructure creation and the implementation of advanced research projects in order to facilitate the deployment of essential resources from both the European Investment Bank and the private sector."
"From a different and more general standpoint, but still in the context of consolidating the cohesion of the internal market and boosting growth, the Italian Presidency also nurtures strong hopes that the European Council will accept the political agreement achieved by the Transport Council on the Commission’s proposal regarding the review of the TENs – which, as you will remember, provides the basic structure for the initiatives for the completion of the infrastructure network of the enlarged Europe – in consideration, not least, of the recent decisions on the increase in EU subsidies from 10% to 20% for projects on cross-border stretches."
"Moving on to issues related to the Lisbon agenda, with particular reference to points concerning structural reforms, to which the European Council next spring will need to devote its energies, I would point out that the Member States of the Union, whose efforts have been unceasing in this area, will now be presented with a major opportunity for open dialogue during the extraordinary meeting of the Trilateral Social Council, which will provide a highly significant opportunity to renew the commitment of the European Union to the implementation of the European Employment Strategy."
"The Social Summit will be the occasion to begin an initial analysis of the results of the work carried out by the employment task force headed by Wim Kok, and to discuss the Growth Initiative, with particular regard to its effects on employment."
"On these bases, the participants in the Social Summit will be able to develop the debate on the links between employment growth and productivity increases highlighted by Mr Kok’s task force, evaluating, in particular, the impact – not least in terms of employment - of policies seeking to improve the competitiveness of the economic system through the enhancement of human capital and the flexibility of European socio-economic systems."
"The outcome of this Summit – on which Mr Berlusconi will be reporting to the European Council - will also, of course, feed into the discussion at the Council itself."
"The European Council will also be a good opportunity to take stock of the situation as regards a number of important issues connected with the creation of a common area of freedom, security and justice, with particular reference to European strategies on immigration, in the light of the recommendations that emerged from the recent Brussels and Thessaloniki Summits held in October and June respectively."
"The Heads of State or Government will need, first and foremost, to take note of the agreements reached at the Justice and Home Affairs Council of 27 and 28 November on the main elements of a European Border Management Agency, a programme of measures specifically devoted to immigration by sea, and the insertion of biometric data in visas and residence permits."
"These initiatives have already been examined at the October Summit, and will now be rapidly implemented and, in some cases, finalised through the formal adoption of the relevant legislative provisions."
"In this regard, I wish to underline, in particular, that the European Parliament, too, will be required to express its opinion on the regulations for the Agency and on biometric data."
"I am afraid that the news on the subject of asylum is not so good."
"In spite of the great effort made by the Italian Presidency, which has led to substantial progress in these difficult negotiations, it has not been possible to reach agreement on the directive on minimum standards for asylum procedures nor to break the deadlock that had already developed by the end of the Greek Presidency on the other directive on refugee status and subsidiary protection."
"The European Council can only reiterate the political importance of this matter and invite the Council to reach an agreement at least before 1 May 2004, the fifth anniversary of the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"In the framework of the Union’s migratory policy, the European Council will certainly discuss the key issue of the reception and integration of legal immigrants as well, and especially the importance of encouraging inter-faith dialogue as an element of social cohesion, a subject to which the Italian Presidency devoted a Conference of Home Affairs Ministers on 30 and 31 October 2003."
"Migratory policy cannot, however, be effective without genuine, effective cooperation with the third countries of origin or transit of migratory flows, cooperation that needs to be developed in a constructive spirit of partnership."
"In this connection, I feel I should mention the positive interinstitutional agreement between Parliament, Council and Commission, which should be formalised in the next few days, on the creation of a financial and technical assistance programme for third countries on the subject of asylum, and the introduction of a mechanism for monitoring and evaluating these countries in the fight against illegal immigration, requested by the Thessaloniki European Council."
"Lastly, in the area of judicial cooperation in criminal matters, the European Council will express its satisfaction at the agreement reached following the Italian Presidency’s tenacious brokerage of the framework decision on combating drug trafficking, an issue that is of particular concern to European public opinion."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the forthcoming European Council in Brussels takes place just a few months before the entry into force of the Accession Treaty."
"The Heads of State or Government will be required to provide important directions for the completion of the enlargement process, especially in the light of the reports presented by the Commission on 5 November 2003."
"As you know, on 17 November 2003, the Council expressed its opinion on the Commission’s monitoring reports on the accession countries’ state of readiness."
"The Foreign Ministers, in particular, expressed their satisfaction at the high degree of alignment achieved by these countries in the different areas of the ,and we therefore expect the Heads of State or Government to endorse these positive opinions."
"The enlargement that will be taking place in 2004 can therefore be increasingly viewed as a complete success, confirming that the decisions taken by the Heads of State or Government at Copenhagen last December were the right ones."
"Of course, as was to be expected in view of the immense effort required of the accession countries, there are areas of the where the preparatory process is not yet complete, with respect to which we need to urge our future partners to make the necessary endeavours."
"The Commission’s recent strategy document shows without a doubt that Bulgaria and Romania have made considerable progress towards their entry into the Union."
"They are now ready to take the decisive steps that precede accession."
"The European Council therefore has a responsibility to facilitate these steps by mapping out in sufficient detail the road that they need to follow."
"This also applies to the timetable, especially the timeframe for the conclusion of the accession negotiations, the signing of the Treaty and, finally, entry into the Union."
"Of course, the completion of these steps depends, first and foremost, on the efforts made by the Bulgarian and Romanian governments."
"Precisely in order to facilitate these efforts, however, it will be necessary, in the Presidency’s view, for the Heads of State or Government to provide clear directions on the next legs of the journey, confirming, therefore, the deadlines: 2004 for the conclusion of the negotiations, 2005 for the signing of the Accession Treaties and 2007 for accession to the European Union."
"The European Council will also have to provide guidance on the timeframe for drawing up the financial framework for the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, in particular by acting promptly on the willingness already displayed by the Commission to present it before the end of January 2004, following the same resource-allocation criteria that were adopted for the accession countries."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I feel that each one of us in this room has reason to welcome the considerable efforts made by Turkey in the area of institutional reform, and the additional progress it has made in respecting the Copenhagen political criteria."
"These positive developments therefore deserve full recognition in the conclusions of the European Council."
"We must not fail to provide Turkey with suggestions and encouragement to continue in this direction, nor must we fail to highlight those areas in which Ankara needs to make a particularly sustained effort."
"In the medium term, our goal is still to ensure that Turkey is sufficiently ready for the decision that the European Council will be adopting in a year’s time."
"Lastly, as regards Cyprus, the Presidency feels that the Heads of State or Government must reiterate the appeal already addressed to the parties to achieve an agreed solution by the accession date, while pointing out at the same time that a solution to the Cyprus question would be a considerable step towards the achievement of Turkey’s desire to become part of the European Union."
"As always, the European Council will devote due attention to the Union’s external relations and to the principal international issues."
"I will not expand on this point as we are awaiting the latest developments on the ground, particularly where crisis areas are concerned."
"I believe, moreover, that we will not be able to avoid dealing with matters such as the Middle East peace process, the situation in Iraq and developments in the critical dialogue with Iran."
"The European Council will also bring to a close the debate on the European Security Strategy launched last June, with the adoption of an excellent document setting out the Union’s security problems and how to address them, with the aim of both giving governments guidance on making practical decisions and increasing public awareness and public support for the greater security undertaking which is now necessary throughout the European Union."
"The Heads of State or Government will also be called upon to examine the report on progress in the development of the ESDP with a view to giving the next presidency a detailed mandate on the matter."
"Acquiring greater capacity remains our primary commitment."
"For this reason as well, the European Council will particularly welcome the decision to create a European agency dedicated specifically to promoting the development and acquisition of new military capacity."
"To conclude, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to mention that the forthcoming European Council will also be required to adopt the first Multiannual Strategic Programme, which will be the basis for the Council’s work over the next three years."
"It is my pleasure to welcome to the distinguished visitors' gallery the former Prime Minister of South Korea, Mr Nam, and his Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Lee."
"They are here to participate in the European Parliament North-East Asia Forum meeting which takes place on 4 and 5 December 2003."
"You are both most welcome to this House."
". Mr President, Mr Antonione, ladies and gentlemen, the forthcoming European Council in Brussels will be the last in a highly eventful year."
"Indeed, almost every week brings with it developments and decisions that will have a major impact on our future."
"Last week was no exception."
"Before turning to the debate on the Constitution, I should like to focus briefly on another topical issue for the European Union."
"The forthcoming European Council will be preceded – as Mr Antonione said – by an extraordinary Tripartite Social Summit, to be attended by the Heads of State of the troika and representatives of the social partners and the Commission."
"Indeed, it is vital to involve the social partners at this stage of the constitutional process and it is essential that we listen to their points of view."
"The involvement of trades union and employers is the best guarantee of success for any initiative promoting employment."
"The meeting will address two issues which are at the heart of the Lisbon Strategy: our Growth Initiative and the European Employment Strategy."
"The key moment will be the presentation of the task force’s report on employment by Mr Wim Kok."
"The report describes how we can respond to the major changes taking place in the economy and the labour market."
"Its main points include the need for firms and workers to become more adaptable, for more investment in human capital and, lastly, for new social dynamics to sustain reforms and speed up their implementation."
"The Commission will take account of the task force’s report and recommendations when it drafts the Joint Employment Report for presentation to the Spring Council next year."
"Mr President, I shall now turn to the central theme of my speech, the Intergovernmental Conference, which is entering its final stages and of which Mr Antonione has already given an extremely balanced, commendable overview."
"The stakes will be high at the European Council in Brussels on 12 and 13 December."
"In the decisions taken we will see the fruit of the new Convention method, proposed by the European Parliament and the Commission and approved by the Heads of State or Government at the Laeken European Council in December 2001."
"Any return to the method of intergovernmental bargaining we witnessed in the early hours of the Nice summit would represent a political failure for the European Union."
"Public opinion would no longer accept it."
"The key task for the Intergovernmental Conference is now to decide how the enlarged Union can achieve its goals and increase its decision-making capacity."
"The European Union is faced with three major challenges."
"Firstly, it needs strong policies and better European coordination aimed at economic growth, job-creation and social protection."
"Then we have to give a common response to the international challenges related to security, freedom and justice."
"Thirdly, we must join forces in order to shoulder our global responsibilities and promote our values and interests."
"Article 3 of the draft Constitution solemnly sets out the Union’s objectives along these lines."
"The Convention did not, of course, produce a perfect Constitution to address these tasks. All the same, the result matches the proposals contained in the Laeken Declaration, maybe even exceeding expectations."
"The Intergovernmental Conference has clearly so far been more occupied with internal disputes between Member States than with creating the right instruments to respond to Europe’s needs and problems."
"It is certainly disappointing that there was no progress whatsoever on adoption of a procedure making amendment of the policy part of the Constitution possible."
"The Commission will support all the Presidency’s efforts to achieve this objective."
"Considering the new challenges that we will face, the Constitution cannot and must not become a constraint on future action."
"The only significant progress made so far on the work of the Convention has been the definition of structured cooperation in the field of defence."
"For all other issues, there is still a danger that the Intergovernmental Conference might take steps backwards towards the intergovernmental method."
"This is also true of European cooperation on criminal law, at precisely a time when all the leaders are aware of the threat of international crime and terrorism."
"Furthermore, some want to undermine the credibility of the Minister for Foreign Affairs – as Mr Antonione made clear – while paying lip service to the need for Europe to become stronger and play a leading role on the world stage."
"Some ministers maintain that more intergovernmentalism would strengthen economic policy coordination, while what is really needed is a greater European ability to put economic governance at the service of the growth strategy."
"Some countries would even like to reintroduce the right of veto in areas where the Convention has already abolished it, in trade policy for instance."
"Clearly, therefore, there are only two options: a divided Europe that is only a spectator on the world political stage or a united Europe contributing to peace, growth and sustainable development."
"With a choice between these two opposing options, Europe is in danger of being relegated to the sidelines in world affairs, surrounded by other powerful actors."
"In its current form, the draft Constitution gives a united Europe the means to act more effectively."
"Nothing less, but nothing more."
"It does not create a political project for the future."
"Hence, the key question facing national leaders at the Intergovernmental Conference summit is not whether to commit themselves to an ambitious European political project."
"The key question is whether, in the future, they will find the collective ability to adopt the necessary instruments which any European project will need."
"The Convention preserved and improved the balance of powers between the various European Union institutions."
"A strong Commission is indispensable for impartial application of the Union’s rules and so the Commission’s powers in key areas such as state-aid control should not be watered down at the last minute."
"Our goal of becoming a genuine Union of states and peoples finds expression in the double-majority system proposed for Council decision-making."
"Democratic legitimacy has been reinforced by strengthening the role of the European Parliament in legislative, political and budgetary matters, and the Court of Justice's role in upholding the rule of law has, in part, been strengthened."
"One thing is certain, ladies and gentlemen: the Commission will hold out against any attempt to weaken the powers of the European Parliament, especially in budgetary matters, right to the end of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"How can the European Parliament and the Commission be expected to explain and promote to the citizens a Constitution which Parliament itself would have rejected?"
"There is no explanation that would stand up."
"For its own part, the Commission welcomes the Presidency’s acknowledgement that making a distinction between Commissioners with and without voting powers is too complex and, above all, will not work."
"There is a simple solution which preserves the equality of all Commissioners: a Commission made up of one Commissioner per Member State, with a more decentralised decision-making structure, and a system of checks and balances to ensure total collegiality."
"This is the solution that the Commission wants to see in the Constitution."
"Lastly, the double-majority voting system proposed by the Convention 50% of the Member States representing 60% of the population - is simple and fair."
"Any change should be aimed at facilitating the College’s decision-making process."
"Of course, the Commission’s preference remains a system based on 50% of the Member States representing at least 50% of the population."
"Under no circumstances should the Intergovernmental Conference decide on a voting system that would make decision-making in the Council even more difficult than under the Nice system."
"There is simply no justification for a Constitution ‘worse than Nice’."
"Moreover, in Brussels, we must, at all costs, avoid the kind of last-minute bartering that would serve only to undermine the credibility of the Constitution before we have even had a chance to present it."
"Remember that the first referendum on the Constitution will be held a mere six months after the conclusion of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, before winding up – and without entering into a debate that will take place in this House at a later date – I should like to make a few brief comments on last week’s Ecofin Council meeting."
"My assessment is based on both the substance of the decision and the procedure."
"As regards the substance, the Council reached overall agreement on deficit reduction plans, which, moreover, are in line with those proposed by the two countries concerned."
"The Council therefore accepted the commitments given by Germany and France that they would consolidate their 2005 budgets."
"From a procedural standpoint, on the other hand, the affair has more serious implications because the Council has opted for an entirely intergovernmental course of action instead of that mapped out by the institutional procedures."
"Here, I must repeat my basic criticism: we should not take short cuts whenever the rules of the Pact and the Treaty, rules that were agreed unanimously, become demanding or inconvenient."
"The usefulness and value of the Treaty and the Pact depend on the certainty of the rules to which we all – Commission, Parliament, Council and Member States – must adhere."
"This is such a serious matter that I do not wish to gloss over it."
"My hope is, however, that, as has so often happened in the history of the Union, a serious crisis will give rise to the most innovative and lasting solutions."
"I therefore believe we should look ahead, fixing our eyes on two objectives: one for the immediate term and one for the future."
"In the immediate term, I am sure that the Member States will see the Council's final declaration as an indication of a greater, more resolute undertaking in the area of growth and stability, and that they will realise that the rules have to be applied systematically."
"For our part, we shall continue to discharge our duty by applying the Treaty and the rules of the Pact."
"It is our responsibility, particularly in this phase, to ensure absolute equality of treatment for all Member States."
"Furthermore, budgetary discipline and stability are essential to Economic and Monetary Union."
"In any case, the affair also teaches us a lesson for the future."
"You will all remember the critical remarks I made a year ago."
"I did not mean to condemn the Pact; my remarks were intended to be a strong appeal for the Pact to become a better thought-out instrument for coordinating budgetary policies at European level."
"Now that the single currency is a practical reality, the markets and all the citizens need to be able to rely on proper economic governance, for which we need a genuine economic policy."
"We have to embark on a new phase of consolidating and managing our achievements and fitting them to the new situation, but always in a disciplined manner and, above all, always treating everybody equally."
"We must restore the credibility of our instruments of economic governance and of the rule of law now that we are in the midst of a debate on our new Constitution."
"As early as a year ago, the Commission took an initial step in this direction by presenting specific proposals for strengthening and coordinating economic policies and interpreting the Pact in a way that would make it both more flexible and more rigorous."
"This line of action proposed by the Commission was approved by the European Council."
"Moreover, our contribution to the Convention already contained a section on strengthening and coordinating European economic policy, and parts of our proposals were taken up by the Intergovernmental Conference."
"These tentative steps forward cannot be called into question now."
"Ecofin’s decisions, however, show that the real problem still to be resolved is the genuine weakness of our present system of European economic governance."
"The real challenge facing us is how to solve this problem."
"The Commission will now take careful stock of the situation and prepare a forward-looking initiativeto take on that challenge."
"Indeed, in my view, it is not enough to revise the rules for implementing the Pact."
"We must have an in-depth debate on fiscal policy in the wider framework of the general monitoring and coordination of economic policy."
"Above all, we need to link budgetary policy more closely to the more general objective of boosting growth potential without jeopardising the long-term sustainability of public finances."
"To this end, we should be more proactive in using the broad economic policy guidelines and the Stability and Growth Pact together as instruments to coordinate economic policies in a way that will secure the smooth functioning of Economic and Monetary Union and ensure that we achieve the Lisbon objectives."
"We need, therefore, to strike a new balance between these two instruments in order to preserve budgetary discipline while, at the same time, stimulating growth."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the few days left before the Brussels European Council, we must act with determination and optimism if we are to achieve the major goals we have set ourselves."
"If we do that, the Constitution now taking shape will clarify our basic objectives, define the European Union’s area of action more precisely and make the working of our institutions simpler and more transparent."
"I am confident that we shall pass on to future generations a Union that is not only larger and more influential but also more coherent, more democratic and closer to the European citizens."
"We must not settle for less at this great, historic time."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, let me start by thanking the Italian Presidency of the Council for having so far kept its promise to stick as closely as possible to the Convention’s draft."
"On behalf of my group, I would encourage them to keep to this rule."
"It must be apparent to us that what has happened with the Stability Pact has lost us credibility in some areas, with an effect on the relations between smaller and larger states in these negotiations and, as regards two states, it has certainly not led them to adopt a more conciliatory negotiating position."
"Perhaps I may start by saying something that I think is important, namely that these negotiations must not interfere with the stability and strength of the European Central Bank, and that the attempts in various quarters to do so must be nipped in the bud."
"It must be clear to us that there has been a great deal of progress in many areas, to which Mr Antonione has referred."
"I am particularly pleased that Naples has seen such progress in the area of security policy with regard to structural cooperation and the mutual assistance clause, including the protocol, to such an extent that it can indeed be described as a breakthrough."
"The Convention, I believe, always took the view that the door should be left open so that other countries could join, and that this should not be seen in opposition to trans-Atlantic relationships."
"I just hope that the Foreign Minister can gain acceptance in the same way, and I think it extraordinarily important from the point of view of the Commission and of Parliament that the Foreign Minister should be a full member of the Commission, with all that follows from that, although there is no doubting that he will have particular duties of loyalty to the Council, and the clarification that the Italian Presidency of the Council has provided in this regard is also important."
"I also think it crucially important that he should also chair the Council of Foreign Ministers – indeed, it makes no sense for him not to, and only then will the whole edifice make sense."
"I am not sure that I can take seriously the idea that it is the foreign ministers, of all people, who find the title of ‘Foreign Minister’ problematic."
"I do not quite understand what is so problematic about it."
"If I am reading Naples the right way, it also seems to be important that the President of the European Council should not have the power to intervene in the General Council and in what it does."
"I hope that the negotiations will leave this unchanged."
"This is part of the institutional balance – President of the Commission, General Council and European Council – and we have accepted the idea of a President of the European Council only if he has no influence over the rest of what the Council does and over the lawmaking process."
"I believe that this will prove resistant to the attempts about which we have heard."
"I have to say that there are two points that leave me profoundly saddened. Trying to solve the problem of voting procedures in the Council by setting a fixed date, in 2009, when it has to go back to taking decisions unanimously, is an escape route."
"It is one that has never worked yet, and if we want the Council to function, it must be enabled to take decisions by dual majority, as proposed by the Convention, and I hope that this will not be too readily abandoned in the course of negotiations over the next ten days."
"We took a critical line on Nice because it did not provide the capacity to act that enlargement demanded."
"This of all points must not be the cause of the negotiations’ failure."
"The second point I would like to address is this: if Parliament is to lose out as a result of changes to budgetary law, then I regard that as the breaking point."
"If – as the Ecofin ministers tell us – the intention is that Parliament’s budgetary rights should revert to being what they were before the Inter-Institutional Agreement, or even pre-1978, then that is not acceptable."
"What we have is a finely-tuned balance, including the fact that the Council alone has the last word when it comes to own resources."
"In this context, this is a balance, one that is destroyed if any point of it is changed. Although I have gone over time, I would like to say that approval of the Budget is Parliament’s prerogative."
"No parliament can agree to a constitution that violates this prerogative."
"Mr President, let me start by making a point relating to method, since the President of the Commission – quite rightly, in my opinion – has touched on the Stability Pact, which is the next item for debate."
"The President-in-Office of the Council informs me that Minister Tremonti will deal with this subject, not him."
"We will have to tell both of them what we think about this budgetary and economic issue."
"Let us start at the beginning, however."
"On the subject of the Social Summit, which will be covered in greater detail by other Members, I would like to start by saying that I hope the Summit will not just be a bolt-on extra."
"The Lisbon Strategy has shown us what happens to good intentions in the absence of commitments."
"We feel it is incredibly important at this time that we should devote ourselves to devising proactive policies for our most valuable asset: human resources."
"We therefore support Wim Kok’s proposals and hope that the Council will draft policies which are more than just a list of good intentions."
"Moving on to the outcome of the ministerial meeting in Naples – which apparently, although there was no black smoke issuing from Vesuvius, was marked by a storm that darkened the end of the meeting – I would like to state, in clear opposition to the position adopted by the Italian Government, that we still want to see an agreement on 13 December."
"We want the Italian Presidency to be a success."
"I have to admit that the Italian Presidency has maintained a constructive approach, often going much further than most governments."
"Moving on to the issues under discussion today, I would like to draw the Council and the Italian Presidency’s attention to the responsibilities of this Intergovernmental Conference, which is being held after the Union has opened its doors to democracy."
"Those doors were opened, but have been shut again."
"We cannot now accept last-minute deals and haggling that are not only against Parliament, but also against democracy and transparency."
"Consequently, we in the PSE Group do not consider the question of the Legislative Council settled."
"In the name of dignity and in order to maintain the ordinary legislative process, the Intergovernmental Conference ought to reconsider the matter."
"On the subject of the Commission’s composition, I would like to say that, in principle, the majority in my group feels a flexible solution is required."
"We are not in favour of having one Commissioner per Member State, but whatever happens, we have to remember that we are thinking in terms of transition periods, when actually the Commission needs to be a responsible executive body for Europe."
"We have noted the Italian Presidency’s proposal regarding qualified majority voting, which is based on a double majority of citizens and States as in Article 1 of the Constitution."
"There is room for fine-tuning, but what we must not do is go further, to the triple majority established at the Nice Summit, because this approach definitely does not work."
"We welcome the progress made on structured cooperation on defence under the Common Foreign and Security Policy and we support the Italian Presidency’s proposal on extending the use of qualified majority voting."
"We are very disappointed with the current third pillar proposals, particularly those relating to judicial cooperation, criminal and civil matters, and the role of the European Public Prosecutor."
"There is a very clear regression on these points compared with the draft Constitution."
"I would like to conclude, Mr President, by commenting on the Council’s all-out attack on Parliament, despite the fact that it has no authority to do so."
"Let us be clear: Ecofin does not have authority over the powers of this House."
"I would say that this is an offensive move on the part of the Council and also of their advisors, the , as they are called in Italian, since Coreper is the next level down from the Council, and it is in Coreper that the papers are prepared for the Council, as the Ministers are not usually experts in this field."
"Let me say that this kind of proposal is wholly unacceptable to us."
"There is a clear demarcation line that must not be crossed."
"In fact, I would go further: there has been a harmonious balance of power between Parliament and the Council since 1975 and we are not going to take these changes lying down."
"If the Council dismantles the budget system, we will respond in kind, and we will see who is willing to go furthest."
"We are not just going to sit still and bemoan our lot."
"We have powers, and we shall defend them to the bitter end."
"Mr President, all eyes are on efforts to agree a Constitutional Treaty before the year is out."
"The irony of our leaders making new rules for the European Union only days after breaking the Stability Pact will not be lost on our citizens."
"At the same time, we look to the European Council to shoulder its responsibility, to stand up for the rights of European citizens who continue to be held in Guantanamo Bay."
"In Naples, our Foreign Ministers managed to move closer to agreement only by moving further away from the Convention text."
"My group regrets that the tide of reform will not now rise to the high water mark set by the Convention."
"The Convention's extension of codecision to budgetary powers would have made the European Union more accountable and transparent."
"No viable parliamentary democracy can exist without the power of the purse."
"The obduracy of finance ministers on this matter is a battle pitting raw politics against the principle of reform."
"I welcome the remarks of the President of the Commission."
"We must not cede on this point."
"We also have to resolve the issue of voting weights so that the efficiency and accountability gains promised by the Convention are not entirely lost."
"To us, what really killed the Stability Pact was certain countries confusing their power to break the law with the right to do so."
"In Guantanamo Bay, the United States has fallen victim to the same confusion."
"America was founded on the principle that the free are governed by laws, not men."
"Countries have borders, but principles do not."
"There is no line on a map beyond which such values no longer hold."
"The prison at Guantanamo Bay squanders a precious American legacy and surrenders vital high ground."
"For two years the 660 men and boys in Camp Delta have been denied the rights of prisoners of war or of civilian criminals."
"They have been charged with no crimes."
"The military commissions that will judge them will grant no right of appeal and no access to an effective defence."
"Dostoyevsky once wrote: 'You can only know the nature of a civilisation by visiting its prisons'."
"Of all the tests that a civilisation can be handed, the responsible use of power over the powerless is the greatest."
"Sadly, the standards of detention and justice at Guantanamo Bay are unworthy of a country with America's proud history of civil liberties."
"While I welcome the news that some detainees may shortly be repatriated, winning a reprieve from this disgrace for a few Australians and a few Europeans renders more stark the injustice committed to those who will be left behind."
"Europe must press for every man and boy in Guantanamo Bay to be either immediately charged, face justice in their home country or be released, regardless of nationality."
"President-in-Office, I hope that will be high on your agenda."
"I call upon this House to demand of the European Council an unequivocal statement of Europe's dismay, and I call upon our President to convey that message."
"I call upon the European Union’s leaders to ensure that bilateral deals do not silence Europe on the greater principles at stake."
"The Liberal Group adds its support to calls for the European Parliament and for the Council to submit an Amicus Brief to the US Supreme Court on behalf of the detainees."
"Two of our greatest enemies in the fight against terror are the fear that makes us cheapen our freedoms and the power that makes us cynical of them."
"If you at the Council can find the will to do justice to our enemy, then we will already have won."
"Mr President, the wonderful speech that Mr Watson has just given is a hard act to follow."
"I fully agree with the comments that my fellow Member made about the detainees in Guantanamo Bay, and my group will also be appealing to the Presidency to stand firm on this matter at the next Council meeting."
"I should also like to call for the Council meeting to express its support for the Geneva Initiative for peace in the Middle East, under which a number of courageous Palestinians and Israelis have now signed an agreement that may succeed in breaking down walls."
"It may be our hope for peace in the region."
"Returning to the European Convention and the Intergovernmental Conference, when the Convention chose to draw up a whole treaty, that is what it was: a choice."
"Laeken, of course, primarily called for answers to a number of different problems, and, since the Convention nevertheless chose to draw up a single, unified treaty, I also think that it has been party to risking the method of working somewhat."
"Perhaps the Convention has raised the European banner so high that its feet do not touch the ground."
"It is to be hoped not, but I should like to say that the product of this – the European Constitution – has several weaknesses and also several strengths. Above all, however, it baffles me how we can sit in this House in a parliamentary assembly – an elected assembly – discussing a constitution which will possibly not be put to the vote, on which our citizens are not permitted to take a position, and to which European citizens are not given the opportunity to give their assent or dissent."
"A number of Member States are to hold referendums, but the mere idea of introducing something resembling a constitution without consulting the citizens is too far removed from my understanding of democracy, at any rate, for words."
"After all, democracy is more than just democratic institutions, although that is part of it."
"Democracy is also more than just free, democratic elections between multiple candidates and multiple parties, although that is part of it."
"Democracy also comprises the possibility for dialogue with the citizens in the process."
"Citizens should not just cast their vote and go home."
"They must also be consulted in the case of important events, such as the drafting of a European constitution."
"I hope that the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference will be such that it can be accepted by those citizens who are able to vote on it."
"That will, however, be quite some task, for example on the subject of economic policy."
"We have just had a little talk about EMU, and this will also be discussed a little later in connection with the Stability and Growth Pact, but the policies behind the Stability and Growth Pact have of course been incorporated into the draft Constitution, and, at the same time, as was said during the Danish referendum, we are now seeing how the small countries have to comply with the rules whilst the large ones are let off."
"We do not care for this policy, and I also hope, therefore, that the Council meeting will find a solution to this problem, so that Germany is able to solve its economic problems and we do not just have to follow rigid requirements."
"– Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office, the Intergovernmental Conference is not going well."
"In my view, the result expected in Brussels at this stage appears to be dreadful."
"I believe that one of the great capacities of politicians who want to say ‘yes’ is having the courage, when it comes down to it, to say ‘no’ or to refuse to sign."
"I feel that it is only right that the Presidency, the Commission and everyone involved should try to reach agreement in Brussels."
"However, if reaching agreement in Brussels means replaying the palaver of the last night in Nice, the Intergovernmental Conference must not end in Brussels."
"There must be no repeat of Nice!"
"You have heard of ‘Dying for Danzig’; now, the Poles have brought us ‘Dying for Poland’."
"Mr Prodi said: ‘We are going to die for the budget’."
"I say: ‘I do not want to die for Brussels’."
"That is the situation."
"I know that the governments usually laugh because this Parliament does not have to say ‘yes’."
"I know that they say that in the end Parliament will be won over."
"In fact, even the majority in this Parliament, against a minority, was won over in Nice and said ‘yes’ to Nice, while we said that Nice would make enlargement impossible or that it would be impossible for Europe to function."
"You, ladies and gentlemen and Mr President-in-Office, can tell them that they will have to see to it that this Constitution is ratified, whether it be by Parliament or through a referendum."
"Tell them, too, that if the vast majority of us, the Members of the European Parliament, do not agree with what they have signed, we are capable of swinging the referenda towards the ‘no’ vote."
"We can still be a nuisance even if you do not allow us to make the decision with you."
"If you do not receive the support of the most European of Europeans, in other words, of this Parliament, you will not receive the support of the people of Europe."
"You must get that into your head."
"Therefore, if you revise the Convention’s draft Constitution, if you do not want to talk about the legislative council any more, if you do not want to talk about institutional equality with regard to the budget and to Parliament’s right, if you are unwilling to come up with the double majority, if you want to call into question the definition of the content of Europe as defined in the first part of the Convention’s text, the most European of Europeans will fight against this text."
"So I say to you that you must not sign, for if you do not reach agreement you must continue to talk."
"You must talk to the Poles."
"You must talk to the Spanish."
"You must talk to my grandmother and to my grandfather and to anyone else."
"As far as I am concerned, signing before doing this would be a crime against Europe."
"That is what we will say to the people, and we will try to persuade our governments not to sign in Brussels if the result is not satisfactory and to leave it to the Irish Presidency or the Luxembourg Presidency to finish the job."
"The fact is that it is never too late to finish but it is sometimes too early."
"That is what I am afraid of and that is why I say to you that you must trust in Europe and must not sacrifice it to a signature of which you will be ashamed, just as you have been ashamed of Nice."
"That, after all, is why you launched the Convention."
"Mr President, I believe it is fair to say that the meeting of the European Union Foreign Ministers in Naples last weekend was a very productive one."
"I say this because now the European Union governments are discussing what I would describe as the bottom-line issues relating to areas of concern with regard to the likely provisions of the new European Union Treaty."
"The Italian Government needs to be commended for accelerating the pace of these negotiations, and the holding of this recent meeting in Naples was a very timely one."
"EU leaders are now meeting next week, on 12 December 2003, to see whether they can hammer out the final agreement which will govern the future of the European Union."
"I believe, in the light of the spirit of cooperation and determination that prevails at this moment, that an agreement can be reached at the forthcoming meeting of the heads of the European Union governments."
"That is not to say that there are not problems or areas of dispute."
"I have always believed it is very important that there is equality of representation with regard to the future composition of the European Commission."
"Equally, there are different concerns from the perspectives of different Member State governments within the Union."
"It is clear that the likely direction of the decision-making process within the Parliament and within the European Council is going to be based on codecision and majority voting procedures."
"I believe that the citizens of Europe are demanding to know the exact responsibilities of the new political portfolios that are being created within the European Union."
"They want to know exactly what the roles of a likely European Union Foreign Minister, and a possible President of the European Council, will be."
"It is important that clarification be given to these questions and that there is no duplication of roles."
"This would blur what the European Union should be doing at this time."
"Furthermore, there is still a concern within Europe with regard to a few sensitive national concerns."
"I very strongly take the view that taxation issues should remain the preserve of the individual Member State governments."
"I do not believe that the European Union should be given powers to raise taxes by means of a procedure of qualified majority voting."
"Equally, I believe that the qualified majority voting procedure should not apply to decisions concerning the operation of legal systems within the European Union."
"This would be an incorrect step because of the different criminal legal systems operating in Europe."
"I have no doubt that over the next ten days there will be further intensification of dialogue between all contracting parties in an effort to broker an agreement for a new European Union Treaty."
"The goodwill is there to reach an agreement at the forthcoming European Council."
"While the Italian Government's timetable is certainly ambitious, it can be achieved under the right circumstances."
"I wish it every success in doing so."
"Mr President, this is probably the last time we shall be meeting before the summit on 12–13 December, and I should like to warn against the Constitution that is now on its way."
"The Laeken Declaration set the task of bringing the EU closer to its citizens."
"Now, a large number of new decisions is to be transferred from the national parliaments to officials behind closed doors in Brussels."
"More decisions are to be transferred from open parliaments to semi-secret Council working parties than decisions in the Council are to be made open."
"Overall openness will diminish."
"Legislative power is essentially being turned into executive power."
"In essence, the electorate is having its influence curtailed."
"The democratic deficit will increase, although the task was to reduce it."
"The federalists in this House are clapping their hands with glee, as they themselves will obtain more influence."
"Instead, they should be opposing the fact that national parliaments are ceding much more power than the European Parliament is gaining."
"The electorate and the elected representatives will be the losers."
"Lobbyists and officials will gain legislative power if the present draft is adopted."
"The Heads of State or Government will be given the right to appoint those who will hold power in the EU."
"The President of the EU, the EU Minister for Foreign Affairs, the President of the Commission and his/her vice-president will all be appointed by an alliance of 17 out of 25 Heads of State or Government."
"Eight countries can be outvoted and their wishes disregarded."
"Out of those 17, ten will probably be able to continue as leaders in their own countries."
"The seven who do not hold on to power back home can then share jobs in Brussels."
"When politicians lose the confidence of the people in their own country, they can have their rejected policies embalmed for five years."
"The monopoly on making legislative proposals will rest with people who can no longer be elected."
"The Commissioners are not elected and are not answerable to the electorate."
"The Commission can only be unseated with a two-thirds majority, and doing so will at most create a crisis."
"The European Parliament itself is undergoing a crisis, with ever falling voter turnout and an inability to make the Commissioners comply with a bookkeeping law applying to every book-seller in the EU, for example."
"Effective means against fraud do, however, exist, namely openness and democracy."
"Let the Commissioners be appointed by, and be answerable to, the national parliaments."
"Thus, no Commissioner will get away with saying ‘I am not responsible; I did not know what was happening’."
"Build Europe from the bottom up and not from the top down."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, I am going to read some statements made after Naples."
"Mr Fischer said: ‘I am leaving Naples more concerned than when I arrived’."
"Commissioner de Palacio said: ‘It is clear that only a minority of States support the Giscard d’Estaing project."
"Mr Villepin said: ‘I will not accept watered-down compromises’."
"The President-in-Office of the Council himself has stated that Austria, Estonia, Denmark and, to a certain extent, Spain, Poland and the United Kingdom would, if they had to choose, currently opt for Nice rather than the new system."
"No comment."
"This is the picture."
"In his excellent speech, which we all applauded with pleasure, Mr Cohn-Bendit stated that he did not want to die for Denmark, Europe or America nor from any illness."
"Bravo."
"Nor do I. However, this policy, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, this lack of policy on the part of our, or your, Europe, is condemning tens of thousands of people to death in the Middle East and jeopardising the region’s fate and future."
"In my opinion, and I support the appeal made also by the former President, Mr Cossiga, on this matter – on the issue of war and peace – pacifists, the only thing you can say is that we must withdraw our troops."
"Bravo."
"You are no different from the people in 1939."
"It is now necessary, and this is our specific proposal as radical members of the Bonino List, in compliance with international law and the rules of war, that experts be consulted as a matter of urgency."
"We must act quickly to legalise the situation and, therefore, the UN, Europe, the Arab League, and, I believe, even the United States, must call for an official peace process."
"The error committed in Italy by the Allies, who even at that time were liberators, is being repeated in the Middle East."
"On 8 September 1943, when the Italian army disintegrated overnight like Saddam Hussein’s army, Italy could have been liberated in two months."
"Instead, it took them months and months."
"It took them six months just to set up the Republic of Salò."
"There will be no territorial Republic of Salò, but we are clearly witnessing the clandestine reform of the Iraqi army, not least in that it remains unpaid."
"Consequently, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in my view, Italy, and now Europe, must take the initiative of convening a special Council meeting for the purpose of proposing a peace process to the UN, the United States and the international community."
"In accordance with the rules of international war, Saddam Hussein is to be characterised as a clandestine fighter so that – as happened for instance in Cassibile in Italy – haggling can subsequently take place not over Saddam Hussein’s immunity, but over his exile and impunity."
"This is a genuine political initiative."
"It can bring together France, Germany and even neo-conservatives in the US."
"Italy and Europe are once again shuddering as they did in the case of the former Yugoslavia."
"The image of Srebrenica symbolises our failure to act."
"I therefore appeal to you: let us live forever, as Mr Cohn-Bendit wants."
"Indeed, let us ward off illness, but let us not continue to condemn to death entire populations of the world in the name of freedom and legality."
"Mr President, this debate is becoming very emotional, but my comments are not in that vein."
"I think the Intergovernmental Conference is turning out as could have been expected."
"I am not at all surprised by the developments in the Conference."
"I would like to say to the President-in-Office of the Council that I think that the Italian Presidency is doing well in some areas."
"I think good progress is being made on certain subjects, such as the social clause."
"This was something we did not succeed on in the Convention."
"I think it would be a positive step if your Presidency succeeded in putting this on the agenda, and we could then see how many Socialist governments support the idea."
"I also think that there are other matters on which you will manage to obtain reasonable agreements – the question of a European Public Prosecutor, for example."
"If your proposal entailed a European Public Prosecutor who would deal with matters affecting the Union’s financial interests, I think this House could accept it, provided that the Public Prosecutor was appointed using the ordinary legislative procedure rather than by a unanimous decision."
"You have a consensus proposal here which, I think, will allow us to move forward."
"There are, however, some other issues where the Italian Presidency has not sought to find a compromise solution, and I do not understand their reasoning."
"Take the question of double majority, for example."
"I do not see why the Italian Presidency has refused to come up with any alternative proposal to the Convention text when they have done so in several other cases."
"Time is marching on."
"I believe there is only one more ministerial meeting scheduled before the definitive Council meeting, and I am not sure we will achieve a result that will be acceptable to all parties."
"Obviously, in political terms, this is not really the best time to be addressing the subject, since the breakdown of the Stability Pact seems to suggest that there are two different standards in use in the European Union – and I would appreciate it if you would pass these comments on to Mr Tremonti – which is not really helping to create a climate conducive to obtaining a consensus."
"Unlike a previous speaker, however, I do feel that we have to complete our work by 13 December."
"I do not think that having more time to consult our grandparents – to use the words of my fellow Member, who is not here at the moment – will lead to a better result."
"I do not think it will work."
"In my view, the situation is cut and dried: we are all familiar with the solutions that have been put forward, we know what alternatives are available, and I think we now have to give a political signal by approving the Constitution on 13 December."
"That is the political signal we need to give."
"I think enlargement is another reason why we need to do so. Enlargement is the big gamble for Europe and for this Parliament, and has to go hand-in-hand with the political recasting embodied by the Constitution."
"It would be very hard to explain if enlargement were completed on 1 May 2004 but for some reason there was no Constitution."
"I therefore urge you to persevere, and call on the national governments to demonstrate pride in the European Constitution, to forget national interests and consider that what we need at the present time is a Constitution for a Union of both States and citizens, which will allow us to work together in the exciting period the coming years represent."
"So, keep up the good work, President-in-Office of the Council."
"Keep on trying to reach agreement."
"Keep on working towards completion on 13 December."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at the very outset, I would like to give the Italian Council Presidency credit for its intensive efforts, in the Intergovernmental Conference negotiations, to keep as close as possible to what the Convention produced and also to offer solutions that go beyond that."
"Let me give two examples: the explicit reference to equal opportunities for women and men as being among the values of the European Union was not of the Convention’s doing."
"That you should propose it, and that it should be accepted, amounts to progress, and that is something we should make clear."
"Your proposal that decisions in specific areas of the Common Foreign and Security Policy should, subject to certain conditions, be reached by qualified majority voting, goes beyond what the Convention came up with, and that is something I explicitly underline in order to make clear the extraordinarily positive role you play in this."
"I do, however, have to tell Mr Brok, who is now no longer present, that what you have proposed with regard to the European Central Bank does not interfere with the Bank’s independence."
"It goes no further than what we want for other areas, that being that decisions on specific technical issues should be capable of being taken by a simplified procedure, and that means that if the Heads of Government want to change something, they have to do so unanimously."
"Unanimity remains in place; the only thing is that, if we want to sort out technical issues, we do not have to set the whole process of revising the Treaties and the Constitution in motion."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I believe that we all see this as a quite crucial point, and I would ask the Council Presidency to see it in that light too."
"As regards Parliament’s budgetary rights, both in medium-term financial planning and in the annual Budget, we cannot and will not accept less than what we have already."
"Such a thing cannot be acceptable to a democratically elected parliament, and we will resist it with all the means at our disposal."
"I might add that I welcome the unambiguous stance taken up by the Commission on this point."
"We may well not always be on the same side, but, in this instance, Mr President of the Commission, we are glad of your support, for our allies are thin on the ground where this is concerned."
"I am glad that you are numbered among them, as also is the Presidency of the Council."
"There is one final point that I would like to address. I, too, have my criticisms of Naples."
"Like Mr Fischer, the German Foreign Minister, I came away from Naples more depressed than I was when I went there."
"My worry is that we are leaving open many issues that will then be squeezed into the package for the Heads of State or Government, and that we will then end up with a repeat of this ‘night of Nice’ and its compromise, not merely on the lowest common denominator, but with a collection of compromises, completely unrelated and mutually contradictory."
"The danger of a repeat performance of Nice in Brussels on 13 December has become greater since Naples."
"My fear is that we will then end up with this peculiar ‘rendezvous clause’."
"For over ten years, ever since Maastricht, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that really has been the customary flight response of the Heads of State or Government."
"At Maastricht, we said that we needed the political unification of Europe."
"We postponed it, deciding that we would do it later."
"Then we had Amsterdam, and then its celebrated leftovers."
"They were then deferred until Nice, where you could not sort it out, and so we passed it on to the Convention."
"Now the Convention has come up with a proposal."
"Please, I beg you, Mr President-in-Office, do not do the same thing again!"
"The situation is getting no better."
"If there are more leftovers from any decision taken on 13 December, then the European public as a whole will see that as a failure on the part of the European Union’s Heads of State or Government."
"Mr President-in-Office, I urge you to prevent such a failure."
"They will be judged not only on their ability to achieve a result, but also to propagate a solution – and so will you."
"President, this Friday, 5 December 2003, the parliamentary members of the Convention will meet up again to consider the progress of the Intergovernmental Conference, to speak with Mr Frattini and Mr Giscard d’Estaing, and to make joint proposals to the IGC."
"The main thrust of our deliberations will be to support the work of the Italian presidency in defending the work of the Convention, but I fully agree with Mr Hänsch that we will fight the notion of clauses on key elements of the package."
"Procrastination will not make tricky decisions simpler to solve: the time to act decisively is now."
"Nor will we approve proposals to inflate the size and distort the shape of the Commission - or indeed this Parliament - to avoid concessions to the self-esteem of Member States."
"Such ploys do not contribute to the efficiency and effectiveness of those authorities, and to ignore the settled will of this Parliament is certain to jeopardise the prospects of the new settlement being brought into force."
"It will sour the political atmosphere and wound the democratic legitimacy of the Union."
"The Presidents of the Council and of the Commission should be absolutely clear that the IGC cannot take our consent for granted."
"Mr President, of course the workers, the peoples of our countries, do not expect the Council summit to talk to them about the reality they experience on a daily basis as the result of the policy of the centre right or centre left governments of the European Union."
"They experience on the ground the increase in unemployment, shrinking incomes, the campaign against and even the abolition of the eight-hour day and their other rights as a result of the famous Lisbon agenda, the application of which is to be assessed by the Council."
"They know that all this is being promoted in the name of competitiveness and productivity, with the sole objective of increasing the profits of big business in the European Union."
"This is also the more general objective of the constant reduction in labour costs, even where we have increased rates of growth, such as in Greece, where the workers are the most productive and the worst paid in the European Union."
"As with all the other issues which will be discussed, such as the Intergovernmental Conference and the European Constitution, which institutionalises capitalism, the further militarisation and autocracy of the European Union, the strengthening of repressive anti-labour mechanisms, the – as far as the peoples are concerned, negative – enlargement with ten new countries and immigration and asylum policy, the sole aim of the Council summit is to safeguard and increase the profits and the power of big business in the European Union."
"The continuing occupation of Iraq is also resulting solely in increased profits and is continuing to claim victims among the Iraqi people, as well as among the conquerors and their allies as a result of the justified resistance of the Iraqi people."
"So the European Council in Brussels will not only not change these political orientations, but will also take measures to reinforce and legally safeguard them."
"In my opinion, the only way to change this situation is develop resistance and counterattack by the peoples, which fortunately are burgeoning constantly."
"We shall do everything within our power to strengthen this prospect."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by associating myself with Mr Watson’s determined protest against the grave and ongoing violations of human rights in the USA’s prison camps."
"Let me now turn to the Intergovernmental Conference."
"I ask myself why in fact the governments summoned a Convention, when, even without one, they could still have had the age-old spectacle of the nations haggling over their interests."
"While the governments are turning the Convention draft inside out, we in this House have gone back to drafting resolutions, repeating ourselves, protesting against the eternal sameness of things, but to no avail, with neither a response nor even a serious debate to show for it."
"The question we should be asking ourselves is what we should be doing."
"The governments think they know what our response is going to be; we gave it to them after the partial failure of Amsterdam."
"It was, ‘this is better than nothing.’"
"Then, after Nice, where the failure was complete, we gave it to them again: ‘this is better than nothing.’"
"Now I have come to believe that a bad constitution is not better than nothing."
"We should make it plain to the governments that it is not they who are the masters of the treaties, but the parliaments and the people they represent, and that it is these who can bring this constitution down."
"We are then told in tones full of emotion that the dignity of every single Member State must be safeguarded."
"What about Europe’s dignity?"
"Nobody said a word about that."
"I cannot imagine that the dignity of any single Member State demands that the principles of the separation of the powers and of the public nature of lawmaking be violated, or that the legislative council – the Convention’s big idea for greater democracy – be done away with."
"I cannot imagine that the dignity of a Member State demands that the undoubted legitimacy of dual majority be traded for the lottery of Nice."
"I cannot imagine that the dignity of a Member State means that more laws have to be passed in Council, or that more offences against parliamentarianism and the public nature of lawmaking are called for."
"That has nothing whatever to do with national dignity, which does not require an attack on Parliament’s budgetary rights."
"In the last debate, and in the corridors and behind the scenes, I have heard people calling for compromise."
"To hear Mr Méndez de Vigo speak about it, you would think it was about this House renouncing its loyalty to the Convention and setting out on the treacherous ice of compromise."
"We are offered compromises only when we are in retreat."
"We are offered negotiations only when democracy and the rights of Parliament are disputed."
"Nobody seems to me to be offering to negotiate concerning our demands over and above the Intergovernmental Conference."
"This time, we should make it plain that a bad constitution is not better than nothing."
"Presidents, ladies and gentlemen, like Mr Cohn-Bendit, I also take the view that there is no hurry, because the Nice declaration, which started the entire process, scheduled the Intergovernmental Conference for 2004 and I believe that a good and long-lasting agreement which takes a long time to reach is better than a bad agreement reached quickly."
"I must, however, acknowledge the merits of the Italian Presidency and the progress that appears to have been started in Naples."
"Naples represents a very positive step in the development of the Intergovernmental Conference, on which I heartily congratulate the Italian Presidency, and which has given rise to positive expectations in many areas."
"It would be extremely damaging now to disappoint these expectations."
"Progress was also made on enshrining the rule of one Commissioner per Member State with full and equal status."
"The limits imposed on the powers of the President of the European Council is to be welcomed, as is the creation of a diversified and versatile system for the rotating presidencies of the various formations of the Council, replacing the unnecessary elimination of the rotating presidency system."
"I welcome the rejection of the so-called ‘simplified’ methods of revising the Treaties, which would constitute an abuse of the traditional model of international and constitutional law."
"Having said this, however, some points still present cause for concern and on these I would appeal to the common sense of Europe’s leaders and to the imagination of the Italian Presidency."
"Firstly, the principle of the primacy of Community law must be clarified and in a way that does not destroy the very principle of national sovereignty."
"Secondly, the transparency and openness of the legislative workings of the Council must be guaranteed, since the prospect of our having a legislative Council appears, unfortunately, to have been abandoned."
"Thirdly, there must be considerable caution and limitations imposed on the passerelleclauses: these must not be seen as a means of re-establishing so-called simplified methods – which are also irregular, in my opinion – of revising the Treaties."
"Next, there is no need to use this too ‘forward-looking’ vocabulary, including ‘minister’ or the word ‘constitution’ itself. A solution must also be found to the issue of recognising the heritage of Christianity, of the Judaeo-Christian religion, together with other components of Europe’s historical and spiritual inheritance, and the secular nature of the institutions must be confirmed."
"One would have to be extremely intolerant and prejudiced not to accept the proposal of the Italian Presidency."
"I wish to say a few words on the issue of qualified majority voting, which Spain and Poland appear to see as an obstacle: we are in favour of parity (60% plus 60%)."
"Spain must understand that it is the largest of the medium-sized countries and not the smallest of the large countries."
"Europe needs more medium-sized countries, not more countries obsessed with the idea that they are large."
"This is extremely important for the development of Europe’s common interest."
"– Mr President, the comments made by the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Antonione, concerning the progress made at the Intergovernmental Conference give us great hopes of the final outcome of the proceedings in terms not only of adherence to the timetable but, above all, in terms of content."
"There has been no backsliding over the text adopted by the Convention, and the Italian Presidency’s resolve not to brook any compromise merely for the sake of having the Treaty signed has therefore paid off."
"Mr President, Parliament, which, this week, has the task of encouraging the Member States to reach an agreement that will, at last, give Europe its first constitutional charter, cannot but agree with the position adopted by the Presidency."
"President Cox has rightly insisted on the need to act effectively with due haste."
"We fully support his comments and share his sentiments completely, but we do not identify with the comments of those pessimists who appear to want to throw in the towel at the sight of any difficulty."
"I therefore support, President Antonione, your comments in favour of abandoning national particularism."
"Europe cannot miss this extraordinary opportunity."
"I am certain that no State will want to be held accountable for shattering a dream."
"Finally, as a member of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I call on the Intergovernmental Conference once again to insert in the preamble an explicit reference to Europe’s Judaeo-Christian roots."
"Lastly, Mr Watson, a word on the Guantanamo question: you speak Italian well, you understand it very well and I hope you read it too, because, according to the reports I have read in the Italian press, it appears that, on more than one occasion, the Presidency of the Council has called on the US authorities to respect human rights in Guantanamo as well."
"– Mr President, foreign policy discussions at the Brussels Summit will take place in two contexts – that of the constitutional debate and that of concrete foreign policy problems."
"Taking the constitutional debate first, I would like to wholeheartedly endorse what President Prodi had to say."
"We have to become actors on the international stage rather than spectators."
"And, as this is not just about the content – although it certainly is that too – but also about the name, I would also like to speak in support of Mr Antonione, who stated plainly that this is – and must be – about a foreign minister."
"We are not talking here about a High Representative or an ambassador, but about a European foreign minister, not supplanting the national foreign ministers, but supplementing them and organising their work more effectively."
"Secondly, while I am on the subject of foreign policy, let me say that we have a problem, and – if I may discuss it briefly with Mr Antonione, let me say that the problem is the Middle East."
"In recent days, we have seen an agreement reached – known as the Geneva accord – which is a private agreement by two people and many others from Israel and Palestine, and the Council wants to consider this matter actually only one and a half weeks after the event."
"Never before though has a private agreement been given such prominence by the media, never before has an agreement called forth such high hopes, and never before has an agreement been so perfectly in line with European foreign policy, so I hope that the Council will indeed turn its attention to this Geneva initiative and will indicate our support for it even more strongly than Secretary of State Colin Powell – thank God! – has done, because, although it could be a European initiative, it is even more valuable by reason of its originating from the region itself, from men and women who know what continued suffering would be like, and without whom there would be no accord."
"If it is Europe that has to be the base for the decisive campaign against terrorism, that has to do with the fact that terrorism will spread – as it has done in recent weeks – for as long as the problem in the Middle East is no closer to a solution – a solution which, it must be conceded, can be arrived at only step by step."
"With this in mind, we profoundly regret the terrorist attacks in Istanbul."
"Like New York, Istanbul is not only a city of many ethnicities, it is positively symbolic of how they can cooperate, and terrorism of course militates against such association and relationships across ethnic lines."
"I also think we have to give Turkey solidarity and support, but that does not mean that terrorism brings with it some sort of bonus, and, like the Commission and the President-in-Office of the Council, I am very much in favour of us proceeding exactly as we have done before, with criteria that are objective and subject to scrutiny."
"Terrorism must not be allowed to affect Turkey’s position either for the worse or for the better."
"In closing, I would like to mention something to which many other Members have referred."
"I rarely concern myself with budgetary matters, but, whatever our nationality or whatever the social or political grouping to which we belong, all of us in this House are aware of the importance of every parliament’s rights when it comes to drawing up budgets, and I just want to support you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council."
"This House’s position is clear."
"We are not just drawing up a resolution."
"One may ask, as Stalin once asked the Vatican, ‘where are your armies?’, but how is a European constitution to be brought into being on the back of referendums and by national parliaments if it meets with massive resistance from this House?"
"This is what I ask you to accept: no curtailments, at any rate not of the rights of this House, Europe’s freely elected and democratic institution."
"– Mr President, Europe still rates opportunism more highly than it does formal agreements."
"Large countries can apparently get away with more than small ones."
"French and German flouting of the rules of the Stability Pact has delivered a serious blow to the confidence of the Dutch people in the European Union."
"The man on the street wonders why he should support a new treaty if it is uncertain that it will be observed."
"It is important that discussion of the Stability Pact should not be avoided, particularly in the light of the referendums about the Constitution."
"The referendum will be more about context than about the text of the treaty."
"It will be a yardstick for confidence."
"We set great store by the Convention's proposals concerning the voting procedure in the Council and Parliament's full budgetary rights."
"As far as we are concerned, however, the Member States may retain their fully-fledged Commissioners."
"If legitimacy is to be enhanced, then they must be directly elected by the European Parliament, without any nominations by the European Council. However, only when in Europe, agreements are more important than political opportunism will public confidence have a real chance of growing."
"Mr President, I should like to address a theme raised by the President-in-Office of the Council which nobody else has yet spoken about but which, for more than one person in this House, is of great moment and significance."
"The President-in-Office mentioned that the question is being raised as to whether the minimum number of MEPs per state is too low."
"Is it wrong to retain a relatively low basic membership in a new and enlarging Union?"
"Let us pause and reflect upon this."
"At the moment, in Britain which is composed of three nations, England, Scotland and Wales Wales is currently represented in this House by five Members."
"After the new Constitution comes into effect, if it does, the number of Members representing Wales in this House will drop to four."
"Malta will have five."
"I do not object at all to Malta having five Members: it is a fine thing for small countries to have proper representation."
"As a Scot, how could I think otherwise?"
"We must not forget, however, that the principle of degressive proportionality has a deep justification."
"Degressive proportionality says that every state in this Union must be represented in this House by a sufficient number of MEPs so as fully to express the political diversity of that state."
"Rightly, therefore, even the 400 000 citizens of Malta should have at least five Members, but perhaps no more."
"If you insist, rightly, on keeping a maximum ceiling of membership, the upshot of increasing yet further the degressive proportionality threshold above five will be to cut the representation of significant parts of existing Member States."
"In the debates we had about the competences of the Union, Mr Lamassoure reminded the House of the importance of partner regions, countries like Flanders, Galicia, Euskadi and, indeed, Scotland."
"These are significant parts in the Union."
"If you cut their representation you deny them the degressive proportionality on which you rightly insist for countries such as Malta or Cyprus."
"Do not do that."
"This is not a trivial point."
"At the Convention, as a Member representing Scotland, I tried many times to alert colleagues to the significance of entrenching certain aspects of the common fisheries policy that are unacceptable to us."
"I was not heeded."
"The upshot of that is that it will be impossible for me, as a strong supporter of this idea of a European Constitution, to persuade my political colleagues in Scotland to back ratification of the text because I now know that on that point it will not be changed."
"My appeal was neglected."
"Had I been representing a larger force I might have been heard."
"What a pity!"
"Do not neglect degressive proportionality for the of the states of the Union in insisting on it for the states."
"Mr President, the British Conservatives i.e. the European Democrats do not support the idea that the proposed European Union constitution as discussed currently at the IGC in Rome is merely a tidying-up exercise."
"We believe it significantly alters the balance of power between Member States and the European Union institutions."
"We believe it is one more stage in the process of setting up a federal super-state with its flag, currency, army and now constitution, rather than a simplifying treaty basing itself on a unique supranational creation between sovereign Member States."
"We are concerned at the new, high-profile role of the Council President and the proposed Foreign Minister and EU legal personality, which will enhance the perception that the EU is a state and will shortly be demanding membership of the UN Security Council."
"We are opposed to the passerelle clauses which jeopardise our veto rights over taxation, social security and, most worryingly, CFSP, which includes security and defence."
"Theoretically, it becomes possible for a new British Government to be out-voted over the deployment of its own troops already committed by a previous administration."
"We have also seen concessions over a separate planning headquarters for autonomous EU operations, which will play into the hands of isolationist US strands who will be happy to see Europeans go it alone as they question the need to keep the US tied into NATO, an organisation which in my view has served us well for so long."
"We reject the Charter of Fundamental Rights - with its vague rights to jobs, health and social security - becoming legally binding."
"It is a recipe for the activism of the Luxembourg-based European Court of Justice in its agenda to enforce the social market economy and undermine the Thatcherite economic reforms of the 1980s which made my country a magnet for foreign direct investment."
"Lastly, we are adamant that such major constitutional changes require a full public debate in all the Member States."
"With particular reference to my country, I call upon Prime Minister Blair to allow the British people a say through a referendum on the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Mr President, could I issue you with a special invitation?"
"If, over the Christmas holidays, you are in the wonderful city of Bolton, please come and join me in a visit to my local pub because you will surprised to discover that most people there are not talking about qualified majority voting, the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the Intergovernmental Conference."
"They are talking about other issues."
"I mention that point not to denigrate the discussions on the Constitution, which are important but, rather, to emphasise that the endless institutional debate that we have does not bring us closer to the electorate because it does not address the issues which voters regard as very important."
"Since I became a Member in 1989 we seem to have had endless institutional debate."
"We must stop that institutional debate, because it is vital for the political legitimacy of the EU that we come to an agreement in this IGC quickly but, more importantly, that we come to an agreement that will stick."
"I agree with Mr Hänsch that we cannot carry on endlessly with one IGC dealing with the leftovers of another IGC."
"When we get an agreement that sticks, we can then start to focus properly on the sorts of issues which concern the citizens of a Europe of 25 Member States."
"We need to start making practical progress."
"Let us not take it for granted that enlargement is on course to happen smoothly."
"We must make sure that candidate countries fulfil the requirements set out by the Commission in its latest annual report."
"We must ensure that the accession of these countries to the European Economic Area something people forget about - goes very smoothly, because that has not been the case until now."
"We must not lose sight of Romania and Bulgaria, or their objective of joining in 2007."
"We must continue our work on Turkey and, as Mr Swoboda says, show greater solidarity with that country, particularly at this time."
"We must also look at other issues concerning our citizens: more and better jobs."
"We must revitalise the Lisbon process and ensure that we have an active social policy that gets people into work."
"As Wim Kok's report has shown, there are too many people excluded from the labour market and we are building a wall between those who have a job and those who do not have a job."
"We must do much more with respect to that."
"In particular, Member States must stop dragging their feet."
"It is the Member States who are dragging their feet on Lisbon and on the European arrest warrant."
"Crime is important to our citizens and we need more Member States to actually ratify that."
"Member States are also largely responsible for the fact that the European Court of Auditors, in its a yearly reports, tells us that it cannot trace all the accounts because of the way Member States spend the money."
"We need to demand much more of Member States."
"On security policy, I welcome the progress being made but let us ensure that we focus on capability rather than institutional structures because we will only be judged by how capable we are."
"If I could ask for a Christmas present given that I still believe in Father Christmas I should like to see IGC conclusions which are agreed upon, which are upheld and which leave no leftovers."
"I would like us to focus on delivery for our citizens, because that is what the European Union will be judged on."
"Thank you for your kind invitation, Mr Titley."
"Mr President, the President-in-Office of Council said that the European Union will not fail to give a welcome to legal migrants."
"This looks hypocritical since the Council agreed a very restrictive text on family reunion rights."
"Indeed it is so mean, that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market advises that the European Parliament should seek the annulment of this text in the European Court on grounds of a breach of the family rights provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights."
"I welcome that."
"The Council has been left in no doubt as to the strength of feeling in this House about the internment without due process of Guantanamo Bay prisoners."
"As co-rapporteur on this topic, I am helping to prepare a submission from this Parliament to the Supreme Court, but only the Council can make representations on behalf of the EU as a whole."
"It has already signed a legal cooperation agreement with the US, so the Americans cannot dispute the Council's legal status."
"It would be outrageous if governments such as the UK Government doing bilateral deals frustrated a Council initiative."
"Even if we get Europeans back from Guantanamo Bay, we must speak up for the rest of the 650 detainees."
"As we are showing on steel tariffs, if the EU punches its weight, the US takes notice."
"Mr President, as a citizen of the Spanish state, I wish to tell this Parliament that the views of the majority of my fellow citizens are by no means represented by the positions that the Spanish Prime Minister, José Maria Aznar, is trying to impose. These call for the implementation of the voting system set out in Nice precisely the opposite of the one approved by the Commission, which involves a double majority of States and citizens."
"In his attempt to keep this arbitrary power of veto, which was won at serious cost to the Spanish representation in this Parliament, Mr Aznar will be representing himself alone and will be confirming his status as the most unhelpful and intransigent political leader in Europe."
"José Maria Aznar is trying fraudulently to hijack the draft European Constitution to block the progress of the national governments of Galicia, the Basque Country and Catalonia in the context of a multinational State, attempting to have things included in the draft that, if accepted, would prevent the future reunification of Ireland, because it would change the borders of the United Kingdom and of Ireland and would also prevent Gibraltar being handed back to the Spanish State."
"I will conclude by recalling that yesterday fifteen more immigrants perished off the coasts of the Spanish State and I believe that we should bear this fact in mind in order to implement the political measures necessary to prevent any repetition of such events."
"Mr President, I trust that the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference will not satisfy us even less than the outcome of the Convention satisfied us."
"I should like to make two or three brief comments about this."
"First, the final arrangements for defence and foreign policy are very important."
"I welcome any progress achieved."
"I should like it to be more substantial, especially as regards the unified assistance clause but, in all events, it is good for us to show that we learned from the war in Iraq."
"Secondly, all the Member States should be represented in the Commission."
"In Greece, in particular, it would make a very bad impression if the smaller countries were not represented."
"Thirdly, it is better for us to have no agreement in December if the agreement is not going to be satisfactory."
"Having said which, a few brief comments about the sector which particularly concerns me in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, transport."
"Mr Prodi, there is the development initiative to incorporate the programme on priority trans-European networks, Quick Start, which is to be discussed."
"The impression has been given that Parliament is being bypassed and that the decision will be taken solely by the European Council at the Commission’s proposal."
"Apart from the fact that this is wrong, it is also contrary to Community law and Parliament is not prepared to accept it."
"We are joint legislators as far as the trans-European networks are concerned and we shall claim our rights until the end."
"Having said which, there is the question of substance."
"We can draw green and red lines on the map and say, ‘There you are, new roads and railways!’, but the trans-European networks must be funded."
"So there must be the political will on the part both of the Member States and the European Commission, so that, with the public and private sectors working together, we can proceed as quickly as possible in this direction."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will start by asking you to forgive me for arriving late."
"Life penalises those who arrive too late, unlike the Vice-President, Mr Dimitrakopoulos, who has been a bit lenient in still giving me the opportunity to speak, for which I am very grateful."
"Speaking on behalf of my group, but also of the German Social Democrats in particular, I want to thank our own government and the Italian Presidency of the Council."
"Mr Antonione, my expression of gratitude to the Italian Presidency of the Council may perhaps be rather surprising, but it is very emphatic, as I get the impression that the Italian Presidency of the Council is making a respectable effort when it comes to defending the outcome of the Convention and to keep in check a number of foolish courses of action that are evidently dominating the Intergovernmental Conference."
"I know that my own government, that of the Federal Republic of Germany is currently, in the Intergovernmental Conference, making valiant attempts to talk certain Member States’ governments out of their belief that they do not have to take on board any of the progressive things that the Convention has decided on for Europe and to lead them into the way of compromise."
"For this, we Members of the European Parliament must be especially grateful, for anything else would gravely endanger the European Union both as it is today and as it will be."
"I want to pick out two points that we regard as positively essential in their significance."
"The first has to do with this House’s budgetary rights."
"It would appear to be the case that a number of finance ministers have persuaded their governmental colleagues – but not, it is to be hoped, the Heads of Government – to limit unanimity on the Financial Perspective and to change over to mere consultation rather than approval, thereby both restricting a right of the European Parliament and also qualifying Parliament’s right to give final approval in the Budget procedure – which is actually the most powerful right that this House possesses in the Budget procedure – by making it a right shared between the Council and Parliament."
"It would appear that some are determined, as part of the constitution-framing process, to have this core right of the European Parliament in their sights."
"The only thing one can say to this is that if you want to give Europe a constitution, you cannot be serious in attacking in this way the right to approve the Budget, which is the prerogative of the future main legislative authority, namely the European Parliament."
"So let me tell you that those who would take an axe to our budgetary rights are taking an axe to the constitution in its entirety, so we in this House would be well advised to send an unambiguous signal to the Intergovernmental Conference to the effect that this is something that Parliament takes very seriously indeed."
"This leads me to mention a second point."
"We believe that we have to compromise on the distribution of votes and on the composition of the Commission, and that both sides can and must live with those compromises. It is quite clear to me that the smaller Member States fear that they will be outnumbered."
"Their fears may or may not be justified; it is not for me to pass judgment on that."
"Whatever compromise eventually emerges, this House must not lose sight of the fact that, in the next Parliament, there will be 732 MEPs, and that is quite a lot to start with."
"It is quite possible that, between 2007 and 2009, the number of MEPs in this House will increase to 800."
"Against the eventuality of further attempts to inflate the number of MEPs, I can tell you that we do not want to become a sort of Chinese People’s Congress; we want to be a working parliament."
"To this issue too, I ask the Council, its Italian Presidency – which, I know, is trying to get sense to prevail – and the Intergovernmental Conference, to actually find a solution that will enable this Parliament to keep on working."
"I arrived late and I have spoken for too long, so thank you, Mr President, for everything."
"I am sure that all colleagues will be glad that you finally made it and were able to speak."
"Mr President, when the Convention was set up, it was a unique historic decision, based on the idea that – in broadly based dialogue with the people – elected representatives, governments and EU institutions should, in an open and thoughtful way, prepare the EU for enlargement and the future."
"In spite of many sceptics, the Convention proved to be a great success."
"A proposal for a European Constitution was put forward that, although deficient in a number of ways, is, in very general terms, a very good compromise."
"I think that Altiero Spinelli must have been smiling from beyond the grave when the proposal was put forward in June 2003."
"What is going on now is embarrassing."
"It is as if the Convention had never been held, and the Council were back in the old Nice routine with all the hullabaloo and horse trading going on behind closed doors."
"Do you never learn?"
"The EU faces huge tasks."
"It must grow, reform itself and engage in deeper cooperation."
"Moreover, it has major problems of legitimacy."
"The row about the Stability and Growth Pact has scarcely improved the EU’s reputation."
"People deserve better than a watered-down compromise seasoned with national interests."
"They deserve a democratic, dynamic and energetic EU."
"They deserve to be taken seriously through having the work done by their representatives in the Convention respected."
"I therefore wish to appeal to the Italian Presidency: do not disappoint them."
"Ladies and gentlemen in the gallery, I understand your enthusiasm but the gallery does not take part in the sitting."
"I would therefore ask you please to be quiet."
"– Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is Parliament’s last opportunity to express its mind in the form of a resolution before the Intergovernmental Conference on a new European constitutional treaty, which we hope will complete its work before the end of December."
"That the Convention’s draft was important as a foundation is not in dispute, but nor is there any dispute about the need for various points in it to be improved."
"One hopes that all the politicians want to bring the work to completion and to find a compromise with which all parties can live, including on the composition of the Commission, with each Member State having one Commissioner who is entitled to vote."
"Public opinion in the EU is one reason why we should not create Commissioners of unequal weight."
"Something else to be welcomed is the European Court of Justice’s monitoring of the decisions of the EU Council, which will make for judicial control and transparency."
"There is also a need to reinforce the Stability and Growth Pact, not only to make it more solid and substantial, but also to improve its flexibility, for there must be no repetition of what has just happened with Germany and France – bad examples must not be allowed to catch on."
"In security and defence policy, a commitment to mutual assistance along the lines of Article 51 of the UN Charter should have a permanent place as a self-evident act of solidarity in a shared Europe."
"Issues of the weighting of votes in the Council should not be over-valued; after all, in the European Union’s political practice, it is usual to arrive at a consensus and a compromise in which ‘small or large’ is not the determinative issue."
"The dual majorities – 15 States, 60% of the population – appear sensible, and I agree with those Members who say that Parliament’s original budgetary rights are important and must not be curtailed."
"– Mr President, I am concerned about the ungodly practices of our governments, who have first concluded a deal with the European Parliament and the national parliaments – known as the positively rated draft Constitution – and then proceed to carry on as they please, with business as usual, and repeat the very practices that caused Nice to fail."
"Citizens stand to gain a great deal by this draft Constitution."
"The Constitution offers us more democracy and enables us to achieve more concrete results in areas that matter in Europe."
"Neither I, nor the citizen, lie awake at night thinking about the trifling details which everyone seems to get het up about. One vote more or less, every Member State having its own Commissioner – or even two for the big boys – or a puppet on a string at the helm of the European Council."
"These are not the core issues."
"I go along with the idea of each country having its own Commissioner."
"What matters is that Europe is able to catch criminals who completely ignore national borders, that we speak with one voice in foreign policy and that there are enough good jobs for everyone."
"The Heads of Government should finally stop whinging and accept that what we have seen come out of the Convention is – subject to a few minor practical changes – the best solution for all of us and for an enlarged and deepened Europe."
"They should not pretend that citizens consider their bickering about power and people as important."
"That is for the little boys who compare their brawn in the playground, but not for the citizens."
"The public want to see results, and we can obtain those results with the new Constitution."
"More rights for Parliament and more codecision in the fields of justice and home affairs, agriculture and budget."
"Many of my fellow-MEPs have already said that if the Finance Ministers get their own way, Parliament’s rights will revert back to what they were before 1975."
"That is wholly unacceptable."
"We would then cross a line which we would certainly advise against approaching."
"That will have an effect on all referendums here in Europe."
"We now have to act on behalf of our citizens as a matter of urgency."
"Accordingly, information is required in good time, otherwise the citizens will not be able to make their views known in the many referendums that will be held about the Constitution."
"Europe needs the Constitution, because on 1 May, ten new countries will be joining, and they should not join without any clear rules."
"Such an historic reunification should not founder because Heads of Government behave in a wholly unacceptable manner, throwing their weight around and refusing to accept an adult outcome."
": either you agree to the present proposal as Heads of Government or you are opposed to it."
"But beware: less democracy and fewer rights for Parliament means that Parliament will be obstructive."
"The governments should not think that the deal can be thwarted only from their end."
"They should also realise that they cannot let things get that far."
"That would be a God-awful shame, irrespective of the fact whether God is incorporated in the Constitution or not!"
"On St Nicholas Day, which is nearly upon us, we in the Netherlands always give presents to each other."
"The Heads of Government should also push out the boat this year, and give us a Constitution that is worthy of the European citizens."
"Mr President, in the run-up to the meeting of the Foreign Ministers in Naples, pessimism about the likely outcome was evident."
"Credit must therefore be accorded to the Italian presidency for the significant progress that it made on very sensitive issues."
"In particular, I welcome the agreement that was reached on structured cooperation on defence and the positive signals emerging relating to the creation of an EU Foreign Minister and one Commissioner with full voting rights per Member State, and also the budgetary powers of Parliament."
"Despite this progress, much work needs to be done."
"To have an effective influence on the world stage, we must end our paralysis in Common Foreign and Security Policy decision-making."
"The presidency's proposals for the use of qualified majority voting, and acting on the proposal for an EU Minister for Foreign Affairs, represent a step in the right direction."
"However, I would like to see progress in a number of other areas:"
"The proposal that there should be a full-time President of the European Council has the potential to undermine both the role of both the President of the Commission and the Foreign Minister."
"Up to now, the only permanent presidency in existence was that of the Commission."
"As the President of the Council will have responsibilities in the field of CFSP, this could conflict with the role of Foreign Minister and could cause confusion as to who authoritatively speaks for the EU in this field."
"It would be more sensible to refer to this post as 'Chair' of the European Council and not 'President'."
"In congratulating the presidency on the progress made to date, I would also like to issue a warning."
"The draft Constitution represents a bottom line compromise."
"Agreement at the Intergovernmental Conference is therefore not solely a matter for Member State governments."
"If the outcome of the IGC is to be ratified successfully it must also secure the consent of other institutions such as the European Parliament, the European Commission and members of national parliaments."
"The Italian presidency would ignore this reality at its peril."
"Mr President, it is quite clear from discussions that everyone wants to finish in December."
"The problem is that everyone wants to make their concessions at the last possible minute - and preferably not at all."
"So there is a danger that despite a general willingness to conclude at the December European Council, we end up, as in Nice, with it going on long into the night with last-minute deals cobbled together."
"There is a danger that no agreement will be reached at all."
"At the moment, Member States to a degree are still posturing."
"They are taking rigid and firm positions even though they know they will have to compromise if they want to succeed in December: therein lies the biggest danger facing the Intergovernmental Conference."
"I am convinced that a reasonable, acceptable deal can be found on the bulk of the points, but there is one that seems to be extraordinarily difficult: the system of voting in the Council."
"The Convention wrestled with the age-old problem of whether we want equality of states or equality of citizens."
"It came up with the novel and balanced solution of the double majority, with one vote every state counts equally, and with the other vote states are weighted according to their population: absolute equality of citizens."
"What could be fairer?"
"Poland, Spain and some other countries, however, are insisting on returning to the opaque Nice formula, which is neither very fair nor very logical."
"I regret this, and I hope that they will shift their position."
"I know too from discussions - notably with Polish colleagues - how difficult the national context in Poland is and how this has regrettably become a , notably for opposition parties - Poland has a minority government."
"But how can we compromise, how can we find a way out between two radically different solutions?"
"Speaking purely personally, and off the top of my head, may I invite the Italian presidency to look at what happened in the early 1990s, before enlargement to Sweden, Finland and Austria?"
"There was then a big row in the Council about adapting the qualified majority system, then it was about the threshold: what threshold is needed to obtain a qualified majority and what is a blocking minority?"
"At the time, one state - regrettably and shamefully my own, the United Kingdom - refused to change the system."
"It wanted to keep the same blocking minority in an enlarged Union, which would have made decision-taking even more difficult."
"There was deadlock."
"What happened, in your own country Mr President?"
"At Ioannina, a compromise was reached the so-called 'Ioannina compromise' whereby the Union switched to the new system, but a declaration was adopted saying that in the future, states that were in the minority, but which would not have been outvoted under the old system could, if they wished, then object to the decision and insist that discussions continue."
"In practice, that clause was never used but it enabled face to be saved at the time, it enabled the transition to the new system and perhaps something along those lines is the only way forward on this very difficult point of the double majority."
"Perhaps we should switch to the new system, but with a declaration allowing states perhaps for a transitional period to invoke the old system if they found themselves in the minority."
"I am sure they would not do this very often, but it would allow them now to save face and go home with an acceptable solution."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, although we are talking about the constitution as a means of making the European Union transparent, comprehensible and more democratic, I see a danger in that the same Council that is to make a decision on the constitution is, when it comes to a decision on the Trans-European Networks, breaking the law as it currently stands and trampling Parliament’s rights underfoot."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the present Treaties state that decisions on the Trans-European Networks, including the priority list – perhaps the President-in-Office of the Council would be so kind as to listen to me, and the honourable gentleman could perhaps move to one side – according to the present Treaties, the revision of the Trans-European Networks is subject to codecision by the Council and Parliament and is not within the decision-making competence of the European Council."
"The European Council exists to set down policy guidelines."
"If, though, the Brussels European Council, in the course of revising the Trans-European Networks were to make decisions on the list of actual priority transport projects that had the effect that practically all the funds for the next few years were spent, then that would be a flagrant violation of Parliament’s right to share equally with the Council in decisions concerning the Trans-European Networks and their revision."
"I therefore appeal to the representatives of the Council to take care that the European Summit does not trample upon those rights that the present Parliament already possesses."
"I also appeal to the President of the Commission: it would be devastating if you, Mr President of the Commission, having made such a clear statement on democratic and parliamentary rights, were, at the Council, to so tangibly to ally yourself with a Council which defines the priority projects in such a way that the European Parliament’s rights of codecision are practically nullified."
"Let us see to it that this European Council does not take back the rights of codecision on Trans-European Networks that Parliament already possesses."
"We want more rights; we want a democratic and more transparent Europe."
"I hope, Mr President-in-Office, that you can provide us with them."
"Mr President, I very much support the joint resolution which my group has signed up to in relation to the Summit and the Social Forum."
"The important thing is that once again it seeks to strike the essential balance that was established at Lisbon: the balanced policy mix combining economic, social and employment policies in an overall framework of sustainable development."
"I hope governments will not succumb to the temptation to try in any way to skew that policy mix at the forthcoming summit."
"There is one element in the resolution that causes me some concern: the second part of paragraph 10."
"My Group will request a separate vote on that point and many will be voting against it."
"Why would that be?"
"Are we in favour of needless, additional regulation?"
"No."
"The first part of paragraph 10 which we support makes that absolutely clear."
"It is equally true, however, that certain sections of this House, and local employers' organisations outside it, are increasingly calling for ever more stringent, narrowly-drawn business impact assessments as a way of blocking the Commission’s right of initiative on much-needed proposals."
"We cannot allow those calls for cost-benefit impact assessments to be used in that way."
"We on this side of the House support the idea of true and honest cost-benefit assessments that take account of all the costs and benefits."
"For example, in a debate on the revision of the working time directive last week in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, the point was made very forcibly by Liberal Members that we need a full business impact assessment."
"I make the point in reply that what we need is a true cost-benefit assessment that takes account of all the costs and benefits."
"What, for example, is the cost of a long-hours culture in terms of damage to family life, damage to children and marital dysfunction?"
"A cost must be imputed to those things as well in such a calculation."
"We therefore urgently need to bring forward revisions of that sort."
"In relation to paragraph 9 of the resolution, which refers to opening up the market in postal and passenger services, it is important that a true cost-benefit assessment is applied there too."
"Finally, I would like to point out that in fact the Treaties are very clear."
"In the area of employment and social legislation, there is already a very clear requirement built into the Treaty: 'such directives shall avoid imposing administrative, financial and legal constraints in a way which would hold back the creation, and development of small and medium sized undertakings'."
"The Commission already applies those tests to every piece of legislation it brings forward in the employment and social field."
"That is right and proper."
"It is good that it takes place already, but we should not try to narrow it in order to needlessly block much-needed social and employment proposals that will help maintain that overall policy balance established at Lisbon."
"– Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the reason why I rise to speak on this point is that the experience of the last few weeks in connection with the handling of the Stability and Growth Pact, that is to say of European law, have made clear how important it is that the Intergovernmental Conference should still include price stability in the list of the EU’s objectives in the European constitution."
"Another reason why I have asked for the floor is that the experience of recent days and weeks has shown how important it is that the Protocol of the Stability and Growth Pact should, like other protocols, be appended to the constitution as an annex."
"And I have asked to speak also because I believe that the experience of the last few weeks also clearly shows us that the debate on the constitution has been, in part, nationalised, and that we must take care that the nationalisation of a European project does not jeopardise this great project through national referendum."
"If there is to be a referendum, then let there be one consultation of the European people, with one Europe-wide result and dual majority of votes and countries."
"We have talked about how the Constitution must make Europe more transparent and more democratic and bring it closer to the people, which is what it is meant to do."
"So I appeal to the President of the Council to see to it that the Commission is strengthened, that this House’s rights of codecision are extended, that Parliament retains sovereignty over the Budget, and nothing is done to aid and abet the attempt by the finance ministers, in their letter to the President of the Council, to force the Commission and Parliament to keep silent about their rights."
"The Europe we need is Community-oriented rather than intergovernmental."
"The Constitution is the outward expression of strengthened Community institutions, and I ask you to counteract all the attempts made by groupings within the Council to hand back Europe to the nation states."
"Mr President, I really am very upset that in the Intergovernmental Conference, we have what I would regard as a lamentable failure of political leadership - a retreat into national chauvinism - at a time when we need a democratic, effective, power-sharing Europe."
"This is not what we are going to get out of the IGC if things continue as they are."
"The Convention, of which I was a member, painstakingly constructed a blueprint for the kind of Europe I have just outlined."
"Neutralising that text in the areas of common foreign and security policy, defence cooperation and social policy, stripping out qualified majority voting in relation to these areas and, worst of all, stripping this Parliament of its budgetary prerogatives, is a recipe for defeat."
"It is a recipe for defeat for the outcome of the IGC, but it is also a recipe for the defeat of Europe."
"Such a defeat would be a victory for the eurosceptics."
"It would be a victory for the lamentable fearmongering that we constantly hear in this House from Mr Bonde, with his simplistic, opportunistic clichés."
"I would appeal to the IGC to listen to this Parliament, to the Convention and the 200 parliamentarians - from all sides of the political spectrum, both in government and in opposition right across Europe who produced the Convention document."
"Finally, President Prodi, I ask you to read today's , which carries an interview with you on the occasion of your visit to Ireland yesterday."
"The headline reads: ' ""States that reject the Treaty may have to leave the EU"" says Prodi'."
"That is an appalling message to give to the people of Ireland, who had to vote twice on the Nice Treaty."
"It is disrespectful of the rights of the citizens of Europe and for the dignity of the people of Europe."
"If it is not accurately reported, then you should immediately correct it."
"If it is accurately reported then you must make it clear that it is your personal view and not the view of the Commission."
"In Ireland, such statements quite simply polarise the debate about whether we defend the nation or build Europe."
"So you must correct this if it is an incorrect reflection of your views in that interview."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe we have overrun on the time allowed and, therefore, in order not to eat any further into the time for the next debate, I will attempt to be extremely brief."
"To start with, and in view of the fact that Mr Watson and others who wanted to discuss the Guantanamo issue are present, I should like to offer some comments for reflection."
"As regards the Italian Presidency, and thus the European Union, I must say that we have made known to the US authorities at every possible opportunity – on the most recent occasion directly to Colin Powell during the meeting held in Brussels – the concerns of the European Union and of the general public regarding this matter which undoubtedly provides us with food for thought and is a cause of concern."
"I must also point out that, at the joint press conference, certain journalists put the question to Colin Powell too, who gave a public undertaking to provide a response and to examine the matter, that is to provide a response to the specific concerns raised."
"Therefore, I must reiterate that attention has been given to this matter and will certainly continue to be in the future."
"On the other hand, as regards the discussion concerning the work of the Intergovernmental Conference, I take this opportunity, which will be the last opportunity for me as representative of the current Presidency of the European Union to address Parliament, to thank the House, to thank all of you for the contribution you have made to the work and the endeavours of the Italian Presidency, a fundamental contribution, containing, of course, a great deal of criticism and many suggestions, but also, I acknowledge, many appreciative comments, which always give much pleasure and help to lighten the sometimes heavy burdens of an overfull schedule we have to bear on some occasions."
"As I have said, we do this in the knowledge that the outcome, if positive, will be so not only for the Italian Presidency but for all of us because the spirit which guides us is a spirit consistent with the European spirit."
"Should we fail, it will undoubtedly be a failure for all of us."
"I am still optimistic and must say that, in the light of the debate held in Naples and today’s meeting, I believe that we can look to 12 and 13 December with confidence based on the fact that there are signs that some sort of positive solution can be achieved."
"As regards individual points, it is difficult for me to go into detail now, but I should like to take up some general points: first, I confirm that we will seek to maintain the greatest possible consistency with the Convention’s text, which, for us, is the reference point."
"As you know, all levels took part in the Convention: national parliamentarians, European parliamentarians, members of governments, representatives of civil society."
"The result is clearly a very important document that we are seeking to improve upon but which, as far as we are concerned, is the guiding point of reference for obtaining the final outcome."
"We will not accept watered-down compromises and we will avoid any horse-trading, as it has been called in the last hour."
"It is normal for negotiations to take place."
"I should not like to undervalue such negotiations because the interests that each country represents are undoubtedly worthy and important interests."
"The negotiations may be intense, but I believe that the spirit which guides us and which I have seen in all those who have participated first in the work of the Convention and subsequently in the Intergovernmental Conference is indicative of the fact that everyone is hoping for a major result, a worthy outcome."
"Further, as regards protecting the prerogatives of the European Parliament and of national parliaments in general, I can confirm that the Italian Presidency considers this to be essential, and even more so when a Treaty having constitutional validity is being constructed because, if there is no connection with the primary democratic source which is bound to Parliament, we will undoubtedly end up doing something which is not positive."
"I would like to thank you once again for your contribution, and I hope that Mr Berlusconi, who will be in the House with Mr Frattini to report on the work of the Intergovernmental Conference the week after the Conference ends, will be able to bring you good news and that you will be able, at that time, to voice your appreciation or criticism so that everyone can subsequently, as the wish has been expressed, come together to celebrate a result that we all hope will be extremely positive."
". – My thanks to the Italian Presidency and to Mr Antonione, who, in my opinion, has explained in a perfectly balanced, commendable way the arguments and positions that we must uphold at the major meeting in Brussels."
"Suffice it to say that I wish him every success in defending these arguments and also call on him not to dismiss any of the issues which have been set to one side for the moment."
"I refer, for example, to the matter of the Legislative Council."
"This is one of the issues which has suddenly disappeared from sight despite the fact that so much energy and thought was given to it in the institutional framework."
"The problem is that when part of this framework is changed the whole framework is affected as a result."
"I will reply briefly to Mr De Rossa."
"I am not in the habit of withdrawing my statements because I usually consider them at length before making them."
"To the journalist of the Irish Times, who made great play of taking these statements out of context, I said that if a country says ‘no, no, no, no’, and I said ‘no’ four times, it must be recognised that it is not right for that country to be able to paralyse the Union permanently."
"I think this is a position which is universally shared."
"I added that the instruments do not exist at the moment but the problem cannot be avoided in future."
"It is pointless for us to hide it."
"I said the instruments do not exist but the problem does."
"The problem, I added, is not a current problem, but there is no escaping this question."
"I believe it is important for the Commission President to raise these matters – even if they are not a current problem – since they constitute a problem which concerns all of us."
"There is no point in continually running away from problems because, if we do so, we will never succeed in resolving them."
"To conclude the debate, I have received 6 motions for resolutions on preparations for the European Council and 7 motions for resolutions on the work of the Intergovernmental Conference in accordance with Rule 37(1) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"– Following the IGC meeting in Naples, it is clear that there is relentless pressure from the European institutions to impose the Convention’s draft Constitution and, thus, a central and supranational power to run the enlarged Europe."
"In our opinion, the correct solution would be the opposite of this: accepting the idea of a differentiated Europe, ensuring greater respect for national sovereignty and clearly organising the process of variable geometry."
"In other words, the countries, such as Spain or Poland, that are being accused today of slowing the progress of the IGC with regard to the Convention by defending their national interests are in actual fact defending the general interest of Europe, which is to keep free nations and national democracies alive."
"With regard to the two major topics of debate that will be discussed once again at the next Council in Brussels – the composition of the Commission and the qualified majority in the Council – we reiterate our unchanging proposal: the key aspect is to recognise a national right of popular opposition, which each population could exercise formally against a European decision."
"This innovation, which would give control back to the national democracies and help to compensate for the democratic deficit, would also put all of the discussions on the Commission and the Council into perspective."
"The way in which the IGC is developing is increasingly worrying because there it shows a clear trend towards maintaining key aspects approved by the Convention but which we dispute. These include enshrining and deepening the economic and social model of neoliberal capitalism, extending the militarisation of the European Union and institutionally consecrating the Union as a political and military bloc and also promoting the federalist institutional approach."
"Indicative of this trend is the compromise reached between France, Germany and the United Kingdom, under the auspices of the USA, on the militarisation of the European Union, cementing its institutional bases as a more or less autonomous pillar of NATO."
"Although some differences remain on institutional issues, compromises are being reached on the idea of a cabinet, with blackmail over Community funds increasingly forcing the small and medium-sized countries to accept a submissive position. This leaves the fight being maintained by Spain and Poland, who are seeking to have the same weighting in the decision-making process as the other ‘large countries’."
"The ‘primacy’ of the so-called ‘European constitution’ and of Community law over the laws and Constitutions of each country is also reiterated, which is equally unacceptable."
"It will fall to the peoples of the EU Member States and to the progressive forces within those States to combat this draft, which has been designed to benefit Europe’s economic and financial groups and the ambitions of the elites that, in each country, unashamedly serve these interests."
"The next item is the debate on the Council and Commission statements on the Stability and Growth Pact."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for inviting me to discuss with you at this sitting the economic Stability and Growth Pact."
"Allow me to begin by going over the events which led up to the Eurogroup and Ecofin meeting of 24 and 25 November."
"During the first half of 2003, at the Commission’s proposal, the Council sent two recommendations in respect of excessive deficits to Germany and France on 21 January and 3 June respectively, calling for the deficits to be reduced below the reference threshold of 3% by the end of 2004."
"It should be noted that the recommendations were adopted on the basis of assumed progressive economic growth during the year brought about by the elimination of negative factors due to the end of the war in Iraq."
"In subsequent months, however, it became clear that the actual progress of the European economy was different, being more negative than expected."
"Economic growth, lower than that forecast by approximately one percentage point, led to a greater increase in public deficits than expected."
"The upshot of this was that it was impossible for Germany and France to reduce their deficits below 3% in 2004, as initially requested."
"In the second half of 2003, between October and November, the Commission fully and formally acknowledged this new situation and accordingly proposed two new recommendations seeking to defer the deficit reduction to below 3% until 2005."
"Essentially, it is reasonable to assume that, had it been known at the start of 2003 that the progress of the Euro area economy would not be positive, the recommendations would have stipulated 2005 at the outset as the year during which the deficits had to be brought back into line."
"On this basis, both Germany and France took measures to incorporate the substance of the recommendations."
"As regards Germany, the recommendations have been directly incorporated into the budgetary legislation: for 2004 provision has been made for a structural adjustment of 0.6% of GDP and for 2005 an adjustment of 0.5%, that is to say 1.1% of GDP in total, which is close to that initially requested by the Commission, without prejudice to the reduction below 3% in 2005."
"As regards France, the recommendations were incorporated first into the budgetary legislation and subsequently by means of other measures: for 2004 provision has been made for an adjustment of 0.8% of GDP and for 2005 an adjustment of 0.6%, that is to say 1.4% of GDP in total, which is close to that requested by the Commission, without prejudice to the reduction below 3% in 2005."
"Furthermore, France and Germany have given undertakings to channel any effects of greater growth into deficit reduction, as requested by the Commission."
"In addition to this, it should be borne in mind that, in 2003, France and Germany set in motion an intense programme of welfare state reforms, which had a decisive, positive impact on the sustainability of public finances."
"Within the context of the political economy, this is an issue of more than minor importance surrounding the discussion of the Pact which has taken place over the course of this year."
"In essence, first in the work carried out during October and November, subsequently within the Eurogroup and, lastly, within Ecofin, a broad consensus has been achieved on the substance of the recommendations formulated by the Commission and on the substance of the adjustments introduced by France and Germany."
"Let us move on to procedural matters."
"The Commission proposed the two recommendations pursuant to Article 104(9) on the basis that Germany and France had persistently failed to put into practice the Council’s recommendations."
"Germany and France, whilst accepting the substance of the recommendations, for political reasons requested a different format, that is to say that a second series of recommendations be reformulated pursuant to Article 104(7)."
"The Council’s Legal Service, when consulted on the matter, said that the Commission could also have taken – and I emphasise the word ‘also’ – this second route."
"The Commission excluded it."
"At this point a deadlock developed: there was a risk that the most important thing, namely the substance, would be lost for reasons of form."
"In order to overcome the deadlock without exacerbating matters, the Eurogroup, on the basis of a broad consensus, incorporated the substance of the recommendations into draft conclusions."
"The validity of this procedure was again confirmed by the Council’s Legal Service."
"Subsequently, when Ecofin started its work, the Commission explicitly registered its disagreement, calling for an express vote on the second series of recommendations for Germany and France."
"The necessary majority was not obtained."
"It should be noted that the vote of the Ecofin Council on the Commission’s recommendations is explicitly provided for by the rules currently in force and is therefore perfectly compatible with such rules."
"After the failure to approve the Commission’s recommendations, the Council voted on the conclusions drawn up earlier in the Eurogroup."
"The conclusions were approved and the discussion resulted in the unanimous adoption of the Council statement."
"The contents of the statement may be summarised as follows: stability and growth are the fundamental objectives of European economic policy."
"The Pact constitutes an essential means of implementing that policy."
"The Pact has been called ‘stupid’."
"We have shown the opposite, we have shown that the Pact can be interpreted in a flexible, discerning manner."
"The Pact can be implemented by adapting budgetary discipline in an even more rational manner to positive or negative economic cycles and by encouraging structural reforms aimed at developing growth potential."
"In these terms, the letter and the spirit of the Pact are not dead; quite the opposite, we have worked in the past, are working now and will continue to work within the framework of the Pact and with the Commission’s support in a cooperative and consensual manner."
"In conclusion, we have thus far talked a lot about procedure and said little about the economy."
"In the growth strategy, as has been said, it is necessary for the Pact to take into account economic cycles and structural reforms: this is necessary, but it is not sufficient."
"Six months ago, at the start of this six-month presidency, we presented an Action Plan for Growth to this House."
"The support given to this Plan by Parliament was decisive and now the Plan must be implemented."
"Other, new development initiatives must follow."
"The Commission, the governments and the markets have a role to play in the growth strategy, but the European Parliament must also play a role as a decisive driving force: indeed, economic policy is either a policy or it is not."
"Mr President, over the last few months we have seen various developments in the application of the Stability and Growth Pact which have created a serious institutional crisis."
"These events are clear proof that we need to strengthen economic governance in the Union."
"The difficulties stem from the fact that Germany and France are experiencing serious tax problems which can be summarised as follows: excessive deficits, not only due to cyclical factors; the high deficits could prove harmful in the longer term because they threaten the sustainability of public financing by triggering increased debt levels; in addition, there are negative repercussions for potential growth due to the change in economic prospects."
"Against this backdrop and with a view to both countries reducing their deficits, applying the rules laid down in the Treaty, the Council first sent a series of recommendations to Germany and France at the start of the year asking them to adopt measures designed to correct the excessive deficit levels by the end of 2004 at the latest."
"In the second half of this year, however, it became clear that the measures adopted by the two countries would not be enough to correct the high deficits in 2004."
"The Commission therefore implemented the procedures laid down in the Treaty, submitting new recommendations which take the current situation into account."
"As you know, a small number of Member States rejected the Commission’s proposals in the Council, and in an unprecedented move, a majority agreement was reached outside the scope of the Treaty."
"This agreement, formulated as ‘Council conclusions’, has very wide-reaching implications which go far beyond the simple application of the Pact in France and Germany."
"The Commission deeply regrets that the Council has followed neither the spirit nor the letter of the Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact, both of which were unanimously approved."
"We feel that a rules-based system is the only way to ensure that commitments are respected and to guarantee equal treatment for all Member States."
"We have to understand that the Council’s decisions will make it harder to apply the Treaty rigorously."
"Proceedings for other countries will be affected."
"It will now be very difficult for the Council to adopt formal decisions in line with the procedure for excessive deficits, including the possibility of sending preventative warnings."
"The value of the reports on the stability and convergence programmes could be diminished if the Council does not accept a system of rigorous multilateral monitoring."
"It could become harder to apply the convergence criteria strictly in the new Member States, given that the euro-zone countries have been allowed to maintain deficits of over 3% for several years running and the procedures laid down in the Treaty and the Pact have not been applied."
"The political agreement established in the Council entails using intergovernmental agreements to manage our currency and establishes a dangerous precedent for the future."
"The Court of Justice will probably have to clarify whether Member States’ governments have the power to create new procedures which effectively replace existing Community structures established in the Treaty for certain aspects of economic policy."
"We must, however, bear in mind the fact that the Council declaration made at the end of the Ecofin Council shows that the Member States understand the need for a growth and stability agreement and also the importance of applying the standards in the same way across the board."
"Whatever happens, the Commission will continue to apply the Treaty and the provisions of the Pact."
"This will allow all Member States to be treated equally and will guarantee healthy public finances in Europe."
"The Commission will ensure that the procedures are applied appropriately and fairly."
"At the same time, we need to strengthen the economic governance of the Union with a view to ensuring that the single market and single currency work well together."
"We think that the decisions taken by Ecofin prove that the real problem is the weakness of the current system of economic governance at European level."
"The Commission intends to tackle this problem and will draw up a programme for better economic governance in the Union after careful thought."
"We will not, however, be starting our deliberations from zero."
"Instead, we will continue along the path taken by the Commission in the past."
"In line with the Communication of November 2002 on strengthening the coordination of budgetary policies, it seems we need to assess how to combine better discipline and flexibility to ensure greater compliance with the rules."
"We think that, among other things, greater emphasis should be placed on sustainability and on debt, so as to allow for the particularities of each individual country and to increase symmetry over the course of the whole cycle, in particular by being very strict in boom years."
"In this way, the Commission will carry out the multilateral monitoring in a more effective way, using all available means to publicise its opinions on economic and budgetary policy."
"We have to look at the budgetary discussions within the wider context of current low growth potential in the European economy."
"We therefore need to pay more attention to the quality of public finances without compromising long-term stability and sustainability."
"This means placing the debate on budgetary policy higher on the agenda within the context of coordinating economic policies, with a more prominent role for the economic policy guidelines and the implementation of those guidelines to ensure that the Economic and Monetary Union works well and that the Lisbon objectives are achieved."
"Parliament’s active involvement will be essential to this process."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Solbes, ladies and gentlemen, the decisions taken by the Ecofin Council on 25 November 2003 meant that it was not a good day for Europe."
"It was not a good day for European law."
"It was not a good day for the European Monetary Union."
"It was not a good day for relations between the smaller countries and the larger ones, and it was not a good day for the forthcoming enlargement."
"Those who, in the nineties, put the case for the Stability and Growth Pact now bear responsibility for the damage done to it, as do those who helped do the damage."
"We, in our group, are fundamentally convinced that we cannot be opportunistic in the way we use European law."
"So long as there is European regulation, so long as there is European law, it must be adhered to rather than bent."
"We do not believe that the Stability and Growth Pact is dead; it would be wrong to say that it were, for that would enable all those who break it to evade responsibility, both now and in the future."
"The Stability and Growth Pact has, however, been seriously damaged."
"Speaking very generally, what we need in politics is trust;"
"Europe’s currency, this young European currency, needs a very special kind of trust, and that trust has been damaged."
"To you, Commissioner Solbes, I would like to express our group’s gratitude and appreciation for the way you fought right up to the end."
"You may well not have got a majority for what you wanted, but we are convinced that you are right. Losing can sometimes be an honourable thing, but you have won your case."
"We also give our backing to the European Central Bank, and we wish its President, Mr Trichet, every success in continuing in future to be effective in contending for the stability of the European currency."
"We have now heard one finance minister in particular coming out with preposterous arguments to justify why this deficit is necessary right now in order for us to achieve growth."
"This argument is utterly false."
"Today’s debts are tomorrow’s taxes."
"What we owe today we will take away from people tomorrow."
"Those who run up excessive debts today are behaving exactly like those who are today despoiling our environment, for today’s younger generation and generations yet to come will have to pay the price for it."
"We therefore demand sustainability not only of a moderate finance and budget policy, but also in environment policy, and these things all belong together."
"Debts lead to higher interest rates, and these lead to higher inflation."
"We therefore end up without the money for low-interest loans enabling business and small enterprises to invest, and then no jobs are created for lack of finance at reasonable rates."
"At the end of the day it will be those on low incomes, it will be what we always used to call the man in the street, who will end up picking up the bill, and so a policy of running up debt is, in essence, anti-social, because it affects most those who have least."
"Such a policy also damages relations between the countries within the European Union."
"We have seen how Portugal and Ireland were required to adopt stability measures – quite rightly, as it turned out – and if these countries do it and other countries do it, but some think that they are big enough not to have to take these steps, then the ones who adhere to the criteria end up paying the bill for those who do not."
"That is why the policy is wrong."
"I would appreciate it if you were to listen; I ask you to hear me out."
"I would like you to listen to my speech, or prove that you understand my language."
"I really do ask that of you."
"Today, in my own country – and I am not now speaking as a German, although I am from the largest country in the European Union – many people no longer have any confidence in the ability of the European Council of Ministers to defend the stability of Europe’s currency."
"We want Europe’s currency to have a future; if it ends up failing, that will mark the failure of the whole project of European integration."
"I am a very frequent visitor to the candidate countries and often speak with our counterparts in their parliaments and governments. In Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, in the Czech Republic, in Slovakia, in Hungary, in Slovenia – the situation is different in Malta and Cyprus – they are asking us how it can be demanded of them, the Central Europeans who want to join the European Union, that they should pursue a policy of moderation in their budgets and work hard at reform when certain countries in the European Union give them such a bad example."
"That is a bad, indeed a terrible sign, not only in terms of economic policy but also more generally speaking, and my advice is that we, together, get back on the path of virtue, for it is not acceptable for some larger countries to do things that are not permitted to the smaller ones."
"This also has to do with European psychology and with the dignity of states, and so there must be no repetition of what happened on 25 November. I hope this is the last time that our group will be obliged to criticise this sort of action in such forthright terms."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I would like to express our deep concern about the current crisis relating to the Stability and Growth Pact."
"Mr Tremonti, as a respected legal expert, you must acknowledge that the rules cannot be ignored in this way."
"When the question of form is raised, we are told we need to talk about policy."
"Fine, let us talk about policy, but first of all, if there is a structure, if there are rules, they have to be respected. One of the gravest problems right now is that Ecofin as a whole does not have a Community culture."
"It did not demonstrate any sense of Community when it acted as it did in the meeting on the Stability Pact, nor when it proposed the amendments which disturb the balance of powers between the Council and Parliament, despite having no authority to make such proposals."
"Consequently, I think that Ecofin’s first task should be to read the Treaties and respect them."
"There are three fundamental issues at stake at the moment."
"Firstly, the present and the future of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"The Stability and Growth Pact was created before monetary union took place."
"Now that we have monetary union, we ought to revise the Pact to include the new elements."
"What cannot be allowed, as we have been saying for months, is for the Pact to have been breached in 2000 and a bad precedent established."
"What we are discussing here, although this is not a conference of forensic experts, is whether or not the Stability Pact is dead."
"The problem is which countries will the Pact apply to now?"
"What about Portugal?"
"What is happening with Ireland?"
"Are they any different?"
"It is therefore very important to get the Stability and Growth Pact back on the rails and to enable the Commission to make constructive proposals."
"The real issue is not whether the Pact is dead or not, but the fact that it is not being respected or applied, which is a much more serious matter at this time."
"The second question – and here I agree with Minister Tremonti who raised it with support from Parliament and with whom we successfully revived the Delors plan – is why the European economy is not a driving force even though it has the potential to be one."
"This is why we have been in favour of the action plan from the outset."
"However, in the current situation, that motor is not even starting, and that in turn is increasingly battering public confidence."
"I think that, aside from the need to update the Stability and Growth Pact, we also need to think about a point raised by Commissioner Solbes: economic governance."
"We are not calling for the Stability and Growth Pact to be included in the Constitution, but we must remember that in the Convention working group chaired by my colleague Mr Hänsch, all the economic representatives were playing very defensively – much like the Italian football team – and seeking to block any progress on economic governance in the Union. This is extremely serious."
"Why is it so serious? Because at the moment we do not have any stronger instruments."
"Compare our situation with that of the United States: we have a central bank which only looks at inflation, and a Stability and Growth Pact which is not being respected and which does not take that element of economic governance into account."
"Minister Tremonti talked about factoring in economic cycles."
"In the United States, before making a proposal to Congress, the Federal Reserve is actually required to take into account inflation, employment and economic activity."
"These are factors which need to be taken seriously and now is the time to raise these issues."
"Now is also the time to ensure that the Stability and Growth Pact will have a future."
"For this reason, Mr President, I think we have a responsibility to respect the Treaties and to make sure that Ecofin follows the same rules as everyone else."
"Mr President, the obituaries for the Stability Pact have been written before and then held back as the patient lurched on, if only on life support."
"What we witnessed last week was finance ministers giving the last rites to rules which were intended to guarantee the long-term stability of our currency and economy."
"Of course, the guilty parties deny all responsibility, or claim 'the Pact is dead, long live the Pact'."
"But the truth is that the eurozone's two leading economies have sent a message to all the small countries in the eurozone, and to the acceding countries, which reads 'do as we say, not as we do'."
"And I should like to point out to Mr Tremonti that the Italian presidency has failed in its duty by acting as an associate in the endeavours of the countries concerned to flout the Pact, rather than ensuring that the rules were respected."
"We will pay a heavy price for the cavalier disregard of finance ministers for the rules of the Stability Pact."
"We will pay a price in terms of damage to the trust between Member States, in terms of lost credibility in the eyes of our citizens, and, in the long run, in terms of higher interest rates, lower growth and currency instability."
"Unless our leaders agree on a revised and workable framework for fiscal stability, and inscribe this in our basic law, then we are left with nothing but a broken gentlemen's agreement."
"Countries which gave up their currencies on the understanding that they would not be expected to pay for the debts of their neighbours have a right to demand more than that."
"That is why my Group welcomes the stand taken by Commissioner Solbes and the Commission's intentions to make proposals to reshape the rules."
"If you kill off the Pact in its existing form, you have a responsibility to commit yourself to an agreed interpretation of a set of rules to prevent a borrowing free-for-all."
"Liberal Democrats believe that a well-run economy and a stable currency require taxes and spending to be in balance over the course of the business cycle."
"The problem is not the 3% deficit limit; the problem is the failure of countries to consolidate their budgets in terms of growth."
"My surprise at hearing the leader of the Socialist Group in this House agree with us is matched only by my delight at his conversion."
"The revised rules should provide sticks and carrots to ensure that we take advantage of periods of economic growth to run budgets in balance or in surplus and reduce national debt."
"Countries which operate a responsible policy in the good times could benefit from more flexibility in bad times to let borrowing take the strain."
"These rules should provide for early action against countries which do not control their deficits in periods of growth, to force them to take corrective measures."
"A new target for the underlying budget balance could be added, and government expenditure on investment should also be taken into account."
"The European Commission should have greater authority to police these new rules, since national governments have shown that they cannot be trusted to do so."
"This has been a bad week for the rule of law in the European Union."
"My Group hopes that at the summit in Brussels our leaders will recognise their responsibility to salvage, from the wreckage of the Stability Pact, some credibility for Europe's fiscal policy ."
"– Mr President, we very much welcome the political debate that is beginning on the Stability Pact."
"Mr Prodi gave the word and it was re-launched by the Ecofin Council."
"The Commission is very wrong to put adherence to the rules side by side with political judgment."
"The law is flexible when the realities so require and it is then the duty of politicians to interpret it."
"This Pact, which is currently being tested by the realities, signed in 1997, at which time, the Commission, the Central Bank and many states heralded an era of sustainable growth."
"Having first denied that there was a recession, they then declared that it would be brief and that the economy would soon recover."
"Those who were so wrong should not dole out lessons."
"Today, the improvement in the situation is fragile."
"It must not be compromised, particularly as we are at risk from the fall in the dollar and serious American imbalances."
"Some governments make a show of virtue in contrast to the large states that are deemed to be guilty."
"However, the behaviour of these critics often appears to be opportunistic."
"In fact, on many occasions their inflation rates are above the average – which reduces their debts – they play at fiscal dumping in order to attract capital and they forget about the Structural Funds, of which some of them are major beneficiaries."
"There are therefore several good reasons for flexibility in the Pact."
"It does not take account of the cycle, it maintains divisions, it seeks to impose penalties without offering encouragement, and it is incapable of responding to the nagging problem of the very poor potential for growth in Europe."
"As a result, it would not be an exaggeration if the Commission were still to be portrayed as the guardian of procedures."
"We need a political actor in Brussels."
"There is no such thing as a European economic policy and we want to create one."
"This is a matter of urgency."
"The Pact is not dead, as proved by the commitments made by France and Germany for 2005."
"However, if the economic recovery were not confirmed or were poor, it would be extremely difficult to fulfil these commitments."
"I say again: the reform is essential."
"To this end, the method is as important as the substance."
"All of the quarrels among institutions and among states highlight a blatant lack of democratic capacity and legitimacy."
"The assessment by peers of the discipline and quality of the national budgetary policy is undoubtedly necessary, but it is not enough, as was mentioned previously."
"Solidarity and greater participation are required to build an economic policy."
"In this respect, I believe that the interactive dialogue between the national parliaments and the European Parliament, as well as the consultation of civil societies, are vital elements."
"As far as content is concerned, we need both rules and acts."
"We do not reject the principle of a pact for rules that seek to combine stability and growth."
"However, we have strict ideas as regards the substance."
"We need rules that encourage timely action and improve the quality of expenditure and revenue."
"How can we claim to legitimise a budget discipline when the Union shamelessly cultivates fiscal competitiveness?"
"France and Germany are right to call for the tax harmonisation that a number of other states refuse to allow them."
"These rules must guarantee too the capacity to finance projects considered to be in the general interest."
"We also need acts."
"There will be no successful reform of the Pact if we do not build, as a complement, a European budgetary policy, with a genuine budget to help finance the objectives of sustainable development and cohesion agreed at the Lisbon and Gothenburg summits."
"Is it not unfair to prevent at least the countries in the euro zone from having a joint capacity for budgetary action when they share a single monetary policy, but are deprived of a second major economic policy lever?"
"Unfortunately, there is the risk that the IGC may not open these doors and that the reform of the Pact may be too limited."
"You can therefore expect an increase in tensions, to which our debates today are only a prelude."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the Stability Pact is dead."
"It could be regretted that it was destroyed by the European Council, in relation to the specific difficulties of two large countries, thus violating the credibility of the institutions based on a system of rules accepted by all."
"However, as far as its form is concerned, this Pact has always been the subject of an intergovernmental agreement rather than control by our Parliament, the only representative of the sovereignty of the people of Europe."
"What ‘intergovernmentality’ has done, Mr Karas, is ruin it."
"Federalists and Greens will not lament the death of this Pact – a Pact that President Prodi himself yesterday described as stupid – particularly as since the Amsterdam summit we had criticised its content."
"It was indeed stupid, doubly so in fact."
"In the current situation, it aggravates the recessions by penalising the countries that are seeking to support the actual demand on the Union’s internal market, especially in the large countries with a particular responsibility from this point of view."
"Instead, it would be better to penalise the countries that have deficits in periods of growth."
"From a structural point of view, a genuine Stability Pact should shelter future investments and in particular the enormous investments required to respect the Kyoto criteria."
"There is no time left to dither now."
"A new, intelligent pact must be adopted."
"Only a pact of this nature will merit inclusion in the third part of the Constitution."
"Indeed, only an intelligent Constitution will merit the approval and respect of the citizens of Europe."
"The pact must be contra-cyclic and, at the same time, must not hinder the countries in difficulty. On the contrary, it must penalise the countries that abuse their facilities and in this way, through a sort of climatic golden rule, shelter future investments from the current situation."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I listened carefully to the speeches by Mr Poettering and Mr Baron Crespo, two Members that I regard highly, and noticed how we sometimes discuss this issue too much from the perspective of our own countries and too much from the perspective of our own political parties."
"It is no coincidence that the Commission position is in line with that of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"On the contrary, I believe that we should make the effort to be imaginative as regards this sensitive and complex issue."
"Europe has its rules – and the Pact is a rule – but, at the moment, we do not need rules any more."
"I believe that Europe needs to be imaginative, courageous and dynamic and I do not feel that these issues can be tackled without understanding that, in this House, the Italian Presidency and Mr Tremonti are not to be supported for what they have said but rather a Presidency is to be supported for what it does, for taking note of serious issues affecting major countries of this Community."
"Furthermore, for the third year running, we – and I am a rapporteur on European public finances – have had to note that the European economy is stagnating."
"I also seem to understand from other Members’ speeches that European politics has some problems, and we were talking about this in committee yesterday with Commissioner Solbes as well."
"Therefore, why not make an effort to move from stability to growth, at last?"
"I believe that this is to be done by people who, rather than being the guardians of rules, want to be politicians, which is what Plato once meant when he talked about the politician and his supremacy."
"From this point of view, it seems to me that we are doing exactly what is needed."
"– Mr President, why should we conclude a new treaty in Europe if we refuse to adhere to existing agreements?"
"And if we refuse to adhere to the Stability Pact in times when it does not suit us, why do we not simply admit to this?"
"And why do we not start working on agreements to which we want to adhere?"
"In my country at least, many people are asking these questions."
"Their confidence has been dealt a serious blow."
"Why are all countries equal, but certain large countries more equal than others?"
"The justifiably devastating comments in the media speak volumes."
"All of this undermines confidence in politics, and that reflects badly on us."
"Why, Mr Tremonti, have you not elected to play your role as independent chairman on the side of the Stability and Growth Pact, as proposed by the Commission?"
"Do you realise what the role of chairman entails?"
"I am also reminded of this by certain clauses of the report of the Euro Group and Ecofin Council's meeting."
"In that report, Commissioner Solbes indicates that the Commission has given France and Germany recommendations with comparable content, which means that these countries are on an equal footing."
"He notes that we have reached a critical moment in time."
"The wrong decisions can seriously damage the procedure."
"Decisions can create an important precedent and affect interest rates."
"This issue concerns the equal treatment of large and small Member States."
"Commissioner Solbes goes on to say that if the Commission's recommendations are not followed, there is a considerable risk of France and Germany remaining above the 3% mark even in 2005."
"The Commission has already been extremely flexible."
"The recommendations currently before us really are as far as we are prepared to go."
"Commissioner Solbes also indicates that, pursuant to Article 104(7) of the EC Treaty, returning to an excessive deficit is not an option, because sanctions would never follow otherwise."
"Moreover, the Treaty and the Pact do not distinguish between cooperative and uncooperative countries."
"As the Guardian of the Treaty, the Commission has no choice but to follow the route it has now proposed."
"– Mr President, the Ecofin Council of 25 November did not violate the Treaty when it suspended the sanction procedure for excessive deficits against France and Germany."
"Rather, it correctly interpreted Article 104, which allows the Council a political margin for manoeuvre throughout the procedure by giving it the choice of whether or not to proceed."
"It was the regulations of the Stability Pact that in 1997 hardened these rules by doing away with the Council’s margin for manoeuvre."
"However, in doing so, they did not comply with the Treaty."
"I would be curious to know what the Court of Justice would think about it if it looked into the matter."
"As far as France is concerned, it violated its Constitution in 1997 when, in spite of our warnings, it adopted a stupid Stability Pact that is now coming back to haunt it and that it is forced to violate in turn, creating a conflict with its partners."
"That is a good example of a bad manoeuvre."
"I hope that we are not going to make another blunder by approving the draft European Constitution, whose philosophy is exactly that of the Stability Pact: centralisation and rigidity."
"Mr President, since this Parliament is usually so critical of the Commission, I would like firstly to congratulate it and the Commissioner responsible for economic and monetary affairs, Mr Solbes, for the integrity and the dignity with which they have defended the powers conferred on them by the Treaty, as guardian of the Treaties."
"I do not wish to blame the Italian Presidency, but, Mr Tremonti, the decision by Ecofin is a real botch job."
"Because the European Union, Mr President, is a community of values and a community of law, and legal rules – the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact are legal rules – only mean something if there is an obligation to comply with them, and that compliance must be demanded equally from the small and the large countries."
"Europe cannot be built upon the law of the largest."
"We cannot, Mr President, apply the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact to Portugal to the letter and then exonerate other larger countries."
"It is one thing to be flexible and apply the rules in accordance with the circumstances, but it is another matter altogether to try to change the rules when the game has already begun, when the result is not favourable or when it does not suit us; and that attitude, Mr President, will have consequences, because a market which is not able to respect its own rules creates insecurity and a lack of confidence in the credibility of the single currency and, as the Chairman of our political group, Mr Poettering, said, today's deficit is tomorrow's debt and the taxes of the day after tomorrow."
"And what is worse, this decision comes at a very bad time, precisely on the eve of the work of the Intergovernmental Conference which is going to discuss the European Constitution."
"And I wonder with what moral authority certain Member States criticise others for exercising their legitimate rights within the context of qualified majority voting, when they are blatantly defending their national interests in violation of the spirit and the letter of the Treaties, as the Commission has acknowledged."
"I would therefore congratulate the Commission, Mr President, on the integrity it has demonstrated in the defence of its role as guardian of the Treaties and I would ask whether, for the sake of coherence, the Commission intends to bring a case before the Court of Justice against the Council of Ministers for violation of the Treaties."
"– Mr President, the Ecofin Council’s failure to take a decision on the German and French deficits leaves a bitter taste in the mouth."
"It is never wise to by-pass freely accepted rules."
"It is a dreadful move to give the public the impression that in the Union some states are more equal than others, that the Federal Republic of Germany and France have the right to special treatment because they are Europe’s driving force."
"As far as Socialists are concerned, stability is a public good that must be defended."
"However, there will be no stability without growth."
"For years, the Socialist Group has called for an intelligent revision of the Pact, which places all its emphasis on stability and none on growth."
"The Pact is too rigid."
"It is the prisoner of criteria which, although freely accepted, do not take account of the realities of the economic cycles."
"I agree with Mr Tremonti on this point."
"Firstly, there is the ‘one size fits all’ approach."
"Some states operate with a public debt of around 60% while others have debt of over 100% of their gross domestic product."
"The Pact does not take these substantial differences into account."
"Then there are sanctions that are impossible to impose."
"Asking a state in an economic recession to make deposits or to pay large fines is like trying to cure someone of anaemia by bleeding them."
"Faced with the German and French deficits, the Commission wanted to ensure that the rules were respected."
"It could do nothing else."
"Yet now that the rules have been smashed, the Commission cannot continue to brandish the Tables of the Law."
"When the real country moves ahead of the legal country, the procedures must be adapted."
"In any event, the economic policy cannot be limited to mere observation of the procedures."
"This is where I also agree with Mr Tremonti."
"For the same reasons, my group is opposed to an appeal before the European Court of Justice."
"We are dealing here with a political problem that requires a political solution."
"We do not need to resort to the government of judges."
"As some of the Pact’s key provisions were clearly made obsolete by the political precedent imposed by the Ecofin Council, the Pact must be improved."
"It is unthinkable that if Portugal, Greece or Luxembourg had excessive budget deficits tomorrow, the Commission could put forward proposals going beyond those that were accepted by the Ecofin Council for Germany and France."
"The absolute rule of equal treatment of the Member States quite simply prohibits this."
"President Prodi has just highlighted the fact that following a serious crisis innovative solutions are needed."
"I therefore call on Commissioner Solbes who, after having preached virtue, must now preach intelligence."
"After having valiantly defended the principles, now the Commission alone has the freedom to propose a Stability and Growth Pact that is both rigorous and more flexible."
"It must be more rigorous in requiring states to maintain a balanced budget when growth exceeds 3% for example."
"It must be more rigorous in requiring states to reduce their debt when growth exceeds 3%."
"It must be more flexible, however, in times when the situation is not as positive, in particular by enabling states to deduct investment expenditure from the calculation of the budget deficit in accordance with the British golden rule."
"According to the Commission, 1% of investment expenditure generates additional growth of 0.6% of GDP."
"For example, the United States currently invests 3% of its GDP while Europe only invests a meagre 1%."
"If we look at economic growth on both sides of the Atlantic, we see a dogmatic Europe and a pragmatic America."
"I am not calling here for American-style deficits …"
"Mr President, I should like to make some constructive points about how to get out of the present mess."
"The first is that there must be a sense of shared responsibility."
"Remember that the problem for both Germany and France began because of the budget relaxations, the tax cuts and public spending increases introduced between 1999 and 2002."
"In each country that budget easing amounted to more than 1.5% of GDP."
"If it had not happened, both countries would today be within the 3% limit."
"Yet no institution, neither the Commission nor the European Central Bank, nor any Member of this House, warned those governments against such easing."
"The system failed and we are all duty-bound to put it right."
"This is important, too, because the Stability and Growth Pact is not a judicial procedure, but a political procedure that relies on the support of the finance ministers for recommendations and, ultimately, sanctions."
"Ministers and the Commission must have a common understanding of how the Pact should be applied."
"There should be a clear code of conduct on the interpretation of the Pact so that it can be credible for the future."
"There must be a reinforcement of discipline in the good years and, in the short term, there must be an agreement on the size and speed of the adjustments necessary for the countries in breach to move back to balance."
"The Pact itself recognises that it will not always be possible to remedy excessive deficits immediately if there are special circumstances."
"Those special circumstances should now be defined to include the risk of a further prolongation of the recession in Germany and in France which, together, represent half of the euro area."
"It is not in anyone's interest to prolong the recession, nor is it in anyone's interest to undermine the credibility of the Pact."
"The law must be respected."
"With goodwill and imagination this circle can be squared."
"We urge the Commission and the finance ministers to do so."
"Mr President, first of all, I welcome the fact that we are holding this debate, which I requested in September, before the recent decision of the European Union’s Finance Ministers not to apply penalties to France and Germany for having breached the provisions of the Stability Pact."
"In the end, they actually proved that we were right to condemn the irrationality of the criteria for nominal convergence, which have led to the well-known and disastrous consequences of economic recession, rising unemployment and poverty levels that Portugal is currently experiencing."
"We have already said here on more than one occasion that this Stability Pact is useless."
"In the debate of October last year we confirmed our agreement with President Romano Prodi and Commissioner Lamy’s observations to the effect that this pact is stupid, like all rigid decisions, and that it is a crude instrument for economic governance, which must be replaced by something more intelligent, since the 3% rule is positively medieval."
"Unfortunately, these gentlemen were not consistent with their observations and failed to present a proposal for the pact’s revision."
"They were afraid of launching the excessive deficit procedure against France and Germany, as they had done against Portugal."
"And then the inevitable happened: Germany and France did not accept the Commission’s proposal."
"Of course, the Commission said it would continue to apply the Treaty and that it reserves the right to look at the consequences of the Council conclusions and to decide on any action it might take."
"Does anyone believe, however, that the Commission will do anything to France and Germany if the governments of those countries do not agree?"
"As we all know, it will not."
"The question that remains is: why keep a Pact that is meaningless?"
"We know that the text approved by Ecofin only imposes rules previously announced by the German and French governments, thereby accepting that these countries have failed to meet the Maastricht criteria for three consecutive years."
"There is furthermore no doubt that if they need more time, they could stretch this to four or five years … It is now clear who controls the Stability Pact, who wields power and strength in the European Union even before the new Constitutional Treaty has entered into force."
"It should be noted that it was Germany that demanded the Stability Pact, with these unacceptable criteria for nominal convergence."
"As we now see, however, it did so in order to enforce compliance on others."
"Well might Commissioner Solbes Mira state that the Council’s decision respects neither the rules nor the spirit of the Stability Pact."
"Will he now resign, his authority having been undermined in this way?"
"France was, of course, more realistic, stating that the Council has another way of implementing the Stability Pact, thereby justifying its non-compliance, whilst advocating changes through what it called the ‘enriching’ of the Stability Pact. This is an approach that others have also advocated here."
"Some, indeed, have said that the Pact is not dead; it is merely frozen until the rich and powerful countries decide it can be defrosted because their problems have been solved."
"We know that the Governing Council of the European Central Bank also supported adopting the Commission’s proposals."
"Will the Governing Council also resign for allowing itself to be ignored by the Council?"
"We, who have always been opposed to this Stability Pact have long called for it to be suspended, in order to revise its stupid criteria for nominal convergence, which fail to take account of the real situation in each country and of their different levels of socio-economic development and which confuse productive expenditure with non-productive expenditure when calculating the budget deficit."
"One thing is certain, however: the hypocrisy of those people – and they exist in Portugal too – who use the argument of the Stability Pact to justify anti-social policies, now becomes even more striking."
"Let us bury this Pact!"
"Let us seek alternative policies that give priority to employment, to high-quality public services, to sustainable development and to the well-being of the people!"
"Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Solbes, at the point that we have reached and having 114 seconds available, it would be stupid and distasteful to pretend to analyse, in this ‘voting machine’, the Tremonti report and what has happened."
"The only thing that we can say to you is that, as far as we are concerned, Mr Tremonti, the situation in Parliament is clear."
"The communist Members and the left-wing statist social democrat Members back you, they hold you in esteem and they share your way of thinking, and against you are those who represent the stronghold of Mr Berlusconi and all his allies in Europe: the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and their satellites."
"Let us just say at this juncture that you have taught us a lesson in the Italian spirit that you represent."
"Breaking the rules is the art of this Italian ruling class; breaking them according to the rule of emergencies."
"Pacts can be respected when those who do not respect them can decide that there are cases of when they do not have to be respected."
"We know that you are also a legendary Member of Parliament, even if you were such as a journalist."
"At the beginning of the nineties you wrote wonderful things about debt forgiveness, about deficit spending."
"For me – a liberal – a little less so since you even brought ethics into it; you said that debt forgiveness and the way the old ruling classes behaved were not very ethical."
"I congratulate you because I believe that you are now a pass-master at playing the old ruling class with such a great technical ability, if I may say so, to talk utter rubbish."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the President-in-Office of the Council has twice had to preside over an Ecofin Council, which twice in the space of four weeks committed a serious foul against the European Community project; the first instance was your letter to Mr Berlusconi in the aftermath of an Ecofin Council meeting, in which you heaped criticism upon the Convention’s proposals to the Intergovernmental Conference, and the second came last week."
"That cannot be allowed to go uncontradicted, and we cannot simply move on to the next item of business."
"Whether one looks at it from the point of view of democratic politics, of economic policy, monetary policy, in legal terms or from the European angle, the way you have gone about things is harmful, unacceptable and deserving of condemnation."
"Today, Commissioner Solbes told us that the Council has not kept to the spirit of the Treaty."
"On Monday, Mr Trichet, the President of the ECB, told the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs that the European Central Bank attaches great importance to the Stability and Growth Pact remaining unchanged whatever happens, for it has proved its worth in terms of economic and monetary policy."
"He called on the Council, the Commission, Parliament and the Member States to take their own responsibilities seriously."
"It is in particular Germany and France whom I urge to refrain from blaming the EU in general, and the Stability Pact in particular, for their domestic difficulties."
"Apportioning blame makes no proper contribution to achieving jointly-agreed objectives."
"The European Union is made up of all of us."
"Germany and France overstepped the mark in the way they interpreted the rules, and what was a Community matter they made merely intergovernmental."
"By a political decision, they set the rules aside, but the Community is not an alternative to politics."
"The finance ministers have impaired its credibility, shattered confidence and given rise to other problems."
"That is not acceptable."
"Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, in Ecofin’s deliberations, the intergovernmental method prevailed over the Community method with a purely laxist decision being taken to suspend the procedure, without, that is, placing precise conditions on the extension granted to the Federal Republic of Germany and France to achieve a balanced budget."
"This is very serious."
"This is a weighty precedent, which could benefit other countries in future and which, as Mr Prodi said, is detrimental to effective coordination, to the governance of economic and social policies on the basis of transparent, binding objectives, not just in terms of stability but also, and especially at this time, in terms of growth."
"This incident, however, only serves to highlight the shortcomings and contradictions that remain in the management of the Stability and Growth Pact, with the European Parliament still being excluded from any codecision procedure."
"This incident highlights the shortcomings in the actual wording of the Stability Pact, which is much more restrictive and mechanical than the text of the Treaty, not least as regards problems of flexibility."
"This means that the Union institutions, starting with the Commission, have to take two completely incompatible approaches in managing the two missions that the Union has given itself in the field of economic, social and environmental policy."
"I am referring to the Lisbon and Gothenburg strategies, the latter still without binding objectives, and to the Stability and Growth Pact."
"It is these serious shortcomings, which are also present in the Commission initiative, which explain why management which is flexible but not appropriate in terms of compliance with the objectives of the Stability and Growth Pact has been adopted, without the minimal but specific conditions being established that justify the length of time set for adjusting budgets."
"I am referring to the Lisbon strategy, to the binding objectives of the Lisbon strategy that need to be among the conditions to be fulfilled in the implementation of the Stability Pact."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, of the various aspects dealt with in this debate, I would like to comment on the following: firstly, there has unquestionably been a serious crisis in the application of the bases of monetary union and the euro, which damage their credibility."
"Secondly, I would take up the famous phrase that the European Union has been built on the basis of crisis and we should learn the lesson from this crisis, particularly in relation to an aspect which has already been mentioned by Commissioner Solbes, and which I fully support, which consists of having a genuine direction for economic policy, something that he has called European governance."
"We have an asymmetric situation in a monetary policy which is much better defined than the economic policy."
"I hope that this crisis will serve to provide us with this economic governance which this Parliament has always called for, and most recently, if you will allow me to be immodest, in my report on the international role of the euro."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, we had a debate in Strasbourg on the Stability and Growth Pact as long ago as 21 October 2002."
"Even then, I made it plain that there was no argument against limiting states’ new public indebtedness, provided that this was coupled with the requirement that growth be generated and demand stimulated."
"Growth and an increase in demand will not, however, be achieved by cutting wages or by longer working hours, but by taking the tax burden off the low and middle income groups, through public investment, capital-widening investment by businesses and by increasing private consumption."
"The decision by the eurozone finance ministers to put the Excessive Deficit Procedure against Germany and France on ice and grant these states a reprieve, allowing them until 2005 to achieve the 3% limit for new annual indebtedness is a lazy compromise, one that does not alter the false basic premise, according to which, in economically tough times, strict adherence to the 3% limit has an expansionary rather than a contractionary effect."
"In order to reinvigorate investment across the board, any reform of the Stability Pact must go hand in hand with more European economic, social, employment, fiscal and environmental policies."
"It must be possible to use loans to fund public investment, even if this does, for a period, take the deficit over the 3% limit."
"Such would be, in my judgment, an honest and proper course of action, without which we would lose all credibility and the same problem would rear its head in more countries every year."
"You may think otherwise, but my view is that we should correct mistakes rather than try to cover them up with new ones."
"Madam President, Commissioner Solbes, ladies and gentlemen, I have noted how, regarding the Stability and Growth Pact, exaggerated statements were made and hasty conclusions were drawn in some cases."
"I am also referring to Mr Poettering: I do not think that Mr Tremonti invited the Member States to run up debts, but rather to look more at the substance than the procedures of what has happened."
"Nor do I agree with Mr Watson’s speech when he talks of a watered-down Pact."
"The Italian Presidency has taken it out of the water in which it was drowning."
"Even less do I feel that I can agree with those who claim that the Pact is dead."
"If, instead, we look at the facts, we have to agree that, on the contrary, the Pact is still alive and that the Italian Presidency has succeeded in saving it, even in a situation where there were very real difficulties."
"The Presidency has succeeded in obtaining the unanimous adoption, including, therefore, endorsement even from the most rigorous States, of conclusions which contain important commitments on respecting the Pact, budgetary discipline and implementing structural reforms."
"This has not been discussed in the Member States, still less in the European Parliament."
"As regards the Commission recommendation, the issue is a simple one: the Commission presented recommendations which, while fully respecting the Treaty, were put to the vote in the Council."
"The Council rejected them since the majority required by the same Treaty was not reached."
"What should the Italian Presidency have done?"
"Taken note of the rejection of the Commission recommendations without adopting any other act?"
"Left France and Germany free to act?"
"Rendered the whole process to date invalid?"
"I believe that, in this case, there really should have been talk of a dead Pact and of the Council’s irresponsible behaviour."
"Instead, the Italian Presidency chose the only way to save the Pact."
"Faced with the impossibility of adopting the Commission recommendations, it proposed to adopt the Conclusions in which France and Germany committed to updating the measures for reducing the deficit and to temporarily suspend the procedure."
"– Madam President, today is not a day for delivering eulogies, nor is it a day when we should be saying that the law – European law – has been broken."
"The procedures are clearly described in the Maastricht Treaty, and they are echoed in the Stability Pact."
"Each has its part to play – the Commission just as much as the Council of Finance Ministers."
"The fact that they do not absolutely have to agree in their assessments has something to do with the way in which everyone stresses the need for the Pact to be adhered to and our need for rules, without it being clear how effective a pact of this kind can be when it deals only with sanctions for when things are going badly and makes no provision for the Commission to have a role when things are going well."
"The Pact is defective not only in that the Commission has no role when things are going well, but also in that it highlights only the difficulties that the Member States face in times of recession."
"Are not, though, the effects of a three-year period of stagnation, which has shaken and battered Europe’s major national economies in particular, ultimately every bit as bad as a recession?"
"Today, I believe, we also have to emphasise that the Pact has, indeed, demonstrated its effectiveness and so we can set about reforming it without qualms."
"Any reform must involve the Commission abolishing its rigid procedures for cyclical adjustment and allowing itself to be judged using the methods chosen by the International Monetary Fund."
"If it did, perhaps our debates would be quite different, as we also have to bear in mind that the figures at issue between the Council of Finance Ministers and the Commission in the cases of France and Germany, even with the error rates in our statistics, relate only to a gap of 0.2%."
"What we really need now, I believe, is an in-depth debate on the reform of the Stability Pact; above all else, I believe that we have to combine a genuine definition not only of monetary stability but also of financial soundness, with growth and with social stability."
"That, rather than austerity alone, is the challenge that Europe faces."
"– Madam President, on 25 November the procedures were adhered to in a formal sense, but everyone is well aware that there is a deterioration in the Community spirit."
"There are passages in force that are admissions of weakness and the oxygen of confidence has become scarce in the European Union since that day."
"We do not have sanctions, but the obligation to reduce deficits remains."
"Indeed, one of the Council’s conclusions highlights this."
"We must therefore save what may be left of the Pact today, in other words its spirit, the quest for stability and growth, using the one to achieve the other."
"What has happened also raises the question of the Franco-German relationship."
"It is not a question of its necessity as regards moving Europe forward but its credibility in ensuring that the steps forward are accepted."
"The Franco-German relationship is a driving force, but this driving force must not turn into a detonator that would cause Europe to explode."
"Madam President, the crisis in which the Stability and Growth Pact finds itself shows very clearly the instability of the EU’s currency union."
"We can see how an economic crisis is very quickly also transformed into a political crisis, given the way in which the currency union is at present constructed."
"We can see how, in practice, there are quite different rules for large countries such as Germany and France and for small countries such as Portugal and Ireland."
"This crisis is not only due to the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact not being fulfilled."
"At root, there are significantly deeper problems."
"Germany’s and France’s problems are basically about low growth and unduly low employment."
"The problem is that, in practice, the EU’s currency union and Stability and Growth Pact have nothing to offer in terms of getting growth under way and creating higher employment."
"In that way, the crisis is in danger of deepening."
"We also see clearly that different countries in the eurozone are now most likely doing well for having different policies."
"Countries with quite different rates of growth and inflation need different interest and exchange rates."
"It is no coincidence that those Western European countries that are not part of the currency union enjoy, on average, very much stronger economic development than the eurozone countries."
"The euro is part of the problem."
"It must be realised that the Stability and Growth Pact no longer works, but must be altered."
"It must be able to allow a more expansive economic policy in times of crisis so that it is possible to escape from the economic crisis."
"A very large majority of Swedes voted against the common currency in a referendum in September."
"The crisis in the Stability and Growth Pact is further proof that it was a clever decision to stay out of the EU’s currency union."
"It is now time to go further and, in the ongoing Intergovernmental Conference, to confirm the Swedish ‘no’ in a legally binding exemption that is at least as comprehensive as the British one."
"– Madam President, I believe that, if you follow the debates in this House, the very substantial differences of opinion that exist here become apparent, and seldom have I heard anything more nonsensical than the statement that the Chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has just given us, in which she accused the Commission of using rigid procedures as a method of cyclical adjustment."
"Mrs Randzio-Plath, I can only shake my head at that."
"If you are capable of accusing the Commission of such a thing, then which Europe, which euro zone, are you living in?"
"We can do no other than back Commissioner Solbes to the hilt and urge him to take the Heads of State or Government to court, for such a breach of the European Stability and Growth Pact cannot be accepted without protest."
"When this House is told that the Italian Presidency of the Council has managed to produce some tremendous conclusions, I ask myself whether this piece of paper is worth more than an international treaty such as the Stability and Growth Pact."
"Why should Germany and France see themselves as bound by this piece of paper when they could not keep to the rules?"
"The leading German daily paper, the , spoke of Germany and France as a ‘’, as digging the European Union’s grave rather than acting as examples to its other Member States of how to do things."
"The Pact is flexible enough as it is."
"It is not the case that there has to be a 3% deficit; instead, the term used in the Pact is ‘budgetary compensation’."
"The difference between 0% and 3% gives the Member States EUR 250 billion in reserve to deal with difficulties caused by the economic cycle, the management of international crises and natural disasters, so the problem is in fact that Germany and France already had no room for manoeuvre left when things started to get difficult."
"It follows, Commissioner, that it is the reforms that you have to get to grips with rather than growth alone."
"That is why we are firmly opposed to the Stability and Growth Pact being altered."
"It has to be adhered to, and the Commission must be given more powers in its dealings with the Council."
"– Madam President, I am surprised that in this debate we are talking only about the Pact."
"The problem is not so much the Pact. The problem is that we are in a monetary union and we do not have an economic union."
"Some people have called the Pact stupid."
"I believe nonetheless that the Commission has demonstrated a certain degree of intelligence in its ability to interpret it."
"I am surprised, however, that some people are talking about referring the matter to the Court of Justice and that no one has ever considered referring to the Court of Justice other violations of the Treaty committed on an ongoing basis by practically all of the members of the euro zone, when they did not consider their economic policy to be an issue of common interest, as the Treaty suggests."
"That is the root of the problem before us."
"The Stability Pact is only the rule at the end of the process that allows the points to be counted."
"The Stability Pact never describes how to play the game, and the game can only be a team game."
"The Stability Pact is called stupid or rigid."
"It is much less so than the competitive devaluations that prevailed before the transition to the euro."
"However, it is not enough on its own."
"Thus, I believe that we must look at three aspects."
"From the point of view of the economic policies, we have the strategic tool we need to ensure new growth in Europe: the Lisbon strategy."
"We do not have the tool for its implementation and it is certainly not the Stability Pact that will be used to implement this strategy."
"This is what we must consider."
"Some people have proposed a strategy for major work."
"However, the ministers for the economy and finance have yet to decide to finance it."
"Everyone is talking about coordination but it only comes to the forefront when it enables France and Germany to unite against the Commission."
"That is not coordination, which is the coordination that should enable the maximum benefit to be derived from the euro zone."
"The second aspect relates to the dialogue with the Central Bank."
"When the Central Bank talks, over and over again, about structural reforms, the governments do not listen to it; another form of dialogue with the governments must be found."
"Finally, we must look to the work of the Convention in order to make progress in relation to the results in the IGC and consolidate the Commission’s power as regards the implementation of an economic union."
"Madam President, most of what I had in mind to say has already been said and I endorse the speech made by Mr Poettering, who unfortunately has left."
"I should like to focus our attention on the following: the rules we freely accept and subscribe to, big and small, weak and strong, must be respected by everyone, whether we like it or not."
"Woe betide if the principles and regulations of the European Union were considered to apply and that, if they were in our interest we respected them and, if we did not like them, we ignored them."
"The most fundamental principle of democracy is respect for the law by everyone."
"If it does not satisfy us, we change it."
"If the Stability Pact does not satisfy, let it be abolished or amended."
"However, under no circumstances is it allowed for us to consider that it applies, but is not adhered to by those who do not like it, as is happening now."
"When it was discovered that the terms of the pact were being infringed by small Member States of the European Union, such as Portugal, they were obliged to proceed to apply harsh measures and spending cuts in order to reduce their deficit to below 3%, and none of the big Member States now in violation asked for the pact not to be applied."
"Now that the problem has unexpectedly hit their economy, they have discovered that the pact is anything from unsuitable or unacceptable."
"Dual standards."
"The reaction is therefore reasonable on the part of the small countries, who see that ‘some are more equal than others’, as George Orwell said."
"Thus their lack of faith in the new arrangements of the draft Constitution is being reinforced, with the possible danger of it not being ratified and of the European Union finding itself in a terrible impasse."
"Madam President, 'sticks and carrots' quoth Mr Watson: there were plenty of sticks and carrots in the Stability Pact - sticks for the workers and carrots for the managers, sticks for the unemployed and carrots for the financiers."
"Not only was the Stability Pact socially unfair, it was totally unworkable, and the tragedy about breaking it is not that we did not wish it to be respected, it is that it was ever set up."
"That was the real tragedy."
"If we had stuck to the Maastricht criteria with the same severity that the Stability Pact asks us to stick to the three per cent, would there be a euro today?"
"Would there be a euro, Commissioner?"
"I ask everybody here to put their hand on their heart and answer that question honestly, like honest people who want rules to be respected."
"The second point about this is that the Commission tells us that it will continue applying the Pact."
"If the same case happens again, how will the Pact be applied?"
"I hope with the same latitude that was shown to France and Germany."
"It would be unfair for a different standard to be applied to a small country in the future."
"It has also been suggested that the deficits of today are the taxes of tomorrow."
"How very simple!"
"The deficits of today can also be the investment of today, which will produce the higher income of tomorrow, from which higher taxes can easily be paid."
"So I suggest we stop making virtuous speeches here and go and enrol in a good course of elementary macroeconomics, which some of us here seem to need - of course, I am not including the Minister in this comment."
"He seems to know about it - or has learned about it - and I am grateful to him for that."
"The substance of the matter is that today we need expansionary, rather than contractionary, economic policy."
"Just as there is inflationary stability, there can also be deflationary stability."
"From that point of view the demise of the Stability Pact is good for stability."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to start by quoting Aníbal Cavaco Silva, the Professor of Economics and former Prime Minister of my country, under whose leadership Portugal joined the euro."
"His words might be harsh, but they are right: ‘the Stability Pact was a stab in the back for the Franco-German axis, which changed from being a boost for a Community-based Europe to a factor for instability."
"The Stability Pact is now dead, at least as regards its power to impose penalties."
"This is an indication that the Community-based Europe has lost its direction’."
"I do not wish to contribute to the debate as to whether or not the Stability Pact was stupid."
"We saw how, in the space of a few days, those who considered it to be intelligent decided not to comply with it and those who believed it to be stupid protested when it was ignored."
"I admit that other indicators are needed and that mechanisms that apply to periods of growth might need to be qualitatively different to those that must be complied with in periods of recession."
"There is one thing I am sure of, however: we need mechanisms to discipline public finances in the interest of the euro and of Europe."
"What we cannot accept are the double standards of the criteria: some countries are obliged to comply with things that others are allowed to get away with."
"What is unacceptable is seeing those that have acted improperly making contemptuous and crude remarks about those who have honoured the commitments they have given."
"One example is the deplorable attitude of the French and German Finance Ministers towards the Portuguese Government’s courageous budgetary stance."
"What is worrying is that the backsliding on complying with the rules of the Pact could lead to an increase in interest rates, as Mr Solbes admitted."
"This is a worrying scenario for highly indebted families and individuals."
"Madam President, our aim should be to strengthen the instruments for European integration, not to weaken them, especially in the context of the debate on the new Constitutional Treaty and on the completion of enlargement."
"– Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are currently devoting a great deal of effort, and attaching a great deal of weight, to discussion of a new constitutional treaty, whereby we provide ourselves with a new legal framework for the future, at the same time as we do this, the larger countries demonstrate their indifference to the law as it stands."
"I hope you will not mind if a Bavarian like myself draws a parallel."
"At the time of the Austrian elections, when the coalition came into being, we accused this law-abiding country of illegality and sought to use all our powers to get our own way, and the same is happening now."
"The larger countries are demonstrating that European law is of no interest to them."
"I cannot do other than encourage the Commission to subject what has happened to critical scrutiny, including by their lawyers, because the Council has not only rejected the Commission proposal – as it was entitled to do – but has also disregarded the Commission and simply set new parameters."
"This is not something that the Council is competent to do and so I cannot do other than offer the Commission encouragement."
"Of course, the way the big boys play the game within the European Union has a seriously prejudicial effect on the accession countries, who, as we are aware, will, all ten of them, followed by another two, be signing up to the euro, and all the while we have had one debate after another about the need to keep to the criteria."
"On what arguments will the Commission or the Council rely in future when telling these countries that they have to stick to the criteria?"
"We ourselves do not, so we can expect that they will do likewise."
"The only thing I can actually do is give the Commission my backing."
"This is where the Commission must proceed with rigour and consistency, and let me issue a warning against negotiating a new Pact; the current situation in Europe being what it is, any new Pact would not be worthy of the name, but would end up as a hotchpotch of wishful thinking and aspirations towards flexibility that bear no relation whatever to what the economy demands."
"Europe is paying the price for Germany’s failure to do its homework over the past few years, and, at the end of the day, what we are aiming for is to keep the European single currency as a guarantee of economic stability."
"Thank you."
"– Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is a community founded upon law; the law and its pre-eminence are what this European Union is about."
"Acting in the name of Germany, the German finance minister has just trodden this law underfoot by joining with France in doing serious damage to the Stability Pact."
"In so doing, Germany not only broke the law but also destroyed trust, not only at home, but also among its neighbours in Europe and without doubt also in the countries seeking to join the European Union."
"Rules can be changed, but not by breaking them."
"At best, this amounts to rule by might rather than right, and hence to the antithesis of what holds the EU together."
"This malevolent spirit of national egoism and Franco-German high-handedness will dog Europe for a long time yet."
"Berlin shrank back in fear from cutting EUR 6 billion from total expenditure of EUR 1 000 billion."
"Such an amount is in no way crucial to the success of a recovery – not that there are any indications of one."
"The EU’s foundations have been tampered with, and a long-planned alliance has been forged against the European Commission."
"That, in essence, is the strategic position, the strategy underlying this course of action, the strategic heart of the Berlin-Paris soft-currency axis."
"Who, then, will blame the smaller states and the Eurosceptics if they again become more suspicious? Nor will anyone be so keen to rely again on the Commission to protect them."
"It was a black day for Europe when this damage was done to the Stability Pact, resulting in a crisis of confidence and a political crisis within the European Union."
"Madam President, the Presidency has been criticised for not being neutral."
"The Italian Presidency, and I am quoting Commissioner Solbes, made a great effort to find a solution, but it is also true that it did not vote in favour of the Commission recommendations."
"The way a person votes is a strange way of defining neutrality."
"The Presidency’s position has been totally impartial."
"It has nothing to gain and I believe that the whole of this debate should be carried out at European level, without following the conventions of domestic politics."
"I feel I can say this as the representative of a government which considers the Commission to be important - as guardian - but considers the financial market to be equally as important."
"I am sorry to see that the group chairman, Mr Poettering, is not in the Chamber."
"If I am not mistaken, the chairman gave the example of two countries that have shifted their position: Ireland and Portugal."
"I am sorry to see that Ireland and Portugal, together with France and Germany, and Belgium, Greece and Luxembourg as well, voted in favour of the Commission’s conclusions."
"Although he is not present today, I believe that a remark must be made on the position assumed by Mr Junker, who I do not believe thinks differently from the European Union, in the Eurogroup and then in Ecofin."
"The debate about ‘large’ and ‘small’ countries does not hold water."
"What we are talking about is a political process."
"Frankly, I do not believe that the Commission has a political monopoly and I do not believe that rules are the same thing as sanctions."
"Monopolies are not a good thing for the economy, nor are they a good thing legally speaking."
"Rules can be interpreted in different ways: the Council’s Legal Service interpreted them in one way and the Council interpreted them in another way."
"The rules provide, not least, for a vote."
"That is not all, though: sanctions are not the whole picture but a part of it and there is more to the rules than just sanctions."
"In essence, the Council decision can be welcomed in so far as the measures recommended to France and Germany are essentially the same as those proposed by Mr Prodi to the Commission."
"The substance is the same."
"The difference does not lie in the procedure: whether the procedure and the sanctions amount to the same thing or whether the procedure can be construed in a different way, the requirement of essential compliance with the Commission’s recommendations remains the same."
"I believe that sanctions are essential, but that they are most useful if they do not have to be enforced."
"Sanctions work well if they do not have to work."
"Sanctions work well if they serve to bring about extension, prevention and adjustment."
"This was the case and this is absolutely clear."
"I do not believe that enforcing the sanctions was our objective;"
"I believe that our objective was to ensure that the rules were respected and this was the case."
"I do not believe that we would have reached the point of enforcing sanctions, even for a small country."
"I would never have voted in favour of sanctions on a small country that had, like two large countries, complied with the Commission demands."
"The sanctions are one part of the rules; they are not all of the rules."
"The main part of the rules is something else and providing for sanctions is important."
"Seeing the sanctions work by extending the process is the essential thing."
"There was total compliance."
"I concluded my speech saying that substance is more important than form, or rather that both are important, but that, up until now, there has been too much focus on one aspect of the procedure, as if it were made up of sanctions alone, and this is not the case."
"Moreover, there has been no talk about substance."
"The substance is very simple, and this came out of the debate with political force and intelligence."
"We are going though a difficult stage in Europe, in which we see a striking correlation between the extent of the problems and the governance capacity."
"The extent of the problems: two wars in two years, the breakdown of the geopolitical balance in the world, the collapse of the financial markets, unregulated competition created by China, the effects caused – perhaps more than predicted – by the changeover in some countries, local and sectoral crises."
"All this in the face of limited governance capacity."
"The old Nation States no longer have the instruments for national governance and Europe does not yet have European governance."
"We do not have wide margins for budgetary policies because there is the Stability and Growth Pact and it is not being challenged."
"We do not have margins for interest rate policies, which are impartially decided using the constitutional reasoning of the European Central Bank."
"We cannot establish exchange rate policies because these are decided elsewhere."
"In 2000, the European economy was doing well, the budgets were in order, the value of the euro was down against the dollar."
"In 2003, the economy is not doing particularly well, the budgets are not particularly in order and the value of the euro is up against the dollar."
"I believe that Isaac Newton would have some difficulty in understanding the cause and effect link between these two phenomena."
"We need European governance."
"I believe that the Constitutional Treaty provides a basis for the development of European governance: I believe that, in the growth plan proposed by the Presidency but which has now become a European plan Europe has found a beneficial common undertaking in the form of a common economic policy: the first since the euro."
"In 2003, Europe began an extremely intensive cycle of structural reforms."
"A cycle orchestrated by European reasoning and in a European spirit of structural reforms of the labour market and the welfare state."
"Reforms extended from Finland, Holland and Germany to Austria, France and Italy."
"Europe is being renewed, investing in its future and changing growth expectations through a cycle of structural measures and essential structural reforms."
"I believe that these are the things that we should be discussing."
". Madam President, I would like to make three very quick comments."
"Firstly, for your information, the Commission never proposed sanctions."
"The Commission proposed greater flexibility by granting an additional year to fulfil the 3%."
"Secondly, the Commission will continue to make all the necessary effort to fulfil its responsibilities in terms of budgetary vigilance."
"We know that complying with the Pact in the current context will raise certain problems, certain difficulties, but we are going to do so while guaranteeing absolutely equal treatment for all Member States."
"Thirdly – as I pointed out in my initial speech – the Commission carefully considered all these issues, what this means for the future economic governance of the Union, and we will prepare an initiative to improve it within the framework of the current Treaty."
"Thank you, Commissioner Solbes Mira."
"The debate is closed."
". – The Queen of the Councils of Ministers, the Ecofin, has come tumbling off her pedestal with a loud thud."
"In the Brussels glasshouse, this debate about the finer details of the Stability Pact is still going on, whilst normal citizens, at least in my country, the Netherlands, have for a long time been debating something else."
"Why do the rules we agree on apply to some countries and not to others?"
"What about the rules we will agree on in the new constitutional treaty, on which all Dutch people are allowed to vote in a referendum?"
"In order to gain any credibility, this constitutional treaty will need to contain tough procedures to enforce monetary rules."
"I am in favour of a much stronger role for the Commission."
"Countries that are themselves in breach of the rules should be excluded from voting on the assessment of other countries that infringe the same rules."
"The French and German Governments have opened Pandora's box."
"This may well serve a short-term interest, but they have lost all credibility as the axis of European cooperation."
"As such, they carry a heavy responsibility."
"– I would like to talk about the Geneva Accord and tell you that, like Jimmy Carter and Nelson Mandela, both former Presidents and winners of the Nobel Peace Prize, the European Parliament must welcome and support the initiative launched by Yossi Beilin and Yasser Abbed Rabbo, who proposed a peace plan between Israelis and Palestinians on Monday, 1 December in Geneva."
"I believe that this is a courageous and symbolic act that highlights and reflects the hope of the vast majority of Israelis and Palestinians of living in a world of peace and mutual solidarity."
"As Kofi Annan said, this plan does not take the place of the UN proposals."
"Similarly, it is not for us to provide an exhaustive, line-by-line commentary on everything that it proposes."
"The key element has been retained, namely the creation of a Palestinian state and the rejection of all forms of violence, especially suicide attacks."
"We must support a strong signal at a time when certain people in both camps are virulently opposed to this peace plan."
"They must be provided with a genuine lesson in peace and forced to move beyond hate in order to live together."
"I regret that the Council is not present."
"The urgency is all the more evident as the Iraqi crisis is only serving to amplify the problem."
"I think that it is time to offer a generation of Palestinians and Israelis a genuine future, and a generation across the world the capacity the politicians have of ensuring that they can all live together with greater success."
"Madam President, I rise to ask you if you will join with me in expressing your concern to the Turkish judicial authorities about the delays in bringing to trial those persons involved in the affray that took place in Galatasaray, Turkey on the occasion of a football match with Leeds United in April 2000."
"This terrible event led to the murders of my constituents Christopher Loftus and Kevin Speight."
"A local man, Ali Umit Demir, has now been convicted of these murders."
"However, he has appealed against the original sentence, and now, along with others involved in the original affray, is awaiting the start of a retrial."
"The preliminary retrial hearing has now been delayed twice, once in July and again in September of this year."
"The third date for the hearing has now been arranged for 11 December 2003."
"While I am very grateful for the interest, concern and assistance shown in this matter by the Turkish ambassador to the EU, Mr Oguz Demiralp, I would welcome the support of the President of Parliament in sending a letter to the Turkish judicial authorities seeking assurances that the legal proceedings will go ahead with no further delay."
"I am sure the President understands the distress the families of the murdered men are experiencing, caused by the lengthy and drawn-out proceedings for the retrial, which have only added to their original grief over this matter."
"Madam President, as I am sure my fellow Members are aware, as a result of the various initiatives launched this year in Parliament, that on 1 December we were due to receive Mr Oswaldo Payá, to whom we awarded the Sakharov prize last year."
"Unfortunately, the Cuban authorities did not allow him to come."
"He sent a message to Parliament, which he asked me to read out."
"I read the message out, in its entirety, at the meeting of the Committee of Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy. I will not repeat it here;"
"I simply wish to have the matter recorded in plenary."
"This is a powerful and stirring message, in which he recounts the difficulties facing democrats in Cuba, but also talks about the ongoing determination of the Varela Project (I would draw the attention of all my fellow Members to this fact) and condemns the fact that he was prevented from coming here."
"He condemns the situation in the concentration camps and the situation of the detainees, which are precisely the issues on which we would like to hear him and to be able to discuss with him."
"He also calls on the European Union to provide moral support for cooperation, which we will certainly not refuse him, and states that the European Union must hold constructive dialogue with all of Cuban society."
"I would therefore ask Parliament’s president and the Conference of Presidents to consider this matter again, since our invitation of 13 November was thwarted and it is extremely important that we achieve the release of Oswaldo Payá so that he can come and tell us what is happening in his country."
"Madam President, I want to raise the case of a British man on death row in Ohio in the United States."
"Kenny Richey was convicted 16 years ago of arson and the murder of a two-year old girl who died in the fire."
"But new forensic evidence presented six years ago may well establish his innocence."
"However, he remains on death row and could be given an execution date any time."
"This is because US law provides that no new evidence can be introduced after a certain stage."
"The prosecutor has said: 'Even though this new evidence may establish Mr Richey's innocence, the Ohio and United States Constitution nonetheless allows him to be executed because the prosecution did not know that the scientific testimony offered at the trial was false and unreliable.'"
"So they know his conviction is unsafe, but he could still be executed."
"That accounts for why Amnesty International has called it one of the most compelling cases of innocence human rights campaigners have ever seen."
"Madam President, I will be circulating an e-mail petition and would urge all colleagues to support it, either to have the case reviewed in the light of the new evidence, or, as a last resort, to appeal for clemency."
"Madam President, under our Constitution, the Irish ratification process requires a referendum on all Treaty revisions."
"Today, headlines, reports and editorials in a serious daily newspaper, the, stated that Mr Prodi believed that any state voting against the constitutional treaty now in its final stages of negotiation should logically leave the EU."
"He did say they might get a second chance it might not be the first time they voted against it."
"My appeal here, however, is that what could be perceived to be an ultimatum accept or leave the Union is most unhelpful in the run-in to a ratification process that is going to be difficult enough anyway, not just in Ireland, but in many Member States."
"Mr Prodi is also reported as saying that any future amendments or revisions of the Treaty should be by parliament or government rather than by popular referendum."
"Could I ask that Mr Prodi be given the opportunity to come and explain in more detail his views on these very sensitive issues, because interference or ill-judged comment at this stage will not be helpful if we want to get the present constitutional treaty through in the 15 Member States, let alone in the 25."
"Sometimes it is better to say less than more in these issues."
"Madam President, I feel that it is my duty to speak about an issue that regards the dramatic legal event in Italy affecting the current life senator, Giulio Andreotti."
"He is a public figure who is well known at European level, a figure who is at the forefront of Community affairs."
"I waited for the Court of Cassation’s verdict before speaking on this issue."
"Even more urgently, I waited for the reasons given a few days ago by the Court of Cassation, in which it not only acquitted senator Andreotti of a torment which had lasted years and of preposterous accusations of no less than murder, but, in the reasons that I have just mentioned, it criticised the absurd action taken by the Court of Appeal in condemning him: personal theories which could not be backed by any evidence."
"I therefore believe that the ordeal of this man, a life senator, one of the public figures to have made a significant contribution to the development of democracy in the country and one of the fathers of Europe, should be firmly highlighted, and that it must be made clear that a part of the Italian justice system, which is clearly ineffectual if not subversive, enforced this situation which has disturbed both Italy and Europe for 10 years."
"I therefore urge you, Madam President, and I am sure that I am not just interpreting the will of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian democrats) and European Democrats, but also the opinion of the European Parliament as a whole, to give Senator Andreotti formal recognition for the clarity, the far-sightedness and the great democratic uprightness that distinguishes this valuable and useful European figure."
"Madam President, as there is time remaining, allow me to bring to the attention of Commissioner Fischler an issue relating to his decoupling proposals and the area required to be farmed once decoupled."
"If farmers have to farm 100% of the area they farmed during the reference years 2000 to 2002 in order to draw down the decoupled or area-based payment, it will put huge pressure on the price of rented land or Conacre as we say in Ireland both in Ireland and in other countries."
"I wonder if Mr Fischler is in a position to consider that farmers should must farm 80% or more of their land?"
"If not, we will put a false floor under rented land and active farmers will not be able to afford it."
"Farmers who want to fill out the 100% of their base-year area are going to have to take that land."
"A distortion is being introduced into the market as a result of this requirement, and I would urge Mr Fischler to do all he can to ensure that the land is in the hands of the best farmers to farm it."
"That is one of the principles of decoupling."
"This item has been dealt with."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs:"
"- A5-0402/2003 by Mr Van den Berg, on European governance (COM(2002) 704 COM(2002) 705 COM(2002) 713 C5-0200/2003 2003/2085(INI)); and"
"- A5-0401/2003 by Mr MacCormick, on the communication from the Commission: a framework for contracts and tripartite agreements between the Community, the States and the regional and local authorities (COM(2002) 709 C5-0202/2003 2003/2088(INI))."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, Europe must do better on behalf of its citizens."
"That means dealing successfully with more cross-border problems, and in a more democratic manner."
"Order should be restored to our European home, at which citizens from across the EU are casting quite sceptical glances."
"Over the past year, we had a Convention which resulted in a Constitution, at least in draft form."
"That is, in itself, very good news for the European citizens, as we have mentioned before."
"There are other ways of restoring order to our European home, though."
"The report I am presenting to you this evening on behalf of our Commission is also about better, more democratic and more transparent governance."
"Even without adapting the European treaties, we can implement substantial reforms."
"Enhancing European governance is one of the Prodi Commission's key strategic objectives for the period 2000-2004."
"In 2001, we issued the White Paper on European Governance, on which we in this House gave our opinion."
"Two years later, we are doing the same thing again, only this time it is about progress in respect of the same White Paper."
"Some important achievements have been made."
"For example, in April 2002, the Commission started simplifying legislation, which was reduced by no fewer than 35 000 pages."
"This is an important contribution to the simplification of European governance."
"In addition, the Commission has published plans in the field of consultation of regional and local authorities, of organisations in the civil society and for consultation with experts."
"I should like to return to some of these subjects, but what matters now is for all of these plans to be implemented."
"Not merely lip service, but concrete action!"
"The Commission can do a great deal more in order to actively bring Europe closer to the citizen."
"I have, in this report, made various proposals to this effect."
"The first, and most important, proposal is, in my opinion, that all legislative proposals should be subject to a so-called citizens' criterion."
"This means that for every law that the Commission lays down, it should think about their social, ecological and economic impact on everyday life of the citizens for whom these are established."
"That is the only way of ensuring that we come down from our ivory tower and that we no longer issue laws in a vacuum or from the top down."
"I would call on my fellow MEPs and the Commission to support this initiative."
"Parallel to this, I should like to place special emphasis on the Commission’s use of experts at an early stage in the legislative process."
"First of all, I have to say that experts are extremely useful."
"Secondly, I have to note that there is an enormous jungle and also a proliferation of expert groups, both on a permanent and on an ad-hoc basis."
"There are 850 groups of experts and another 500 or more sub-groups."
"Nobody, not even the Commission, quite knows exactly who is involved in these."
"Parliament has already urged the Commission to publish clear lists specifying which experts can be consulted on which topics."
"In that way, Parliament and the Council, and I even think the Commission, gain a clear insight into who exactly examines these legislative proposals and into the fundamental policy choices that are made during the policy-forming process."
"When those lists become available, this will benefit us all."
"I would call on the Commission finally to do something about these lists after three years of promises, for we want a parliamentary democracy and not a democracy of experts."
"Another important point that I have mentioned is Global Governance."
"Multilateralism and a broad concept of safety, which include peace and security, but also the fight against poverty and sustainable development, have always been at the heart of foreign policy."
"It is time for the European Union, the UN’s largest economic superpower, to commit itself to spreading its values at world level during the reform of multilateral institutions."
"However, we want the EU to speak with one voice in this respect, starting, if possible, with one seat in the Security Council."
"Finally, turning to the consultation of organisations, I have quite specifically underlined the need for local and regional authorities to be among the bodies consulted."
"'Europe begins in the regions'."
"After all, it is the regions where policy is to be implemented and where many of Europe's funds are spent."
"The regions are also the places with which citizens identify, sometimes even more so than with their own capitals, certainly when regions transcend borders."
"That is why it is important for regional authorities to have their own voice and to be given this in the legislative process."
"The Commission has grasped this well and is showing itself willing to do something about this."
"We would now like to see this translated into action."
"On the same subject, Mr MacCormick has drafted a very important report on tripartite contracts and agreements."
"These contracts with Member States and regional authorities can be a very useful instrument, enabling Europe to start to bring the region nearer and give it actual shape."
"European governance thus becomes more efficient and moves closer to the citizen. We warmly support the gist of Mr MacCormick's report."
"Finally, I should like to emphasise here that it is the responsibility of all institutions to achieve credible, transparent and democratic governance."
"It is not simply the responsibility of the Commission, but of all Institutions."
"This is why, in this report, we call for an interinstitutional agreement in the area of consultation, to be binding upon all institutions."
"The reforms contained in the White Paper on Governance are of major importance for Europe and for its citizens."
"What matters now is for us to roll up our sleeves and get down to business."
"I thank you for the slightly extended speaking time."
". Mr President, my report is on the proposal for tripartite contracts and agreements between the European authorities and the Member States, and local and regional authorities."
"This is, one might think, rather a mouthful for what is essentially a simple idea."
"The point is, as the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy pointed out in its opinion on this matter, much of the implementation of important aspects of European policy environmental policy, regional policy and other policies, including transport is carried out in Member States at a level of government below that of the centralised state government."
"And yet there is a danger of inadequate connection between the Commission, at the centre, and local and regional government."
"Any steps that can be taken to improve these connections are greatly to be welcomed and much to be encouraged."
"The Commission's proposal on tripartite contracts and agreements is a proposal for precisely such an improvement, and therefore my Group strongly welcomes it."
"The Committee on Constitutional Affairs, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, and the Environment Committee also welcome it and wish to carry it forward."
"One of the first pilot arrangements in terms of a tripartite agreement was among cities."
"It was based on the idea of a sustainable city for example Birmingham, Stockholm and other cities in the Union."
"It was about trying to figure out ways to make sustainability make sense."
"One of the interesting facts I discovered in reading a report on that pilot project was that the city of Birmingham could write to the central government in London and go for weeks or months without receiving a reply."
"Central governments in Member States are often very bad at maintaining adequate contact with local and city authorities and with city regions."
"If we are going to make progress in implementing policies in Europe, it is obvious that we must make sure there is interaction between central government, local government and government at the European level."
"It is important to stress and I address in particular my friend and opponent Mr Bradbourn on this point that this suggestion for tripartite contracts and agreements is not only a suggestion about regional government of which I know Mr Bradbourn disapproves it is also a suggestion about local government, of which I rather think he and his party strongly approve."
"We must ensure that there is real contact and connectivity and that we get things moving."
"Sometimes in this House we use the word 'region' in a very misleading sense."
"For example, Scotland, the constituency which I represent, is for some purposes called a region."
"But most of the inhabitants of Scotland think it is a nation within a multinational state."
"And Scotland itself has extremely varied regions."
"Only yesterday I was visiting the South of Scotland Partnership, who were discussing some of the particular problems facing the rural south of Scotland, which is very different linguistically, culturally, socially and agriculturally from central Scotland and from highland Scotland."
"They raised with me the problem of the town - the old borough."
"Nowadays it is very difficult to sustain small towns."
"Cities and regions have great identity but towns, in our local government system, have lost that."
"The sustainable city is currently being trialled as a pilot project."
"What about the sustainable town?"
"We must look at governance in Europe at many levels: the region, the locality, and entities which are lower than the locality in terms of current governmental structures."
"All these things matter."
"The report adopted by the Constitutional Affairs Committee needs to be amended, not in such a way as to break the spirit of what was agreed in that Committee, but in a way that completes that spirit by building in some of the points agreed on by the Environment Committee, all of the points agreed on by the Legal Affairs Committee, and some of the things which have emerged from the pilot projects under way."
"I strongly commend the report in its amended form to the House, and I very much hope that it will be carried in the vote tomorrow."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission welcomes the two reports by Mr van den Berg and Sir Neil MacCormick."
"The Commission is grateful for Parliament’s support for its initiatives seeking to produce better regulation, by for example arranging impact assessments, setting minimum requirements for the consultation of stakeholders, laying down guidelines for the collection and use of expertise and simplifying Community legislation."
"Next week the Commission will table its annual report entitled ‘Better Lawmaking 2003’, which will for the first time provide an overview of all of the work currently underway to improve regulation and policy-making in the EU."
"With the same intention, Parliament, the Council and the Commission recently concluded the 2003 Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Lawmaking."
"This is a major step in the right direction and ensures that the competences of all of the institutions will be fully respected in our future work to achieve better regulation."
"Today, however, I should like to focus on the two key issues that have been raised by Mr van den Berg, namely the consultation of stakeholders or interested parties and the advice that experts should contribute. What are the principles and minimum standards for the consultation of interested parties?"
"Our first task is to provide a coherent and transparent framework for the consultation of these groups."
"Here the Commission fully shares the European Parliament’s opinion that consultation cannot be a substitute for parliamentary democracy and emphasises that the aim of having minimum requirements for consultation is to give stakeholders a voice, but not a vote."
"In other words, this is not about deciding, but about being heard."
"The representatives of the people of Europe will still have to decide. Neither will these measures impact on the institutional role of the two advisory bodies, the EESC and the CoR."
"The general principles and minimum requirements for consultation set out by the Commission could also serve as a basis for a further interinstitutional agreement."
"The Commission also agrees with Parliament that the consultation process must not be allowed to slow down the legislative process and stresses that the minimum eight-week consultation period for public consultations strikes a good balance between the need for efficient decision-making and gaining the necessary input from external parties."
"To make the consultation process more transparent, the Commission has published a formal and structured list of advisory bodies."
"This information can be retrieved from the database of advisory bodies."
"Establishing guidelines for the collection and use of expertise is a further important Commission measure to improve the way in which initiatives are prepared."
"As we have underlined in the White Paper, European governance standards for the collection and use of expertise need to be improved."
"The guidelines, which apply to any Commission services calling on and using expert advice, seek precisely to guarantee that high standards and tried and tested practices form an integrated part of the working culture of all of the Commission services."
"Careful preparation, however, is not the only way in which the Commission needs to improve the quality of its work; it must also make this process more transparent."
"For this reason, next week the Commission will be adopting a new standard explanatory memorandum for all of its proposals, which will make it necessary to explain the reasoning and facts underlying each one."
"This decision also covers expert knowledge and the consultation of interested parties."
"I should now like to turn to Sir Neil MacCormick’s report on tripartite contracts and agreements."
"The approach adopted in this report is in tune with the Commission proposal and is as ambitious as it is sensible."
"It is ambitious, because it seeks to enhance the status of local and regional authorities and to give them increased responsibility for implementing Community regulations and measures, something which is being advocated increasingly vociferously."
"This should bring the Union’s regions closer to each other."
"The conclusion of tripartite contracts or agreements may be an interesting development when implementing particular Community policies."
"At the same time, however, it is also a sensible approach, because we do not question the need to proceed step by step."
"The Commission had the same idea in mind when it adopted the communication on tripartite contracts and agreements last December, as it had promised to do in the White Paper on European Governance."
"There too we proposed first to have a trial period."
"This phase has already begun."
"In environment policy, work is already underway in three European cities on an initiative to conclude a tripartite agreement."
"Tripartite agreements might also soon be concluded as part of measures to implement the Sustainability Pacts initiative."
"In regional policy, the Commission is convinced that greater decentralisation is needed."
"Tripartite contracts between the Commission, the Member State and the region might possibly form part of a new system to implement the Structural Funds."
"In addition, this would also transfer even more responsibility to the regions and those involved in regional development."
"We must, however, exercise a degree of caution."
"Firstly, as the rapporteur has requested, we must take stock of the pilot phase and evaluate the results."
"Secondly, we need to consider what legal, political or institutional stumbling blocks might in certain cases lie in the way of using such agreements."
"In regional policy in particular, I should therefore like to draw a distinction between two phases: the phase of determining the development strategy, where greater involvement on the part of authorities below the State level is desirable – provided that it is compatible with the constitutional system of the Member State concerned – and then the implementation phase."
"Here we need to consider what impact these new contracts might have on applying the rules on the use of budgetary resources and on the obligations that the Commission has to discharge as the guardian of the treaties."
"In addition, we need to check to what extent there is a danger of the Commission having to take on extra administrative and monitoring tasks."
"Finally, I should like to assure the rapporteur that, in accordance with his wishes, the Commission fully intends to involve Parliament in the implementation and evaluation of future tripartite agreements."
". Mr President, I would like firstly to thank Mr van den Berg for the wonderful report he has presented and I would also like to thank him for having taken up the ideas which, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, I have presented in my opinion report on the central idea that in modern societies civil society is expressed by means of the vote and by means of representative bodies elected by the citizens."
"This is the central idea which the rapporteur has taken up very well in his main report."
"Secondly, I believe that significant progress has been made in recent months with the conclusion of an interinstitutional agreement, between Parliament, the Council and the Commission, on the improvement of Community legislation."
"I believe this is an issue on which we will continue to work, as the Commissioner himself, Mr Fischler, has said."
"It seems to me essential, however, to point out that there is a mistaken idea that the reduction of Community legislation reduces the total amount of legislation."
"Nothing could be more wrong, because every time we adopt a Community rule we are simplifying the legislation by replacing 15 pieces of national legislation."
"And it is not that I am in favour of adopting Community rules just for the sake of it, but, at the moment, we are dealing with a genuine legislative jungle."
"Only very positive action by the European Union can put an end to the national legislative jungle which prevents the proper functioning of the European institutions and the European market, the internal market, which is one of our objectives."
"I am not, therefore, one of those people who call on the Commission to legislate less or who propose less legislation."
"I would ask it to legislate more when it is necessary, because if it does not fulfil its legislative function we will continue with this jungle which, furthermore, can only increase."
"With 25 Member States each Community rule represents a genuine legislative simplification and the way ahead does not involve a reduction in the Community acquis but in strengthening it and consolidating it."
"In any event, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr van den Berg."
"I hope that tomorrow we can approve this report without any great difficulty."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my speech concerns the MacCormick report, which deals with European governance and – as the rapporteur rightly mentioned – Europe united in diversity."
"The Commission communication on which this debate is based, and to which Commissioner Fischler made a timely reference earlier, proposes tripartite contracts and agreements committing the Community, the States and regional and local authorities."
"It proposes this in order to make Community rules adaptable to situations that are characterised by significant environmental and demographic diversities as well as to the political diversities of the Union, from transport policy to regional, territorial policies and so on. This is an important decision, although it must be noted that it will start an experimental phase in which we must take stock in order to learn the necessary lessons, which will partially be procedural ones but which – as has already been said – will also concern the best management of Community regional policies."
"We know that, in any case, these are agreements bound by an obligation of compatibility with the Treaties regulating the life of the European Union and adjustments that must not hinder the functioning of the internal market."
"Basically, the principle to which the Commission refers in this communication, which is accurately interpreted in the MacCormick report, is that of flexibility."
"This principle entails respecting the various constitutional systems of the States of the Union, but it recognises that in some States there are constitutional systems that assign huge responsibilities to regional and local authorities, which must not be reduced despite the fact that, in such cases, the need for greater democratic participation must not cause imbalances that would run counter to the guidelines produced by the constituent Convention."
"Tripartite contracts cannot, however, derogate from the provisions of secondary law applicable throughout the territory of the European Union because – as I mentioned earlier – it is only in this way that they remain coherent with the guidelines of the constituent Convention."
"We need to improve the implementation of Community policy."
"It is, therefore, important that the tripartite agreements and contracts define clear objectives based on the need to give due consideration to diversity throughout the territory of the European Union, although, on the basis of these experiences, it will then be possible to look again at a policy for the management of Community policies that goes beyond the issue of diversity and tackles the more general issue of democracy in greater depth without, however, compromising – and I believe that this must be emphasised – the uniform enforcement of Community law across the entire European area."
"Mr President, we are debating the regulatory framework for future contracts and tripartite agreements between the Community, the States and regional and local authorities."
"I would like to stress how necessary it is for the intra-State administrations to collaborate, increasing subsidiarity, in order to achieve the objectives which we have set in the majority of programmes and projects stemming from the European cohesion and environmental policies, and also in order to guarantee sustainability."
"I am thinking of the FIFG funds and programmes for the fisheries sector, or LEADER + for agriculture for the target regions of FEDER or the URBAN and Interreg projects, amongst others, in which the participation and responsibility of the territorial bodies is so essential."
"I am also convinced, however, that the fact that a significant proportion of the important Community resources which are budgeted for are not used – the so-called RALs – is due to the fact that the regional and local autonomous governments, which execute the majority of projects, have not so far been able to participate in the early phase, either in the drawing up of policies, or in the adoption of strategies, or in the identification of legal obligations prior to drawing up of the respective European programmes."
"It is time to put things right, to come down from Mount Olympus and to share decision-making with the other institutions which are closer to the reality on the ground and the reality of the citizens."
"Mr President, I rise to speak specifically and directly in response to Sir Neil MacCormick's report on tripartite contracts."
"I hope I will be able to respond to a number of the points he made in his opening remarks."
"In the light of current events in the UK, this report centres on an extremely important issue."
"The UK Deputy Prime Minister a hapless fellow if ever there was one is trying to foist regional governance upon our own electorate."
"This unwanted and completely unnecessary tier of politicians is symbolic of the UK's recent shift towards regionalisation."
"I have no doubt this move is directly related to the President of the Commission's call for the development of a 'Europe of the regions'."
"This report, and the Commission proposal that lies behind it, certainly echo this call."
"By drawing up contracts directly with the regions, the Commission can enter into legally-binding agreements with local and regional bodies on regional and other policy issues such as the environment."
"If these proposals go ahead, one can imagine all manner of projects and policies which could be foisted on the UK by the back door."
"This move clearly represents a slippery slope towards a system where the prerogatives of national governments are diminished and those of the regions are enhanced."
"It appears to me that the Commission is attempting progressively to break down the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe into bite-sized chunks, aided and abetted, in this case, by our own government."
"British Conservatives are opposed to any measure which would bolster such a development."
"I shall certainly vote against this report tomorrow in plenary."
"Quite simply, we cannot accept a situation where the Commission foists upon us any changes to the UK's government structures."
"If we accept that the EU can deal directly in any way with the regions, we are compromising national integrity, and the nation as the prime building-block of the EU."
"This report represents an unacceptable interference in the governance of individual countries, and I reject the approach entirely."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work."
"I want to stress the vital importance of an ever more transparent administrative culture in the European Union if we are to gain the approval of its citizens."
"Obscurity leads to complete darkness, as we know."
"It is essential to simplify legislation."
"The public must be able to understand how this whole place works, and it is absolutely necessary to replace mind-boggling legal texts with something that is more streamlined, and I am in favour of that."
"It is unnecessary to regulate the details, as has been mentioned here."
"That is our disease."
"I would nevertheless like to make one additional amendment, which is already contained in this report."
"The Union supports the one-stop shop principle in all areas."
"According to this, people can always obtain the information and forms they need at one and the same point."
"As yet, however, the different institutions of the Union do not share a common website where the public could follow the progress of legislation."
"Discussions by Parliament, the Commission and the Council on legal issues and other projects should be accessible at one website address."
"The institutions at least need a common portal, like a one-stop shop, where all the necessary links can be found."
"The Commission and Parliament have become more transparent, but the Council has not."
"The Council is to have more power, which means more obscurity."
"This issue has to be addressed."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I can be brief."
"Firstly, I should like to thank you for your constructive contributions to this debate on the two reports."
"Secondly, I should like to address a few of the points that have been raised."
"I think – as Mr Medina Ortega rightly pointed out – that the main way in which European legislative initiatives will be simplified is that in the future it will be possible to consolidate 25 different legal acts into one single one."
"I do not believe that this can be stressed enough, particularly given that the institutions of the European Union are, as we know, constantly being accused of being somewhat legislation-happy."
"The reality is rather different."
"You are probably aware that we did actually look into this a few years ago and it turned out that the Member States introduce more new pieces of legislation every year than the Community has introduced since its inception."
"This is a clear indication that you are right to make this assertion."
"Nevertheless, this does not absolve us from our obligation also to organise our European laws properly: organise their preparation, but also how they are structured, so that they meet the appropriate standards of transparency and clarity."
"Above all, however, it will be important to identify what these days we often refer to as ‘European added value’, because any legislative initiatives with no such added value should have a large question mark over them."
"This is an important point, particularly in the light of the new European constitution, which specifically states that legislation should be subject to such a test."
"As far as tripartite contracts are concerned, I certainly do believe that it is sensible to conclude such tripartite contracts, and I do not agree with Mr Bradbourn, who thinks that they would ride roughshod over national interests."
"For a start, one of the three parties to these contracts will be the Member State."
"Without the agreement of the Member State such a contract does not even come into being."
"I therefore do not understand your fears at all."
"I would tend to see this the other way round."
"I regard it as important, particularly for example in structural policy or in my own area, rural development policy, for us to make greater use of the bottom-up approach and to allow that to become a reality, because this gives the people on the ground a better idea of who is responsible for their problems."
"That is how you should look at it, and that is why we have also taken the precaution of first having a trial period and then an evaluation."
"That is as it were the icing on the cake."
"Having said this, I should like to thank you once more for giving such a favourable response to these reports."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0393/2003) by Mr Bösch, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the Commission report on the assessment of the activities of the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) (COM(2003) 154 2002/2237(INI))"
". – Mr President, allow me to begin with a brief flashback."
"Five years ago almost to the day, on 2 December 1998, this House held a heated debate here in Brussels with the former President of the Commission, Jacques Santer."
"With hindsight, this debate marked the beginning of the end of the former Commission."
"The issue then, as it is now, was combating fraud and the conclusions that the Commission needed to draw from several serious cases."
"At the time, the President of the Commission decided to head for a confrontation with Parliament."
"Against the declared will of this House, he wanted to move most of the responsibility for fighting fraud out of the Commission and into an external agency, on the grounds that this was the only way to guarantee the independence of investigations."
"We rejected this very firmly, because no one was able to tell us where this agency was supposed to derive its authority from and how the effectiveness of its work was supposed to be ensured."
"This fantasy of an external agency has resurfaced in recent months in connection with the debate on the Eurostat case, thankfully, it seems, at least only in the minds of a handful of senior officials in the Commission."
"The signals that we received from the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, in Strasbourg in November pointed in another, more constructive direction."
"Today, a good five months before the Members of this House bid one another a final farewell and head for the campaign trail, it is a question of identifying what is feasible and tackling this together, so that on such a decisive issue as protecting the Union’s financial interests we do not have to go before our electorate empty-handed."
"I now turn to the individual points."
"My report makes it very clear that our prime concern is that OLAF is underperforming, something that was brought to light very dramatically by the Eurostat case."
"This is not the time to apportion blame, but if we note that of the 300 staff in OLAF fewer than 15, even on a generous count, are at present working on internal investigations in the institutions, then something has gone seriously wrong."
"If that is the case then this office is, to put it inelegantly, completely off the mark."
"A quick and radical change of course is required here."
"OLAF needs to focus its investigations on those areas in which the relevant bodies in the Member States either cannot or do not wish to intervene, that is on investigations within the institutions and on the expenditure that is managed directly by the Commission."
"My second point is respect for the fundamental rights of those involved in investigations."
"The OLAF Regulation is absolutely clear on this."
"I quote: ‘These investigations must be conducted … with full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, in particular the principle of fairness, for the right of persons involved to express their views on the facts concerning them and for the principle that the conclusions of an investigation may be based solely on elements which have evidential value.’"
"We take it from the reports and opinions of the OLAF Supervisory Committee, but also from the Ombudsman’s reports, that this is where the greatest danger currently lies."
"In this respect, the regulation is quite simply being ignored by the Office’s investigators."
"I only have to remind you of the most recent example, the reprimand issued by the Ombudsman last week against OLAF in connection with the libelling of a journalist in public statements made by the Office."
"If the fundamental freedoms of those concerned are not respected then at the end of the day the results of the investigations are also worthless, and I fear that, as a result, OLAF still has some nasty surprises in store in connection with Eurostat."
"What is lacking is an effective and above all preventive monitoring mechanism to enforce the provisions of the regulation."
"This is an area where we need to take countermeasures by amending the regulation itself."
"We do not wish to touch the Director’s decision-making powers, but we need a stronger counterbalance."
"This counterbalance is the OLAF Supervisory Committee, but on three conditions: firstly, that the amendment concerned explicitly confers upon it the power to ensure that the fundamental freedoms and rights of those involved in investigations are respected; secondly, that it receives the additional resources to enable it to carry out this task, and thirdly, last but not least, that it has greater independence from the Director of OLAF, not only by increasing the number of staff in the Committee’s secretariat, but also by removing it from the organisational framework of both OLAF and the Commission."
"Targeting resources on investigative activities and stepping up the monitoring of these investigative activities are the key points that now need to be addressed where OLAF is concerned."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we have done our work well in the committee."
"We are fulfilling our responsibilities to our electorate and to the Union’s taxpayers. I therefore commend this report to the House."
". – Mr President, Mr Bösch, ladies and gentlemen, OLAF, the European Anti-Fraud Office, was, as you mentioned, established in 1999."
"This office became the focus for most of the Commission’s work to fight against fraud and OLAF was given the task and the right to carry out investigations in any of the European institutions if fraud was suspected."
"OLAF was entrusted with extensive responsibilities and, as the latest OLAF activity report shows, it has already notched up clear successes in many areas."
"OLAF carries out its administrative investigations, whether internal or external, completely independently, even though the office is established within the Commission."
"This dual status has raised both problems and questions, as can be seen from the report that we are debating today."
"At issue in today’s debate is the Bösch report on the Commission’s so-called Article 15 report."
"This sounds very technical, but it is a tremendously important debate, because it is about the future of OLAF, which, let us not forget, is still a very young office."
"The Commission would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Bösch, for his hard work."
"The evaluation of OLAF’s activities over the last three years, which is the subject of the report, has been largely eclipsed by the Eurostat affair."
"Nevertheless, the findings and analyses in the report are essentially still valid, even though the views of the rapporteur, Mr Bösch, differ from our own in many respects."
"It is true, however, that the Eurostat affair did highlight existing shortcomings, in particular the question of communication between OLAF and the Commission, and OLAF’s legal framework, which was adopted in record time in 1999, needs to be adjusted accordingly."
"This does not mean, however – and here the Commission agrees with the rapporteur – that we need to go back to square one."
"At the present time, this would not appear to be either proper or realistic."
"In any case, greater changes are in the offing for OLAF, at the latest once we achieve our aim of setting up a European financial prosecution service."
"The Commission is continuing to lobby very vigorously for the European financial prosecution service to be enshrined in the new constitution, and we then propose to table a White Paper."
"I now turn to your report."
"In it, the Committee on Budgetary Control criticises various aspects of OLAF’s work, in particular its investigative activities and its priorities."
"Although I understand the rapporteur’s displeasure, I do not think that the criticism is entirely fair on all counts."
"OLAF has a difficult transitional period behind it."
"It would be wrong to view and assess OLAF through the Eurostat lens alone and not to include other essential work in the evaluation, whether it be in customs or cooperating with the enlargement countries to fight fraud – a very important field – or in the legislative area."
"Despite the criticism from the Committee on Budgetary Control, I do not think that Parliament’s and the Commission’s positions are actually all that far apart."
"What we all want is a proportionate reform of OLAF, that can be dealt with if possible in this parliamentary session."
"This is a starting point for us to work together."
"On 18 November, President Prodi outlined the essential features of the proposed improvements in the Committee on Budgetary Control and I take it from your speech, Mr Bösch, that you too would agree with their general thrust."
"The Commission and the Committee on Budgetary Control agree that OLAF should concentrate more on its core activities."
"I should, however, also like to scotch the rumours that could be heard after the President of the Commission had made his speech, namely that if Commission officials were suspected of fraud the Commission wanted to take control of the internal investigations away from OLAF."
"Let me be quite clear: this is not true."
"Instead, we need to consider whether tasks that are not closely related to OLAF’s specific area of expertise should be moved back to the sectoral directorates-general."
"This might apply, in my opinion, to clearance of accounts in agricultural policy for example."
"In addition, however, the boundaries between OLAF and other entities with investigative powers, in particular IDOC, need to be more clearly defined."
"Moreover, it should also be stated clearly in the regulation itself that it is the Director of OLAF who decides whether or not to open an investigation, that it is the discretionary principle that applies."
"This too will contribute to ensuring that the office concentrates on its true priorities."
"The information flow between OLAF and the institutions needs to be improved considerably."
"The Eurostat affair exposed the existing weaknesses in the channels of communication."
"Even when investigations are ongoing, the Commission must be able to take precautionary measures to protect the Community’s financial interests, obviously without jeopardising OLAF’s investigations."
"The draft memorandum of understanding between the Commission and OLAF is, in our view, an important and opportune step forward."
"However, in the interests of legal security and clarity the OLAF Regulation should also be clarified accordingly and we will obviously also discuss where such clarifications should be introduced and what form they should take."
"An important and completely undisputed point is also strengthening the rights of defence of those who are involved in investigations."
"The OLAF Manual already contains a whole series of detailed internal rules about this."
"The main principles underlying the rights of the people concerned, such as their right to inspect files and to be given a hearing, should however be spelt out in the regulation itself."
"In his speech of 18 November, President Prodi mentioned enhancing the role of the Supervisory Committee or creating an interinstitutional forum as possible ways of improving OLAF’s governance."
"The Commission has not yet concluded its reflections on this."
"However, I can say that on the whole strengthening the Supervisory Committee, as proposed by the Committee on Budgetary Control, is something with which we can agree, particularly when it comes to examining complaints."
"The Supervisory Committee itself has of course made an interesting proposal on this in its opinion."
"The Commission cannot, however, accept the rapporteur’s proposal to make the secretariat of the Supervisory Committee part of the European Parliament’s secretariat."
"The proposal raises fundamental questions of interinstitutional balance and also legal issues."
"The question of where the secretariat should be located needs to be given thorough consideration."
"Neither can the Commission support the other proposals on OLAF’s budgetary status or on the control mechanism within the Commission, because they would call into question key aspects of the reform of our financial management."
"I might also remind you that, following the intensive work of Parliament and the Council, the new Financial Regulation only entered into force on 1 January of this year."
"We first need to gain experience with this new legislation."
"In any case, it is too early to make significant changes."
"It is now a question of acting swiftly – the Commission fully agrees with you here – and of tabling a legislative proposal that has a real chance of being dealt with in this Parliament."
"Unfortunately, it will not be possible to do so before the end of this year, as the Committee on Budgetary Control suggests in its report, and I would ask for your understanding in the light of the complex and sensitive nature of the subject."
"However, the Commission is confident that it will be able to table a legislative proposal very quickly at the beginning of next year."
"We should work on this together."
"We will take account of your report and the opinions of the Supervisory Committee in our work and considerations."
"The Commission is prepared to cooperate extensively with Parliament and, in the interests of effective fraud prevention in the European Union, our joint overriding objective should be to create a solid and workable basis for OLAF’s future work."
"– Mr President, work on the Bösch report was obviously overshadowed by the Eurostat affair."
"In its efforts to shed light on the Eurostat affair – its secret bank accounts, mis-management and nepotism – the Committee on Budgetary Control also uncovered significant shortcomings within OLAF."
"In this case, OLAF’s main failing was to work too slowly."
"In so doing it missed the opportunity to recover a considerable proportion of the at least EUR 8 million that had been embezzled."
"I believe, however, that the report adequately reflects the various criticisms of OLAF’s work."
"One thing must surely be clear to all of us, and it is clear: the real guilty party in this more than dramatic case of fraud is not OLAF but the Commission."
"They hushed it up and issued denials for so long that they had no choice but to continue doing so."
"And the Commissioners responsible, including the President of the Commission, are still refusing to accept the political, as well as the actual, responsibility for this embezzlement."
"On top of this, the Commission tabled its report – this Article 15 report – more than one year late."
"That is not very respectful of the law either, Commissioner."
"In our view, Eurostat showed above all how necessary it is to have an anti-fraud office, if the Prodian zero tolerance of fraud is not to mutate into full tolerance of fraud."
"We want an independent OLAF and we continue to need a strong OLAF Supervisory Committee, made up of external experts."
"An independent OLAF is still far from being a reality, because unfortunately the Commission repeatedly manages to exert influence because of its links to OLAF in terms of organisation and staffing."
"The Commission’s attempt to take internal investigations away from OLAF, which only recently came to light, is a perfect example."
"Commissioner, that was not a rumour, as you have just claimed; a meeting really did take place."
"If your top officials did not inform you of it then I can give you sight of the minutes of that meeting."
"The Commission has an inexhaustible wealth of ideas in this respect, with which it now even appears to want to honour the OLAF Supervisory Committee."
"So far it has tended to be seen as a nuisance, but now, so we hear from the Commission, representatives of the Commission, Parliament and the Council are to be involved to make it more democratic."
"This would, however, only serve to undermine OLAF’s independence further and we will certainly not be accompanying you down this precarious route, Commissioner."
"OLAF’s work will also continue to be difficult. We are aware of this."
"That is why, alongside strong, unswayable managers, we also need clear framework conditions."
"There is still a long way to go before we have a European financial prosecution service, but I hope that there will be no turning back."
"I am not able to support most of the amendments tabled by the Liberals and Greens, with two exceptions, but we can go along with most of the PSE’s amendments and I would ask for your support for our ten amendments."
"Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, as we are reminded in Mr Bösch’s meticulous and exhaustive report, OLAF’s current director took office three and a half years ago. This body has grown so much that it now has 364 members of staff."
"The time for expectations, transitions and adjustment is, therefore, over."
"The time has definitely come for a balance sheet, for an evaluation and for accountability."
"The audit that has been planned for OLAF is crucial, as is moving from the current ‘Supervisory Committee’, which is simply a figurehead, to a monitoring, evaluation and decision-making body with ultimate authority."
"Our Committee on Budgetary Control has always viewed OLAF as a working instrument for a European Prosecution Service, an institution made increasingly necessary by the growth and sophistication of transnational European crime."
"The outcome of the current Intergovernmental Conference will consequently be crucial."
"We must ask ourselves whether, until OLAF is given the status of a European Prosecution Service, it makes sense to continue investing in police action that this organisation cannot legally pursue and instead employ auditing methods that are used in all financial crime-fighting and which no financial investigation body can do without."
"Clearly contributing to OLAF’s poor performance in the recent Eurostat case was a lack of understanding of basic concepts of communication and information, and an imbalance between the interests in play."
"Another contributing factor was the lack of auditors, whose skills must always be at the heart of combating financial fraud or irregularities."
"This is a time for rigour, strictness, hard work, professionalism, balance, reason and common sense and this is precisely what we hope to see OLAF achieve."
"Mr President, recent events, which have very much pushed OLAF into the limelight, have lent this assessment great importance and relevance."
"I should like to emphasise that the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party supports a strong, independent OLAF."
"Briefly, I am also of the opinion that reform of OLAF is needed – reform that should focus on the following matters: the whole issue of OLAF’s independence and the fact that OLAF must prioritise its tasks to a greater extent and concentrate its resources on its core task, which is to clear up cases involving fraud and irregularities."
"The time taken to deal with cases must be reduced, and the channels of communication between the Commission and the Commissioners responsible must be improved."
"In the interests of the division of responsibilities and of the possibility of cutting losses, it is crucial that the Director-General and Commissioner responsible are notified as soon – and in as much detail – as possible."
"Mr Bösch has done sterling work in this House in relation to OLAF over a long period."
"Nevertheless, in our opinion, this report does not quite measure up to our aims."
"I do not think that it is Parliament’s business to determine OLAF’s internal organisation and staff policy."
"Nor do I think that it is right to bring the OLAF Supervisory Committee under the European Parliament."
"It must be fully independent of all the institutions."
"Nor do I think that it is necessarily a particularly good idea to give us a special legal officer for the rights of the individual."
"The tasks in this field should and will be performed by the European Ombudsman."
"Finally, I also think that it is important that this report be about OLAF."
"Other things should be dealt with separately."
"An example is the proposal regarding the Commission’s accountant in paragraph 16."
"Finally, I should like to express my regret once again that our committee has not had a proper opportunity to debate extensive amendments to the original text of this report, and I should like to call for Parliament to support the amendments proposed by the ELDR Group, so that we, too, can support, or vote in favour of, the final report during the final vote."
"Mr President, I should like to give Mr Bösch the highest praise for a splendid report, which is both penetrating and thorough, and I should like to say to Mrs Schreyer, who is my favourite Commissioner: you should ask someone else to write your speeches instead of coming out with the nonsense we have heard this evening."
"It is unacceptable."
"There has been a great deal of criticism of OLAF of late, and rightly so, but OLAF must not be made a scapegoat for the Eurostat case, for example."
"The Commission must not use OLAF as a dustbin for all the cases it does not feel like dealing with itself."
"Even if a case has been forwarded to OLAF, that does not release the Commission from its obligation to act."
"OLAF must be fully independent, and we must admit that we were wrong to set OLAF up as an administrative part of the Commission."
"The secretariat of the Supervisory Committee must be fully independent of the Commission."
"The staff working for OLAF must be independent of all the institutions, and it is important that staff are not allowed to apply for posts in the Commission afterwards, because we have of course seen examples of cases being shelved because people had to go back to the Commission."
"I telephoned OLAF about Eurostat in the spring of 2002, after Dorte Schmidt-Brown had contacted me for the first time."
"OLAF told me that it had neither the time, the inclination nor the staff to look over the Eurostat case. In their words, Dorte Schmidt-Brown was a hysterical woman who should try to relax a little."
"It was not until Parliament became vociferous on the subject that the investigations picked up speed."
"It is very worrying that OLAF only prioritises investigations that have the interest of Parliament or the press, and it is also very worrying that OLAF does not take whistle-blowers seriously."
"I hope that we do not see any more of this kind of case."
"It is absolutely crucial that we are able to rely on OLAF’s objectivity, and that people work quickly and effectively in the future, but I should also say that OLAF is not known for being the sharpest tool in the box."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we too would like to thank the rapporteur for his comprehensive work."
"On this occasion, unfortunately, we are unable to support him on all points, and we regret that there was not enough time left for a discussion of the individual amendments before the vote in committee."
"We identify two main problems with the amendments."
"Firstly, we are in favour of strengthening the Supervisory Committee, but we are also against the Supervisory Committee then being allocated to the European Parliament."
"If a Supervisory Committee is to be genuinely independent in its evaluations, it should be independent of Parliament as well."
"At the moment, we can perceive another tendency in the current debate about the Supervisory Committee."
"It is extremely regrettable that there is still no European Public Prosecutor at present and that we will probably have to wait some time for this."
"However, we should not now make the mistake of trying to achieve a transitional solution which pushes the Supervisory Committee vicariously into this role, as this would not be the appropriate role."
"What we need, in the long term, is judicial control of OLAF, but this can only be provided by the European Public Prosecutor, not by a substitute committee."
"We take an equally critical view of another problem."
"We see that Parliament is increasingly seeking to involve itself in OLAF’s internal affairs, and we do not think this is right."
"We take the view that OLAF must be – and must remain – genuinely independent, but this does not mean that its independence from the Commission is necessarily strengthened if this House gets involved in micromanaging OLAF at the same time."
"That is quite wrong, in our view."
"Genuine independence also means administrative independence."
"Overall, I think we need a thorough rethink of the amendments."
"I hope that we can achieve a compromise that a majority in the committee can support."
"I would also, however, like to make one thing clear to Mrs Stauner. We will not support most of your amendments, for we think it wrong that they should contain an implicit vote of no confidence in OLAF and apportion blame – also in a one-sided way – as regards the Commission’s role in the Eurostat affair."
"This is something we will not go along with."
"Mr President, first of all, I should like to thank Mr Bösch for a splendid, extremely thorough report, the conclusions of which we can support, on the whole."
"It could of course be said that the advisability of Parliament giving such detailed rules for the reform of OLAF is doubtful, but, as the Commission has been unable to create a functioning monitoring body, Parliament must of course attend to it."
"It is we who must be answerable to citizens in the last instance for the way in which their money is managed."
"In the past, we had UCLAF, but that did not function perfectly."
"Then OLAF came along, and obviously we are now seeing that that has not improved matters as desired."
"I agree with the criticism, in itself, that several of my fellow Members have made regarding the causes of OLAF’s inability to function."
"In the late seventies, there was a joke in my country stemming from the fact that there was a main post office that did not function properly."
"We were discussing what to do if a nuclear power station were built."
"There was a problem with the waste, and the joke was that the solution was to package the waste up and send it to the main post office, where it would go round and round in an eternal cycle until the radiation had diminished."
"The Commission has actually used OLAF in a similar way."
"Things have gone on far too long, have lain unattended for too long, and it is incomprehensible to us, especially in relation to the Eurostat case, that OLAF’s management was able to say to the Committee on Budgetary Control, in deadly earnest, that cases have been kept secret from the Commission so as not to burden the Commission with the unpleasant knowledge of what has happened."
"This gives a very amateurish impression."
"In fact, it could of course be life-threatening to the Commission not to be informed."
"We do not really believe that it would be very helpful to put new committees above the existing Supervisory Committee, nor do we have much faith in the idea of a European Public Prosecutor."
"Indeed, what is important is to bring about a sea change in our approach towards dealing with the EU’s economy as a whole."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, this debate should have taken place last year."
"The rapporteur cannot be blamed for this, as he drafted a sound report in the shortest possible time."
"When the Commission took office, it announced once again that it would apply itself fully to tackling fraud and irregularities in the EU Institutions, justifiably so, for there are billions of euros involved."
"The Commission continues to perform in a wholly unsatisfactory manner now that it has submitted this progress report to Parliament more than a year late."
"The fraudulent practices surrounding the Eurostat affair illustrated that OLAF should no longer, administratively speaking, fall within the Commission's remit."
"The bureau must be given as much independence as possible and be made accountable to Parliament."
"I firmly hold the Commissioner to the promise that she made a moment ago to present her proposal to Parliament within two months."
"Otherwise, her credibility will really torpedo."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Bösch’s report is a critical but also a very constructive one, and I congratulate him on his intensive work."
"Of course, we could have voted on its outcomes and possible implementation at an earlier stage if the Commission had submitted its evaluation of OLAF’s three years of work on time, as envisaged in the Regulation, instead of over nine months late."
"Some of the mismanagement and irregularities could then have been addressed more effectively than is possible now, at the end of the parliamentary term and the Commission’s term in office."
"Eurostat is a case in point."
"We know the background to OLAF’s establishment: an interim structure was all that could be achieved because a Treaty amendment was not envisaged at that stage."
"As a result, OLAF was in a paradoxical position from the outset. In its work, it is independent – we insist on that – but it is subordinate to the Commission administration in organisational terms."
"Nonetheless, delays, cumbersome processes and inadequate application of the OLAF Regulation by both parties – the Commission and OLAF – have regrettably characterised this agency to date."
"Let me cite just a few examples: its protracted recruitment process, its excessively long investigations, its failure to inform the Supervisory Committee as required, and above all the poor training and the failure to adequately respect the defence rights of the individuals under investigation."
"I take the Supervisory Committee’s clear statement on this latter point especially seriously, as it directly highlights the need to create a European Public Prosecutor to protect the Union’s financial interests."
"This House has called for such an appointment for a very long time and the Commission has now added its voice to these calls in the Convention and at the Intergovernmental Conference."
"I am grateful to President Prodi for now having addressed this issue in his action plan."
"The fundamental rights of the individual can only be guaranteed within a judicial framework based on the rule of law."
"Until this objective is achieved, I fully support strengthening the Supervisory Committee, both as regards the Secretariat – we need to discuss its allocation to the European Parliament budget – and also, and especially, the appointment of highly qualified, independent persons as members of the Supervisory Committee."
"In sum, what we need is not a new regulation but a number of amendments, as the report makes clear."
"We need a strong OLAF."
"I ask the Commission to take our demands seriously so that we can move closer to a zero tolerance policy."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to congratulate Mr Bösch on the report and express my appreciation of the firm stance he took towards those directly and politically responsible for the fraud who have been charged."
"A plea to Commissioner Schreyer: I urge you not to try to play down the Eurostat case which remains one of the most alarming and awkward episodes that the European Parliament has ever faced."
"The enormous economic damage caused has not and may never be quantified."
"Let us move onto the report."
"If what Mr Bösch wrote in the report were to be implemented, then we would live very peacefully in Europe."
"Financial interests would hardly be protected; legality would be the key element in all European issues."
"If, however, the established principles, which are summarised in Recital G, which state, and I quote, that ‘the Commission committed itself to a ‘zero tolerance’ policy with regard to fraud and irregularities’, are not translated in practice, then everything that is written will not make the immense effort poured by the rapporteur into his report worthwhile and no specific objective will be achieved."
"Now, given what has come to light on Eurostat, would it not have been more appropriate to put an amendment tabled by myself to the vote in committee – although, I am glad to say, Mr Bösch explained this issue – which reads, and I quote: ‘Can only condemn all the cases in which OLAF has been unable to conclude its investigations within the allotted 9-month time limit, in particular the Eurostat case, which has been suspended for over three years and in respect of which a timely investigation could have broken a chain of events which has now been exposed as anything but straightforward and of which certain elements are under investigation by the judicial authorities’?"
"This amendment will be put to the vote and, I hope, adopted tomorrow in this Chamber."
"At the same time I do not want what I have said about OLAF to be misinterpreted, for it cannot become a scapegoat for fraud perpetrated by others."
"This is why OLAF must be able to continue to receive its funding, which must be sufficient to strengthen the staff, in particular the investigation officials."
"I completely agree with the rapporteur in Article 33(1), when he calls on OLAF to inform the European Parliament in detail if an investigation takes longer than the prescribed nine months."
"Coming back to the Eurostat case, which disturbs and irritates many of us, I feel I can say that I certainly agree that our positions should be cautious, but, at the same time, we cannot accept an arrangement, which would mean that it would be seen as counterproductive to place the European Institutions in jeopardy over this case."
"We should be discussing and debating something else: in the Eurostat affair, were the contracts concluded properly or did fraud come to light?"
"If, as would seem the case from reading the reports, many contracts were concluded without lawful signatories, if there were conflicts of interest that led to certain, illegal economic benefits, if documents were systematically lost that should have been subject to control and news published outside that was intended solely to facilitate negotiations, if more than 50% of contracts were concluded with a single bid, then, clearly, damage running into millions of euro has been done to the European Community and this aspect must override everything else, including the preservation of the European institutions."
". Mr President, honourable Members, with your permission, I would like to respond briefly to a number of points."
"There is certainly no doubt that the Eurostat affair is not merely about gross misconduct at Eurostat – and I refrain from using the term ‘fraud’ simply because the matter is still under judicial investigation and I do not want to be accused of making prejudicial comments."
"Mistakes were also made in the Commission, and OLAF should have carried out the investigations more swiftly."
"This is why Mr Prodi has also devised an action plan which, on the one hand, contains comprehensive measures regarding Eurostat and, on the other hand, addresses the issue of communication between the departments and the Commissioners, as well as measures relating to OLAF."
"Let me say again to Mrs Stauner: the measures relating to OLAF do not include shifting the internal investigations into Commission officials back to the Commission."
"Therefore there might be a case for reassigning to Commission departments certain horizontal tasks that are unrelated to investigations."
"I think you know as well as I do that OLAF’s core tasks – in other words, what was reinforced and, in part, newly established in 1999 – are indeed the internal investigations, the rights to conduct internal investigations, and the duties to do so. I entirely agree with Mr Bösch that more capacities must be established in these areas."
"At the same time, however, it is also true – as the Eurostat case itself has shown – that sometimes an external investigation becomes an internal investigation because the external investigation suddenly raises the question: Why did these mistakes with the competition process occur?"
"Let me reiterate one point: the drafting of the action plan which Mr Prodi has outlined to the Committee on Budgetary Control is well under way and the text to amend the law of the Regulation will be with you at the start of January, I hope, or at any rate promptly in January."
"I see many similar approaches on the issue of the amendment of the Regulation."
"Mrs Theato has just mentioned them again."
"As the President of the Commission has pledged, we will work very closely on these points with the Committee on Budgetary Control, also in advance of the drafting process."
". – Mr President, the Commission should perhaps finally decide whether it is satisfied with OLAF’s work or not."
"I almost have the impression that we are criticising OLAF out of the blue, yet I had the feeling that President Prodi has been taking OLAF apart with his criticisms while we have been defending it, since so many Members of this House, speaking in today’s debate, have stated that Eurostat is not an OLAF matter, it is a Commission matter."
"The Commission must finally adopt its own identifiable line here."
"Otherwise, I am very pleased that it is happy with everything to do with OLAF."
"In that case, though, I really do not want to hear any more, not from the President of the Commission, about the obvious shortcomings, in terms of quality, which have arisen in connection with Eurostat."
"That does not mean that we have not moved from our position, and I think there are still a number of misunderstandings as regards the independence of the Supervisory Committee."
"The Supervisory Committee must, like OLAF’s Director-General, be appointed on an interinstitutional basis; today, it is part of the Commission, and not – lest any myths arise – in a vacuum."
"We think that there must be a separation, and that includes a physical and financial separation."
"It is unacceptable that the staffing of the Supervisory Committee, which exercises a monitoring function, should be the ultimate responsibility of a body which is the subject of that monitoring."
"We have adopted a firm position here and I hope that this House will endorse this position tomorrow."
"Mr President, the message for Mrs Schreyer this evening is crystal clear: she should say to Mr Prodi that we have no need of his action plans."
"They are only there to gain time, to sweep the whole matter under the carpet."
"We cannot tolerate this."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0407/2003) by Mrs Miguélez Ramos, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Council Regulation (EC) No 2561/2001 aiming to promote the conversion of fishing vessels and of fishermen that were, up to 1999, dependent on the fishing agreement with Morocco (COM(2003) 437 C5-0357/2003 2003/0157(CNS))."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking you, Mrs Miguélez Ramos, very warmly for your excellent report and for supporting our proposal."
"The Commission has proposed making various changes to the system to promote conversion of fishing vessels and fishermen that were, up to 1999, dependent on the fishing agreement with Morocco."
"We propose the following amendments: compensation will now also be paid to every fisherman who has lost his job because the ship on which he worked has now joined another fishery, for example through a joint enterprise."
"This will extend the group of beneficiaries, so we must, therefore, also extend the deadlines by one year so that all new beneficiaries are able to apply for assistance and to give the authorities in Spain and Portugal enough time to make a decision."
"I am also willing to accept Amendments Nos 2 and 3. However, I cannot accept the amendment tabled by Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna as it calls for an amendment to Article 12 of the Regulation, which governs structural support in the fisheries sector, as regards socio-economic measures."
"We cannot amend this Regulation at the present time."
". Mr President, on 30 November 1999 the Fisheries Agreement between the Community and Morocco expired, bringing the activities of four thousand three hundred fishermen and four hundred vessels to an end."
"Since then, the aid to the people affected entered into force, in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 2792/1999, payable under the FIFG."
"This aid was extended to 31 December 2001, but it was then necessary to implement a policy of converting the fleet, which to a large extent could not be relocated to other fishing grounds."
"We therefore approved, and on the basis of national plans, Regulation (EC) No 2561/2001, for the socio-economic diversification of these areas affected by the cessation of activities."
"In regions particularly affected, such as el Morrazo, Barbate, Algeciras or Lanzarote, fishing activity was drastically reduced or quite simply disappeared, with repercussions for many other sectors linked to this activity and to local production as a whole."
"In order to fund these actions the Solidarity Fund was used, as you know, to the tune of EUR 197 million in total."
"The Regulation also provided for derogating measures and exceptions to the legislation defining the methods and conditions for interventions aimed at structuring within the fisheries sector."
"Nevertheless, the exceptional nature of the measure led the Council to approve a limited period for it, which has not been sufficient to deal with many of the people affected."
"The rigidities of the Regulation have also contributed to this and now, by means of this modification promoted by the European Parliament, they are going to be eliminated."
"That is why I am so pleased that Mr Fischler should say that the Commission will accept these modifications and the amendments I propose in my report, because the two of us – Mr Fischler and we, the European Parliament – want the fishermen affected to receive equal treatment, so that they may receive the aid for their conversion, regardless of the fate of the vessel on which they work, because the linking of the fisherman to the fate of the ship has been one of the great difficulties."
"In certain cases, the vessels were able to be relocated to other fishing grounds, fishing less than they fished in Moroccan grounds and, therefore, losing income."
"These vessels had to reduce their crews."
"Nevertheless, the Regulation did not cover these fishermen because it linked the fate of the vessel to that of the fishermen, preventing them from receiving the global premium for their conversion."
"Therefore, and so that this Regulation – as both the Commission and the European Parliament want – can in practice deal with the greatest possible number of people affected, we must eliminate the provisions according to which the individual global premiums can only be granted to a vessel or to fishermen who fished in a vessel whose fishing activities have ceased for good."
"And the modification we are now debating, as the Commissioner has said, also means extending by twelve months the deadline for eligibility of the expenditure, which will now be 31 December 2004, and the last date for submission to the Commission of the request for payment of the balance, which will now be 30 June 2005."
"This is what the representatives of the people affected by the closure of the fishing ground asked us in the Committee on Fisheries, including the Loitamar Cooperative, on the Morrazo peninsula (Galicia), consisting of almost 60 workers who previously fished in Morocco waters, but who have still not been able to fully implement their business project."
"Now, with the greater time margin they are being allowed, they will be able to do so, and all the members of this cooperative will be able – as required by the Regulation – to begin to work in order to be able to receive this individual aid."
"This was also requested of us by the Government of Andalusia, which, together with Galicia, the Canaries and the Algarve, is one of the regions which has suffered most profoundly from this failure to renew the Fisheries Agreement with Morocco."
"I must say to you, ladies and gentlemen, that this modification, as I propose it, has no financial repercussions, but merely seeks to ensure that the financial resources allocated can be duly disbursed, thereby fulfilling the objective intended by the legislator when the Regulation we are now revising was approved."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Miguélez, on her report on a just cause – as others have said – which we have all supported for a very long time, including the Spanish Government, as the Commissioner is aware."
"I wished to take advantage of this modification of the Regulation on aid for the conversion of the fleet which fished in Morocco to point out that what was done then must not be the exception, but the rule."
"In other words, when Community fleets need to be converted, either due to a failure to renew international fisheries agreements, or due to a drastic reduction in catches owing to recovery plans – and our British colleagues are well aware of this, particularly the Scottish Members, in relation to cod – the European Commission should automatically provide for additional measures to compensate these fleets and deal with the new situation."
"We should not therefore make partial modifications to the general Regulation on FIFG structural aid whenever a situation such as this occurs, but rather there should be a permanent general framework in order to provide aid whenever it happens, either as a result of species recovery plans in Community waters or in external waters when they affect our fleet, the Community fleet."
"This has been the case recently with the Community halibut fleet in NAFO waters, where the Commission proposed a recovery plan for halibut which was accepted and which involves dropping from 42 000 tonnes this year, 2003, to 16 000 tonnes in 2007, a reduction of 62%."
"And since it appears here that nothing has happened, I say that the Commission must be obliged to do something in order not to jeopardise the future of this fleet."
"And it must take appropriate action by adopting extraordinary measures such as relocation to other fishing grounds, the promotion of experimental campaigns and the granting of other socio-economic aid which we have been asking for in order to compensate for the situation which has been created."
"Our intention in presenting this amendment which, Commissioner, is not a ‘Varela’ amendment but an amendment tabled by the Committee on Fisheries, is to resolve these problems and any future problems."
"If our Parliament approves it tomorrow, my request to you, Commissioner, is that the Commission should consider this since the sector in question is calling for it."
"It is asking you to do something."
"The European Parliament wishes to help you and be your ally and an ally of the sector and therefore ensure in this way that the European Commission takes action."
"This is my opinion and I hope, Mr Fischler, that you will consider what has been said before taking the initiative you have announced."
"I would like to end – since I will not have time later – by congratulating Chairman Stevenson, rapporteur for the report on Mozambique, which we are going to deal with next, because it is a wonderful report which deserves our support."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the failure to renew the fisheries agreement with Morocco dealt a harsh blow to the external strategy for fisheries policy and has had tragic consequences for certain fishing areas, especially in Andalusia and, on a smaller scale, in Portugal’s Algarve region."
"The Commission and Parliament have, it must be said, managed to adopt a plan to support the activities affected, albeit with a few weaknesses and shortcomings, which are now being corrected."
"We therefore welcome this Commission proposal, which has come about as the result of Parliamentary pressure as well as requests from the two countries directly affected, Portugal and Spain."
"It must be said that this proposal would perhaps not have been needed if the Commission had listened to Parliament when Regulation 2561/2001 was discussed."
"Even then, the potential problems of implementing this regulation had already been clearly identified."
"We support the Miguélez Ramos report, and have nothing but praise for the rapporteur’s work and for the initiatives she has produced, which are doubtless behind the corrections that are being made to the proposal."
"We must ensure equal treatment for all fishermen and we must ensure that the regulation covers the greatest number possible of people working in this sector."
"The provisions preventing already scheduled aid being granted within more reasonable deadlines must, therefore, be removed."
"We support the rapporteur’s amendments, which are so clearly justified that they need no further comment."
"It is right that financial compensation should also be given to fishermen who are unemployed as a result of other decisions and not just because their vessels have been scrapped, including fishermen who have decided to devote themselves to other types of fishing, for example, or those who have already switched to other types of fishing."
"I wish to make one last comment, Mr President, which concerns the need, in future, to provide emergency measures for situations of vulnerability when agreements with third countries might lead to situations of collapse and harm fishing activities."
"I genuinely believe that we need a global strategy so that we do not only respond to these situations as and when they arise."
". Mr President, honourable Members, I am very grateful to you and to everyone who has contributed to this debate."
"I fully agree with the rapporteur that it is positive and important to undertake the adjustment for this very specific case of the Spanish and Portuguese fleet in connection with the Morocco Agreement, or the expiry of the Morocco Agreement."
"However, I still believe that we should not have recourse to knee-jerk legislation of any kind."
"While I do understand the issue raised by Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna here, I think that this is something we should examine during the midterm review of the structural measure."
"A midterm review is envisaged in any case, and I believe that is the right moment to discuss all the elements and experiences that we have gathered during implementation in the first half of the implementing period."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0406/2003) by Mr Stevenson, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the conclusion of the Fisheries Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Mozambique (COM(2003) 419 C5-0354/2003 2003/0154(CNS))."
". Mr President, honourable Members, I can continue where I left off."
"This concerns the Fisheries Agreement and the renewal of the Protocol to the Fisheries Agreement between the European Union and Mozambique."
"First of all, I would like to thank Mr Stevenson for his report and also for supporting the Commission’s proposal to conclude this Protocol."
"With the aid of this Agreement, the Community’s fishing vessels can resume their fishing activities in Mozambique’s waters. The new Agreement also expands the set of agreements on tuna fishing concluded by the Community in this major region."
"Moreover, we have succeeded in establishing a highly innovative partnership agreement, for Mozambique will earmark the entire amount of the financial compensation to funding marine surveillance, research, training and various other measures designed to develop Mozambique’s fisheries and improve its capacities for fisheries management."
"As regards the other amendments proposed here, let me say that Amendments Nos 1 and 2 do not seem necessary from our perspective, as we already supply Parliament with this information under the relevant framework agreement between you and the Commission."
"Amendment No 3 – this is really an old story – concerns the renewal of a Protocol."
"As long as it relates to a renewal of the Protocol, no separate negotiating mandate is required, as it falls within the scope of the existing negotiating guidelines."
"For that reason, I must reject this Amendment."
". Mr President, this new agreement between the European Community and Mozambique was initialled on 21 October 2002."
"The agreement is for three years, and the protocol setting out the fishing opportunities, the financial compensation and the technical annex form an integral part of the agreement and enters into force on 1 January 2004."
"The main fisheries connected to this agreement are, of course, deepwater shrimp and tuna."
"As the Commissioner knows, we have had considerable controversy in the past concerning some of these international third-country agreements."
"Indeed, last year we worked very closely with the Commission to produce a template: the Senegal agreement."
"I make no apologies here for moving from the east coast of Africa to the west coast: the Senegal agreement broke new ground in introducing innovative new ways of dealing with third-country agreements, which we have continued to put in place ever since."
"In the case of Senegal, we insisted that 60% of the financial compensation should be for fishing opportunities and 40% should be for conservation and development."
"We insisted that half of the crews on the EU vessels should be Senegalese, that a considerable quantity of the catch should be processed in the fish processing plants in Senegal and that VMS monitoring be fitted in all vessels involved."
"In every respect, this was seen as a good package that delivered the development and conservation values, provided a sustainable fishery, continued to provide jobs for EU fishermen, and continued to supply the EU with high-quality fish."
"In the EU we are only 60% self-sufficient in fishery products; there is a rising consumer demand for more fish, and fish stocks are falling in the Community's waters."
"It is important that through the Senegal agreement, and the subsequent agreements we have achieved since then, we are trying to continue with this pattern in order to continue to provide these kinds of sustainable fisheries agreements."
"If we abandon these agreements, we would have a free-for-all."
"There would be a situation where countries like Senegal, Mauritania, and, in this case, Mozambique, would feel free to enter into contracts with the Koreans, the Japanese or the Russians, and there would then be no element of conservation, no development element, no care for the local indigenous fishermen or their welfare."
"In these circumstances, if we act via the EU, we have a better opportunity for monitoring the way these agreements work."
"In the case of the Mozambique agreement, we are asking the Commission to report to the Council and to the European Parliament on the application and implementation of the agreement one year before it ends."
"If we find that these conditions have not been adhered to, then we will not mandate the Commission to enter into further agreements with Mozambique."
"In this case, we have a report of an abundance of deepwater shrimp and tuna in this area."
"We are going to give fishing opportunities for ten vessels fishing for 1000 tonnes per year of deepwater shrimp - and an additional 535 tonne by-catch - 35 freezer tuna seiners and 14 surface longliners fishing for 8000 tonnes of tuna."
"The financial package is EUR 4 090 000 per annum."
"In this case it is not a question of 60% for fishing opportunities and 40% for development; all of it is going towards conservation and development - EUR 1.5 million for monitoring marine fisheries, EUR 1 million for institutional development, EUR 1 million for research, EUR 430 000 for training, EUR 100 000 for quality control and EUR 60 000 to help Mozambique participate in international meetings."
"This is a very good package and I commend it to the House."
"I am grateful to the Commission for producing it, we are now working in a new spirit of partnership in these third-country agreements and we should continue to do so."
". Mr President, I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Stevenson, for having included the amendments of the Committee on Budgets in his report, and I believe we should all be pleased because this protocol will allow Community ships to return to the waters of Mozambique, in which they fished until 1993, when Mozambique condemned the then existing Agreement."
"Although Mr Stevenson has already spoken briefly on the budget, I would like to insist that the financial record sheet for the Council's proposal effectively provides for compensation for 2004, 2005 and 2006 in commitment appropriations of EUR 12 270 000, which is exclusively dedicated as Commissioner Fischler and the rapporteur, Mr Stevenson, have said – to what we call specific measures, which the Committee on Budgets also welcomes."
"Furthermore, it is laid down that there may be a maximum of EUR 15 870 000, when the annual budget is established."
"Apart from this, the Committee on Budgets is in favour of this Protocol with the Republic of Mozambique, which provides for new fishing opportunities for the Community fleet in the Indian Ocean."
"Mr Fischler, the Committee on Budgets, however, regrets – as on so many occasions – that the Commission has waited until the end of July 2003 to communicate its initial proposal, despite the fact that the Protocol was signed in October 2002."
". Mr President, the main concern of the Committee on Development and Cooperation in relation to this agreement is to make sure that its impact is in keeping with the wider development goals of the Union."
"We are very keen to ensure that development policy is not ghettoised into one little bit of the Commission, and that its objectives are mainstreamed right across EU policies when we are dealing with the developing world."
"What does this mean in concrete terms in relation to this agreement?"
"It means we want to see real benefits for the local communities and assurances that this agreement will not have negative impacts on the local populations that depend on fisheries."
"We want the Commission to maximise local employment opportunities arising from the agreement, looking at access for fishermen to the tuna fishing business."
"We are keen to see women be given a role in the marketing and processing of fisheries products."
"Stock management issues are also important."
"We want the Commission to make sure that the agreement takes full account of the sustainable management of fisheries resources, particularly with regard to tuna stocks."
"The emphasis should be on decentralised production using low-cost, sustainable farming methods."
"Like Mr Stevenson we welcome the Commission's proposals to allocate the financial compensation to measures which promote institutional development, marine surveillance, research, training and quality control."
"This is a good step in the right direction because it is important that the money also goes into furthering our development goals."
"Finally, I agree with all those who are saying that it is extremely important that the Parliament be kept informed of the implementation of this agreement."
"We need regular assessments on what is happening on the ground before we can agree to any renewal of the agreement."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in order to overcome the problem of its scant fish stocks, the European Union has, amongst other measures, concluded agreements with third countries with a view to using these countries’ territorial waters in exchange for financial compensation."
"In 2002, the European Union signed an agreement of this nature with Mozambique, which was seen by many as the perfect agreement, because it managed to combine cooperation and mutual interest: in the next three years the Community fleet will be able to fish in Mozambican territorial waters in return for financial compensation of around EUR four million."
"This balanced agreement is in actual fact ideal."
"Firstly, because it covers species which have abundant stocks in Mozambique; shrimp and tuna."
"Secondly, it seeks to develop local fisheries by training Mozambican crews."
"Thirdly, Community compensation has been earmarked for tangible objectives in the fisheries sector."
"The fourth and last point is that the agreement’s implementation will be monitored, with particular attention being paid to the sanitation aspects of catches."
"I agree with the requirement laid down by the European Parliament, through its rapporteur, Mr Stevenson, to receive an annual report on the agreement’s application and on the implementation of its measures, which will enable this institution closely to monitor this agreement – of strategic importance for the European Union’s common fisheries policy – thereby keeping up to date in preparation for any negotiations, when it comes to renewing the agreement."
"I wish to conclude by expressing my complete satisfaction at the signing of this agreement, which is so well balanced."
"I am truly convinced that, unlike the previous agreement, Mozambique will have no reason to be unhappy with this text."
"Mr President, it is me again."
"International fisheries agreements with third countries have always been one of the key elements of Community fisheries policy."
"Half of our fisheries products, consumed fresh or used for processing, originate from waters outside the Community in which third countries exercise the right to exclusive use of resources."
"In economic terms, the European Union is an enormous market of more than 370 million inhabitants, an expanding market with a deficit in fisheries products."
"This situation determines the European Union's commercial policy in the field of fisheries."
"Given its volume, the Community market is the world’s main market for sea products."
"The Socialist Group therefore supports the conclusion of this agreement between the Community and Mozambique and congratulates the rapporteur, Mr Stevenson, who has produced a wonderful report."
"We have absolutely no doubt that this agreement will contribute to strengthening mutually beneficial relations with that Republic."
"It will not only contribute to the supply of the Community market but it will also mean - as Mr Piscarreta said – aid for the development of Mozambique’s fisheries sector, all within the framework of sustainable development."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we believe that strengthening commercial relations between the European Union and Mozambique, is not simply demagoguery, but might actually help to improve the lives of the Mozambican people."
"Surely it is good development aid policy for the so-called first world to buy from the developing countries their most valuable products, whether they are diamonds or prawns, and that the fruits of these sales should promote fundamental strategic sectors such as local agriculture."
"The Socialist Group therefore supports the amendments of the rapporteur, Mr Stevenson, and those of the Committee on Budgets."
"We agree with the wishes of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, although we regret that we cannot support its proposals, since they have not been presented in the form of amendments to the legislative text, as is always required in these cases."
"Mrs Miguélez, you began your speech by saying ‘it is me again’."
"The fact that you have spoken more than once in one evening simply demonstrates that you are very hard-working."
"You know that the Presidency is always very happy to hear you."
"Mr President, I too wish to welcome the return of the Community fishing vessels to Mozambican waters."
"As a Portuguese citizen, I make this statement without any colonialist nostalgia or any harking back to those times, but I feel that the fact that Community boats are returning to Mozambican waters is also a sign of the democratic maturity that Mozambique has achieved and the normalisation of diplomatic relations that have been established between that country and the European Union."
"In fact, as has already been said, this agreement brings mutual advantages and really represents the culmination of a process of drafting fisheries agreements with third countries that the Commission and Parliament have been working on for some time now."
"This agreement was concluded as the result both of discussions and of a wealth of experience, which should in future be applied to cases similar to that of Mozambique."
"In this regard, the President of the Commission has called this a model agreement, and I share this view. This could provide a model for future agreements with third countries, poor countries, underdeveloped countries for whom the type of scheme and system contained in this agreement provides the best way of protecting their interests, of supporting their fisheries in a manner that is ecologically, scientifically and economically advantageous."
"I must therefore congratulate the Commission on having achieved such positive results in its diplomatic relations with Mozambique, and the Chairman of the Committee on Fisheries on the excellent report he has produced."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0362/2003) by Mr Cashman, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the adoption of measures concerning the repatriation of mortal remains (2003/2032(INI))"
". Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking the members of the Committee on Citizen's Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs for their unanimous support on this very important report."
"To provide a context, at present there is no EU-wide provision uniformly governing the repatriation of mortal remains from one Member State to another."
"In the absence of any such provisions, cross-border transportation of mortal remains is governed by two instruments of international law, but primarily the Strasbourg agreement concluded in 1973."
"The world, methods and technology have changed much since then."
"It is also interesting to note that only some Member States have actually acceded to this Strasbourg agreement, which, in many respects, is obsolete."
"On account of the above-mentioned agreements, the death of a Community citizen in a Member State other than his country of origin results in much more complex procedures, a longer period of time before burial or cremation takes place, and higher costs than if the death had occurred in the deceased person's country of origin."
"We encourage people to live, work and settle in states other than their own national Member State."
"Currently, over 5 million people reside outside their national Member State; add to this the millions of EU citizens who holiday throughout the European Union every year, and we are looking at a growing number of people who die abroad."
"Their relatives are faced with appalling bureaucracy through which they have to wade."
"The Commission has recently stated once again that EU citizens should be able to move between Member States on terms similar to those applicable to nationals of a Member State, and that additional administrative or legal obligations should be kept to the bare minimum required by the fact that the person in question is a non-national."
"As things stand at present, it is still far from true that a Community citizen who dies in a Member State other than his own is treated in the same way as a national who dies in his home country."
"This has been pointed out to the Commission and the Council on numerous occasions by many Members of the European Parliament."
"We are presented with the ludicrous situation that we are supposed to be a Europe without internal borders, yet as soon as somebody dies, when there is a great need for understanding and sympathy, we erect the borders merely because the body needs to be transported from one country to another."
"That means that a zinc coffin is required, at enormous expense."
"A family from Coventry in the UK had to repatriate their son who was tragically killed on his first night on holiday in Spain."
"They were given no help."
"They were given a mass of bureaucracy – in a foreign language – through which they had to wade."
"They were given no translation, no help from the consular services and had to meet the cost of over GBP 3000 for a zinc coffin alone."
"We are presented with a ludicrous situation in which the repatriation of a corpse from Salzburg to Freilassing – a distance of ten kilometres – requires a zinc coffin, but the transfer of a body from Ivalo to Helsinki – a distance of 1120 kilometres – requires no such coffin."
"It is quite clear that we need a uniform approach to this situation."
"We are currently 15 Member States, soon to be 25."
"We are encouraging people to live in other countries, to embrace other cultures; yet when they die, suddenly, the border is erected and the bureaucracy comes into play."
"It is very simple: in 1973, we were worried about the deterioration of corpses during transit."
"Embalming is now common, technology has moved on."
"We have to say to the reluctant Commission that this issue will not go away."
"All of us here are protected – we have organisations, trade unions and institutions that will return our bodies to where our families want them to be."
"But imagine for a moment the plight of a mother, Dolores Shambley, dealing with the death of her son, Kris Shambley – barely 20 in 1998."
"Dolores Shambley is a woman with very little money, who was given very little assistance."
"This is a fundamental right."
"If we are really interested in upholding the rights of our citizens, I urge the Commission to bring forward proposals and accept the principle of free movement. I believe that the right to move freely only ends when the body is interred."
"There has been a reluctance within the Commission to accept this own-initiative report."
"Be brave."
"Be courageous."
"Accept the challenge."
"The goodwill is there."
"I now want the political initiative."
". Mr President, may I first of all thank Mr Cashman for his detailed and precise report on this very sensitive and important issue."
"This report sets out very clearly the problems regarding the repatriation of mortal remains that exist within the Union today."
"I know how strongly many Members feel about this issue."
"Many Members of this House have personally intervened to assist families of constituents who have faced these difficulties when trying to repatriate the mortal remains of their loved ones."
"I therefore appreciate the particular importance that must be attached to this issue."
"The Commission agrees with Mr Cashman that these problems will multiply as EU citizens increasingly use their rights to work and reside in other Member States."
"Although the Commission fully recognises the importance of this issue and the urgent need to deal with it, I must admit that it has been somewhat hesitant, as the report has clearly pointed out, in determining precisely what to do about this."
"The Commission has signalled, in response to a number of questions by Members of Parliament, that it does not believe, at this stage, that specific harmonisation is required."
"I wish to stress today, however, that this does not imply that we cannot move to resolve these problems."
"In the coming weeks, I shall be asking my colleagues to adopt a directive on services in the internal market, and I believe that directive will help resolve a number of the problems raised by Mr Cashman's report insofar as they reflect restrictions on the exercise and provision of cross-border funeral services."
"In particular, it will simplify administrative procedures and abolish authorisation requirements that are not consistent with the principle of proportionality."
"I also hope to be able to deal with the specific problem related to zinc coffins insofar as a coffin is obviously an essential element of the funeral director's services."
"There will remain problems caused by different national requirements such as those on death certificates and autopsies."
"On those issues the Commission doubts that it is legally possible to apply the principle of the free movement of people to contest restrictions on the transfer of mortal remains."
"It also believes that harmonisation on these issues would be likely to be contested on the grounds of subsidiarity."
"I wish to thank Mr Cashman once again for this report and I should like to reassure this House that the Commission will seek to resolve as many of the problems raised in it as possible, but I cannot guarantee that we shall solve all the problems, given the uncertain legal situation regarding the free movement of people."
"In resolving the restrictions to the provision of funeral services the Commission will do its utmost to make Member States aware of the very important problems raised in this report regarding differing provisions on autopsies and death certificates."
"In particular, we shall indicate that national legislation in this field should respect fundamental rights, and in particular the dignity of people."
"Mr President, it is not easy to speak following Mr Cashman’s speech, and I would firstly like to congratulate him on having had the idea of producing this own-initiative report, on the way he has drawn it up and on achieving the unanimous support of his committee."
"I would also like to congratulate the Commission on announcing that it is going to propose a services directive and simplify some of the procedures necessary for free movement – in this case of mortal remains and we eagerly await the presentation of this proposal by the Commission."
"I believe this issue is of particular importance."
"It is said that societies are measured in terms of their respect for their elderly people, and even more in terms of their respect for their mortal remains."
"I believe it is our obligation to make as much progress as possible in simplifying as far as we possibly can the procedures necessary – which affect the families so much for the free movement of mortal remains within the Union in the event that death takes place far from their places of origin."
"Furthermore, I believe that Mr Cashman – if you will allow me a little humour on such a serious issue is showing his great qualities as a politician, because he is showing concern for people who are never again going to be able to vote for him."
"I believe that the fact that certain countries of the European Union have not signed the Strasbourg Agreement, as the rapporteur has quite rightly said, obliges us even more as the European Union – in view of the imminent entry of ten new countries – to establish certain rules in order to simplify as far as possible the procedures necessary for the free movement of mortal remains within the European Union."
"I was surprised to see this report and its contents on the agenda."
"In my own 35 years in the funeral profession, I never encountered the problems of not being able to send home or receive mortal remains."
"What I have repeatedly witnessed, however, is the appalling conditions in which some bodies have been received because of the lack of proper embalming or care treatment in some countries."
"Sadly, there is no attempt in this report to tackle this serious issue, despite a reference to it in the introduction to the explanatory statement, wherein it is hinted that this is the main problem."
"The rapporteur has informed me that the Commission would not accept amendments on this essential issue, so the chances of standard systems of embalming being introduced are zero."
"This report will no doubt be adopted nevertheless without the real issue being confronted."
"By voting for this report, Members should be aware that they will do nothing to alleviate the stress and emotion suffered by the bereaved who frequently fall victim to the tragic catastrophes of the repatriation of mortal remains."
"Unfortunately and regrettably, factual errors in this report make it obvious that it has been written by a layman who has no real understanding of the problems of repatriation or indeed the funeral profession, and I therefore see that this report has not addressed the real issue."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I wish to congratulate Mr Cashman on the report he has presented, which won the unanimous support of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs."
"As Mr Cashman stated, and as Commissioner Bolkestein reiterated, the fundamental logic of freedom of movement will make the need to adopt rules in these areas increasingly pressing, because the free movement of citizens within Community territory will multiply the number of cases that we are seeing today and which warrant our attention."
"In fact, it is incomprehensible that the death of a Community citizen in a Member State other than his or her country of origin results in much more complex procedures, a longer period of time before burial or cremation takes place, and higher costs."
"This clearly runs counter to the Community approach."
"This being the case, measures must be adopted to simplify or even harmonise the process of repatriating the mortal remains of persons who have died so as to bring this process more into line with the Community approach which is not, of course, taken into account in the international agreements governing this field."
"These are the 1937 Berlin agreement and the 1973 Strasbourg agreement which, because they are quite old, are not relevant to the situation we have in Europe today and have therefore become largely obsolete."
"Furthermore, these agreements established a form of indirect discrimination because they apply essentially to ‘non nationals’, which contravenes the fundamental principle of non-discrimination enshrined in Community law, thereby breaching essential rules of Community law."
"It consequently falls to the Commission, as guardian of the Treaties, to ensure that these are compatible and to adopt the necessary measures to guaranteeing that they are complied with."
"Lastly, it should be pointed out that not all Member States have ratified these agreements, which is another reason for the unacceptable disparity in the measures adopted by each of the Member States."
"Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate Mr Cashman."
"His report is based on a resolution that I tabled."
"Following on from Mr Titford's comments, today I tried to contact an undertaker friend to see if he had anything he wished to add tonight, but it seems he is on his holidays somewhere, as it so happens."
"We all accept that Mr Cashman’s excellent report is still and I do not mean to denigrate it - an aspirational report."
"It aspires to improving a situation that is indeed common."
"Every year I hear of one, two or even sometimes three cases where people experience problems in relation to the repatriation of remains."
"If we look at the dates of the various pieces of legislation that Mr Cashman has mentioned in his report, we see that they are all at least 30 years old."
"30 years ago the world was very different."
"As Mr Cashman said, huge numbers of people are now moving about and spending holidays in other Member States."
"In two of the cases I have very recently heard about, the deceased had been killed under what were considered to be suspicious circumstances."
"Only this morning I had a phone call from the mother of a young man."
"She has been waiting 17 months to have his remains repatriated, and local courts have constantly changed their minds about the prosecution of the person believed to have been involved in the death of this young man."
"So, it is not just a question of the technical matters relating to repatriation."
"Very often, delays also occur in relation as the report mentions - to the circumstances of the death."
"I have just received a copy of one of the questions the Commissioner referred to."
"This was an answer to a question I tabled on 11 October 2000: 'the Commission, following extensive consultations with all parties concerned, concluded that detailed harmonisation of national rules in this area, over and above those that already exist, is neither desirable nor necessary and would not be justified from the point of view of subsidiarity or proportionality'."
"That is a depressing answer, Commissioner, so I hope very much that, in the provision of services directive you are proposing, you will recognise that this is an important issue, and above all that in these situations we are very often discussing a deeply human tragedy."
". Mr President, I believe it would be right to correct the record as regards Mr Titford's contribution."
"I would point out to him that the report is about the adoption of measures concerning the repatriation of mortal remains."
"It is about barriers to movement rather than the conditions of the corpse."
"I want the principle to be accepted."
"Mr Titford could, at any time, have suggested amendments to me."
"Despite discussions in Strasbourg on my report, he subsequently offered no amendments."
"I am deeply saddened."
"I always deal honestly and openly with all my colleagues, but he flattered me privately and failed to act publicly."
"I need to correct the record in this regard."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0400/2003) by Mrs Lucas, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on a European Union strategy to reduce atmospheric emissions from seagoing ships (COM(2002) 595 C5-0154/2003 2003/2064(INI))"
". Mr President, I want to start with a word of praise for the Commission."
"In the first reading on sulphur levels in marine fuel, the European Parliament asked for stricter levels for sulphur in marine fuel, and as a first step towards looking at this, I am very pleased that the Commission has requested a study which has now been produced - that looks into the particular issues involved, arising from a potential price premium for 0.5% sulphur in marine fuel."
"So I am very pleased to see the Commission taking the Parliament's initiative so seriously, and that is a very positive point to start with."
"However, it is balanced by a negative point: we are still waiting for a common position on that proposal."
"The European Parliament's first reading was back in June 2003, so one preliminary question I have is why has the Council not made more progress?"
"Could the Commission enlighten us as to when we might expect that common position?"
"I hope that we could have it by early 2004 at the latest ."
"Regarding the Community strategy on air pollution from seagoing ships, as I have said before, I very much welcome the publication by the Commission of this communication on a European Union strategy to reduce atmospheric emissions."
"As it states, the Commission has indeed set out a broad series of objectives, actions and recommendations for reducing the emissions of air pollutants from seagoing ships over the next ten years in order to reduce their impact on the environment and on human health problems in the EU."
"However, many of the proposals outlined do not go far enough and in my report I seek to encourage the Commission and the Member States to go a little bit further than outlined in that Commission communication."
"The Commission very usefully sets out the scale of the impact of ship emissions."
"It is very important that we recognise that those impacts are far from being insignificant."
"In my explanatory statement I underline the seriousness of these impacts that we face."
"For example, ship emissions contribute to critical loads of acidity being exceeded by more than 50% in most of the coastal areas along the English Channel and the North Sea, in the Baltic Sea along the coast of Germany and Poland, and also in large parts of southern Sweden and Finland."
"So, the kinds of impacts we are talking about here are indeed very serious."
"In terms of the main atmospheric emissions that should be addressed by the Commission communication, it already mentions sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds, particulates, carbon dioxide and halon - all of these are quite rightly included."
"However, in my report, I seek to add two further categories of emissions that should be covered by the strategy: heavy metals and polycyclic aromatics, which are essentially hydrocarbons associated with cancer."
"I would very much like to see the proposal being extended to cover those."
"The Commission is right to state that EU regulations on emissions standards are the best way to reduce emissions from ships in EU ports, territorial waters and exclusive economic zones."
"But, indeed, it is also right to note that economic instruments can also be one of the best means of promoting good environmental performance providing that what they are doing there is giving incentives to go further than the regulations and actually move towards coming up with the best available technology."
"Another point about the objective of the communication is that it needs to be more explicitly aimed at reducing ship emissions of greenhouse gases in particular, looking especially at the impact on global warming."
"In relation to that, my report also asks the Commission to study how emissions from international maritime traffic could be included in Directive 2001/81/EC on national emissions ceilings when that is reviewed."
"Furthermore, my report reminds the Commission of the Sixth Environmental Action Programme, which requests that the Commission identify and undertake specific actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from marine shipping if no such action is agreed within the International Maritime Organisation by 2003."
"Since we can see that indeed no such action has been agreed within the IMO, I hope very much that the Commission will go ahead and initiate such actions without further delay."
"On sulphur emissions, it is appropriate to mention the Commission's proposal on the revision of Directive 99/32/EC relating to the sulphur content of marine fuels."
"The Commission proposed only to reduce sulphur emissions from seagoing ships in European sea areas by about 10% compared to the emission levels in 2000. But, in order to achieve the objectives of the Sixth Environmental Action Programme, emissions need to be reduced by at least 80%."
"The Commission must therefore be much more ambitious as regards the limit values it has proposed and, indeed, the sea areas to be covered by such limit values."
"My report therefore calls on the Commission to amend its proposal on the revision of Directive 99/32/EC in accordance with the European Parliament's first reading back in June, the aim of which was to reduce sulphur emissions by 80%."
"The Commission should also publish, before the end of 2004, proposals for EU-wide economic instruments aimed at reducing atmospheric emissions from ships."
"Finally, I would like to see the Member States, the Commission and the accession countries really putting pressure on those countries that have not yet ratified the Marpol Annex VI Agreement."
"Only five Member States have so far ratified that, and it seems appropriate at this moment to call for wider ratification among accession countries and others as a matter of urgency."
". Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Lucas, for her thorough, well-drafted report on the Commission’s ship emission strategy."
"Reducing ship emissions of air pollutants and greenhouse gases is a priority for the Commission, since we know that if measures are not taken, by 2020, ships in European Union seas will emit more air pollutants than all land-based sources combined."
"I therefore welcome most of the proposals in the Parliament’s draft resolution and I am pleased to say that the Commission is already working to take these forward."
"For example, on market-based instruments, we are examining a range of possible options."
"We held a useful stakeholder workshop in September 2003 to which parliamentarians were invited."
"On the issue of taking international ship emissions and EU national emission ceilings into account, we aim to launch a study soon to get a better perspective on how significant ship emissions are in individual Member States compared to land-based emissions."
"On the use of shoreside electricity and abatement technologies for air pollutants, we aim to use the same study to examine the costs and benefits and present positive examples."
"We shall feed the results of this work into the Clean Air for Europe Programme in 2005, and present proposals as appropriate."
"The question of ship sulphur is of course subject to codecision negotiations on the Commission’s marine fuel sulphur proposal."
"The proposal as drafted would deliver a significant 40% reduction in sulphur dioxide emissions targeted in asset-sensitive northern Europe."
"The Council’s progress on the proposal has been slower than we would have liked, but we have used the extra time to investigate the costs and benefits of the tighter sulphur limits proposed by the European Parliament in June 2003."
"In response more specifically to Mrs Lucas’ points, we share her concern about the slow progress in Council and we now hope that a common position will be agreed upon under the Irish presidency early in 2004."
"We have found that the 0.5% fuel sulphur limit proposed by the European Parliament would give rise to a price premium of approximately EUR 70 on every tonne of fuel."
"The environmental and human health benefits of the tighter sulphur limit would still outweigh the costs but the overall cost to the shipping industry would double to over EUR 2 billion."
"We must consider whether this is proportionate, bearing in mind the Commission’s commitment to promoting a modal shift from road to sea transport."
"Lastly, in direct response to a question raised by Mrs Lucas on the issue of ship greenhouse gas emissions, I am pleased to inform her that the International Maritime Organisation is due to adopt a strategy on this issue later this week."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Caroline Lucas for her report and also pay tribute to Heidi Hautala, upon whose original report this is built and who is now back in national politics in Finland."
"It highlights an issue that the citizens around the European Union are not even aware of, despite the fact that what the Commissioner says is absolutely true."
"If present trends continue, over half the pollution produced in the EU will be out at sea."
"It is true that the use of sea transport and inland waterways is the most environmentally friendly way of moving goods with the possible exception of a locomotive using electricity produced in a nuclear power station."
"It is important we see development of this particular type of transport."
"It is also true that we take the pressure off the roads."
"In my own country, lack of investment in roads means that one alternative could be the development of more coastal shipping, using ports, for example Scarborough and Whitby, in my region."
"However, there is a downside to the improvements that we have achieved on land and in fuel quality."
"If you fill up your car with the latest diesel at 10 parts per million, the downside of that is that the sulphur, which has been taken out of your diesel, remains in the bunker fuel which goes to the ships, and could be 26 000 parts per million."
"The Hautala report, at first reading, called for reductions to 1.5% in sensitive areas like the English Channel, the Baltic and the North Sea."
"It is very encouraging that the amendments that I put forward at first reading with regard to abatement technology were taken on board."
"P[amp]O Ferries, operating on the Dover-Calais route, have two identical ships operating, one with the abatement technology and one without."
"I hope the Commission will look at the initial results of those trials to see whether this technology is an alternative, more cost-effective way of achieving the aims that we want."
"I hope that these amendments will be taken more seriously by the Commission than some of the amendments that the Commissioner referred to, which call for even stricter levels that may not be cost-effective."
"We must bear in mind that if we reduce the sulphur levels of fuel for ships, we increase the emissions at the oil refinery where these sulphur levels are reduced."
"It is important that we act internationally, and not unilaterally, through the International Maritime Organisation and Marpol Annex VI."
"It is particularly disappointing that only five Member States have ratified Marpol Annex VI."
"Unless there have been developments which the Commissioner could refer to, I understand that the United Kingdom - which is always critical of other countries that do not ratify agreements such as Kyoto - has not ratified Marpol Annex VI."
"It is vitally important, when we look at emissions, to see where they take place."
"Emissions out in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean do not cause us problems on land."
"I am worried that some of the more ambitious suggestions in Mrs Lucas' report, for example an 80% cut, are out of proportion to the cost."
"But we now have a reasonably balanced report which we will be pleased to support in the vote in plenary tomorrow."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, as regards the subject of the Directive, one cannot disagree with the need to reduce atmospheric emissions of sulphur caused by maritime transport, which must agree to make the same efforts as land-based transport in this respect."
"Granite areas are particularly vulnerable to the phenomenon of acidification caused by these sulphur emissions and must therefore receive priority treatment."
"We must ensure, however, that we do not penalise our own shipowners by laying down standards that do not give sufficient consideration to the international nature of maritime transport."
"In this area, as in many others, the Union is only an intermediary."
"The relevant forum for pushing forward the regulations is in this case the IMO."
"That is why we are in favour of the measures to limit the maximum sulphur content of marine fuels used in the North Sea, the English Channel and the Baltic Sea as they are in line with the ceilings laid down by the IMO/Marpol Convention."
"There could also be extensions in this area if defined within the IMO framework."
"We do not believe, however, that the rapporteur’s additional proposals on the two other aspects of the Directive concerning the levels applicable to passenger ships and ships in ports are appropriate."
"They do not integrate the need to proceed gradually in these fields in order to take account of the heavy technical constraints imposed on our shipowners by these new guidelines, nor the need to develop these emission reductions within the framework of the IMO, which seems ready to act."
"On the contrary, they give rise to discrimination that could harm European interests."
". Mr President, as I said earlier, the Commission generally welcomes this report."
"However, there are two points which the Commission finds difficult to accept."
"First, I believe that a proposal to include polyaromatic hydrocarbons and heavy metals in the ship emissions strategy is perhaps premature."
"The monitoring of those pollutants is not currently mandatory in the European Union and no limit values are set."
"This is, however, considered in a new Commission proposal on ambient air quality."
"Secondly, the Commission is somewhat disappointed by the proposal that ships travelling to remote island regions should be exempt from emissions policies."
"In our view, clean air is a human right for all EU citizens, no matter where they live."
"My services recently received a letter from a woman in Crete who protested about the filthy, black smoke which ships belch out into her house in Heraklion harbour."
"The use of shoreside electricity in harbours, which Mrs Lucas, the rapporteur, is trying to promote, would dramatically reduce emissions of both air pollutants and noise, offering real improvements in the quality of life in port cities."
"Finally, I should like to stress that the essential plank of the Commission’s strategy is to work with Member States to promote global solutions through the International Maritime Organisation - the IMO."
"In that respect I should like to welcome, and indeed echo, Parliament’s call for EU Member States and acceding countries to ratify, as a matter of urgency, Annex VI of the IMO’s Air Pollution Convention, Marpol, and to submit proposals to the IMO for tighter global standards."
"In conclusion, I should like to say to Mr Goodwill that the Commission is very interested in his comparison between the two ferries travelling between Calais and Dover."
"This is a controlled experiment that should be of value to us all."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0410/2003) by Mrs Randzio-Plath, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 77/388/EEC as regards reduced rates of value added tax (COM(2003) 397 C5-0359/2003 2003/0169(CNS))."
". Mr President, on 23 July 2003, the Commission presented its proposal to simplify and rationalise the current situation with regard to reduced rates of VAT."
"This proposal, based on Article 93 of the Treaty, is intended to harmonise legislation to the extent that such harmonisation is necessary to ensure the smooth functioning of the internal market."
"Therefore, the Commission could not support modifications to its proposal that represented a step backwards."
"Having said that, I should like to make the following comments relating to the report presented by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"I agree with the rapporteur that it is not the time to make drastic changes."
"That is why the Commission did not propose any change to the level of the rates or the optional nature of reduced rates for Member States."
"On the other hand, it is necessary to rationalise the present situation."
"The limited extension of Annex H, proposed by the Commission, is intended to reduce the discrepancies between Member States rather than increase them, in line with the objectives of the internal market."
"The extremely difficult discussions in the Council on this issue have highlighted the radically divergent views on the question of VAT and the use of reduced rates."
"That reinforces my belief that the Commission's proposal is a balanced one."
"Any amendment which introduces new reduced rates in sectors where the standard rate is currently applied, such as for CDs, would be unacceptable, all the more so because the application of reduced rates could create competitive distortions."
"The addition to children's shoes and clothes is also unacceptable."
"Only three Member States are allowed to apply zero or super-reduced rates by temporary derogation."
"All other Member States are obliged to apply the standard rates."
"The rapporteur proposes to maintain the present derogations, but suggests establishing a new annex to the sixth directive, which would include all the supplies for which only one Member State has a specific derogation, thus permitting all Member States to apply a reduced rate to such supplies."
"I am not convinced that this solution is feasible."
"I want to stress that the Commission still favours a real phasing-out of these derogations."
"Politically speaking, they have always been considered transitory and due to disappear at a certain moment."
"Already in 1967, 1977, and again in 1992, at the time of the introduction of the internal market, the Council decided to authorise the Member States concerned to maintain these derogations."
"However, no absolute deadline was set by the Council."
"This does not mean, however, that they can remain indefinitely."
"That is why I am still convinced action is needed in view of the forthcoming enlargement, in order to give all Member States, both present and new, equal opportunities and to create a level playing field."
"I should like to remind you in this context that, for acceding countries, concrete deadlines have been laid down for all derogations."
"Finally, I should like to come back to you on the results of the last Ecofin meeting, which invited the Commission to extend Annex K for two further years."
"I have also received a letter from your rapporteur which urges the Commission to extend the duration of Annex K for at least six years, in order have a total period of application of ten years."
"I should like to take this opportunity to explain why I am convinced that an extension of Annex K is not a realistic solution."
"First, the Member States' and the Commission's reports have clearly shown that reduced rates are not a cost-effective way of creating employment."
"I have, however, already indicated to the Council that I was prepared to turn a blind eye to those Member States which, after the 1 January 2004, would continue to apply the reduced rates introduced within the framework of the experiment of reduced rates for labour-intensive services."
"This was to give the Council more time to find a solution based on the Commission's proposal."
"Such a situation could only continue for a short period of time: that is why I spoke of a period of six months."
"An extension would merely postpone, once again, a solution to this problem."
"Moreover, it could give rise to the expectation that the experiment would become permanent."
"A simple extension would, moreover, exclude other Member States, and in particular the new Member States, from being able to introduce reduced rates in the sectors concerned and would therefore be an added source of discrimination."
"In that context, I should like to remind Parliament that the Commission has already proposed to introduce, once and for all, housing and domestic care services into Annex H. That is part of the exercise of rationalisation of the present situation and takes into account the fact that reduced rates are already applied by a majority of Member States."
"To conclude, for the reasons I have outlined, the Commission is still convinced of the merits of its proposal and I should like to invite Members to reconsider very carefully their position on this issue."
". – Mr President, in view of the Commissioner’s comments, I would ask the House’s Bureau to consider once again whether it might be more important to allow the rapporteur to speak first, since we are part of the legislative process and the Commission is merely making a proposal."
"I think this is a fundamental problem relating to parliamentary democracy, and one that we must address."
"As regards the matter at hand, I would like to begin with the last point."
"This House has lobbied in favour of a reduced rate of VAT for labour-intensive services."
"Regrettably, this was not adopted as mandatory by the Finance Council but was merely introduced as an option, and some Member States have put it into practice."
"However, it has been implemented very tentatively, so we have very little experience on which to assess the impact of this reduced rate of VAT on work and the black economy."
"That means that after two years, we did not even know whether this provision would be extended for a year, and we are aware that many companies were not prepared to take the risk and therefore did not participate in the experiment at all."
"So let me ask you this, Commissioner. If we take a simple service industry such as hairdressing, where we can see that there has been an increase in the number of employees and self-employed persons – thousands in Spain, and hundreds in Luxembourg and Belgium – should we not take this as a sign that what has been happening is something that we really must evaluate?"
"Moreover, do you think it is right that after such a short time and based on such poor analyses by the Member States, you are nonetheless concluding that the reduced rates of VAT really have had no impact on employment, especially given that in some sectors, the figures tell a very different story from the ones in your reports?"
"That is why I urge you to extend this provision – if not for ten years, then for six years, not six months – for otherwise, there will be no legal certainty for the companies involved and we will also be unable to determine whether there has been any change in behaviour on the part of the clients and the businesspeople themselves."
"Let me turn now to the fundamental principle underlying your proposal."
"I am very sympathetic to the idea of a systematic approach to reduced rates of VAT, but I must ask you this, Commissioner: the whole point is to move towards a definitive VAT system based on the principle of taxation in the country of origin, so that we can introduce this and finally establish genuine and systematic clarity."
"We still have a long way to go before we reach that point."
"Indeed, we really cannot see how any progress on the issue of VAT is to be achieved at all."
"Therefore as one of the MEPs concerned, the question in my mind is this, and I put it to you on behalf of my committee and on behalf of this plenary as well: Do we need rules in areas where competition is not distorted and where the functioning of the internal market is not affected?"
"You have mentioned children’s clothing and children’s shoes, but you yourself are listing children’s car seats for a reduced rate of VAT."
"I really do not understand the argument any longer, Commissioner."
"I also think it is very important to make it clear that in the European Union, it must be permissible to promote culture using different instruments and approaches."
"If some Member States choose to go down the tax rate route and others prefer direct subsidies, we must be saying to ourselves that this House is committed to the principle of subsidiarity, and only to the Community principle where there are actual distortions of competition."
"I cannot see that in the areas identified in our report, the functioning of the internal market is in any way impeded, and I also cannot see that consumers are being invited to cross borders in order to purchase products or services or distort the market."
"That really is not the case."
"That is why I believe that we are not yet at the stage of being able to implement your ideas."
"I ask you, too, to show understanding for citizens who want to treat the internal market as their home market."
"I therefore take the view that tax legislation must take account of these citizens’ interests."
"I think our report offers a promising approach for compromises that serve the interests of a well-functioning EU home market."
"– Mr President, the Commission has recently developed the bad habit of confronting us with proposals, among other things, on the pretext that they dismantle distortions of competition in the internal market and rationalise the VAT system."
"Unfortunately, they are counterproductive in the current climate."
"The proposal before us is a case in point. Our rapporteur, Mrs Randzio-Plath, has displayed moderation and realism in preparing her report, and I pay tribute to that."
"She has also demonstrated these qualities again very comprehensively in her speech."
"We have generally followed her line because she wishes to make it possible for the Member States to retain their reduced rates of VAT."
"This applies especially to the reduced rates for labour-intensive services, such as hairdressers and others, which were introduced in 2000. It would be wrong, in the current economic climate, to trigger higher inflation by substantially increasing VAT rates."
"In my country, for example, this increase would entail a leap in the VAT rate from 6% to 15% for the labour-intensive services listed in Annex K. This special provision was intended to create jobs and reduce ‘black’ working."
"It expires at the end of the year and is not renewed in the Commission’s proposal, for according to the Commission’s report, its dual objective – which I have mentioned – has not been achieved."
"However, we do not share this view of things, and nor – as Mrs Randzio-Plath has explained – do the many other people whom we have consulted."
"It is also doubtful whether an experiment conducted over just three years can be described as a failure after such a short time."
"It would be premature to draw conclusions at this stage."
"Unfortunately, I see no good will on the part of the Commission, and our committee has incorporated most of the services listed in Annex K into the expanded Annex Ha so that the reduced rates will continue to apply if the Member State so wishes."
"On behalf of my group, we have tabled amendments enabling the Member States to continue the experiment at least until the new directive enters into force."
"If these two amendments are rejected, the provisions of Annex K – Mr President, I still have the two minutes allocated to Mr Karas, who is not here – will expire at the end of the month."
"The Member States would then have to increase the rates before being allowed to reduce them again in a matter of months when the new directive comes into force, when many of these services will be eligible for the reduced rates."
"The situation would become quite farcical."
"The third amendment, which I have tabled on behalf of my group, would permit the Member States to retain the parking rates of at least 12% for a further 15 years, so that the changeover would not have to take place abruptly over night, which I think is reasonable."
"Despite what the Commissioner would have us believe, nor is there any need to follow his line in the interests of enlargement."
"I hope that the Commission will see sense and support our very reasonable proposal, and if it does not do so, I trust that the Council of Ministers will vote unanimously to do so."
"– Mr President, are taxes only a means of generating income for the treasury, or can they also be used to serve other purposes of government policy?"
"This is, in actual fact, the underlying core question on which I, with others, and Commissioner Bolkestein fundamentally differ."
"What is more, it looks like he is increasingly on his own in his puritan rejection of the use of the instrument of reduced rates of VAT, which is still being deployed as an experiment, to promote employment."
"At the time of the autumn 1997 employment summit in Luxembourg, the idea of reduced rates of VAT was mooted here in this Parliament."
"This idea already met with resistance then from the Directorate-General dealing with tax cases and from a number of Member States."
"Despite this, it was decided to carry out, in a very select number of labour-intensive sectors, an experiment which would definitely not result in any cross-border distortion of competition."
"It was in these that the Member States were allowed to apply the reduced rates of VAT."
"However, it had to remain an experiment, limited in time."
"People could not agree beforehand on clear criteria whereby the experiment could be assessed."
"This evaluation was also done too late, the experiment had to be extended first, and the evaluation was left up to the Member States and badly coordinated."
"In the Netherlands, the first evaluation report met with strong criticism, and a re-appraisal done at the request of parliament yielded many positive results."
"I do not have the time to enter into the detail of this, but I think that you are familiar with those reports."
"I have noted nonetheless that, eventually, you only adopted the negative tenor of those evaluations and have written the experiment off with what amounts to only the prejudices that preceded the experiment. There was wide indignation in the Netherlands about the simple termination of an experiment that had been found to be effective for hairdressers, cobblers, decorators and bicycle repairers – and this in times of recession, no less."
"After all, you do not need economic models in order to figure out for yourself that the re-introduction of the high rates will cost a very large number of jobs."
"I am delighted that this indignation is widely shared in this House as well."
"Moreover, the following logic is applied here: if there are no cross-border or competitively distorting effects, why would the EU prohibit Member States from applying the VAT rates that they think are sound?"
"Why would governments and parliaments not be allowed to weigh up for themselves the goals to collect as many taxes as possible or to promote employment and make moonlighting legal?"
"The Council of Ecofin Ministers has now also clearly and unanimously announced its wish to extend the experiment and to remove the current uncertainty for those involved."
"In my view, your response in this matter to ignore this request and only to promise to tolerate the illegal continuation of the experiment does not show much respect for European rules and for the way they are implemented in the Member States."
"'Tolerance' – surely that can only be intended as a joke on the part of the Commission as Guardian of the Treaty?"
"I should therefore like to urge the Commissioner once again to make a definite, formal proposal to extend the experiment, and to do so before the end of this month, and definitely before 1 January 2004."
"After all, it is quite clear that there is wide support here in the European Parliament to include the experiment of Annex K in a structural insertion of these labour-intensive services in Annex H of the Directive."
"It is also clear, though, that this will not be done before 1 January."
"The sooner the structural facility becomes operational, the better."
"This will receive our unqualified support and as long as that is not the case, the experiment must remain in force on a formal footing."
"– Mr President, a three-year experiment for the application of reduced rates of VAT on labour-intensive services is short, too short, in my view, and certainly too short if we factor in the economic climate that has seen more downward than upward movement over the past three years."
"You too, Commissioner, know that in those circumstances, it is difficult to establish the longer-term effect of reduced VAT on employment."
"Added to this is the fact that we are bombarding each other with various research reports that make conflicting claims about the impact on employment."
"In short, it is high time that the Commission adopted the Council’s unanimous verdict and continued the experiment."
"Mr Bolkestein, surely you will have to agree with me that in times of virtual economic stagnation it is unwise to increase VAT?"
"– Mr President, we are very much in favour of extending to all Member States the derogations granted to some as regards reduced rates of VAT, for example for restaurant services."
"We are no less in favour of continuing to maintain reduced rates of VAT for labour-intensive services, which began as an experiment in 1999."
"In its report evaluating the experience, the Commission was sceptical, particularly with regard to the effects on employment."
"Finally, it proposes certain continuations, which is positive, but it includes them in a broader plan aimed at eventually doing away with the derogations, which gives rise to pointless discussions."
"As elected representatives, we see the benefits of these VAT reductions on the ground."
"The report provided by France also emphasised this."
"We therefore believe that they must continue or at least, in the meantime, that the experiment must be continued for several years along the path demonstrated by the Ecofin Council of 25 November, for example for six years, as our rapporteur has just proposed."
"It also seems to us that in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity this subject should, without discussion, be the competence of the states alone."
"I will supplement these assessments in my explanation of vote."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on the work she has done on this report."
"It is a very good one and, like the rest of my Group, I will be supporting it tomorrow."
"I should particularly like to thank Mrs Randzio-Plath for including a number of amendments which meet the concerns of the charity sector in the European Union and in the United Kingdom as well."
"Charities face a lot of difficulties caused by the VAT system and the amendments relating to charities in the report, and indeed tabled by the PPE-DE Group, are essential in trying to mitigate those problems."
"There are other problems in relation to irrecoverable VAT which, sadly, we cannot solve with this report but are also very important."
"These issues are important to charities across the United Kingdom including places like Chipping Barnet, in my own constituency."
"It is also vital that Parliament adopts the amendment to ensure that Member States can allow a reduced rate for repairs to listed buildings."
"That is crucial, particularly for churches in the United Kingdom, many of which are listed."
"In many cases, repairs to these churches are phenomenally expensive for parishioners."
"These churches are not just of religious significance: they also have a social and cultural purpose within the community."
"The burden of paying a full rate of VAT makes keeping them in repair that much more difficult, so I very much hope that Parliament and Council support reduced rates of VAT for those kinds of repairs to historical listed buildings."
"It is also vital to preserve the existing zero rates in Member States."
"There is no reason why they should not be able to decide for themselves whether to levy the zero rates."
"I would strongly defend the United Kingdom's zero rates, particularly in relation to children's clothes and shoes."
"I see no reason why these should be abolished."
"They perform an important social function and my British Conservative colleagues and I steadfastly defend those zero rates and will continue to defend them."
". Mr President, I should first like to say something about Annex K, on which a number of speakers have voiced their opinion."
"This Council had established these rules, including those in the directive for evaluation - about Annex K. The Council - and not the Commission - also established that the experiment should run for three years."
"In fact, it lasted four years, since the Commission wanted more time to analyse the results."
"I want to stress that the Council stipulated what the rules should be."
"The Commission has not made a proposal to continue Annex K. It does so because it is not effective."
"The reports that the Commission has received from most Member States - including the Netherlands and France, where opinions differ - indicate that there is no noticeable positive effect on employment."
"The reason is quite simple: in too few cases is the decrease in taxation passed on to the consumer."
"In fact, I quote my wife, who said that she had never witnessed a reduction in hairdressers' prices."
"I do not know whether Mrs Lulling agrees with this, or whether she has witnessed a decrease in hairdressers' prices."
"My wife has not, and the reason is that the hairdressers pocket the decrease in taxation and, therefore, Annex K amounts to a subsidy for hairdressers."
"I have nothing against hairdressers, but why should we subsidise them?"
"It has no positive effect on employment, and if you want to stimulate employment, it is better to reduce the social on-costs of labour for the same amount of money."
"One will create 52% more employment by reducing the on-costs of labour rather than reducing VAT."
"The Commission sees no reason why it should make a proposal, and that is exactly why unanimity in the Council does not work."
"It only works if there is a proposal, and then it is overturned."
"In this case, there will be no proposal and, therefore, unanimity in the Council cannot overturn what is not there."
"The same situation happened previously in the case of the tax-free shops at airports."
"There was no proposal and, therefore, there was nothing to overturn."
"Mrs van den Burg said that I do not respect the rules of the European Union."
"I should like to know which rule I do not respect."
"I am scrupulous in respecting all the rules of the European Union."
"It is the Council which established this entire experiment and set a three-year period."
"The Commission made it four years."
"It is the Council, and not the Commission, which said this was in order to increase employment."
"The whole idea therefore originates from the Council."
"It is an experiment, and experiments are supposed to be discontinued if they do not work."
"This is why they are experiments."
"Therefore, why should the Commission propose an extension of Annex K if it has not worked?"
"I fail to see, Mrs van den Burg, where this Commissioner is not obeying or following the rules."
"On the wider issue of reduced rates, the standard rate is the normal rate."
"It is around 20% in most countries."
"That is the standard rate."
"All derogations must be construed strictly and, where the internal market and distortions of the markets are concerned, one should be extremely strict."
"Mrs Randzio-Plath mentioned children's shoes, which are zero-rated in the United Kingdom and Ireland."
"But if you look at the figures, it is clear that there again there are no noticeable benefits to the consumer."
"The differences between the prices in the United Kingdom and the prices on the Continent are the same whether the high rate or the low rate is applied."
"That proves that it is the manufacturer or the trader that is subsidised, but certainly not the end-consumer."
"As regards CDs, they are by their very nature easily transportable and, therefore, if the rates differ, there is a clear inevitability of a distortion of the internal market."
"At the moment, no Member State applies the reduced rates to CDs and, therefore, if we did, it would again be a step backward."
"That is why I now return to Annex K. I have said to the Council of Ministers that the Commission would not press charges or start infringement proceedings against those Member States that would continue to apply Annex K as if it were still in force - which it will not be."
"But I recognise that Member States may need a certain time to organise their affairs and that is why I said for the first six months of next year I will not start any infringement proceedings."
"But Annex K will no longer exist."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, you have not provided an adequate explanation of why you are submitting this proposal at the present time."
"Nor have you provided an adequate explanation of why you are unwilling to allow this experiment with reduced rates of VAT for labour-intensive services to continue, even though you must realise that the analysis of the findings is inaccurate, given that the Member States’ reports are so general that they did not stand up to scientific scrutiny."
"The Commission is obliged to supply Parliament with a well-founded opinion, not just a general opinion containing snippets of information simply hinting that no tangible impact on reducing ‘black’ work can be identified."
"Commissioner, there are economic research institutes which can undertake this study on your behalf."
"There are social science institutes that can do so too."
"This Parliament – and, indeed, you yourself – must have a sound basis for a decision, and you are well aware that a six-month period is really not long enough to carry out studies of any kind."
"With this in mind, I urge you to set this experiment, which no one has taken seriously, on a serious footing at last and let it run for the next six years."
"Mr President, in reply to the last remark by Mrs Randzio-Plath for which I thank her I would like to say that the basis for the Commission’s decisions is the reports that are produced by Member States; these reports have not been drafted by the Commission."
"According to the rules that were established four years ago, we rely on these reports."
"I do not see why Mrs Randzio-Plath needs any further evidence."
"I can send her the reports if she likes, but they are the basis of the Commission’s decisions."
"I am not responsible for the way in which Member States draft their reports - that is their business."
"I use them as they come in."
"The Commission has looked at them and has seen that there is insufficient evidence."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"The next item is the presentation of the Court of Auditors' annual report."
"I am pleased to welcome the President of the Court, our former colleague Mr Fabra Vallés, back to the House."
". Mr President, I am both proud and honoured to be back in the House."
"As usual, only the early birds are present."
"Nonetheless, there is an abiding memory of the best moments of all the meetings held and the hours of work undertaken together."
"Mr President, honourable Members, Budget Commissioner, colleagues from the Court of Auditors, ladies and gentlemen, on 17 November of this year I presented the annual report for the financial year 2002 prepared by the European Court of Auditors to the Committee on Budgetary Control at its meeting."
"I was also able to take the opportunity of providing the committee with a detailed account of the observations and conclusions contained in the report."
"Today, I should like to draw the attention of the House to the conclusions concerning three areas, namely the Statement of Assurance, budgetary management, and the process of reforming the Commission."
"The first chapter of the Court of Auditors’ report contains the Statement of Assurance, known as the DAS. The latter will be published in the Official Journal together with the Community’s consolidated accounts."
"This is sound practice and should provide greater transparency."
"The Court is adjusting its DAS methodology to bring it into line with the process of reforming the Commission’s financial control."
"The intention is to provide more accurate information about the areas where problems arise and about their causes. This is in response to requests by Parliament and the Council."
"To this end, our observations and conclusions centred on four main elements."
"Firstly, they were based on the quality of control systems in the Community institutions and Member States."
"Our assessment is based on several indicators."
"We also examined the extent to which the Commission followed up our earlier observations."
"The second element entailed examination of a sample of transactions and payments for each area of expenditure."
"Thirdly, the annual declarations of the Directors-General at the Commission were considered. Work undertaken by other auditors constituted the fourth element."
"Further to this audit, it is the Court’s opinion that the annual accounts for 2002 submitted by the Commission were drawn up in accordance with the Financial Regulation."
"The accounts accurately reflect the revenue and expenditure for the financial year, and the financial position of the Community."
"Nonetheless, as in previous years, the Court expressed a number of reservations regarding the Commission’s accounting system."
"It should be noted that last December the Commission adopted an action plan to modernise its accounting system."
"This plan is due to come into force in 2005."
"I would urge caution concerning the timetable. The scope and quality of the necessary reforms should not be jeopardised by undue haste."
"With regard to revenue, commitments, administrative expenditure and pre-accession aid, the Court believes that the transactions are legal and regular. In the latter case, however, controls must be strengthened."
"As concerns the EAGGF-Guarantee, we believe the number of faulty transactions is still excessive."
"Errors occur most frequently at the level of the final beneficiaries of aid."
"A higher risk was noted for measures not subject to the Integrated Administrative and Control System. They include amongst others aid for production, rural development and export refunds."
"The Court noted an improvement in the controls on structural measures. This was the case at Commission level in particular."
"Nevertheless, the errors are similar to those of previous years and mostly concern the management undertaken by Member States."
"As you will appreciate, ladies and gentlemen, the Court’s report is somewhat mixed."
"If improvement is to be effected, it will be necessary to continue strengthening the management systems of the Commission and of the Member States."
"This is the for attaining a totally satisfactory Statement of Assurance in the future."
"I shall now turn to the observations on budgetary management in Chapter 2 of the report."
"Firstly, a swift change in the structure of revenue is apparent."
"Traditional own resources such as customs and agricultural duties have fallen by 23% compared with the previous year. At the same time, revenue from GNP has risen by 32%."
"Secondly, it was noted that the budgetary surplus had fallen appreciably."
"The surplus has dropped from EUR 15 000 million to EUR 7 000 million."
"Nonetheless, the figure remains high. It is indicative of systematic problems that must be rectified."
"One of the main reasons for the surplus is the difference between planned and actual expenditure."
"For the financial year 2002 the Member States overestimated expenditure in the Structural Funds by almost EUR 5 000 million."
"Consequently, the financial year 2002 closed with more than EUR 66 000 million in outstanding commitments known in French as the RAL. This was almost EUR 10 000 million more than in the previous year."
"The Commission should adopt a more active policy in this regard. It should undertake budgetary adjustments to maintain the balance between anticipated revenue and expenditure."
"On a positive note, I should like to mention the general improvement in the rate of payments."
"One notable exception to this is the SAPARD programme for rural development in applicant countries."
"Only 2% of the available funds have been transferred to the final beneficiaries, although this programme has been in operation for three years."
"Finally, I should like to point out that the Commission has implemented the recommendations of the Court and improved its report on budgetary and financial management."
"This report will prove very useful throughout the whole budgetary cycle."
"I shall now turn to the budgetary management of the European Development Funds. The Commission has accelerated the decision-making process for the financing of programmes."
"Nonetheless, the rate of implementation is still low."
"At the close of the financial year 2002, the available balance amounted to almost EUR 3 000 million. Outstanding commitments awaiting settlement amounted to more than EUR 8 000 million."
"The Court is of the opinion that management would improve if the EDF were integrated into the general budget."
"Allow me to move on now to the state of the administrative reform."
"The Court has paid particular attention to analysing the degree to which internal control standards have been put in place."
"The assessment is along the lines of ‘could do better’."
"Despite the progress made in all Directorates-General, standards had not reached the required level by the end of 2002."
"Priority must be given to attaining these levels without delay."
"One of the main difficulties facing the Commission is the control of measures managed jointly with the Member States. This mostly concerns EAGGF-Guarantee and Structural Funds."
"Article 274 of the Treaty does confer full responsibility for management on the Commission. In practice, however, the Commission is limited by activities of the national administrations."
"Stronger control by the Member States is needed to improve management of European funds. The activity management plans for the Directorates-General have improved."
"Nonetheless, it is recommended that the objectives be specified more clearly."
"It would also be advisable to introduce indicators to allow results to be measured and compared."
"Activity reports and statements by the Directors-General have also improved."
"Most of the measures detailed by the Commission following the summary of the reports for the financial year 2001 have been implemented."
"The Commission has improved its procedure for drafting reports in line with the recommendations made by the Court."
"Nonetheless, Directors-General should provide more detail concerning the content of their reservations about the way control systems work. They should also provide a clearer description of the shortcomings noted."
"Lastly, the Court recommends updating the White Paper adopted in 2000 in the interests of greater transparency and in order to facilitate following up the reform."
"The Court also recommends revising the timetable set."
"To conclude, reform did make progress in 2002."
"The Commission proved capable of diligently implementing the new provisions of the Financial Regulation. Progress was noted in all areas."
"Much remains to be done, however, as the Commission itself recognises."
"In my view, the content of the Commission’s reform plan is adequate, and the plan itself consistent. It will no doubt require adjustment and amendment."
"At this juncture, however, it would be a mistake to reject it or to launch into reforming the reform. The latter would be a risky venture."
"The plan does actually contain appropriate measures to improve management and control. A sustained effort is now needed to ensure these measures are applied with a will across all the Commission’s services."
"This is the Commission’s main responsibility. The same applies to all the institutions."
"Simply launching plans is not enough. It is essential to ensure that the plans are implemented."
"I believe that is one of the lessons to be learnt from the Eurostat affair."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I trust you will allow me to depart briefly from the agenda just before I finish."
"I would like to say a few words on the Intergovernmental Conference and the draft European Constitution."
"The Court of Auditors has expressed concern because it is not mentioned by name as part of the institutional framework, alongside Parliament, the Council, the Commission and the Court of Justice."
"The Court of Auditors is the body charged with external control of European public finances. It is not acceptable for it to be placed at a lower level than the institutions it is required to control."
"It must not be placed in a position where it is dependent on them either. If that were to happen, the Court would be deprived of the independence it needs in order to discharge its obligations."
"All those involved in the Intergovernmental Conference have been made aware of this concern. I trust it will be taken into account."
"Thank you for your attention, ladies and gentlemen."
". Mr President, Mr President of the Court of Auditors, Members of the Court of Auditors, ladies and gentlemen, the Court has been unstinting in its support for the Commission’s reforms, and acknowledges in its report for 2002 that these have made good progress."
"Not only for that, but also for the depth and breadth of their work, as also for their unambiguous recommendations for specific further action, many thanks are owed to all the members of the Court of Auditors."
"As regards the Budget, there is no doubt that the highlights of 2002 were the recasting of the Financial Regulation and the conclusion of the financial negotiations with the candidate countries, whereby enlargement was put on a sound financial footing."
"These two things had been targets that I had set for myself personally and for the Commission."
"It is because we are on the very threshold of enlargement that I am very glad that the Court of Auditors was able to state, in its annual report for 2002, that no mistakes of any significance had been made in the handling of pre-accession aid."
"The effort made not only by the candidate countries but also by all the European institutions to support more widespread and functioning financial controls in the enlargement states are bearing fruit."
"This is made all the more important by the fact that the implementation of pre-accession aid is at last gathering pace, and, from next year onwards, all ten states will participate in all the aid programmes funded from the European Budget."
"The Court of Auditors has the function of checking the books of the European Union – that is to say, of examining the way it keeps its accounts."
"It is our accountant."
"It has again given a favourable opinion of the correctness of the books: the accounts of the European Union truthfully reflect the receipts and outgoings in 2002, and the balance sheet presents a faithful picture of the European Union’s assets at year end."
"I might add that the outgoings for 2002 amount to EUR 85 billion, rather than the EUR 100 billion that is always quoted in the media, and not only for a Budget Commissioner is the difference between EUR 100 billion and EUR 85 billion something more than marginal."
"The Court of Auditors’ comments on the balance sheet for 2002 also show that the European Union’s entitlements and obligations are not set in stone, but vary according to the tasks – and the example I would give is our share in Galileo, which represents a challenge not only to technology, but also in terms of auditing and of the balance sheet."
"The Court of Auditors also issues a positive Statement of Assurance in respect of the receipts, examining both the levying of customs dutiesand the computation of the European Union’s VAT receipts and of the national contributions based on gross national income, which – the various deceptive rumours in connection with the Eurostat affair notwithstanding – is declared by the Member States rather than by Eurostat."
"Although the Court attests the reliability of the commitment appropriations and of the administrative expenditure, it does not do this in respect of the other items of expenditure."
"This clearly shows where new priorities in improving financial management both at Commission level and in the Member States are to be found."
"I emphasise that the Court acknowledges the Commission’s tighter controls and stresses the problems involved in joint management, which applies to 80% of the expenditure."
"The agricultural budget required the Court to audit 64 paying agencies, in the course of which it discovered three where errors cropped up so frequently that they could not be certified as reliable."
"One of them was in Portugal and the other two are in Germany, one being in Baden-Württemberg and the other in Bavaria."
"The Court again had criticisms to make of the Structural Funds, in that, whilst the funds are not expected to be used to their fullest extent, the surplus is not to be repaid to the Member States next year, but in a supplementary budget in the current year."
"This year, we have taken on board this criticism and submitted a supplementary budget totalling EUR 5 billion, and this House will probably adopt it on 18 December."
"The fact that there are discussions every year about how the EU’s finances are managed might give the impression that no progress is being made."
"It is the Court of Auditors, though, that stresses the fundamental and comprehensive nature of the Commission’s financial reforms, which is precisely what the Court had asked for."
"At the heart of them is the adaptation of financial management to the realities of a budget that will, over the coming year, come close to reaching the EUR 100 billion mark and will comprise over a million payment transactions every year, spread over 35 Directorates-General and 15 – soon to be 25 – Member States, and administered by international and non-governmental organisations."
"Responsibility for the ex-ante control of financial transactions has been transferred to the operational departments, and any attempt to reverse this – even the demand that ex-ante checks be carried out by the accounting officer – takes no account of what modern public-sector financial management requires."
"Checks are no less thorough since the end of centralised budget control, which was in any case only capable of carrying out limited spot checks."
"In every one of the directorates-general, the new financial circuits, which must involve trained financial experts in every service and ex-post controls by the auditors, all reinforced by the addition of human resources in this area and by a hitherto unseen level of expenditure on initial and in-service training in auditing, make it possible for every Director-General to give the Commission a regular account of how the finances are managed."
"If one also takes into account the audits by the internal audit service, the regular evaluation of the examination of the control systems by the Central Financial Service, the investigations by OLAF and, of course, the ever wider-ranging audits by the Commission’s external auditors, then it becomes apparent that an extensive structure is in place for monitoring the European budget, to which one must add the checks carried out in the Member States in respect of 80% of the Budget."
"According to the Member States, 16 000 persons are employed in auditing the agricultural funds and 6 700 on the Structural Funds."
"I agree with the Court of Auditors that this is where there needs to be greater convergence if these controls are to be made efficient."
"Controls require rules, for which the conditions were created when the new and fully recast Financial Regulation entered into force on 1 January."
"What lies behind this is shown by the example of the financial support given to institutions, which, although a central instrument of Community expenditure, were subject to no rules whatever prior to the Commission’s first Vademecum in 1999."
"There are now detailed and binding rules for them in the new Financial Regulation and in secondary legislation, and the new legal acts required for these grants will shortly be adopted by this House."
"In addition, the reforms do, of course, constitute a process in which the Commission is constantly learning by practical experience and from what the Court of Auditors and Parliament recommend."
"So it is that further substantial improvements have been made to the procedure for drawing up the reports of the Directors-General, in particular for the sake of improved comparability."
"The President of the Court of Auditors has just mentioned the implementation of the internal audit standards, which he quite rightly described as being central and crucial elements in reform, with which we are again currently pressing ahead with some vigour, especially as regards the rotation of officials in sensitive positions, and, where this has not yet been done, precise deadlines have been laid down for it."
"We are learning our lessons from the Eurostat experience, primarily, of course, within Eurostat itself, but also as regards OLAF and the relationship between the Directorates-General and the political level."
"What happened within Eurostat in the years leading up to 1999 is not evidence of the reform’s failure – on the contrary, it is evidence of how necessary the reform was and of the fact that the steps we took were the right ones."
"Where the existence of loopholes has become apparent, we are closing them."
"Let me again stress how far-reaching these reforms are."
"What they in fact do is introduce, at last, into every area of the management of this international authority, uniform rules and uniform standards."
"That amounts to a cultural revolution, in that the various cultures were previously bound by very diverse rules, most of which were not written down."
"In future, if I may quote Mr Fabra Vallés there will be no more ‘principalities’, but, instead, one administration, which must – and will – in every sphere, comply with demanding standards and be held to account for the way in which they do so."
"The presentation of the Court’s annual report marks the start of the budget discharge procedure."
"The Commission looks forward to good cooperation with the rapporteur, Mr Bayona de Perogordo, and with the Committee on Budgetary Control as a whole."
"Any public budget largely devoted to the granting of subsidies, and that in what are now 15 Member States and will shortly be 25, will always have to defend its financial interests tooth and nail."
"The Commission has committed itself to the objective of doing so; far from being discouraged by setbacks, we will redouble our efforts, and the Court of Auditors gives us fresh courage as we pursue this goal."
"– Mr President, Mr President of the European Court of Auditors, Commissioner, Members of the Court of Auditors, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank you, Mr Fabra Vallés, for your presentation of the Court’s annual report for 2002, and all the more for your having already presented this important document to the Committee on Budgetary Control a fortnight ago."
"Today, we can shed further light on certain aspects of the annual report and discuss them with you, and this begins our work on the discharge for 2002, on the foundation of the Court’s report."
"In considering the points that you yourself have raised, let me begin with the Statement of Assurance."
"You have described how the Court has refined its auditing techniques still further, and this is something we very much welcome."
"The fact remains, however, that, because of an error rate that may well have differed from the preceding year’s, but was still too high, no positive statement of assurance can be issued in respect of 2002 as a whole."
"In the areas of agriculture, the Structural Funds, internal and external policies, only the receipts have been certified, and you give a clean bill of health only to the administrative expenditure."
"So little was spent on pre-accession aid for the candidate countries that a positive statement of assurance does not say very much."
"Overall, I would say that this is an utterly deplorable result in terms of the quality of the Commission’s implementation of the Budget, even if much of the blame lies with the Member States."
"These aspects will certainly be reflected in Parliament’s discharge report."
"Secondly, it is cause for gratitude that the Court has done what Parliament wanted and introduced a chapter summarising the implementation of the Budget and containing an overall view of the receipts and outgoings."
"Why, we ask ourselves, are there still such large surpluses in the 2002 Budget?"
"They may well be only half the size of the previous year’s, but I regard EUR 7 billion in unused money not as a saving, but as a deficit resulting from action not taken and hence as a failure to meet the targets set."
"If, year after year, in the measures managed jointly by them and the Commission, the Member States over-estimate the funds required, the Commission has to be even more determined in taking counter-measures, something that it already does, albeit to an insufficient extent, but it could, for example, submit supplementary and amending budgets."
"The Court’s forthright advocacy of the idea that the administration of the Development Fund should be improved by including it in the general budget is precisely what Parliament has been demanding for some years now."
"Thirdly, Mr Fabra Vallés, you spoke about the administrative reform and the internal audits, in which, in the light of the Eurostat affair, this House takes a particular interest."
"What you say sounds very positive but we doubt whether these reforms are really having any effect."
"Take the slogan ‘decentralising the way the Commission is run’, which, as such, I welcome."
"The activity reports and the guarantees given by the individual Directors-General are an improvement, but should they not also be signed by the office responsible for finance and personnel?"
"Should there not be a clearer dividing line between the accountant and the authorising officer?"
"Should the internal auditor, through his reports, also be in close contact with the internal audit service?"
"The Court has devoted attention to the audit reports, but will it also cast an eye over administrative processes as a whole?"
"The Committee on Budgetary Control will have other questions to ask about reform of the accounting and book-keeping system."
"Over the next few weeks, our committee will have a lot of work to do in preparing the discharge for 2002."
"We are very grateful to you for supplying the documentation and information that we need and for the openness with which you and all the members of the Court of Auditors have cooperated with us."
"Let me just briefly say something in response to your closing remarks about the Intergovernmental Conference."
"You will be aware that Parliament – and, in this instance, the Committee on Budgetary Control, too – believes it to be of the utmost importance that the Court of Auditors should have equal status with the other institutions."
"That is why you will see from the documents that, as rapporteur, I appealed to the Intergovernmental Conference to add the Court of Auditors to the list of the various institutions, thus guaranteeing the Court its proper place and ensuring that the public can see that we have the instruments and agencies to watch over how the taxpayers’ money is handled."
"– Mr President, let me, on behalf of my group, thank the President of the Court of Auditors for his report, although what I have to say I will address to the Commission."
"After nine years as an MEP – four and a half of them on the Committee on Budgetary Control – one imagines that there are no more particularly enlightening experiences in store."
"My belief that this is the case was disproved this week;"
"I had a moment of clarity exactly two days ago when, in the Committee on Budgetary Control, a Commissioner who was already under pressure was faced with a situation in which the Commission apparatus had not yet supplied answers to four questions by a fellow-Member relating to the Eurostat case, even though those answers had been due since mid-October."
"What I found illuminating about this was that, for the first time and for just five minutes, I found myself obliged to appreciate what an enormous achievement this was on the part of the Commission’s apparatus and what this says about the depth of its loyalty to a Commissioner."
"I am bringing my political problem not to you personally, Commissioner, but, so to speak, to the Commission as a college of Commissioners."
"I have started to feel tempted to stop directing political criticism at the Commissioners and to start feeling nothing but pity for them."
"If, in the months in office remaining to them, they cannot manage to give their apparatus some sort of structure, so that their officials go in fear of their masters and acquire a minimal amount of loyalty to their political leaders, then we are in for lot of fun and games in the coming months."
"If the present Commission does not at last get that message, then heaven help their successors in the next one."
"If there is no change in this state of affairs, then nor will there be even the slightest change in the public’s perception of the Commission; it will, if anything get even worse."
"The time has come for this to be said out loud, and I believe it is necessary that it should be."
"– Mr President, I too should like to express my gratitude to the Court of Auditors for drawing up the annual report, which I have, as always, read with great interest."
"We are now on the eve of new elections, and I can only look back on the debate which we had here four or five years ago when we were in the heat of the discussion about the financial difficulties that the Santer Commission was having at the time."
"I promised the electorate then that financial control in the new European Commission would be considerably enhanced."
"We are now four years down the line and what strikes us most of all is that – even after nine years of working on Statements of Assurance – the Court of Auditors has still not managed to issue a positive Statement of Assurance."
"That is quite clear to every citizen in Europe and the lack of success in this respect is very regrettable."
"This is offset by the fact that the Court of Auditors has concluded that the Commission is on the right track and if I may quote the President: 'The reform plan is concrete and coherent and must be supported'."
"Things are therefore moving in the right direction, but the big question is that of how much longer we can wait – particularly as enlargement is imminent and it will be extremely difficult to tell those countries what to do if we ourselves are not even able to implement this in our old Member States."
"That is, in my view, the crucial discussion."
"It has been said before, the main centre of gravity lies with the Member States themselves, but it is always the Commission that is responsible."
"At the beginning of this year, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party took an initiative proposal for agricultural expenditure, which is this year once again meeting with strong criticism."
"This proposal stated that if it is the case that a Member State continues to mismanage agricultural funds, the Commission should stop making advance payments to those Member States."
"That worked in our opinion."
"That report has received unanimous support by Parliament and, according to Mr Fischler, it has also been supported by the Commission."
"In response to a written question from me, the Member States have rejected it."
"What instruments of power are left to this Parliament?"
"Finally, even after this report, we do not know how much things have changed for the better or for the worse."
"According to the Court of Auditors, things are improving."
"The word 'indicators' is being bandied about."
"Is it possible to develop indicators?"
"The Court of Auditors has said that they are unable to do this, but that the Directors-General should do this."
"Is the Commission thinking about starting with this?"
"Can we say that things are improving every year by a certain percentage, until such time as 100% may be reached at some stage, sooner – it is to be hoped – rather than later?"
"Mr President, I should like to thank the Court of Auditors and its President very much for this valuable report."
"We are forced once again to observe that the Court of Auditors is very keenly critical of the way in which the Commission conducted itself during the previous budget year."
"There are such large areas of doubt and such major errors that, in practice, the Court of Auditors is giving the thumbs down to quite crucial areas of the EU budget."
"The problem is that it is difficult to judge whether the trend is for the better or for the worse."
"It would have been desirable if, as in previous years, the Court of Auditors had been able to quote a percentage figure for the funds it considers to have been wrongly expended."
"Now that we are no longer being given this percentage figure, it is difficult to decide whether the trend really is in the right direction, as it is often maintained to be."
"The Court of Auditors again sets out a general reservation concerning the accounting system itself, which is obviously the most serious point on which we have to adopt a position."
"This means that there are doubts hanging over a very great many of the figures."
"We do not know whether we can fully rely upon them."
"We have been promised thorough reform by 2005, but we have today heard again that the Court of Auditors doubts that it will be possible to implement this reform adequately by 2005."
"There is therefore still a danger of new scandals, for the Commission clearly has no general view of the way in which the budget is implemented."
"That is shown with all the clarity one could wish for by, in particular, the Eurostat scandal."
"I also intended to say a few words about the European Development Fund, for I am the rapporteur when it comes to discharging it of liability this year."
"It has emerged that funds from the European Development Fund have been misused by the same firms that are involved in the Eurostat scandal."
"Money from the European Development Fund has been used to finance contracts between Comesa (Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa) and CESD, the firm that defrauded Eurostat of at least EUR 3 million."
"The internal auditing service concludes that there is a large risk of errors having been made, of there having been double payments and of there being conflicts of interest and so on. The Directorate-General Development entered into a contract with this firm as recently as in April 2001, a contract valid for 33 months."
"I should like to ask the Commission whether this contract has now been terminated."
"One of the main proposals by the Court of Auditors regarding the European Development Fund is that this be incorporated into the ordinary budget."
"I am totally convinced that such a measure would facilitate reform and make it easier to obtain control in this area, in which a lot is at present unclear, especially when it comes, for example, to the control of direct budget aid to different countries."
"– Mr President, I want, today, to express my gratitude to the Court of Auditors for the outstanding quality and considerable quantity of its work."
"Its numerous individual reports, and now its comprehensive annual report, give us a clear picture of the European Union’s defects and strengths, of its problems and of the attempts made to resolve them."
"This being the year before the European elections, I would like to reaffirm that the Court’s work can help to qualify the widespread suspicion of the European institutions."
"Where mistakes have been made, they must be brought to light and corrected."
"The Eurostat case, in particular, demonstrates how we need greater transparency and less bureaucracy in the European institutions, but your report goes further, using important issues to show the challenges that the European Union faces."
"Enlargement is one example."
"The enlargement programmes such as Sapard, are meant to help with the proper functioning, post-enlargement, of the agricultural programmes, the structural programmes and the administrative structures."
"It is unfortunate that backlogs persist;"
"Sapard’s implementation rate, for example, was higher than in the previous year, but 2% is still a disgracefully low figure."
"Mr Fabra Vallés, your report, however, also makes reference to structural problems and errors in the European Union’s policies."
"Let me take the common agricultural policy as an example and quote what your report has to say, which strikes me as very instructive."
"On the subject of the greening of the common agricultural policy, the Court came to the conclusion that more intensive agricultural production methods had led to environmental problems that were a cause for concern."
"That is in fact the precise opposite of what we were meant to be achieving by the use of our resources."
"There are many defects that have to be removed – in the Council Directive and in the environmental criteria – for taxpayers have every right to expect not only a lack of possibilities for fraud, but also that their money will be invested wisely."
"Responsibility for this lies not only with the Commission and Parliament, but, primarily, with the Council."
"I would like to refer to an example that you mentioned and which strikes me as highly illuminating, namely the issue of artificially dried animal fodder."
"Let me quote: ‘The rate of aid paid for artificially dried fodder is almost double that paid for sun-dried fodder."
"This encouraged producers to switch from sun-drying and to produce artificially dried fodder to the maximum extent possible."
"EU production has continued to increase since 1995 and the MGQ has been exceeded since 1998/99’."
"I think that is a scandal that has to be highlighted, and something must be done to ensure that the position changes."
"Another example, one that I see as equally important, is that of cotton."
"Generally speaking, the aid arrangements for producers of cotton are intended to support the production of cotton and to make it possible for producers of it to enjoy an adequate standard of living."
"Although this is a proper objective and one that we can support, it would, I believe, constitute a misuse of funds if the result were to be an increase in cotton production without its effects on the environment being monitored at the same time."
"We have to consider not only fraud and irregularities, but also the proper use of our money."
"Let me give another example, that of export refunds, which, in 2002, totalled some EUR 3 622 million, money that I do not think has been used properly, for we keep learning on a daily basis how export refunds lead to irregularities and fraud, quite apart from which, such export refunds are also unjust, because they destroy markets in the developing world."
"I take the view that, if the European taxpayer is to become willing to keep on making his contribution to the European Union, then the EU’s policies have to be discussed in far greater depth."
"This not only involves fighting fraud and irregularities, but also this House thoroughly getting to grips with the question of what services we get in return for the money we invest."
"We have to redefine our objectives, and we have to delve far more deeply in order to evaluate what is being done with these funds in the European Union."
"Mr President, I too should like to extend my thanks to the Court of Auditors for a brilliant report and, at the same time, thank them for the many excellent items of information we receive from the Court of Auditors throughout the year."
"It is of course unnecessary to repeat in this House all the views so excellently expressed by my fellow MEPs."
"I shall be content to state that we are faced with two problems."
"The first is the number of impossible administrative systems, and the second is low morale in the administration."
"As Mr Sjöstedt said in this House, it is of course entirely true that the repeated signing of contracts with companies that have behaved quite unacceptably is inadmissible and that the Commission should simply have avoided having anything to do with such companies. Like my fellow MEP, Mr Kuhne, I must also say that one’s strongest emotion is really one of sympathy with the Commission."
"When, time after time, I listen to the Commissioners in the Committee on Budgetary Control, I think of a man armed only with a driving licence, sitting alone six miles above the ground in the cockpit of a Boeing 767 with no idea of how to land it."
"When we look at the problems we confront now that the EU has existed for 46 years, we cannot but observe that the whole problem lies in the attempt to solve problems that simply should not be solved."
"Agricultural policy in the 15 countries is quite harmful, as well as being superfluous."
"All the 15 countries are so rich that we could easily provide the necessary subsidies ourselves."
"The same applies to structural fund policy and, as the Swedish Prime Minister recently said, it is in fact meaningless for highly taxed countries to deduct tax from the ordinary man in the street when there are countries that will not tax their citizens, even the richest of them, and that subsequently redistribute these funds via the EU."
"For each euro we send to the EU, we therefore receive, on average, 80% of it back."
"That is of course a completely absurd policy, and one we can completely revise."
"We could fulfil all of the EU’s tasks with 10% of the budget, whereupon we should only have 10% of the fraud we see today."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, President of the Court of Auditors, I should like to start by thanking Mr Fabra Vallés for the excellent report he has presented. I should also like to thank the whole Court for its ongoing work."
"The Committee on Budgetary Control depends on this work to allow it to discharge its responsibilities."
"We find it very useful indeed to be able to study and analyse the reports forwarded to us by the Court of Auditors. The annual report presented to the House today is of particular importance."
"I should like to focus on specific issues in that report."
"These include reform of the Commission, the responsibilities of the authorising officers, internal control and the introduction of a service of internal auditing."
"I believe they are key to improving the functioning of the European Commission and to better implementation of its budget."
"Internal control and following up reform are the most vital of the aforementioned issues. I shall come back to them later."
"I also believe that all the analysis of enlargement is very significant. This includes an account of the remaining deficiencies in the structures and in the implementation of the Community ."
"Nonetheless, some progress has been made in this regard. Shortcomings in the implementation of pre-accession instruments are also detailed."
"Once again, significant improvement has been recorded but the overall situation remains most unsatisfactory. Indeed, many of the shortcomings and deficiencies we are confronted with in those countries could perhaps have been avoided had there been a greater commitment to those instruments and had there been a greater effort to ensure that they functioned more effectively."
"It is less than it was, which represents some progress, but the fact that such a sizeable surplus still has to be dealt with is cause for considerable concern. As has been stated in the House, this may well prove to be the responsibility of the Member States."
"Nonetheless, the European Commission should exercise greater control to prevent such a situation arising. It represents an obstacle to effective implementation of Community programmes."
"All this relates to one of the issues considered in greater detail in the Court’s report for this year. I refer to shared management with the Member States, and in particular to the EAGGF and the Structural Funds."
"Failure to implement has been most marked in these areas. I believe this calls for particular attention and I hope it will receive it both throughout this year and in the course of our current deliberations on discharge for the year 2002."
"Controls by the Member States must improve, as should the percentage of expenditure. We have stressed this on a number of occasions."
"I should also like to emphasise the need for a more detailed study of the reform. A more careful study must also be made of how it stands at present, of its possible shortcomings and of appropriate changes, should any prove necessary."
"Reform is essential if management of the European Commission is to become more flexible. Serious shortcomings have been noted."
"They are due to the longstanding in-house culture. As has been apparent today, a particular attitude prevails amongst officials."
"This means Commissioners are sometimes required to assume responsibility. Obviously, in the fullness of time Commissioners reach the end of their mandate and are succeeded by others full of good intentions and ideas."
"It should be understood that structural change and full and complete implementation of the reform are essential to capitalise on the good will and good intentions of these Commissioners."
"As I conclude, I should also like to mention that bringing the European Development Fund under the Commission’s control and management would be a significant step forward. It would also be helpful to have it within the scope of this committee’s budgetary control."
"Mr President, as the rapporteur for the European Parliament discharge for 2002, I was pleased to see that the Court of Auditors has dealt with some of the issues of concern raised in Parliament."
"It is clear from the report that there are still problems."
"The secretarial allowance rules still contain loopholes, which mean that the money is not always spent on staff, as it should be."
"Despite earlier warnings from the Court of Justice, the rules on the funding of political groups still show shortcomings."
"There was evidence of that this week when an OLAF report showed that a former political group in this Parliament had misused funds."
"Finally, the pension fund still lacks a proper legal basis and does not even have sufficient funds to cover all its liabilities."
"The European Parliament, as we all know, is always very good at criticising other institutions – we have done so today, but we also have to put our own House in order."
"Yesterday, a coalition of the selfish, the naïve and the greedy once again blocked a proposal to reform the system of pay and expenses for MEPs, which would have solved this problem once and for all."
"Opposition to this was led by Mr Schulz and Mr Nassauer."
"They are the same people who wrote to you, Mr President, asking for reform of the system of travel expenses because a German newspaper published their pictures and shamed them into action."
"The Bureau, as I understand it, postponed that debate."
"I hope that the German proposal will be taken up even though the SPD, the CDU and the CSU – not the Greens – have made it clear, privately, that they hope it will not be taken up."
"The best evidence of this hypocrisy came last night, when the Bureau discussed reform of the secretarial allowance as mandated by the Court of Auditors."
"I am told that Mr Friedrich’s first reaction was to ask whether MEPs could still employ their relatives if the new rules were adopted!"
"I am not against MEPs employing relatives if it is done in an honest and transparent manner, even though I personally do not think it is a wise move."
"However, Mr Friedrich’s reaction demonstrates that, unfortunately, for some MEPs on both sides of the House, the only purpose of their membership of this Parliament is self-enrichment and deceit."
"Fortunately, there are many MEPs, including colleagues such as Mr Kuhne, who want to reform our system of expenses."
"This question will be at the heart of my report on the discharge for the European Parliament for the 2002 financial year."
"2004 is an election year; we cannot afford to embark upon this election with the current system, which is morally corrupt."
"If necessary, we must publicly shame our House into action."
"Mr President, it is with a certain satisfaction that I hear the Court of Auditors praising the Commission’s efforts at reform."
"At the same time, it is a good thing that, for the first time, the Court of Auditors has not discovered material errors in connection with implementing the pre-accession aid for the candidate countries."
"Finally, it is also worth noting that the Court of Auditors has approved the 2002 accounts for the European Development Fund, even if there are critical remarks concerning their inspection."
"I wish to emphasise that we in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party fully support the Court of Auditors’ proposal that the European Development Fund be integrated into the general budget."
"At the same time, it is extremely worrying that the Court of Auditors cannot again approve the really big budget items such as the expenditure on agricultural aid, structural funds and internal policies, that is to say items constituting approximately 80% of the EU budget."
"In this area, we must be aware of the fact that administration and control of these budget items is, to a large degree, taken care of by the Member States themselves."
"There are also these budget items that, year after year, completely miss the mark in budgeting terms."
"This year, total under-use amounted to EUR 7.4 billion, or EUR 7 400 million, and that is extremely unsatisfactory."
"That is money that should and could have been used to fulfil the political objectives, and, had it not been used for those purposes, it could have been used in other of the EU’s budget areas, for example research and development."
"I think these problems should lead to reflection upon the structures for exercising control in the area of the budget, with competence shared between the Commission and the Member States."
"In the first instance, I think that efforts should be made to coordinate and upgrade the Member States’ control of EU funds."
"A working party could be set up, consisting of representatives from the Member States’ respective control bodies."
"Of course, the Court of Auditors must have a seat on the working party, and the objective must be to develop a uniform control standard on the ‘best practice’ model."
"In the longer term, it should be considered whether the incentive for the efficient control of EU funds is simply too weak in the Member States."
"If that proves to be the case, top priority should be given to setting up a common European prosecution service."
"In conclusion, I have a practical question for Mr Fabra Vallés."
"In connection with the publication of the report, and also in this House today, you have said that the Commission’s deadline for reforming the accounting system, namely January 2005, is very optimistic."
"I should like to ask what considerations form the basis of this statement, for I have noticed that the Court of Auditors has not evaluated the accounting reforms in the report."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, after the speech by my friend Mr Van Hulten, I am no longer certain whether we are talking about the Court of Auditors’ report or the report of the Bureau meeting."
"If we are talking about the Court of Auditors’ report, there is no problem, because that was the debate for which I put my name down."
"First of all, I should like to praise the work of the President of the Court of Auditors, Mr Fabra Vallés, and the work of the Court as a whole."
"I believe that, once again, the Court of Auditors has given us a document that deserves and requires our full attention."
"Unfortunately, I do not believe that this document will be widely read outside our institution, for example by national governments, by people in the Council and in the Ecofin Council, who think that it is quite all right to take power away from the European Parliament, whereas they ought first of all to look at and check their own accounts and take seriously the point raised by the Court of Auditors."
"Mr Van Hulten was right when he said that the Court of Auditors has drawn attention to a certain number of things that this House also needs to put in order."
"It is unfortunate that we sometimes tend to contemplate our own navels too much."
"We can see straight away those things in Parliament that are not working properly, and it is quite right that we should, and yet, for years, the Court of Auditors has been telling us that 80% of our expenditure, which is controlled by the Member States, contains an improbable number of errors, false allocations and problems which the Court itself has not been able to identify specifically."
"So I ask myself when we are going to clear things up and finally put this system in order."
"It is our duty to be fastidious, and to pay attention to what the Commission and the other institutions do."
"As you know, Mrs Schreyer and Mr Fabra Vallés, we in the Committee on Budgetary Control have submitted two hundred questions to the Commission – perhaps even more – based on the Court of Auditors’ report."
"Unfortunately, though, we did not put any to the Member States, because we are not able to do so."
"I believe that this is a real problem."
"We must find a way of coming up with a solution, and of making the Court of Auditors’ report binding not only on the Commission, which will be asked to produce accounts, but also with regard to the accounts of Member States."
"The other problem is how to follow up the recommendations that the Court of Auditors has made."
"For years now, the Court of Auditors has not carried out specific audits or surveys, for example of Eurostat."
"Yet for years it has been highlighting a certain number of problems that have never been taken seriously."
"For example, on the issue of export refunds, the Court of Auditors had for years identified a problem which had never been taken seriously, and the result of that was that we ended up with the scandal of which we are only too well aware."
"If this exercise is not to be a pointless one, I believe that it must be given a more specific content, at any rate as regards the following two points: the way in which follow-up measures are organised at Member State level, and the reason why the Commission, and we ourselves, do not take sufficient account of the report’s conclusions."
"Madam President, I should like to begin by thanking the President of the Court of Auditors for coming before the House today, and for his presentation. I am glad a number of the Court’s officials are accompanying Mr Fabra Vallés and I would like to take this opportunity to thank them also for the work accomplished."
"I cannot fail to emphasise once again the pedagogical aspect of the report before us."
"A conscious effort was made to include initial definitions of each of the areas. There is also an account of previous observations, proposed observations and of the Commission’s responses."
"Consequently, the document amounts to an encyclopaedia of Community financial management. It should prove most useful to all who have the pleasure of reading and studying it."
"In my view it should also be stressed that this is a transitional report, insofar as it is part of the ongoing reform of the Commission, which is a significant administrative reform. I welcome the fact that whenever it referred to that reform, the Court of Auditors focused on improvements within the Commission."
"It would not actually make sense for the Commission to drag its feet over undertaking its own reform. After all, the initiative for reform came from the Commission itself."
"Much does certainly remain to be done. Nonetheless, there is movement towards greater cooperation."
"I therefore believe the observation made by Mr Fabra Vallés concerning the desirability of revising the timetable is most opportune. The estimates may prove overly optimistic."
"Concerning assurance of the accounts, I should emphasise that the reservations expressed are specific and can be overcome. These are not reservations on the substance, nor are they reservations on the principles."
"These reservations can therefore be dealt with, despite their significance."
"Further, some of the issues dealt with in the report, such as under-use, shared management and the reform process will be dealt with in the report on discharge for the financial year 2002."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, President of the Court of Auditors and other members of the Court, let me join in congratulating the Court on the excellent work it has presented to us, but let me also highlight two special reports on export refunds which are indeed exemplary and speak highly of the quality of work that the Court of Auditors has produced in recent years."
"Written in clear language, which does not give way to hyperbole or the bureaucratic metaphysics that we unfortunately still find in some of the Court’s texts, they repeat a diagnosis originally made in 1990."
"The export refund system is extremely complex and highly open to fraud, as it does not follow the most elementary rules of transparency."
"In thirteen years, nothing has essentially changed in the way this scheme is run; it involves a very small number of interests and companies, which the Commission refuses to name."
"Commissioners come and go, reforms pass, but export refunds are still here and pose a challenge to everything and everybody."
"Three years after the network that falsified tens of thousands of tonnes of butter throughout Europe was exposed, and after it was called on to protect Europe’s financial interests as well as citizens’ and farmers’ rights, the Commission still refuses to take any action against any of the offenders and in fact affords privileged treatment to large dairy product companies involved in this scandal compared with the treatment it reserves for any farmers whose milk production exceeds their quota."
"These are the practices and the realities which it is essential to combat, and it is useful to see them effectively and diligently examined, as has happened with these Court of Auditors reports on export subsidies."
"My heartiest congratulations once again, therefore, to the Court of Auditors on the work it has done."
"– Madam President, perhaps I can give Mr Fabra Vallés, the President of the Court of Auditors, a tip on how his institution can be better appreciated by the other institutions, for that – as you, Mr Fabra Vallés, said, and as I also believe – is what is lacking at the present time."
"Perhaps you should make your reports a bit clearer."
"Perhaps you could just state that the Statement of Assurance is absent or that you do not believe that reforms will be in place by the time promised, or perhaps you could just report that, where agriculture is concerned there has been no preparation for enlargement to speak of."
"If one can talk in terms of only 2% funds getting to their intended recipients, then this policy has proved to be a non-starter."
"That is the simple view taken by our fellow-citizens."
"I cannot see any way of putting a cosmetic gloss on these things."
"If reform is the issue, then we have our own indicators."
"I am not talking about the time before 1999, but about the present day, when I say that, when we are told by a Commission that the report will be produced a year later, in contravention of the law it exists to guard and uphold, then something has not happened, that something being a learning process within the Commission."
"When one has to wait months to get a reply to questions relating what is currently going on in Eurostat – that is, questions relating not to the distant past but to the mistakes being made right now and to the continued waste of taxpayers’ money – then nothing has happened."
"When we are told that, if we want reforms and proposals for legislation by the end of December, we will get them in January, then, again, someone has failed to learn anything."
"It is by these criteria that we judge whether a reform has happened and has been successful."
"As you will by now have gathered, we are highly sceptical."
"Madam President, I should like to thank the Court of Auditors for its report."
"We are looking at the reform of a massive multinational administration and it is not going to be easy to turn it around overnight."
"There is a recognition in the Court's report, however, that things are heading in the right direction and we are pleased to see that."
"There are still major problems with accountancy and we wish to see those efforts speeded up within the Commission."
"Since the publication of this report, we in the United Kingdom have been treated to screaming headlines about the fraud that goes on within the EU."
"It is the ninth time the Court of Auditors has not given the nod to the accuracy of the figures in the largest areas of expenditure."
"We must always remember that 80% of the money is spent within the Member States, and until there is more responsibility on the part of the Member States, the Commission cannot possibly account for every euro."
"The issue I should like to concentrate on is the massive amount spent on invalidity pensions to institution staff."
"EUR 74 000 million are spent every year on people who are sick within the institutions."
"Of course, we have a responsibility to look after people who are sick, but the efforts made to help staff back to work are absolutely pitiful, especially those suffering psychological problems."
"50% of staff said that there was no enquiry about their state of health or the possibility of them returning to work while on sick leave."
"In grades C and D, 62% of people retired on invalidity pensions while 21% retired on retirement pensions."
"I want to ask both the Court and the Court of Auditors whether they will be pressing for Member States to sign declarations of assurance – both for the Structural Funds and in the agricultural domain – in the forthcoming reforms."
"Until we get that we are not going to see an improvement on the whole issue of accountancy, or of the Structural Funds, or of where the responsibility lies."
"If we stand firm on this issue we will try and hold up the process within the European Parliament until the Member States start taking their responsibility."
"Are you going to be pressing for the Member States to sign declarations of assurance?"
"Madam President, I should first like to make a statement on Eurostat."
"Several speakers referred to it indirectly, though no specific questions were posed."
"The Court has never undertaken a full audit of Eurostat, the statistics office. The Committee on Budgetary Control was informed of this on a number of occasions."
"Nonetheless, the Court has considered programmes implemented by Eurostat in the context of other audits."
"The results of these audits were included in the Court’s annual reports for the years 1993, 1998 and 1999. This last report was published in November 2000."
"The Court’s observations on Eurostat management related to inadequate procedures for the award of certain contracts. They also related to poor use of technical assistance offices, known as TAOs."
"It should be mentioned that the Court had already commented on the TAOs further to other audits."
"The Commission followed up these comments and reviewed procedures for awarding contracts and use of the TAOs in 1999."
"It also put in place new standards for management and control in these two areas."
"In addition, OLAF launched an internal investigation into Eurostat in mid-2000."
"In the light of the introduction of these new measures and of the ongoing internal investigation of OLAF, it would have inappropriate to initiate an audit of Eurostat at this juncture"
"It is worth stressing that in principle, the Court refrains from conducting audits in departments and areas under investigation by OLAF."
"This is in order to avoid interference or activity liable to prejudice anti-fraud investigations."
"The Court will take the lessons of the Eurostat affair into account when undertaking its risk analysis for the coming year."
"I thank Mr Kuhne for his contribution, but I must say that I do not believe there were any questions for the Court of Auditors."
"Mr Mulder stated we are on the right track, but wondered how long this would last."
"In my view, if we are on the right track we should stay on it."
"As to the time period, that depends on the organisation or institution."
"It depends on how complex or extensive it is. The Commission’s size and geographical dimension must be borne in mind."
"It should also be remembered that the Commission is not the only player involved."
"Each of the changes it makes has implications at national level."
"The Commission is therefore bound to be in constant contact with the various Member States. Consequently, it cannot always maintain the cruising speed set at a particular time."
"It should also be borne in mind that the reforms under way do not relate to the next five years only. We feel this is this is a longer-term venture."
"In addition, Parliament is there to play its part. It is for Parliament to keep nudging the Commission into action and to ensure this reform is taken forward as an ongoing and continuous process."
"It also has to be said that a favourable DAS has been granted since 1994, despite a number of shortcomings in the accounting system."
"This is why in December 2002 the Commission decided to reform the accounting system. The intention was for the new system to come into operation in 2005."
"I do not wish to enter into a debate with the Commission on this. I simply mention it so that the House is not disappointed if it should turn out that the reform is not fully complete by 2005."
"The Court of Auditors feels that the time allowed is too short."
"We believe it is best to proceed slowly but surely. Each step forward should only be taken after due consideration, to ensure that decisions are sustainable."
"Adopting Penelope’s approach to reform is not helpful. Progress cannot be achieved through constant doing and undoing."
"On the subject of reform, I believe it is important not to allow it to be jeopardised by the Eurostat case. The latter has been a blow to all Europeans, coming as it did just when it was thought that the TAOs and other situations had finally been dealt with."
"The clear conclusion to be drawn from this situation is the urgency of pursuing the reform and concluding it at the earliest opportunity."
"That is how things stand."
"The difficulty lies in quantifying the improvement."
"The House will be aware that the Court has never favoured references to the rate of error."
"The reason is that this leads to error, and that therefore nothing is gained."
"Nonetheless, the Court is working with standards."
"I am convinced that the standards presented this year will allow standards to be raised in subsequent years."
"It is to be hoped that within Parliament, the Commission and the Court of Auditors agreement can be reached on what constitutes a spade and what does not."
"That would be the best way of reaching an understanding."
"Mr Sjöstedt stated that we are referring to a general improvement."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is important to establish whether or not improvement has taken place, and if so, to measure it."
"Hence the reference to standards, to allow you to make comparisons."
"I can assure you that there has indeed been some improvement."
"Mrs Rühle spoke of eliminating mistrust and increasing transparency. She also called for more democracy."
"Subsequently she referred to agriculture. My response on this is also directed to Mr Sørensen."
"The difficulty with agriculture is that too many faulty payments are still being made."
"That is the problem. We have established most of the errors relate to payments made outside the Integrated Administrative and Control System."
"Clearly, this involves a significant proportion of the budget."
"It actually relates to more than 40% of the budget."
"When compared with the agricultural sector as a whole, the final beneficiary’s sum may seem small. Nonetheless, 40% is a large slice of the budget, and minor errors cannot be overlooked."
"It should also be borne in mind that 80% of the Community budget goes through the national budgets."
"The question then arises as to how far improvement of the Commission can go without the help of control by the Member States."
"I should inform you that we organise seminars throughout the year. Invitations were extended to parliamentarians, other institutions and members of national Courts of Auditors."
"They were invited to come to Luxembourg and get to know us. It is one way of building good relations."
"We were able to provide them with information and begin to gradually harmonise procedures. Bear in mind that we do not all use the same system."
"There is the Anglo-Saxon system and the European system. We are working to harmonise them."
"A phrase from the Bible comes to mind, namely ‘go forth and preach’."
"I can assure you that all members of the Court do go forth and preach."
"We have all recently been in our home countries to do some explanatory work."
"Our task is the same in this House, in the national states and in the Court of Auditors."
"Our aim is to ensure that the Member States understand just how much we need their assistance and cooperation when it comes to controlling Community funds."
"To save time, I shall reply to Messrs Camre, Bayona, Van Hulten, Dell'Alba, Casaca, Bösch and to Mrs Aviles and Mrs Morgan in writing."
"Thank you for your attention."
"Please be assured that we remain entirely at your disposal at all times."
"– Thank you for being so understanding, MrFabra Vallés."
"We have to stick to very strict timetables."
"The debate is closed."
". Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, today I have pleasure in announcing a real success for us to debate."
"After two and a half years of negotiations and five presidencies which have given close attention to the matter, agreement has been reached in the Council on Regulation No 1408/1971, a particularly important regulation because it concerns the rights of workers in the European Union."
"Mrs Jensen’s report precisely concerns Parliament’s position on the alignment of rights and the simplification of procedures relating to the workers of the European Union working and living in different places, and today we have the first reading."
"This regulation is of exceptional importance for the rights of the insured."
"The proposal submitted by the Commission in June essentially reinforces the rights of the insured – all insured persons living temporarily in another Member State will have the same health care rights – but it also simplifies the procedures for safeguarding health care during temporary residency."
"So we have a very specific act of the European institutions, which is understandable, clear and has an immediate impact on the daily life of European citizens."
"Essentially it touches on two fundamental matters in the European Union: the concept of the European citizen, on the one hand, and the right of free movement for workers, on the other."
"Over and above the significant independent operation of the regulation, however, and the simplification and reinforcement of workers’ rights, it will facilitate the introduction of the European Health Insurance Card which, as you know, will be ready on 1 June 2004, and it will significantly facilitate free movement in Europe."
"I must make a point of congratulating Mrs Jensen who, with a deep knowledge of the subject and with creative flexibility, has managed to formulate Parliament’s position in relation to this proposal in a relatively short space of time, I would say in an exceptionally short space of time."
"With the very creative cooperation which there has been between the Commission and Parliament, perhaps we really shall find ourselves today before a decision which will be taken in record time, perhaps at first reading if there is ultimately agreement, and we shall have a final agreement between the three institutions on the regulation and its operation as quickly as possible."
"I would remind the House that essentially within six months, from June to today, there have been very important efforts, exceptionally creative collaboration, and I am very satisfied that the Commission can accept most of the amendments proposed by Parliament, because approval of these amendments will allow the Council to proceed to final approval, following the reading by Parliament."
"Ladies and gentlemen, very often, and also because of the nature of the institutions and how they operate, we concern ourselves a great deal with procedures, which are complicated."
"Today, with an end to procedures, with the agreement of the institutions, we essentially face a decision which has very specific and tangible repercussions on the lives of European citizens, even more so in a Europe of 25, in which the movement of workers, cooperation between the Member States, will need to be simplified and will need to be subject to much simpler and clearer procedures."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I want to begin by thanking you very much for the cooperation we have enjoyed concerning the European Health Insurance Card, because what you say is correct, Commissioner."
"It is a real success story, as a result of which, with fairly few changes and a quite modest reform, we shall obtain very major benefits indeed for the individual citizen. I am pleased, moreover, that Parliament has supported our attaching importance to finishing the job quickly so that people might have the card in their hands by 1 July 2004."
"I believe it will have very great symbolic value indeed."
"It has not been as simple as all that, for it was as recently as last Friday that the Council agreed upon the wording now before us. I must thank my colleagues in the form of the shadow rapporteurs from the other parties for having been so flexible and trusting in the work on this card and for having supported us in finding a solution as early as today, when I also hope we can lay the foundation for reaching an agreement at first reading and so having the proposal implemented in a mere six months."
"Initially, a simple form, called E111, is to be replaced. Subsequently, a number of other forms will follow, normally to be completed when people move from one country to another or need health insurance – paid for by their country of origin – when temporarily resident abroad."
"It will simplify matters and make things easier for people, including those who are travelling, in a host of practical ways."
"It is, then, not only students and retired people temporarily resident, or working in, another country, but also people travelling who will no doubt make more use of the new Health Insurance Card, for they will no longer have to contact the social authorities but will have the card and be able to go directly to the doctor’s."
"If, however, we are to be able to devise a card for all, everyone needs to be given the same rights, and this has meant some citizens being given more rights."
"In future, everyone will be entitled to all necessary medical treatment whereas, up until now, some people were only entitled to emergency medical treatment."
"In future, it will be the same for everyone, and this means, for example, that people suffering from chronic diseases, such as kidney diseases, will in future be able to come to an agreement with a hospital in the country to which they are travelling and be sure of being able to obtain dialysis."
"This proposal will therefore improve and simplify matters for them."
"The tighter rules for the Health Insurance Card will be laid down by an administrative committee in which the individual Member States will be represented."
"How the rules will look and what list of illnesses it will be permitted, in purely practical terms, to obtain treatment for will be laid down by representatives from the Member States."
"What we are establishing here is a situation in which everyone is given the same rights and in which it is possible to go directly to the doctor without, therefore, having to do a tour of the social authorities."
"It is also worth mentioning that it will become easier to reimburse expenditure."
"This can be made simpler and faster."
"At present, it can take a long time before expenses are reimbursed."
"This will become simpler."
"It will become simpler for the individual, but it will also in fact become simpler for the doctors and health staff, as well as becoming easier for the authorities. The situation is therefore really one in which everyone can be pleased and elated about what is happening, because we shall, in actual fact, all benefit from it."
"Finally, I wish to say how very important it is to state that what we are preparing in this case is an insurance card and not a card providing health information in the general sense of the term."
"The only information to be carried on the card will be the person’s name and insurance details, but not health information."
"In the context of the e-Europe programme, work is being done on a card that will contain health information, but that is not what we are talking about today. We do not therefore have data protection problems, because the data that is to be exchanged by means of this Health Insurance Card is exclusively the same data we exchange by means of forms."
"It is a small reform but one that, I believe, will be very effective in practice."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I too would like to congratulate Mrs Jensen, not just on the work she has done, but on her ability and her efforts to reach consensus between all the members of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"The European Commission had officially launched the idea of creating a European health card at the beginning of the Spanish Presidency of the European Union, which ran from January to June 2002, at the informal meeting of Employment and Social Policy Ministers, held in Burgos on 18 and 19 January 2002."
"That proposal was supported by the then Spanish Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, President-in-Office of the Council of Employment and Social Policy Ministers, Mr Juan Carlos Aparicio Pérez, who is incidentally now the Mayor of that beautiful Castilian city."
"Then, the Barcelona Council of March 2002 decided to create a European Health Insurance Card, a card which will replace the current paper forms which European citizens require in order to receive healthcare assistance in other Member States."
"When Community citizens move between Member States there may be, and in fact there are, inconveniences and restrictions of their intra-Community freedom of movement."
"The possibility – an immediate one, having heard the Commissioner – of a European health card must contribute to the elimination and removal of these difficulties and furthermore is going to make it easier for Community Europeans to exercise their rights."
"The situation was very different initially, since we were working on the basis of differing situations in each of the Member States."
"Nevertheless, the advantages of this European health card are obvious."
"For my country, which receives more than 40 million European citizens per year and in which furthermore many Community citizens take up residence, it is very important."
"The inhabitants of highly regionalised countries will also have special advantages."
"The card for all Community Europeans is going to simplify the procedures currently necessary in order to receive assistance in the country of temporary stay, also guaranteeing that the bodies funding that assistance are reimbursed for their expenses by the country of origin of the beneficiary-user."
"I therefore believe that the advantages, amongst others, are the correct application of Community coordination in the field of health care; creating confidence amongst the European citizens with regard to their healthcare when they move within Community territory; to facilitate the citizens’ exercise of their right to healthcare assistance by means of simplifying the documentation required, concentrating it in a simple card, in a single card to ensure healthcare assistance, with the integrated use of cards and terminals; and finally, the provision of the replacement procedure in exceptional cases, by which I mean the loss or theft of the card."
"With this card, which in principle is going to replace the current E111 form, used for short stays, as the Commissioner said, we will have another piece of Europe in our pockets to add to the euro."
"Quite simply, to return to the Spanish Presidency and its slogan, this card will provide us with ‘more Europe’."
"In any event, I believe that ‘more Europe’ means a closer Europe, closer to the European citizens, which the citizens will have a better image of, and, undoubtedly – and I will end here, Madam President – a further step in European construction as our precursors would have said."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, thank you for this important Regulation."
"I should also like to thank the rapporteur for the fast and flexible work and, above all, for the excellent cooperation with the political groups."
"I am also indebted to the Council for its positive attitude in this matter."
"Commissioner, we are really witnessing a small miracle here: a Regulation that has to be approved by the Council unanimously in codecision with Parliament, the procedure of which is completed within the space of one reading."
"I do not think that this has ever happened before in this Parliament."
"Yet, the Regulation we are discussing today is very important, as it considerably enhances, in two ways, the rights of citizens who utilise the right to free movement of persons."
"First of all, from now on, everyone will enjoy the same rights to essential medical care, which is a vast improvement for a huge number of people."
"So far, students and retired people have been entitled to medical care in the Member States in which they reside, if required, while employees and their families can only obtain essential care in those countries."
"This discrimination has therefore now been lifted."
"Secondly, the procedures will also become much simpler for the public."
"At present, persons residing in a different Member State must take their E111 forms to the local health insurance fund, whereupon they obtain new forms, and only then can they visit the GP or dentist."
"This is hopelessly complicated."
"At least now, they are allowed to go to the care-provider directly. That too is a vast improvement."
"Commissioner, I am also pleased that the Council and Commission have agreed to the principle of Member States having to inform their citizens about their entitlements to health care, for these are naturally not unlimited."
"Finally, Commissioner, I share the hope of my fellow MEPs that this Regulation will indeed be a important new step towards the introduction of a general European Health Insurance Card which will provide ready access to health care throughout Europe for all insured Europeans who enjoy rights of residence."
"– As a member of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, but also as a former government commissioner for administrative simplification in my own country, I can only welcome the unanimous approval, by our committee, of Mrs Jensen’s report."
"In effect, the introduction of a European Health Insurance Card, which will replace the current paper forms needed for health treatment in another Member State, constitutes a considerable advance for Europeans."
"I think that we should all be aware of this."
"The harmonisation of procedures will lead to greater well-being, it will avoid people being confronted by endless paperwork, but above all it will give real mobility to European citizens."
"This step is an excellent example of the efficacy that can result from a reorganisation of procedures."
"Thus the famous Form E111, so familiar to tourists and required for short-term stays, will be the first thing to be abolished."
"The European card will simplify the lives of our fellow citizens, without changing existing rights and obligations."
"This is something that we all insisted on."
"This practical and very visible act will increase our sense of belonging to the European Union, just as it will strengthen European citizenship."
"It is clear that we shall very quickly have to continue our efforts and broaden the scope of the card, so that it includes medical emergency data and information about the health of the holder."
"For now, let us welcome this new administrative culture which, without a doubt, will be appreciated by the citizens of Europe, who have all too often been disappointed by the slow and cumbersome nature of our procedures."
"– Madam President, measures facilitating the simplification of procedures and formalities are always positive, and in this particular case of health care provision they are even more important because they will help to make the free movement of persons easier."
"These rights need to be extended to as many people as possible, and therefore it is a positive step that a European health card has been successfully created for everyone who travels, studies or works – and also for their family members – in any European Union Member State, thus replacing the forms that currently exist, but without containing data that might put their privacy at risk."
"I also consider it a positive step to provide all citizens with information on the rights they enjoy in this field in the various Member States and that this should be duly guaranteed."
"I therefore congratulate Mrs Jensen on the work she has done."
"I hope that the citizens of the various Member States of the European Union will indeed gain direct access to full health care and that this will happen as soon as possible, according to an established timetable."
"I also hope that today’s vote will help to ensure that this timetable is adhered to and that the health card will become a reality during the coming year."
"Madam President, I too welcome the decision to introduce a European health insurance form card and congratulate the rapporteur for her clarity and perseverance."
"This is indeed a breakthrough for our citizens and a concrete example to them of the way that the European Union can be of direct benefit."
"For example, instead of having to collect an E111 form before travelling, and then having to go through various bureaucratic procedures before receiving care, they will, through the card, have immediate access to the care they need."
"Member States have the responsibility for health, and there is, of course, a great diversity of approaches in this area."
"Nevertheless, it has at last been possible to reach agreement in Council."
"I congratulate all concerned for reaching that agreement so that the card can be in active use by 1 June 2004."
"The rapporteur is correct, however, in pointing out that the European Parliament must be consulted again if an extension of the card to include personal medical data is proposed – indeed, this has already been suggested – as the proper protection of personal information – particularly of a medical nature – is a major concern."
"Madam President, I too would like to join my colleagues in congratulating both the Commissioner and the rapporteur for their work on this issue."
"In one sense it helps to promote the ideal of European Union integration and greater mobility between the Member States when we think that a short time ago we had difficulty in agreeing a common format for a passport."
"There was even greater difficulty in agreeing some form of common format with regard to a design for a coin or for a bank note when the euro came into being."
"However, for many years, through the E111 form or other forms, we have had an agreement with regard to the ability to deliver services to people who are unwell when they are away from their home Member State."
"The biggest difficulty with the format of the form was that it was too bureaucratic and there was no certainty or guarantee that you would get the standard of care that you required – or even get any care – when you were struck by an illness or a certain medical condition while you were away."
"This single card will at least eliminate a lot of those difficulties."
"Secondly, the agreements between the Member States – regarding the types of care, and the range and level of services that will be available to people – will also help to clarify the situation for many people."
"Thirdly and more importantly, it will also give a great sense of security to people who are moving abroad whether for a holiday, for work or for any other reason."
"The figures pertaining to this matter are interesting."
"Since 1970, the number of people within the existing 15 European Union Member States living outside their home Member State has risen by 61%."
"The number of people within the European Union who work outside their home Member State has increased by 54% since 1970."
"The number of students who are studying away from their home Member State has increased by 71% since 1970."
"This illustrates that the necessity for the delivery of services is even greater."
"Finally, to ensure that doctors in the Member States understand what these cards mean, a training or advertising programme should be put in place."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, Mrs Jensen, ladies and gentlemen, I support the gist of this report."
"It is important to promote free movement in the European Union and to create the conditions for this."
"If we want to promote the free movement of persons and wish to achieve further integration of the internal market, a solution will need to be found for the not-so-pleasant things in life too – like calling on health care abroad."
"This solution is now within reach with the introduction of a European Health Insurance Card."
"Alongside the clear advantages, however, I can also see a few objections to introducing a card of this kind."
"In her report, Mrs Jensen mentioned two measures that are required for such a card."
"First of all, the harmonisation of the rights of all categories of insured persons."
"I do not share this wish for harmonisation."
"The way in which health care systems are run is different is every Member State, and the funding too varies from premiums to paying for it out of tax money."
"In addition, I do not consider the symbolic value of such a card to be of vital importance."
"After all, when you become ill abroad, you need care, not a symbol."
"You will soon be able to receive the care with a card."
"I certainly have no European sentiment in this matter."
"I do approve, though, of the second measure, which should lead to the simplification of formalities."
"Administrative procedures and formalities must be reduced to a minimum."
"The fact that increased mobility among citizens leads to them calling on health care in another Member State should not be penalised by red tape."
"I should like to finish off my contribution with a question to Commissioner Diamantopoulou."
"Will the card that is yet to be introduced also need to be introduced and issued by new official bodies, or would that be possible without any new bodies or staff?"
"– Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union cannot merely be an area for the free movement of capital, products and services; it must also be a Europe of free movement of citizens without prejudice to their rights."
"The entry into force of the European Health Insurance Card will be a great step towards achieving this fundamental objective."
"In the Barcelona conclusions of March 2002, it had been agreed to create a European health card as a means of removing the barriers to geographical mobility."
"Facilitating the free movement of people in the European Union is thus the objective."
"Supporting this report now is a necessary condition for us all to benefit from this step forward for the Community in 2004."
"I congratulate Mrs Jensen, the rapporteur, on the good work she has done."
"I also applaud the Commission for its diligence and commitment in putting this ambition into practice, as well as the highly positive collaboration of the Council."
"The entry into force of the European Health Insurance Card will result in a harmonisation of the rights of insured people and their family members whether they are travelling, studying or posted abroad, or are job-seekers or international road transport drivers."
"All citizens will be entitled to benefits in kind when seeking medical care during their stay in a Member State, and will avoid the complicated bureaucratic process that currently involves the intervention of various different bodies."
"In order to create the environment needed for the adoption of this card, the regulations implementing social security schemes, namely Regulations No 1408/71 and No 572/72, must first be amended."
"I am pleased to note the agreement reached with the Council on the revision of Regulation No 1408/71."
"With the adoption of this single, personalised document, the various forms currently in use will be eliminated, the rights of the insured will be harmonised and formalities simplified."
"Eliminating the existing forms will, however, take place in stages."
"Such changes mean that the insured must be properly informed on their rights and duties deriving from the new legislation and it will be up to the Member States to ensure that their citizens are given this information."
"The creation of the European Health Insurance Card is, therefore, an ambition that has become reality, but it is also a symbol of Europe and a tool that strengthens the feeling of belonging to the European Union."
"– Madam President, I would like to echo those who have congratulated the rapporteur, the shadow rapporteurs and also the Commissioner on their dynamic work, as a result of which it is possible to complete this matter in one reading."
"Wonderful!"
"I should nevertheless like to take this opportunity to make a few remarks."
"It is, of course, marvellous that we will have this permit next year, but I think that these things are sometimes done all too hastily."
"Health care is not simply a commercial product or service that is traded within the free market."
"You cannot simply regard those who make use of health care as ordinary individual consumers, and those who provide the care as companies and self-employed people who carry out their jobs on the market 'for-or-not-for-profit'."
"The Member States’ systems for dealing with health costs within social security systems that are largely funded collectively and on the basis of solidarity between those in poor health and those in good health, young and old, men and women and, to a certain extent, the rich and the poor."
"These systems are currently under a great deal of strain on account of an ageing population, increasing medical possibilities, privatisation and other trends, and I would ask the Commission to pay greater attention to all of them."
"It is absolutely inadequate only to regulate the free movement of medical care for individual cardholders and for Europe to seek to intervene in health care only by way of rulings by the Court of Justice and through the new directive on the free movement of services that is now being put together by the DG Market."
"We must not allow the solidarity element to be eroded."
"It is not our intention to encourage calculating citizens who can afford it to shop around for health care, while care at home is being fleeced."
"I cannot go into all of this in the two minutes that I have been allocated now, but I should like to alert you to this and to add that, however successful the health insurance card may be, there is an urgent need for the so-called high-level reflection process that was initiated by the Council last year, to culminate in the firm, fully-fledged coordination of health care in which solidarity and quality aspects occupy centre stage."
"Madam President, the proposed arrangements for the insurance card may abolish a few bureaucratic procedures, but in practice any positive points are cancelled out by the policy of reducing social spending and benefits, in accordance with the Maastricht criteria, on the pretext of excessive public-sector deficits, and by the policy of commercialising the health systems."
"These adjustments will help to speed up the implementation of the policy of the European Union, of the capitalist reforms in the Members States, on the pretext of harmonising health systems, by which we mean levelling social benefits downwards, abolishing the public nature and privatising and commercialising the health and social security systems, reducing pensions and increasing workers’ contributions to insurance funds."
"All this signals an attack on the workers."
"What good will the card be when access to the national health system is becoming more and more problematic and the privilege of the right to care remains with those who can afford to pay, given that even national health hospitals are operating on business criteria?"
"Insurance funds are in the red because the state is drawing resources from the social security funds in order to finance the money markets and help out employers by reducing employer contributions."
"The proposed measures will probably make the financial situation of the insurance funds worse."
"When social security is privatised, what sort of insurance will there be for the 20% of the population of the European Union living below the poverty line and the 8.8% unemployed, according to the recent Eurostat study?"
"So the workers have nothing to expect from the much-publicised insurance card."
"On the contrary, they can expect greater insecurity, poverty and increased payments in order to have preventive health protection and care."
"We are certain that they will fight to overturn these policies."
"We, the Communist Party of Greece, stand by their side."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we Christian Democrats here in the European Parliament and, obviously, the Swedish Christian Democratic Party too, welcome the clear and significant administrative simplification entailed in a European Health Insurance Card."
"As from 2004, this card will also be electronic, and it will be possible to read data off it."
"The introduction of a Health Insurance card is, of course, extremely welcome."
"It will make it significantly simpler for people in the various Member States of the European Union to have their social rights safeguarded without administrative worries."
"The various forms will now disappear, firstly the E111 form and, subsequently, the others too: E110, E119 and E128."
"At the same time, it is important to emphasise that this new European Health Insurance Card does not provide any new social rights."
"It is only an administrative simplification."
"In the future too, it will, on a purely constitutional basis, be the Member States that are responsible for health care within the European Union."
"Responsibility for payment also lies with the Member States."
"It is important for us in the European debate to see social rights as being linked to issues of solidarity and responsibility for payment."
"I also wish to emphasise that, today in many EU Member States, there is an economic crisis within the health and social insurance systems."
"The objective of harmonisation, or of creating a European catalogue of social rights without linking this to funding by the Member States, is very dubious."
"We must make matters easier from an administrative point of view, but we must allow the Member States themselves to deal with these issues in the future too."
"Madam President, in fact, our ritual congratulations at this point for the rapporteurs and the Commissioner are today fully justified, because today this Parliament, together with the Commission and the Council, is taking a genuine step forward in terms of bringing our agenda into line with the agenda of the citizens and simplifying their lives and, although it does not give them new rights, it does at least make it easier for them to exercise the rights they already have."
"Administrative simplification is very important, as other Members have pointed out, but I would also take this opportunity to say that for the first time we are modifying the old Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 and we are beginning to talk not just about the free movement of workers in Europe, but also the free movement of citizens, and we are beginning to organise a discussion and political practice in which the right to European citizenship begins to become a reality in relation to such fundamental elements as the right to health."
"It is therefore an extremely important first step of a strategic nature."
"I would also say, Madam President, that this success and the congratulations we are all offering must not lead us to be complacent: we must continue to be demanding because this is simply a first step."
"We do not yet have a European card."
"This is a simplification of forms; the card is not yet an intelligent card, there are still many steps to take before the right to health for all Europeans is truly guaranteed, coordinated and justified by a Community authority."
"I therefore believe, Commissioner, that we must continue to make progress; this is the first step, as I have said, in a long battle to make the social Europe more administratively simple, but also more profound and more serious in terms of our status as citizens."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate the Commission and Commissioner Diamantopoulou heartily on this excellent document, as well as the rapporteur, Mrs Jensen, and all the Members that are flocking into this Chamber from their offices to hear me speak, since they have certainly not come to vote."
"I would like to thank them because there have never before been so many Members as there are today to hear me."
"I am infinitely grateful to you all."
"I must tell you that I dreamt that Mr Berlusconi came into the Chamber at the end of December to report on the work done during this term-in-office in Europe."
"In the dream, Mr Schultz stood up once again and, turning to Mr Berlusconi, said: ‘Mr Berlusconi, what would you do if you fell ill when travelling in Europe, for example here in France?’"
"Hearing this, Mr Berlusconi grasped his genitals – as we do in Italy – to ward off danger and then said: ‘Mr dear Mr Schultz, I will go a great deal further than this Commission Charter, which is already significant."
"When Italy has the Presidency of the Council and I am President-in-Office again in thirteen and a half years’ time, I will endeavour to ensure that all the citizens can travel throughout Europe to receive treatment for all illnesses."
"Remember, therefore, to vote for this document and to show my satisfaction for this wonderful health Charter’."
"Madam President, it is excellent that we are dealing with this European health card on a first reading."
"We should bear in mind, as the Commissioner has pointed out, that it has taken two and a half years to get to this point through negotiations with five presidencies."
"Nevertheless, this is a tangible reality for citizens of Europe."
"It is a tangible way of bringing Europe closer to the citizens and I would support the view that this card should, in fact, have a European logo and should be very clearly identified as a European benefit for citizens."
"The forms that it is replacing – E111, E128, E110, and E119 – sound more like food additives than health passports, but I am pleased that this card will now replace those in good time."
"We also need to insist – rather than simply recommending – that Member States ensure people know that this card is available, that they know how to apply for it, how it can be used and what their rights will be."
"Madam President, I have an even bigger audience than Mr Fatuzzo so let me be positive and say that, after the introspection of the Court of Auditors debate and the criticism that we heard, it is really refreshing to have a debate on something with so little criticism, something which is so positive for EU citizens."
"I want to stress what the Commissioner said: this is a tangible benefit making free movement a reality for ordinary EU citizens."
"While congratulating the rapporteur, I should also like to ask – if this card is to become a reality – that the Commission and all MEPs stress to Member State governments that they must not see this merely as a technical step forward."
"Advertising is needed, and, as Mr Crowley said, proper training for doctors so that they accept the health card and ensure that this is seen as the success story that it so obviously is."
"There are very few criticisms here."
"Let us go out and publicise the fact that the health card is a benefit that makes free movement, as set out in the Treaties, something of a reality."
". Madam President, it was impressive that there was a consensus on all sides of Parliament."
"There was an agreement, and we all agree that we have a success story here."
"We have tried to simplify the procedures, so I should like to assure you that there will be no new institution responsible for issuing the card, no new services or new people."
"The same people in the Commission will go on dealing with the issue, and the Member States will continue with the same procedures."
"As far as the card is concerned, I should like to clarify that the European Health Insurance Card is not a health card like others we know in certain Member States."
"It does not contain the information concerning the health status of the cardholder."
"It is interesting that we now have a regulation which is clear, simple and which facilitates the everyday life of workers in the European Union."
"The extent of the differences between the Member States' health systems meant that it was not an easy issue to agree on, but in the end – thanks to the consensus and to the political will coming from the Member States – we have agreed on this regulation."
"My second point concerns the procedures."
"I believe this agreement answers some of those voices at European level that claim that Europe is becoming more and more complicated."
"They say it is very difficult to agree on complicated social issues, but here, 15 Member States with different social protection systems have agreed and now we have a common single regulation."
"My third point concerns not only the substance but the symbolism of the European card."
"As many Members of Parliament have already said, the European citizens will have the euro in one pocket and the European health card in the other pocket: a real symbol of social Europe."
"Mrs Jensen has done an excellent job and I should like to congratulate her again."
"It was not easy to strike a balance and achieve an agreement on all sides of Parliament."
"The Commission accepts Amendments Nos 8 to 34."
"In the light of the agreement, Amendments Nos 1 to 7 are no longer applicable."
"I believe that now, after Parliament's first reading, it will be possible to adopt the regulation before the end of the Italian presidency."
"–That concludes the debate."
"The vote will take place shortly."
"– Mr President, I rise on a point of order."
"Can someone please explain to me who makes the decision arbitrarily to change the time of the vote in this Parliament without a by-your-leave?"
"We are told that a vote is going to happen at a certain time and it never seems to be the case."
"If it is possible to break a sitting for a formal sitting on the nail, why is it not possible to take the vote at the time which is announced without there being too much difficulty?"
"Many Members of this House are getting fed up with these delays and want to know what the answer is."
"If I find out I shall let you know!"
"The next item is the vote on a request for urgent procedure to be applied to the proposal for a Council regulation concerning transitional measures for the reform of the Staff Regulations, in particular with regard to pay and pensions (COM(2003) 612 C5-0492/2003 2003/0241(CNS))."
". The European Commission wishes to take advantage of the vote by the European Parliament on the so-called request for urgent procedure for the reform of Staff Regulations to point out that it intends to stick firmly by its proposal for the general reform of Staff Regulations."
"This proposal was approved by the Commission on 18 November."
"The proposal in question takes account of a series of amendments which were proposed by the European Parliament and accepted by the Commission, including the provisions for officials working for the political groups of the European Parliament."
"(1)"
"The next item is the vote."
"Mr President, I would like to thank all those who are going to support the conclusion at first reading of the debate on a regulation that we hope will be able to enter into force on 1 January 2004, as planned."
"I would like to thank the draftsperson, Mrs Sauquillo, the Commission, the Council and all those who will accept my compromise amendments and thus allow the report to be adopted today, just in time to ensure that the regulation enters into force on 1 January next year."
"This is an extremely innovative report which, for the first time, gives Community resources to third countries so that they can help us to combat illegal immigration in their territory."
". – Mr President, as rapporteur, I am obliged to make a comment and recommend the rejection of the amendments other than those originating from the Committee of which I am Chairperson."
"I would, though, like to observe at the very outset that, whatever the different political groups to which we belong, we worked together very well on this, and this is particularly true in the case of Mrs Hermange – the rapporteur of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs – and myself."
"Although it was no longer possible for that committee to put together an opinion and vote on it, we are voting the same way."
"I would furthermore like to make it clear that we disregarded group boundaries in voting together on one point on which the House has taken a political decision, namely the reduced rate of tax for labour-intensive services, and were outraged to hear Commissioner Bolkestein say yesterday evening that he envisages extending this for only six months, even though even the Council is thinking in terms of two years and we in terms of six."
"The Legal Service told the Committee that Amendment No 22, which is before us today, was not permissible, and the Committee voted it down for that reason."
"I fear, though, that Amendment No 22 could, today, politically speaking, send out the wrong message."
"The plenary can of course be wiser than a Committee, and so I recommend that it adopt Amendment No 22, thereby making a clear statement that we are extending the lower rate of VAT for labour-intensive services beyond 31 December 2003."
"In exactly the same way, by means of Amendment No 21, we can do the same for films."
"– Mr President, I am very much in favour."
"Mrs Randzio-Plath was right to correct her group’s list."
"We tabled Amendment No 22 so as to ensure that the trial involving reduced VAT rates for highly labour-intensive services could continue beyond 31 December of this year."
"That is what the reporter wants and that is what we all want."
"The oral amendment is purely editorial in nature."
"Instead of stipulating that the date of 31 December is replaced by the date referred to in Article 2 of the new directive – which concerns the date of entry into force of that new directive – we have worded it more clearly, so that 31 December 2003 is replaced by the date of entry into force of the new directive."
"It is therefore the same thing, but our legal experts thought that it was better to word it in this way."
"Consequently, all those who want to indicate that it should be possible for the reduced VAT rates to be retained, if the state so wishes, should vote in favour of our amendment, as corrected."
"(1)"
"(2)"
"– I simply want to make the wording more precise, because I think that the original wording was not very easy to understand."
"At the end of the amendment proposed by Mr Corbett, and with his agreement, I propose that the amendment should be worded as follows, ‘the introduction, in Article 1(2), of equality between women and men, which should, however, be regarded as a value and not simply as a principle’."
".– I applaud the Commission on this initiative to adopt measures to reduce the emission of atmospheric pollutants by ships."
"Sea transport is responsible for a significant part of the pollution in coastal regions and also contributes to global warming."
"Contrary to what many people believe, ships can be shown to be one of the most polluting means of transport, a fact that has been compounded by the increasingly strict legislation on fuels for road vehicle engines."
"Hence the importance of these measures for ship engines also."
"I consider, however, that the measures proposed by the Commission fall short of the objectives that this initiative is intended to achieve."
"Without running the risk of falling into a utopian programme, I believe we could go a little further, along the lines of what the rapporteur proposes, towards drawing up a bolder plan."
"As is also pointed out in the report, the Commission proposal also does not provide the necessary link with the European Union’s fifth and sixth environmental action plans. It makes good sense, therefore, to improve the text by taking a line that is consistent with what already exists on this subject in Community legislation."
"I voted for the report."
"."
"Although this area of indirect tax is reviewed every two years, the Labour delegation for the UK sees no reason to change the current Annex H. This, we believe, should be the responsibility of the national governments as long as they are non-distortive in terms of trade and industry."
". The differences in law found within the national legal systems of the various Member States of the European Union place the relatives of persons who have died in a Member State other than their own in a particularly distressing situation."
"The necessary formalities, which are inevitably more complex in such cases, the extra time required and the higher costs incurred by victims’ families make a painful and very sensitive time even more dismal. Furthermore, the international legal instruments that apply to these situations are inadequate, given current levels of mobility amongst the citizens, an aspect that takes on greater importance for the freedom of movement of persons in the intra-Community area and which increases the likelihood of such situations occurring."
"I agree in particular with the rapporteur’s assertion that freedom of movement is hampered by this legal framework, especially because equal treatment between Community citizens and nationals is not fully respected."
"Because I believe that the rapporteur’s suggestions are heading in the right direction, providing for the practical adoption of measures and ending the inactivity of the European Commission in this regard, I voted in favour."
"I will pass your comments on to the President of Parliament, who will raise the matter at the Conference of Presidents.(1)"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 4 December 2003.(1)"
"The final draft agenda as drawn up pursuant to Rules 110 and 110a of the Rules of Procedure by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday, 11 December 2003 has been distributed."
"I have received no requests for changes."
"Mr President, I am not exactly sure if I am on the order of business. However, I should like to ask, if possible, for the vote on the directive on environmental liability which we are debating tonight not to be held at noon tomorrow but for it to be held at noon on Wednesday."
"I know very well, both from my group and from other political groups, that they are still discussing various issues relating to the vote, how it is organised, and so on."
"The deadlines were abysmal."
"So, if there is no major problem, I would be most grateful if the vote could be held at noon on Wednesday."
"The problem is, Mr Papayannakis, that under the Rules of Procedure, the services must receive requests for changes to the order of business at least one hour before the opening of the sitting."
"No such request has been received, and so, if I follow the Rules, I should dismiss your request."
"Are there any other comments on this matter?"
"– Mr President, although this may have been formally incorrect, I have to assume that an agreement has been reached that the vote will indeed be deferred."
"The groups thought that we could attempt to resolve the problem – or problems – in good time, so that we could keep to the original timetable, but it has turned out in the meantime that these attempts have – so far at least – proved fruitless."
"In that case, we too on our side of the House could support this if you regard it as feasible."
"Mr President, I must draw the attention of this House to the fact that this is a major codecision text in second reading, for which we require a qualified majority to pass amendments."
"Given the relatively low attendance in this House on Thursdays - I make no comment about why that is - it is quite unacceptable for a major codecision text of this kind to be taken on a Thursday. I would strongly advise against taking this text."
"I speak as the deputy coordinator of my Group on the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which is leading on this text."
"I should like to clarify matters."
"Mr Papayannakis wants the vote to be taken on Wednesday instead of Tuesday, in which case it would be reasonable to assume that the requisite number of Members would be present."
"Under the Rules, no change should be made because I did not receive a request in writing."
"However, if the House wishes to accommodate the request, I am prepared to use our common sense collectively to do so."
". – Mr President, as rapporteur, I should like to echo Mr Papayannakis’ request and call for the vote to be moved from Tuesday to Wednesday, the reason being the problems caused by the amendments not having been translated into a number of languages."
"This will then also give the various groups the opportunity of concluding compromises."
"However – and I support Mr Harbour in this – I would certainly not be in favour of moving the vote to Thursday."
"After all, then we run the risk, this being a codecision procedure, of being left with a limited number of people and of not reaching the quorum, particularly as we are nearing Christmas."
"I am therefore in favour of moving the vote to Wednesday."
"This compromise could then be the starting shot for all groups and rapporteurs to join together in guiding this report through the process."
"I get the impression that perhaps the groups would agree to having the vote on Wednesday."
"Mr President, we have the same problem with the Lisi report concerning the conciliation on compensation and assistance to air passengers."
"What is regrettable is that, on Thursdays, Members leave during the vote, and that is a real problem."
"So, either these votes, which really are extremely important and require a qualified majority, are indeed transferred to Wednesday, or they take place on Thursday, but right at the beginning of the sitting, so that we do in fact have the quorum needed."
"We have made several points here."
"Concerning Mr Papayannakis' request, in the light of the exchange of views we have had, despite the fact that no request was made in writing, it seems that we have a consensus to move the vote to Wednesday."
"As regards Thursday, that is when we have the annual budget vote."
"The House had better be quorate indeed more than quorate or we risk having no budget."
"So, on Thursday it will be business as usual."
"Last week at the Conference of Presidents I announced that work to replace the simultaneous interpretation equipment in Strasbourg has now been completed."
"However, for technical reasons, the ring on your microphones, which normally appears as red when you speak, will not work during this session."
"Please press the speaking button as usual and then proceed in the hope and let us hope, the certainty that your microphone will work, even though the red light will not be on."
"I should like to welcome members of a delegation from the Romanian Senate to the Official Gallery."
"They are led by Mr Nicolae Pătru, Chairman of the Committee for Agriculture of the Senate."
"They have come to Strasbourg on a familiarisation visit."
"They are very welcome."
"– Mr President, it is very kind of you to allow me the floor."
"I have to say something that relates to you."
"I was in my electoral district this morning, and when I opened the newspapers, I learned that you are to receive the international Charlemagne Prize in Aachen next year."
"Speaking quite personally, I would like to extend to you my wholehearted congratulations on this."
"Mr Laschet, who is a member of the Charlemagne Prize committee, does not appear to be in the Chamber."
"He is a Christian Democrat, and so I do not always agree with his decisions; indeed, on the contrary I sometimes think they are quite wrong, but his choice of you as a nominee for this prize is one that I can firmly endorse, and I would like to warmly congratulate you, not only for myself, but also, I believe, on behalf of most of the members of this House."
"In his absence I should like to thank Mr Laschet."
"The award is to be presented in May 2004, some weeks before the election."
"In addition to the personal honour, of which I am very conscious, it is a wonderful tribute to the role of the European Parliament in an election year and I would be happy to receive the award in that context on behalf of this House and the contribution it makes to European Union affairs."
"Mr President, I would like to reply to the comments that have been made in previous months at this point on the agenda by Members of the GUE/NGL Group criticising the situation in Latvia, and in particular the position of Russian speakers."
"It seems to me that many of those comments have been unfair and misleading."
"They do not refer back to the illegal Soviet occupation of Latvia, nor indeed to the Hitler-Stalin or Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact."
"I believe that the comments were politically motivated, ignoring the very great diversity within Russian-speaking Latvians."
"My final point - because I believe an official rebuttal is needed - is on the Latvian electoral law."
"My understanding is that former members of the KGB are not permitted to stand for election; it seems to me that is in accordance with the national legislation."
"In this House I am sure we welcome all the new Member States into the European Union."
"It is important that we understand the sensitivities and the histories of those countries."
"I hope there will be no further comments from the GUE/NGL Group on this subject."
"Mr President, at a time when I believe that we will all be very concerned about mobility because of the New Year celebrations, I would like to report to you and also to the Italian Presidency an extremely distinctive situation that affects Italian residents in Belgium."
"Did you know that long-term Italian residents in Belgium today still have to go to their place of birth to renew their identity card?"
"Furthermore, if by any chance they decide to do without it and to instead use a passport – the cost of which I will leave you to imagine – and if they have the misfortune, or the good fortune, of being divorced, then they still have to ask the consent of their ex-spouse."
"All this may seem rather trivial but I think that the Italian Presidency will be able to see that it prevents part of its population from having a completely European mobility and, as a result, from having a little more faith in Europe."
"Perhaps you could pass on these remarks to the Italian Presidency?"
"Mr President, firstly I would like to refer to the tragedy of today's dead-heat parliamentary election result in Turkish Northern Cyprus which is insufficient to oust Mr Denktash, who actively opposes the generous US-Annan plan to reunify the island in time to join the European Union next May."
"Can you appeal to Mr Denktash to reopen negotiations urgently and accept that the huge swing against him in the election indicates a desire by his impoverished people for a settlement on the island?"
"Secondly, in Russian Daghestan we have once again seen the brutal action of Chechen guerrillas who beheaded the border guard commander and took hostages including local hospital workers."
"This is against the backdrop of a suicide bomber in Moscow last week killing six innocent civilians."
"I should like to ask you to send to the Speaker of the new Duma, which is being convened next week, this House's expression of condolences and outrage against such terrorist actions."
"Finally, on a different note, I congratulate Prime Minister Berlusconi on securing for historic and gastronomic Parma the seat of the Food Safety Agency."
"Mr President, I wish to inform the House of the ban on Som Ràdio in the Balearic Islands."
"The newly elected government in the Balearic Islands, which belongs to the PP Party, has banned its broadcasts."
"Som Ràdio was the sole broadcaster using the Catalan language, which is the official language in Majorca, Minorca and Ibiza."
"A few months ago we talked about the prohibition of the newspaper in the Basque country."
"The Spanish Government bans newspapers and radio stations whose opinions differ from its own, especially when the issue is that another language, such as Catalan or Basque, is involved."
"Another example of disgraceful behaviour was the position of the Spanish Government on the European Constitution last Saturday in Brussels, which we find unacceptable and which my party and I are completely against."
"As you can see, the Spanish Government does not only ban the European Constitution."
"Mr President, I am sure that a number of Members like me will be alarmed at suggestions that France is considering a ban on Muslim girls wearing headscarves in its state schools."
"Indeed, a study in France has now suggested that these scarves, Jewish boys' skull caps and other religious symbols are ostentatious and provocative."
"President Chirac has been quoted as saying that for Muslim girls to wear headscarves is a sort of aggression."
"Far be it from me to interfere in French internal politics - I am not a Muslim, indeed I am not a follower of any religion - but my belief is that this would not address the challenge that France faces in integrating Muslims and other minorities into its society."
"In my part of London - Brent, Harrow, Hounslow, Ealing, I could go on - we found that the opposite policy of respect for peoples' differences, respect for their different religions, respect for different practices and heritage, is a much better way of incorporating minorities into societies."
"I hope through you, Mr President, and through our French colleagues here, we can send this message back to President Chirac and the French authorities."
"Mr President, on the last occasion we met I raised a question about the Scotch whisky industry which was of considerable public concern."
"You very kindly, on behalf of the House, took it up with Commissioner Byrne, who is fortuitously here present."
"I am glad to report that the Scotch Whisky Association has reached a consensual settlement of that difficult question for the time being."
"I hope that it will be possible for the whole matter to be resolved through satisfactory industry standards."
"The attention that this House and other public bodies paid to this matter was instrumental in reaching a solution, so I thank you and encourage you all to celebrate the New Year of 2004 with an appropriate beverage!"
"Especially if you are sponsoring it, Mr MacCormick."
"Mr President, the capture of Saddam Hussein in Iraq is to be very much welcomed."
"Nonetheless, the United States' Pentagon website has posted a list of 63 so-called favoured countries which President Bush wants to include in the bidding process for USD 18 billion of contracts to rebuild Iraq."
"Mr Bush has excluded from this list a number of European Member States - including Ireland - which have been long-time allies of the United States."
"This despite the fact that the European Union has donated EUR 40 million of EU taxpayers' money this year, and that this week we will be voting for a further EUR 500 million."
"To add insult to injury, the exclusion of these countries has been deemed as necessary for the protection of the essential security interests of the United States."
"Public opinion in Europe was clearly divided over the question of invading Iraq."
"I was opposed to it."
"I did not believe the justifications given stood up to scrutiny, and this has proven to be the case."
"I would appeal to the Commission, to the incoming Irish presidency and to you, Mr President, particularly as the EU-US Summit will be held during the Irish presidency, to impress upon President Bush the serious misjudgment he is making in this matter and the potential negative consequences for us all in western Europe."
"Mr President, it is Christmas time, which means it is the time for goodwill throughout Europe."
"From the platform of this House, I would like to call on the government of the Federal Republic of Germany to give a present to the Italian ex-military internees, the ex-prisoners condemned to forced labour who have not yet received any compensation for this non-voluntary work."
"I would like to point out that the German Foundation ‘Memory, Responsibility and Future – a direct expression of the German Government and German industry – has decided to exclude Italian ex-military internees alone from this compensation, in conflict with both European Parliament resolution B2-0147/1985 and, most importantly, with all the equal opportunities legislation being developed by Parliament."
"These prisoners, these internees, are no different from the others."
"Even the Austrian Government decided to make good this debt in 2000."
"The deadline for submitting applications is 31 December."
"Mr President, I would like to ask you a question: in view of the fact that there is a resolution on this matter drafted by Mr Borghezio but that the timeframes will be very long, why does the German Government not act immediately?"
"The harsh statistics tell us that the numbers fall by 10% each year."
"We cannot accept this resolution."
"Mr President, at a time when the World Trade Organization is meeting in Geneva, I wish to draw attention to the need to revise current policies for liberalising trade, in order to promote fair and equitable trading systems that are geared towards genuinely enabling each country to develop its true potential, towards solving the problems of poverty, towards promoting better living conditions, without imposing relationships of dominance and dependence."
"Mr President, it is important that this Parliament discusses the current Commission mandate, given the failure of the WTO Ministerial Summit in Cancún to conclude any agreements, and that we make the appropriate proposals for the future which take account of these concerns."
"On the very day that this meeting is taking place in Geneva, the Commission must take account of these concerns."
"Mr President, I wanted, all the same, to respond to our fellow Member who took the liberty of addressing Parliament on an issue which is only an issue for French internal policy."
"I would like to stress that it is not acceptable for Members of the European Parliament to interfere in a country’s internal politics."
"It is good to draw attention to this rule, especially at a time when Europe in general, and Parliament in particular, is criticised for meddling in everything."
"Mr President, France is, as everyone knows, a secular state."
"Secularism is an essential value for French people and it is an intrinsic part of our culture."
"The Islamic headscarf is a sign of oppression of women, a sign of male superiority."
"This is unacceptable for French people, but also for every man and woman that advocates humanism."
"In this House we campaign for equality between men and women."
"The issue of the Islamic headscarf is a complex one and we hope that some of our fellow Members will not compound this complexity with their certitudes."
"If they possess the truth, then good for them."
"As for us, we are searching for the truth, and we will make every effort to promote the secularism that is the only hope for peace between all religions."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate Spain and Poland on their courageous and principled stand at the recent IGC, which resulted in the failure of the wretched draft Constitution."
"However, I regret that it failed over voting weights, which is essentially a technical issue, when it would have been better had it failed by rejecting in principle this massive step in European integration for which there is no public demand."
"There is a disturbing parallel emerging between the political of the EU on the one hand and the former USSR on the other."
"Both were obsessed with their own narrow vision of the unification of their continents."
"Both showed an arrogant disregard for the ambitions and aspirations of ordinary people and eventually we shall be able to say that both failed."
"Mr President, I am almost ashamed to mention a simple news item at a time when international news is so important and at a time when we are lamenting the failure of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"In my country, in my region, workers have taken the managers of their company hostage."
"That is reprehensible, and, we are told, it is not a socially acceptable way of negotiating."
"Just after the acceptance of the French plan was achieved in the Commission – and I would say after a long brave struggle – Alstom decided to quite simply close one of its companies in my region, to relocate it to Montrouge, near Paris."
"If a Europe for workers envisages acknowledging that a restructuring plan, accepted by the Commission, will lead to such protectionist measures, then this is a deplorable vision."
"We should not then be surprised that managers are taken hostage by workers when there are no longer other means of negotiation."
"Mr President, the dramatic events of the weekend should not go unnoticed in this Parliament, so let us send our congratulations to the forces of the United States and Britain and other coalition countries whose valiant efforts have ensured over the weekend that the tyrant Saddam Hussein is now in custody."
"Those two countries and others have ensured that democracy and freedom can flower in Iraq, where perhaps in the past they would not have done so."
"Secondly, echoing the comments made by Mr Helmer, we should congratulate the Polish and Spanish Governments on ensuring that this wretched Constitution may be delayed."
"Perhaps that view may not get cheers inside this Parliament but it will get many cheers in the homes and streets of the countries we all represent."
"Let us welcome that move and congratulate them on their achievement."
"We will all have the opportunity tomorrow morning, with the Italian Presidency, to bring our collective wisdom to bear on those issues."
"Mr President, while General Wesley Clark a certified, as yet unindicted war criminal testified at the so-called International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia in absolute secrecy, the Deputy Registrar of the same 'Tribunal' has issued a decision banning practically all contact between the former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and the outside world."
"A similar decision was taken for Mr Vojislav Seselj."
"Both are candidates on the list of the Socialist Party of Serbia for the elections on 28 December."
"Whatever opinion one might have on the Milosevic case, it is more than obvious that the ban is a punitive measure in order to prevent Mr Milosevic from exercising his right of freedom of speech and his right, pursuant to Serbian law, to stand as a candidate in the electoral process."
"Thus the Deputy Registrar's decision is a blunt intervention in the Serbian elections in favour of those who sold their country to the imperialist powers and an attempt to deny the people of Serbia the right to decide their own fate."
"Last but not least, it is a clear threat to the civil rights of all of us."
"Mr President, I would like to place on record my appreciation to Mr Berlusconi for the gift of a tie."
"That was a very kind gesture from the Italian presidency."
"I assume lady Members may have received scarves, though I am surprised that we do not see any of the ladies wearing scarves here this afternoon."
"I wish to say that on 25 September 2003 Parliament passed a resolution requiring the Commission to answer certain questions on the regulation of Lloyd's of London and to give information by 15 November 2003."
"That was not received, though a promise was received from the Commission, dated 18 November, that information would be received by 15 December."
"Last week I was assured by Commissioner Bolkestein's office that information would be available."
"I regret to inform the House, as rapporteur on this item, that I have yet to see any of these documents."
"I understand that the British Government is seriously censoring such documents as may be made available."
"Unless you can advise me to the contrary that they have now been received, I hope that we can send a gentle but nonetheless firm reminder to the Commission to honour its promises."
"I am not in a position to give such confirmation."
"I will wait until 16 December to see if that is true."
"Then we could remind the Commission of its failure to honour the deadline for the forwarding of that material."
"Mr President, I have listened to Mr Beasley repeat the shameless arguments that, in Latvia and Estonia, they are flagrantly violating the rights of almost half the population in these countries, who were born and have worked there and whose only crime is that they are of Russian extraction or speak Russian."
"These people are being forced with humiliating examinations to abandon their country."
"At the same time, communist parties are banned in these countries and their cadres are being persecuted, as are the veterans of the anti-fascist war, and monuments are being erected in honour of the SS and the Nazi conquerors."
"At the same time, the universities are being closed, while the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is being forced to open universities and to ensure the Albanian minority, 25% of the population, is represented in the parliament and in the government."
"The problem is that similar views and these sorts of violations are also being supported by the Commissioner materially responsible for enlargement, Mr Verheugen, and by the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, who said in a recent response to my letter that, in his view, the ban on a communist party was no reason to censure a country by preventing it from becoming a member of the European Union."
"However, because the communist parties in the Member States of the European Union are still legal, I fear that this is a foretaste of autocratic and anti-democratic measures to come."
"That is why I am protesting, and I have insisted today also that this protest on my part go on record."
"You did so in twice the time allowed."
"As a result you can explain to your colleague, who will be excluded from speaking in this item, why that is so."
"Mr President, Julio Medem's film is a bid to start dialogue using the metaphor of the Basque national game."
"It has been highly acclaimed by the Basque people, but has been condemned by the Spanish Government and by ¡Basta Ya!, the Sakharov Prize winner in this Parliament two years ago."
"For the Spanish nationalists, political dialogue in the Basque country is unacceptable because, as they say, it would mean agreeing with the will of ETA."
"As a matter of fact, those reactions may be the film's strongest endorsement, as its current success proves."
"Last week the Spanish Government announced a change in the criminal code, making authorities that consult their citizens through referenda liable to prison sentences."
"This could also affect citizens who participate in the consultation procedure."
"From this morning, Mr Maragall, the new president of Catalonia, like Mr Ibarretxe in the Basque country, risks coming under these legal provisions."
"Mr President, honourable Members, in your experience as politicians have you ever heard of any purportedly democratic government behaving in a similar way?"
"Mr President, I have requested the floor following the speech by Mr Gorostiaga."
"It is difficult to understand his approach, since he is confusing a film with a provision by a government which intends to guarantee democracy."
"And, furthermore, you say this as a representative of a political party which is illegal in Spain, which defends terrorists and kills those of us who defend our ideas."
"Mr Gorostiaga, your approach is totally out of line with what we in this House defend: freedom of expression, which you do not defend in any of your considerations and even less in your speech this afternoon."
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0387/2003) from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the Council common position adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on setting standards of quality and safety for the donation, procurement, testing, processing, preservation, storage and distribution of human tissues and cells (10133/3/2003 – C5-0416/2003 – 2002/0128(COD)) (Rapporteur: Peter Liese)."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what is at issue here is the transplantation of cells and tissues, a fast-growing branch of medicine."
"Although it will not cure all the things that people are currently promising it will, the transplantation of cells and tissues will, in future, be able to help many people who suffer from hitherto incurable illnesses."
"Even today, people can survive them by means of the transplantation of bone marrow, heart valves and skin, and the new biotechnological discipline of tissue engineering will certainly lead to new triumphs in the future."
"It does have its risks, though, such as, for example, the transmission of pathogens or the uncontrolled growth of cells, which can result in cancer, and the ethical problems associated with it must always, of course, be considered."
"We must make use of the opportunities presented by this technology, while limiting its risks."
"I believe that Parliament’s amendments to the Common Position, which are before you, make an important contribution in this regard."
"In the course of the past week, we have succeeded in coming to an agreement with the Italian Presidency of the Council on a whole range of amendments, which means that, what you will be voting on tomorrow at midday is a package of compromises to which the Council has already agreed with the permanent representatives, and if this House adopts it, we can avoid a conciliation procedure."
"I am grateful to all those who have helped to bring this agreement about, especially to the Italian Council Presidency, and most particularly to the Minister of Health, Professor Sirchia, who has personally committed himself to it."
"My thanks go also to the Commission’s staff and, of course, to my fellow-Members as well."
"Above all else, Parliament aimed to prevent the donation of cells and tissues being commercialised, and, to a large extent, we have succeeded in achieving this important objective."
"In contrast to the vague wording proposed by the Council and the Commission, the agreement we now have makes provision for unambiguous rules."
"We draw a distinction between payment for the donation of cells and tissues, which is to be prohibited, and compensation for costs incurred by a donor, which is perfectly permissible."
"We want the compensation to be clearly defined and the Member States to shoulder their responsibility in this regard."
"It was at this point that great controversy erupted, with the Council and the Commission initially contending that Parliament’s demands lacked any basis in law."
"We were, however, able to persuade them both that a non-commercial approach was called for not only in terms of considerations of ethics, but also of health protection."
"It is quite simply unthinkable, for example, that one should offer a great deal of money for the donation of cells and tissues and only then ask the donor whether he is at any sort of medical risk."
"The possibility of medical risks being concealed is always a factor when large amounts of money are involved, and this presents dangers not only for the donor but also for the recipient."
"We have also made it clear that there is to be no trading in cells and tissues as such, but that there is no objection to trading in medicines manufactured from them."
"As is made clear in one of the recitals, industry has an important part to play in this."
"This House takes the view that a ban on commercialisation is an absolute necessity, being something that is not merely included in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, but also a requirement on which Parliament has insisted on repeated occasions, both within Europe and outside it."
"Let me take this opportunity to mention a visit to this House on Wednesday by a Ukrainian woman who campaigns for human rights, who will, on that occasion, be describing instances in which new-born children are taken away from their parents, the suspected purpose of this being the transplantation of their organs or tissues."
"Even outside Europe, I believe, we have to keep a watchful eye on this."
"At first reading, this House also called for a comprehensive ban on the cloning of human beings, which we have not been able to persuade the Council to accept."
"The Council of Ministers firmly refused to accept this amendment, and, in the negotiations, I no longer insisted on it in order to avoid the need for a conciliation procedure."
"This does not, however, mean that Parliament has changed its opinion about this."
"I believe this to be another area in which safety considerations demand that we be very careful, and we will continue to keep a watchful eye on this in future."
"In addition to this, we have also managed to bring about a whole range of further improvements, with better-framed provisions on anonymity, reinforcement of Parliament’s rights in the event of the directive being amended, and a series of clarifications on, among other things, the import of cells and tissues."
"The cumulative effect of these small improvements in these areas is to clarify the Common Position and to make it more precise, and the non-commercialisation aspect has been greatly improved."
"I can therefore recommend that the Members of this House, tomorrow morning, vote to adopt the compromise amendments, which have been submitted by several groups and negotiated with the Council, and to do so in the interests of unambiguous regulation and an improved Common Position."
". Mr President, eight months have passed since I had the pleasure of addressing you on the Commission’s proposal for a directive establishing quality and safety requirements for human tissues and cells."
"Since that occasion in April 2003 there has been a considerable amount of effort, discussion and negotiation on the part of Parliament and the Council in order to arrive at the compromise before you today."
"I am fully aware of the tremendous work that these institutions have undertaken with the Commission over the recent months."
"Let me specifically express my appreciation to the rapporteur and to the members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy for all their hard work on this important proposal."
"The compromise package will ensure that the increasing number of patients in Europe who are treated with human tissues and cells can trust that these substances are not only safe but also of good quality."
"It constitutes another step forward in the regulatory framework on substances of human origin under Article 152 that we initiated a couple of years ago with the blood directive."
"In my view, the main concerns of the European Parliament have been successfully addressed in the compromise – and that is very much down to your rapporteur."
"Let me now turn to some of the key concerns."
"I appreciate the difficult issues the Environment Committee had to address – in particular regarding ethics and other related issues."
"The Commission is willing to accept the compromise position that strikes a balance between Parliament’s wish to 'ensure' voluntary and unpaid donations, and the current proposal, which 'encourages' such donations."
"This amendment would introduce the wording 'endeavours to ensure' voluntary and unpaid donations and the idea of compensation in specific cases, leaving the responsibility of defining such compensation to the Member States themselves."
"I must, however, make it clear that this compromise solution goes to the very limit of what the Commission believes to be legally acceptable, given the restrictions of the Treaty."
"The Council of Europe and the European Group on Ethics have stressed the principle of not-for-profit procurement of tissues and cells."
"The directive should therefore accord with this principle."
"However, I must draw a distinction between the act of procurement, to which the 'not-for-profit' principle should apply, and the secondary activities, such as the further processing, manipulation, testing, or the manufacturing of products, to which it should not apply."
"For example, whilst it might be considered unacceptable to take heart valves from a deceased donor and sell them, heart valves need to be treated to ensure the absence of infectious agents and preserved so that they can be stored for a longer period."
"These and other processes that have served to improve the quality and usefulness of the heart valve should not be constrained by the 'not-for-profit' principle."
"This point has been clarified in the compromise package."
"Some amendments refer to prohibition of the use of 'cells derived from cloned embryos' for 'transplantation' – so-called 'therapeutic cloning'."
"Such applications remain highly controversial with no consistent opinion amongst the Member States as to either their ethical legitimacy or their safety."
"I would add that there is no likelihood of any such opinion emerging in the near future."
"We therefore consider it necessary to refrain from interference regarding decisions to be made by individual Member States on the use or non-use of any specific type of human cells or tissues."
"I believe the best solution is to set a Community framework on safety and quality requirements with sufficient scope to cover the use of such cells in those Member States where it is permitted."
"The compromise package reinforces the thrust of the Commission proposal in this respect."
"Anonymity is another important issue."
"It is generally accepted that tissue and cell donation should respect the anonymity of both donors and recipients."
"This principle aims first to respect the confidentiality of the donor and the recipient, and second, to encourage altruistic donations."
"The common position introduces the possibility for Member States to maintain or adopt different legislation in exceptional circumstances, such as the right of a child to know the genetic parents in case of the donation of gametes."
"I can accept further clarification of the rights of Member States to make exceptions."
"Finally, a word on organs."
"While the quality and safety of organs is indeed important, priority at this stage should be given to addressing the serious shortages of organs and the prevention of organ trafficking."
"The Commission wishes to reflect on how it could best address the concerns of Parliament in this sensitive area."
"We need first to get the overall framework right before proposing specific solutions."
"To this end, the Commission is willing to present a declaration as follows: 'The important differences between organ transplantation and the use of other human substances such as blood, tissues and cells mean that a specific approach for organs in order to ensure safety and quality is necessary."
"Such an approach in the current situation characterised by shortages of organs has to balance two factors: the need for organ transplantation, which is usually a matter of life and death, with the need to ensure high standards of quality and safety."
"The Commission believes that before considering any proposal it is necessary to conduct a thorough scientific evaluation of the situation regarding organ transplantation."
"The Commission will present a report on the conclusions of the analysis it undertakes as soon as possible.'"
"To conclude, I look forward to your endorsement of the orientation presented in the compromise package."
"I believe that if Parliament and the Council can endorse the amendments, so too can the Commission."
"I will be very disappointed if we cannot reach agreement."
"Discussions on the 70 amendments would be very complicated, and I very much doubt whether we would arrive at a better solution than that offered by this compromise package."
"– Mr President, I advocate here the position adopted by Parliament at first reading."
"We wanted to safeguard the voluntary and unpaid donation of cells and tissues and ban the trade in unmodified cells and tissues, while at the same time protecting industrial activity in this area."
"The Council wanted to abrogate Parliament’s position on non-payment, suggesting it was an ethical question outside the competence of the EU."
"In my opinion it would be a big mistake to exclude ethical issues from EU decision-making, especially when we talk about a Community which likes to call itself a community of values."
"Besides, ethical issues rarely arise in isolation in some moral vacuum."
"They are ethical for the very reason that they have an effect on people’s health, for example, as in this case."
"Here we arrive at a key policy issue in which Parliament’s work, under the leadership of my colleague, Peter Liese, is extremely important."
"A certain Italian film director – if in honour of Italy’s presidential term, coming to its end as it is, I may return once again in this House to the subject of Italian films – said that the way you define the angle of view is an ethical choice."
"Ethical issues cannot be passed over, because that in itself is an ethical choice."
"I, who had an education in philosophy, feel compelled to say this."
"We also have a responsibility for how the rest of the world imitates our practices."
"If we allow trade in human body parts we have to bear in mind that the developing countries will follow Europe’s example."
"This sort of commercialisation will lead to exploitation, and, moreover, to increased risk."
"The approach chosen by the Council also risks accusations of inconsistency."
"Several Member States of the European Union have signed a Convention on bioethics which categorically prohibits the financial exploitation of the human body and its parts."
"Our rapporteur’s conclusion is well argued."
"The legal basis of the Directive is Article 152 of the Treaty on European Union, which deals with health matters, but all the ‘ethical issues’ addressed by Parliament are also linked to protecting the health of donors and recipients."
"Any donation made in dubious circumstances, for example in response to financial pressure, is also a danger for the recipient of cells and tissues."
"This view is also widely shared within the Council."
"Mr President, this is an important report and it must be approved and brought into law across Europe as quickly as possible."
"For that reason I can confirm that, although the Socialists did not sign the compromise package of amendments, we will support them as we favour most of them and do not wish to hinder bringing them into law."
"We urgently need this legislation on the quality and safety of tissues and cells across Europe."
"This is a growing sector, with many new opportunities for the relief of pain and suffering and we do not want to stop anyone taking advantage of it."
"Many of the diseases and ailments from which people are currently suffering can be cured by various therapies that can be derived from this sector."
"It is important that, whilst human need is met, standards of health and safety and quality be maintained."
"Ethical standards on donation, confidentiality, freedom of choice and other issues of concern to individual Member States need to be respected and addressed."
"I am glad the Commission has recognised that in terms of the amendments it has accepted from Parliament."
"New technologies, such as embryo stem cell research, cannot be ruled out as sources of future therapies for either medical or ethical reasons."
"We have gone as far as we can to satisfy those people with specific ethical concerns on those issues and with regard to other new technologies."
"We must recognise that our primary duty here today is to ensure the quality and safety of tissues and cells that are going to be used for the relief of human suffering, as they move around the single market to various destinations."
"That is our duty: to give the people of Europe common choice, common opportunities and common relief from many of the diseases and ailments from which they currently suffer."
"Mr President, after more than a year of discussion regarding this directive, the position of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is clear and has remained almost unchanged."
"It has been said that it is a public health directive, as Commissioner Byrne mentioned just now."
"Furthermore, if it is true – and I am answering Mrs Korhola – that ethical principles are at the heart, and form the basis, of the majority of our decisions, then it is not for Europe to regulate and, even less so, to harmonise in this area."
"We must, therefore, concentrate on the amendments that, in practice, meet the needs of potential recipients."
"The report has made much progress along these lines, even in this House, thanks to the tireless work of Mr Liese whom I thank."
"Let us take note that the progress includes effective traceability at all times; the possibility of authorising, in exceptional circumstances, the lifting of anonymity for gamete donations – this was crucial for thousands of infertile couples waiting for the gift of life; and adding to the text an amendment, which I tabled, on information campaigns designed to raise living citizens’ awareness concerning the donation of tissue and cells."
"To move on now to the controversial issue of voluntary and unpaid donation, the liberal group is satisfied with the compromise that was reached, a better compromise than the one reached for directive 100."
"The text specifies that the donation must be made of the donor’s free will without payment, with the exception of possible compensation, for which detailed rules are to be laid down by Member States on the basis of subsidiarity."
"All the same, I am sorry to see that amendments that explicitly encouraged the donation of umbilical cord blood and the registration of potential bone marrow donors were refused."
"As regards organs, the Commission has been promising us a legislative initiative since this was first an issue, because this is a considerable problem taking various forms: organised trafficking, shortage etc."
"So be it!"
"Having said that, and on this issue of the difficulty of finding compatible organs, we could perhaps suggest the inclusion of a proposal, within the framework of this declaration, to encourage European cooperation through the Retransplant consortium."
"Currently, only six countries are involved in it and that is not enough."
"To conclude, Mr President, I welcome the fact that, as regards this issue, which, as we can see, is complex and sensitive, the European law that we are in the process of drawing up in this House establishes first and foremost general principles and rules, which must be flexible and progressive in the interests of putting patients first."
"It was both important and vital not to close the door on genetic research, in particular for stem cells."
"We achieved this and, therefore, I recommend, on behalf of the liberal group, that we adopt, without modification, the overall compromise reached between Mr Liese, the shadow rapporteurs and the Italian Presidency."
"The objective sought with this text, and I would remind you of this, is to resolutely combat shortage and trafficking, and to promote solidarity and quality."
"This is the only message that Europe should send out to the hundreds of thousands of patients waiting for heart valve transplants, corneas, bone cells, donated sperm and oocyte, or simply for reparatory transplants for severe burns."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in April 2003, when there was the debate at first reading of the Liese report, I spoke then on behalf of my group on this important issue."
"On that occasion I mentioned three principles, which led me to reject many amendments."
"The first principle was that the draft directive had a scope that should not, above all, be extended, in particular so as not to reopen the debate on embryonic stem cell research, or even on voluntary abortion."
"The second principle: although, of course, there have to be strict ethical rules, there should not be any religious or sectarian bans of whatever origin."
"The third principle: the human body is not for sale, not to be bought and not to be stolen."
"At the time, the European Parliament broadly followed these principles when voting, thus leaving authors of amendments that could be described as reactionary in the objective sense of the word in the minority."
"During the preparation for the second reading, the rapporteur, Mr Liese, true to his ideas and as pugnacious as ever, once again tried to extend the scope of the draft directive to reopen other debates and perhaps, one day, win the battle that he has regularly lost since the adoption of the sixth Framework Programme on Research and Development."
"I was therefore getting ready, this evening, for a new attack on behalf of a large majority of our fellow citizens, on behalf of many researchers, on behalf of public health and, above all, on behalf of the patients who are waiting for treatments and for transplants."
"Some amendments, which were, moreover, adopted in the committee, seemed to me in fact to be inappropriate, even dangerous."
"I am glad to see that this evening – and perhaps this is a Christmas present – the rapporteur is tabling 21 more or less satisfactory compromise amendments."
"Fortunately they clarify some provisions of the text."
"They clearly set down principles to which we attach importance: that donations are made voluntarily and without payment, although compensation is possible;"
"Member States guarantee these donations; respect for anonymity is confirmed, with the exception of what is stated in Articles 8 and 16 which leave the matter to Member States’ legislation on the basis of subsidiarity; traceability was officially sanctioned and validated."
"I particularly welcome the removal of two amendments: 35, which related to abortion, and 38, which did not distinguish between therapeutic cloning and reproductive cloning."
"As a result, on behalf of my group, I can support the 21 compromise amendments with the Council, accompanied moreover, by some assessments of their legality, which I heard from Commissioner Byrne, and I am glad that common sense largely prevailed."
"I too would, therefore, like to thank the rapporteur Mr Liese, since once is not the norm here, who undoubtedly played a very positive role in drafting these compromise amendments."
"Mr President, I commend Mr Liese for his dedicated work on this very sensitive and technical subject."
"Tomorrow we will vote on a compromise package of 21 amendments."
"The fact that an agreement was struck between Parliament and the Council is, in no small measure, due to the unstinting efforts of the rapporteur, who made every effort to keep all the political groups on side and who vigorously defended the views of Parliament with the other institutions."
"The common position was totally unacceptable from Parliament's point of view."
"The Council gave scant regard to over 50 amendments adopted by this House in the first reading."
"The final deal before us this week is far more reflective of the reality of the Council and Parliament being equal legislators in this area."
"Through our perseverance Parliament has clearly improved on the original proposal."
"As far as ethical principles are concerned, I welcome the more specific language to reinforce the principle of voluntary unpaid donations of cells and tissues."
"I am also very pleased with the new wording in relation to the protection of the anonymity of the donor."
"The wording is now clearer in terms of many crucial aspects: the basic principle that human body parts, be they tissues or cells, must not be treated like some commercially tradable product."
"As regards organs, Parliament has accepted that this directive is not the appropriate place in which to deal with organ transplants."
"Nevertheless, we look forward to a proposal from the Commission on the subject, which is of great importance."
"Regarding the issue of cloning, I would have been happier with the original Amendment No 38, but there are sufficient safeguards included in this compromise."
"Member States have an explicit right to put stringent public health rules in place, including a total exclusion of cloned human material or human animal hybrids, as transplantable material."
"Apart from the clear health risks involved in transplanting cloned material when so much is unknown about the future consequences, I oppose the creation of human life as raw material for tissues and cells."
"I believe this to be a serious violation of human dignity and the right to life as enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"This Parliament has repeatedly voiced its opposition to human cloning and is committed to a universal ban on human cloning."
"In conclusion, my Group supports the compromise and tabled the full set of amendments involved."
"This is an important directive that will, I am sure, be a vital contribution to public health in the European Union by ensuring a high quality of tissues and cells for transplantation, while at the same time respecting fundamental ethical considerations."
"– Mr President, it is unfortunate that nearly all of Parliament’s amendments have been dropped from the common position adopting the directive on setting standards of quality and safety for the donation, procurement, testing, processing, preservation, storage and distribution of human tissues and cells."
"Important points, such as unpaid and voluntary donations, reference to fundamental ethical principles and the request for a directive applying also to organs, have been brushed off the table."
"This is why we have supported the re-submission of these amendments at second reading."
"In order to avoid a stalemate between Parliament and the Council, with a long conciliation procedure to follow, the rapporteur has pulled out all the stops to look for compromises, and, thanks to his considerable efforts, there is now a package of compromise amendments before us."
"Most of these compromises receive our support, even though not everything is exactly as we would like it, but that is one of the essential characteristics of a compromise."
"The compromise on unpaid donations causes us a dilemma."
"Amendment No 31, which clearly states that Member States shall ensure voluntary and unpaid donations, is being traded for a text which states that Member States shall take the necessary measures to encourage voluntary and unpaid donations."
"Paid or involuntary donations within the European Union should be rejected unequivocally."
"Quite apart from the fact that this should be considered unethical, it can also present risks to public health."
"The inclusion of the recital is merely a pretext."
"All things considered, we will support the compromise package, but with precious little enthusiasm."
"The statement that Commissioner Byrne made a moment ago about a directive for organ transplantation only partly meets this House’s wishes as expressed at first reading."
"Nevertheless, I should like to thank him for this, because this has made it clear that this is an area to which priority should be given."
"Mr President, this is a very sensitive issue and Mr Liese and I have crossed swords on it, which is sad because we belong to the same Group."
"Nevertheless, we are both sincere in our views, opposing though they may be."
"As Mr Bowe said, this is a very good and much-needed proposal and I welcome it."
"I also welcome the way in which Mr Liese has been flexible - finally - about the amendments and we now have a chance of getting this legislation on to the statute book as soon as possible."
"However, this issue of tissues and cells and how we deal with it has raised an interesting question about subsidiarity."
"One of the reasons why I have been so stirred up about all this is that I have been on the receiving end of a large number of letters from people in my own country who suffer from Parkinson's Disease, chronic heart disease or diabetes, or from their carers in the case of Alzheimer's Disease."
"People who suffer from these diseases have a life sentence: they do not die, they stay alive and their condition degenerates."
"They know it is degenerating and they know that research that might help them is being carried on, often involving stem cells."
"It is their only ray of hope."
"Let me quote from a letter I received from a constituent in Cornwall."
"Mr Alan Cole from Liskeard suffers from Parkinson's Disease."
"He states: 'Rightly or wrongly, each day I listen to the TV or radio hoping to hear that a cure for Parkinson's Disease is on the way."
"I then become aware of stem cell research and how this might lead to a breakthrough for sufferers like me."
"A ray of hope - albeit a long way off - could be my miracle."
"I then discover that people are opposed to this type of research."
"Who are these people?"
"They cannot possibly suffer with Parkinson's Disease or any other disability.'"
"Who are these people?"
"Well, they are here, sitting in the rather remote European Parliament."
"The decision of whether or not stem cell research should go forward and the kind of research which Mr Liese was dealing with in his report would be much better dealt with in the national context than in some rather remote European one."
"I would also point out that one of the ironies of the situation is that those who suffer from Parkinson's Disease in countries which do not allow this research to be done with stem cells may well benefit from research being done in countries where it is allowed and may, in the end, be very grateful for it."
"The other issue that came up between us was the question of the payment of donors."
"There is a particular situation in the United Kingdom regarding the payment of donors."
"We need to have subsidiarity here so that some countries may go ahead and continue to pay them."
"We now have a compromise."
"Mr Blokland has rightly observed that it is a bit of a fudge."
"However, the text as agreed in Amendment No 69 is an acceptable compromise."
"That is the way forward."
"I regret that we have given the impression in this Parliament that we are against stem cell research."
"In fact we voted for stem cell research to be financed from the EU budget at the last part-session."
"That has now being reversed by the Council of Ministers."
"Let us show that in this debate we are very much in favour of a sensible proposal from the Commission on the safety of tissues and cells and we can all agree, including Mr Liese and myself, in wishing this proposal well."
"Mr President, Commissioner, this is the second reading of a very important legislative measure on specifications for the quality and safety of human tissues and cells for use in transplants, the priority objective of which is to provide a very high level of protection for human health."
"It is a fact that tissues and cells help on a daily basis to restore health, which is why we need to lay down a specific European framework which will guarantee supply and sufficiency and, at the same time, safeguard the physical integrity of those who receive them, of the recipients."
"The demand for tissues and cells in Europe is far greater than the supply; thus the imports necessarily being made from third countries must respect the same legislative framework, because this is the only way to prevent the illegal trade."
"As regards the codes of conduct with which we are so preoccupied, everyone agrees that the new technologies must respect human dignity and the non-commercialisation of the human body."
"At the same time, human tissue and cell donations must be based on the free will of the donor, not the fee."
"The human body, as has been emphasised on numerous occasions, is inviolable and inalienable and must not therefore be turned into a source of financial gain."
"The compromise reached during negotiations satisfactorily covers the above principles."
"The addendum, whereby donors may receive compensation which is severely restricted to compensating the expenses and procedure connected with the donation, does not violate the principle of voluntary donation and allows the Member States to lay down the preconditions under which compensation may be granted."
"It is also a good thing that under this directive, as with blood, the data needed to ensure traceability at all stages are kept for at least thirty years after clinical use."
"Full and in-depth information for the donor, from a trained person, on the purpose, nature, consequences and risks involved in the donation is a necessary precondition to free consent."
"Protection of the donor's details and medical secrecy are, I think, satisfactorily protected by the corresponding points in the annex."
"I should like to mention that, even if the package of compromise amendments does not include other important points approved by the relevant committee of the European Union, I shall ultimately agree, considering that the priority is to get the present directive applied as quickly as possible."
"Of course we are waiting directly for the Commission proposal on the preconditions for organ transplants, as you yourself promised us Commissioner."
"Allow me to conclude by thanking and congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Peter Liese, on his work and on the huge effort which he made for the procedure to be concluded as quickly as possible."
". Mr President, the global agreement put forward today by the rapporteur is a good compromise, which takes on board the key European Parliament amendments while still being in line with the Commission proposal on the essential questions."
"It is good news for patients that we will soon have Community legislation on tissues and cells."
"It also achieves an optimum solution for the updating of technical standards, maintaining all the political issues under the codecision procedure, while leaving the technical details for comitology."
"I note that many of you, including Dr Liese, are not entirely satisfied that the Commission has not offered to go further on the so-called ethical issues."
"This is not because we do not consider ethical standards to be important."
"Quite the contrary: it is precisely because ethical standards are so important to our citizens that we must not overstep the mark."
"I refer to what Mrs Jackson said in relation to subsidiarity, with which I agree."
"The Commission is the guardian of the Treaty."
"We have to respect the advice of our Legal Service – advice echoed by the Legal Service of the Council."
"A satisfactory compromise is proposed today on voluntary and unpaid donation and the non-profit character of the procurement of tissues and cells as such, which reflects the goodwill on all sides."
"A series of amendments aims to limit the use of certain types of cells, such as cells derived from cloning or abortion."
"With this proposal we seek neither to mandate nor to prohibit the use of specific types of cells."
"If, however, any particular use of such cells is authorised in a Member State, then the directive will apply, to require the application of all provisions necessary to protect public health."
"The quality and safety of organs is a major concern of the European Parliament."
"The Commission is acutely aware of the importance of this matter and we have taken concrete steps to address this issue."
"The Commission statement on organs proposed as part of this compromise is a real commitment to continue work in this area and to find the best approach to the current situation, which is characterised by a shortage of organs."
"As I have already said, any approach needs to balance two factors: the need for the transplantation of organs - which is usually a matter of life or death - and the need to ensure high standards of quality and safety of such organs."
"The Commission statement is complemented by the Council statement that it intends to intensify efforts to combat organ trafficking."
"In conclusion, I am very pleased to be able to accept the compromise package on the table today."
"I thank you all once again for your strenuous efforts on this dossier."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at noon."
"The next item is the report (A5-0469/2003) by Klaus-Heiner Lehne, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on takeover bids (COM(2002) 534 – C5-0481/2002 – 2002/0240(COD))."
". Mr President, last October, I presented to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market the new Commission proposal for a takeover bids directive."
"That proposal was aimed primarily at meeting the Parliament's criticism that the earlier proposal had not gone far enough in establishing a level playing field."
"That proposal has been discussed and amended by Member States and, on 27 November 2003, the Competitiveness Council adopted a general orientation on a compromise text presented by the Italian presidency."
"On the same day, Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market adopted Mr Lehne's report, based on the same compromise text."
"At this point, I would like to express my surprise about all the changes in this report between the vote of the Legal Affairs Committee and the plenary session."
"The proposal now on the table is based on the text, dated 7 May 2003, that was worked on during the Greek presidency including multiple voting rights in the scope of the breakthrough and draws on the suggestion put forward by the Portuguese delegation to introduce options for Member States and for companies in the application of Articles 9 and 11."
"I can only repeat here what I already said in the Council."
"Articles 9 and 11 are crucial elements of this proposal."
"Article 9 contains the basic principle that the board of an offeree company may only take defensive measures after prior consultation of the general meeting of shareholders."
"Article 11 makes it possible for an offeror who has acquired 75% of the capital to break through certain defensive mechanisms set up by the offeree company."
"I indicated quite clearly during the discussions that I would not accept as a compromise the deletion of those Articles."
"Nor can I accept an arrangement whereby those Articles are to be made optional."
"That will not achieve the harmonisation that the Commission intended when it tabled this proposal."
"Moreover, it goes back on the level of harmonisation that we agreed last time, before Parliament objected to the first proposal on the grounds that it did not go far enough in establishing a level playing field."
"At the moment no level playing field whatsoever is established."
"Therefore, you will not be surprised that I cannot accept Amendment 5 or Amendment 21, which introduce these optional arrangements."
"I have some difficulties as well with Amendment No 4 and Amendment No 20, last paragraph, concerning 'special rights'."
"This confuses rights in private law and those in public law, which are not covered by the directive."
"I know that time is running out and that we have already spent a great deal of time discussing this proposal."
"However, I do not think that we are sending the right message to the markets by adopting the proposal in its current form."
"Is it really a worthwhile contribution to our project which seeks to build the most competitive market in the world by 2010?"
"I sincerely hope that we can do better, even if we need more time."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this directive’s story is never-ending;"
"Parliament, the Council and the Commission have been discussing this issue for well over 15 years."
"Right now, I have no desire to go through everything that has happened in relation to it in the past."
"I share the Commissioner’s view that something more would have been desirable."
"I still believe that a better solution was represented by the joint initiative that we set in motion during the Greek Presidency of the Council with the aim of finding an overall solution that would create truly uniform conditions of competition in Europe."
"As tends to be the case with political change, we ended up having to make compromises, and the best is the enemy of the good."
"What we have before us is what was negotiated with the Italian Presidency and unanimously adopted in the Council as part of a political agreement and, in essence, the same as what was adopted by this House’s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and by its Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"It is a compromise with which all parties can live under the prevailing circumstances, and that in itself shows that it is a good one."
"We will achieve the goals of which the Commissioner spoke, but, for now, they do no more than indicate what is currently achievable in terms of European law."
"The rest we can leave to the markets."
"We have been given an objective to aim at, but, according to this proposal, it will ultimately be the markets that decide whether or not what is proposed is right, and in which direction things will change."
"Having had in-depth discussions with the various Council Presidencies – starting with the Danes, then with the Greeks, and now with the Italians – we now have the opportunity of wrapping up this issue once and for all."
"The Italian Presidency of the Council has offered us the possibility of completing this procedure in one reading, and, as we are in any case approaching the end of this Parliament, I believe that we should make use of this opportunity."
"Over recent months, the rapporteur and the committees were kept fully and regularly informed of the progress of the deliberations."
"People from all quarters of this House were involved."
"I therefore ask you to vote in favour of the Commission proposal."
"I cannot but note with regret that a number of groups have submitted amendments aimed in particular at further extending the rights of workers."
"It is with reference to them that I wish to make it clear that this compromise already includes workers’ rights; it is explicitly laid down in the compromise reached on Article 9, that the workers’ representatives have to be informed and that they can make a statement, which, together with the board’s statement, must be made available to the shareholders and to the public."
"By way of a compromise, Article 13 ensures that all existing rights of workers to participation and co-determination – be they put in place by the nation states or by Europe – are retained and remain unaffected by this directive."
"Here too, I think, one must be amenable to compromise."
"Rather than constantly wanting to enforce pure doctrine, one must at some point reach a compromise."
"There is something positively paradoxical about a situation in which it is the Socialist governments in the Council that want to prevent workers gaining more rights – the examples I would give are the Swedes and the British Labour Government – while, here in this House, the Left, led by the Socialists, who are willing to let these directives and this proposal fail, even though their own governments, at Council level, are blocking these compromises that go even further."
"This compromise will, in my view, provide adequate protection for workers’ rights."
"There is no reason to go further."
"I would therefore ask you to reject these amendments, for, if you do not – for so we have been told in unambiguous terms by the Council – the whole of the compromise that has been achieved will be in jeopardy."
"If we approve this directive, this compromise, we will be demonstrating the European Union’s capacity to act in difficult times."
"It is for that reason that I ask you to vote in favour."
"We could now bring this never-ending story to a close."
"I want especially to thank all the co-rapporteurs and the shadow rapporteurs from all the groups."
"I want to make especial mention, by name, of Mr Huhne, with whom I have enjoyed the closest possible cooperation. We have run the Rule 162a – enhanced cooperation – procedure very well and have achieved a good result."
"What I ask this House to do is to bring this never-ending story to a full stop by voting in favour and letting the end of this year be marked by a real success for the European Union."
". Mr President, I am not going to make any great claims for this draft directive."
"I fully sympathise with what the Commissioner has said and those who argue that it will not create a level playing field in cross-border takeovers in the Union."
"There is no doubt about that."
"Member States will still be able to sanction their companies to take anti-bid measures with the approval of only the board and not of the shareholders."
"Therefore, it fails to deal with a major potential obstacle to cross-border takeovers and restructuring."
"The choice of whether to apply the rules is only a fig leaf to disguise that reality."
"Many Member States, including some like Germany who proclaim themselves in favour of more political integration, are against foreigners taking over their own companies."
"In Britain we have many hang-ups but, fortunately, not that one."
"We have been losing foreign direct investment due to our failure to join the euro, but the signal that this part of the directive sends out about France and Germany may help to sustain Britain's share."
"For the euro area in particular this failure is a serious own goal."
"Why then is this draft worth supporting?"
"The provisions in this text to protect minority shareholders are important and will encourage more cross-border portfolio share ownership."
"By ensuring that there is a threshold in each Member State at which someone taking control of a company has to launch a full bid for the other shares, this directive stops creeping control of a company."
"It therefore means that a new shareholder with perhaps only 30% of the stock cannot decide, without providing an exit for all the other shareholders, to pay themselves special dividends or to sell off assets cheaply to another private company that they happen to control."
"By reassuring investors about those practices, by no means unknown in many Union financial markets, the directive will encourage more cross-border share ownership."
"That is crucial to the efficiency and returns on pension funds, for the support of the retired and for insurance funds for the compensation of the distressed."
"Overall, however, this is clearly a modest measure."
"It does no harm, it does some good."
"It sends the wrong signals but, in reality, it changes too little; it does not change anything in the reverse direction."
"Certainly calling it a takeover directive is a misnomer and would probably be a breach of the United Kingdom's Trades Descriptions Act."
"But all that is politically attainable at present."
"For those who would like to see more radical opening-up of cross-border mergers, there is also the promise of a clearer view in the next Parliament and the prospect that the markets themselves can add to the pressures on companies to apply best practice in consulting their shareholders."
"Transparency in this matter, as in others, may help, and we must not let the best be the enemy of the good."
"Let me finally reiterate something on the debate with the Socialist Group on employee consultation."
"Mr Lehne, to whom I would like to pay tribute, has certainly worked very hard, as I did, on a text that would have satisfied the PSE Group, even though the position on takeovers, as we have seen, is effectively unchanged."
"Takeovers will not be made any easier but, nevertheless, the PSE Group wanted a form of words to provide some political concession, as if they were being made easier."
"In reality, that form of words in their amendments merely echoes what is already in the information and consultation directive."
"It provides employees with nothing new, but potential differences in the legal text between this draft directive if it is voted and that one could mean a risk of litigation over takeovers if it is voted through."
"For that reason, we should vote against these amendments and support what is, I agree, a flawed and partial compromise, but, nevertheless, one which makes some progress."
". – Mr President, a year ago, in the spirit of Christmas, I prepared an opinion for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs which was adopted in February 2003."
"This has been somewhat overlooked in the whole debate, although we have already heard about the latest developments."
"I should like to remind you that the lack of arrangements for employees' information and consultation was one of the main reasons for rejecting the previous proposal for a directive on takeover bids in 2001."
"The Commission acknowledged that, to a certain extent, in providing us with Article 13, but our Employment and Social Affairs Committee was almost unanimous in its opinion that it was not enough."
"The Commission refers only to national Member States' practices and the Employment Committee's opinion explicitly makes information and consultation a mandatory part of takeover bid procedure, both for the companies making the bids – Article 6 – and the target companies – in Article 9."
"The PSE Group is still of that opinion, and over the last month I have prepared a text which is adapted to the situations in different Member States."
"This was a big concession to the United Kingdom, whose standards for takeover bids differ from those in the continental Member States."
"We also adapted the text to bring it into line with the provisions of the directive on the information and consultation of workers."
"That is why the references are there."
"So there is no real problem as regards differences of opinion."
"The only thing is that the main Articles of the directive should explicitly mention information and consultation."
"My Group wishes to stress that this should be a normal part of the procedure."
"That is made clear by three amendments that have now been re-tabled: Amendments Nos 35, 36 and 37, and by other amendments that have been tabled by the Verts/ALE and GUE/NGL Groups."
"Mr Lehne, Mr Huhne and I had a compromise on this, but between Monday 24 November when these three amendments were adopted almost unanimously in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, and Thursday 27 November, before the Council took its position, they left the deal and voted against the three amendments in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"That is why that compromise is not in there now."
"Mr Lehne's argument that it would have complicated the decision-making process is not convincing."
"The only reason he does not want this to be included is that he wants to press for a first-reading agreement, but in our opinion this takes away Parliament's right to have any input in the discussion."
"It is still early enough in the negotiations to make this input."
"The Italian presidency did discuss this seriously enough with the Council: there is still a chance to do so."
"Our Group is ready to support the compromise, although we are not very enthusiastic about it."
"Our original position was to make a directive without Articles 9 and 11 protecting minority shareholders' rights."
"But we only want to support it if these three amendments are adopted."
"If that is not the case we will vote against the compromise package."
". Mr President, perhaps I can reassure Mrs van den Burg that the concerns of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs were rather carried over into the debate on the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, and indeed a number of the amendments that were adopted by us in our opinion at first reading were, in my view as draftsman, more appropriate to your committee."
"Nevertheless, the opinion that we put forward reflected the concerns of a majority of our members and those concerns were particularly directed at the need for, and importance of, employee information and consultation."
"A number of amendments concerned informing the employees of the target or offeree company, and another amendment concerned the importance of consulting the employees of the offeror or predatory company."
"The second area of concern to us, where we were in line with a number of other committees, is the issue of jurisdiction."
"We felt it very important that jurisdiction should be in the Member State of the offeree company to avoid any ambiguity or confusion."
"We also put forward an amendment covering the issue of jurisdiction on bids originating from companies in countries outside the European Union – third countries – and the need for those to be subject to national authorisation within."
"A third area of concern which was addressed in the opinion of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy was that of the Scandinavian countries in particular over multiple classes of shares."
"Those were the three points that our committee was concerned about."
"Mr President, I agree with the rapporteur, Mr Klaus-Heiner Lehne: the affair of the takeover bids directive really does seem to be never-ending."
"Starting life in January 1989 with the first Commission proposal, a proposal that was, moreover, ambitious, pursuing the objective of achieving a single market in corporate control, the progress of the takeover bids directive through the legislative process seems to have been a kind of obstacle course, with texts alternating between maximalist proposals unacceptable to some – the individual States and the Council of Ministers – and minimalist compromises unacceptable to others – the European Parliament."
"Of this obstacle course, I remember that the European Parliament rejected a Conciliation Committee joint text on 4 July 2001I also remember the extremely interesting Commission proposal of October 2002, drawn up after a group of high-level experts had been consulted."
"This proposal, in addition to preserving the passivity rule in Article 9, sought to achieve the objectives set by the European Parliament and the wise men consulted, the neutralisation of some pre-bid defensive measures and proportionality between risk capital and voting rights, while I am afraid the very points that we might call most dangerous such as large corporations and multiple voting rights were excluded."
"Another obstacle course has started, with regard to which we thought that the intuition of the Council Presidency in June 2002 provided a way out: giving the Member States and quoted companies respectively the possibility of choosing between the directive’s model with the passivity rule and the neutralisation of defensive measures - type A companies - or preservation of defensive measures - type B companies - all supplemented by a requirement of maximum transparency in a system to which a company is subject."
"To put all the operators on a level playing field, provision is made for type A companies to decide not to let themselves be taken over by a type B company."
"The solution has many advantages: it shows which is the ideal solution – type A, the benchmark – and creates reciprocity."
"Moreover, the neutralisation of defensive measures requires an initial uniform rule of European company law: Article 11, which provides for the options, is essentially a derogation from the usual system."
"These options can be withdrawn once the market, favouring type A companies, has created the right conditions."
"There is more. With the current system, quoted companies subject to systems which do not provide for passivity rules or neutralisation can opt for competitiveness, which would not be possible without the directive."
"Moreover, the maximum transparency of company systemsand internal rules required by both Article 10 of the proposal for a directive and the parallel proposal for a directive on the transparency of quoted companies - which is also currently being debated in Parliament and the Council - ensures that companies which fully accept Articles 9 and 11, the stars, are the true European companies and clearly identifiable as such."
"In this way, it is made possible for the market to reward them. Indeed, institutional investors should explain to their clients why they are investing in non-competitive, type B companies rather than in a competitive, type A company."
"Lastly, the compromise, providing for preventive partial takeover bids, allows many countries not to make substantial changes to their legislation, while, at the same time, it does not riskexposing companies to unfair competition from companies in other countries."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, please believe me when I say that I am not particularly interested in stirring up past issues."
"If I am doing so, however, it is also the case that, when it appears that a high degree of consensus has been reached on certain issues, it is good to consider what has happened, at least so that, if not in this case, then certainly in the future, we can draw conclusions on how parliamentary tasks are carried out within the codecision procedure."
"I am therefore going to focus exclusively on two aspects of the first occasion on which – as all the honourable Members will remember – during this legislature, Parliament did not approve the text of the Conciliation Committee, which was basically in line with the text of the common position."
"The first of these aspects will allow me to remind the honourable Members of the different formulae which were considered on the initiative of the European Parliament in terms of regulating administration bodies’ neutrality obligation and comparing them – where appropriate – with the formulae now being presented."
"And in view of this comparison I do not believe that what we are going to approve today improves on what on that previous occasion had been proposed, at least by the European Parliament."
"Because at that time this House proposed maintaining the administration bodies’ neutrality obligation – which is positive – although, simply for certain cases in which it is not possible for the board of directors to meet, it proposed certain formulae, which were not accepted by the Council or by the Commission."
"What is happening now?"
"Well it has only been possible to reach a consensus by greatly reducing the Commission’s initial proposals. Ultimately, by not regulating the section relating to the neutrality obligation and consequently allowing the legislations of the Member States to regulate, by means of handy subsidiarity, issues relating to the prohibition or non-prohibition of defensive measures."
"I do not believe that this is a good formula for legislation."
"I believe that, if certain proposals presented by Parliament had been approved at that time, we would have had more suitable legislation."
"The second aspect – which has been mentioned by my colleague, Mrs van den Burg – relates to the chapter on information and consultation for workers."
"I would like to point out that, on that occasion, a large majority of Members of Parliament approved rights to information and consultation for workers which were shared by the immense majority of these Members."
"Some people pointed out on that occasion that there had been an alliance between certain conservative sectors and the Socialists, as a result of which the former had obtained flexible treatment for the prohibition of defensive measures, while the latter obtained broad recognition of the participation of workers."
"At that time it was also proposed that we Socialists should break the pact and vote in favour of the proposals in the common position in exchange for recognising the workers’ right to information."
"Well, on that occasion we did not do so, but – as Mrs van den Burg has said – if this aspect is not recognised and if the relevant amendments are not approved we will be obliged to vote against."
"– Mr President, the proposal for a directive that is currently before us is a much–watered-down version of what Parliament undermined eighteen months ago, unfortunately only by one vote."
"The current proposal leaves a great deal of scope for Member States and companies themselves, such as a company's optional, or even temporary, permission to take defensive mechanisms when it is faced with what it views as a hostile takeover bid."
"The question can therefore be posed whether takeovers are still to be possible at European level and whether this directive will, in practice, make any actual change to the current situation."
"Nevertheless, I think that we should approve this proposal, even if it were to finally end the discussion in the European Union about takeover bids – which has been going on for thirteen years now – and set up a first, albeit hesitant, regulation."
"According to a Flemish saying, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush."
"The takeover directive is indeed an important component of the Lisbon agenda on a strong, competitive European Union and is essential to the further completion of the European internal market."
"We should therefore ensure that this directive enters into force as soon as possible, so that we, along with the market operators, can immediately learn whether, and how, we can give this regulation more depth."
"Mr President, when, for the first time, I became involved in discussing this issue a couple of years ago, I was very surprised that only different forms of shareholder interests were discussed: the German tradition as opposed to the Anglo-Saxon tradition and so forth."
"Eventually, the matter went back to the Commission, which has had ample time available to it, and it might therefore have been thought that the proposal had been developed."
"Now, a compromise is being presented between different owner constructions and owner interests, but still no concern is being shown for the employees."
"I think that is incredibly strange."
"It must be obvious that the employees, just like the shareholders, are interested parties in takeover situations, and it is unrealistic to ignore the fact."
"In a way, the employees are perhaps interested parties to an even greater degree than the shareholders, because hostile takeover bids are almost always combined with plans for restructuring and, perhaps, cut-backs."
"In other contexts, we talk solemnly about the social dialogue in the European employment strategy as progress in EU policy."
"We talk about the Lisbon strategy in which the two sides of industry and the social dialogue are also important."
"In the present context, all this is conspicuous by its absence, and the old idea still prevails that companies only belong to their owners and that, in general, the employees are no more important than machines or other loose fittings."
"It is an old-fashioned, unrealistic and out-of-date idea."
"There can be no legislation on takeover bids that is not in some way grounded in the fact that a company is also its employees."
"That is absolutely fundamental."
"We shall of course support the amendments concerning improved information and consultation."
"Information is, of course, important, but I want at the same time to say that it is not enough."
"It must be possible, in one way or another, to use information for something."
"There must be certain rights."
"The employees must have certain opportunities to act in situations such as these."
"If the matter were now to go back to the Commission, I should like to give Mr Bolkestein a piece of advice."
"I think that the offeror should also be required to present an adjustment plan for the new company that is coming into being."
"A development and adjustment programme of this kind should also take account of the employees’ interests and talk about what will happen to them."
"There should also be a guarantee against at least short-term dismissal."
"Mr President, you will no doubt recall as vividly as I do the late nights in Luxembourg in June 2001 when we last went through this exercise, followed by the heated third-reading debate in this House shortly thereafter, which was lost by a tie."
"It is worth reminding ourselves that although technically we are now at first reading, this is in fact a fourth reading, even just for those of us who have participated in the present Parliament."
"We have been through this a long way and I myself am one of those who think that if we can bring it to a successful conclusion this time, then we should do so."
"I take the point made by Mr Huhne and Mr Bolkestein that there are further problems we did not have before."
"It is perhaps a little like the story of the Sybilline Books."
"The first time they were offered as a set of 12 and Tarquin refused them."
"Three of them were then burned and they were offered as a set of nine at a higher price: each time the price goes up and the quality goes down."
"Maybe that is so, or maybe not, but we are now in a position where we have to make up our minds."
"My Group is firmly of the conviction that we must take full and proper account of employees' rights in this context."
"Employees are not just pawns on the chess board."
"Employees are the people who make companies work and make them function effectively."
"Their interests have to be taken fairly and fully into account."
"Their right to consultation and information has to be taken seriously."
"On that account, my Group will certainly vote for the sets of amendments agreed between us, the GUE/NGL Group and the PSE Group when the vote is held tomorrow."
"Thereafter we are of two minds: some of us are firmly of the view that we should adhere to this to the last, and that if they are not carried then we will vote against the directive in its present form."
"If that means the compromise collapses then it will simply have to go to second reading, and so on."
"Others - and I am one of those others - think that the time has come to reach a conclusion."
"I shall vote for these amendments, but at the end of the day I shall try to get this through at this reading."
"Mr President, a short while ago the issue of takeover bids at European level showed, with some degree of sensation, two of the main problems of European integration."
"First of all, the blind submission of the Commission in Brussels to the demands of the financial markets to the detriment, most of the time, of the European Union’s economic, industrial and even financial interests."
"The Commission became renowned in many ways, last year, for this waywardness."
"Then, the dominant position granted to Germany in this Parliament, of which we have been able to measure the effectiveness, since the whole of the German representation voted along the same lines."
"As the much loved saying goes, you should choose the lesser of two evils."
"Subject to Member States’ law being preserved, in particular by Article 5, we will vote in favour of the new draft regulation."
"Mr President, I think I can say, in line with the opinions expressed by Commissioner Bolkestein, that we have lost yet another opportunity to modernise the capital market, first and foremost through rules which can ensure greater competitiveness of European companies and thus more effective protection of shareholders."
"We need to understand each other: I believe that calling this a takeover bids directive – as Mr Huhne said earlier - is an exaggeration."
"What we are doing here is acknowledging that there are different regulations and guaranteeing to the different countries that they can maintain protectionist legislation with regard to their companies, their national public or private market leaders."
"I believe that we needed to go much further, to decide whether to aim at an integrated, effective, competitive European capital market which would provide fresh opportunities for growth for the European Union, not least in the field of employment, or not to take this so-called ‘risk’ and remain in our current situation."
"The rules, as proposed by the Council, eliminate very few of the obstacles that some States’ rules place in the way of companies’ competitiveness, with the result that I am sad to say that hostile bids – as are the norm in a mature financial market, in which capital is moved where there are thought to be efficiency margins to recover, in the interests of the companies and the workers of those companies and of other companies, in the interests of the consumers of products, goods or services – become impossible."
"There is also the risk that this crystallisation of the current situation will take us a step backwards."
"In Italy, where the current legislation – the Draghi law – is extremely open and effective from this point of view, we are already being asked to take a step backwards, and I would point out that we are not going so far in Europe in opening up to the competitiveness of companies."
"I hope that, should this measure – which is not, I repeat, a takeover bids directive – be adopted tomorrow by Parliament too, it will generate genuine competition between legal systems and ensure that those systems in which takeover bids are penalised and obstructed pay the price for it through having their international investors ‘vote with their feet’."
"There are very few positive elements: recognition of the protection of the rights of minorities and the sunset clause - the idea that the debate on the issue can be reopened."
"Maybe for this reason alone, it is worth adopting this measure, which is not a European law on takeover bids."
"I will end, Mr President, by saying that employment in Europe, the interests of workers and the unemployed, are to be protected by effective capital markets too."
"At the moment, we do not have them, and I do not believe that this directive will create the necessary conditions either."
"– Mr President, it is not often that this Chamber witnesses real political drama."
"However, it did so on that day some two-and-a-half years ago when Parliament rejected the takeover directive."
"Nothing I have seen or heard since then has made me change my mind that what we did was not only wrong but also foolish."
"In an increasingly interdependent world, where the globe's economy is seamlessly linking together, the single greatest economic challenge we face in Europe – a challenge which we lose at our peril - is global competitiveness."
"We all know that we are very good at talking about it and we are equally bad at doing anything material to address the problem."
"Furthermore, whenever Europe has to face up eyeball to eyeball to the challenges posed by competitiveness, we funk it."
"We funked it that day two-and-a-half years ago, and we have regularly funked it since."
"We always use special pleading about the minutiae as an intellectual fig leaf to avoid the tough decisions."
"It must be said that it is all pretty transparent."
"To set the picture straight: I may be a British Conservative, but I am not the contemporary equivalent of the hard-faced men who made money out of the war."
"I am no Thatcherite – never have been – and I am not a Eurosceptic, but I think – some consider this to be an eccentric point of view – that we should deal with the world as it is and not the world as we would like it to be."
"If Europe is to deliver for its citizens – and it has to – our economy has to be competitive."
"Part of that state of competitiveness is to have a system of company law and capital markets that enables it to compete."
"It does not now, and that problem has to be dealt with."
"The proposals we are debating this afternoon are a miserable, insufficient response to today's world."
"However, we have to start from where we are."
"I hope Commissioner Bolkestein will be able to confirm that in the event of this proposal becoming law further proposals will follow this one, taking the matter forward – and rather more quickly than this one has been taken because, if it is not taken more quickly, if I am lucky I will be drawing my pension and if I am unlucky I shall be dead."
"Nevertheless, it is a single, wretched, shuffling step on the journey that Europe has to take."
"There is no choice."
"It is for that reason we shall support it as long as Mr Lehne's proposals are not amended or watered down."
"On balance – just – it is worse to reject it than to support it and for a Conservative that is a good enough reason to vote for it."
"– Thank you, Mr President. I honestly did not know that there were 275 German MEPs in this House."
"That is how many Members rejected the results of the first conciliation procedure."
"Ladies and gentlemen, when we consider Europe as a social community and as an example to others, workers’ rights have an important part to play."
"It was because they were not sufficiently taken into account that the first takeover directive failed in this House, when the plenary rejected as inadequate what had come out of the conciliation as having been agreed with the Council."
"It was clear to us that decisions concerning an enterprise’s continued existence could not be left to the shareholders alone, but that the people who were employed by it had, at the very outset, to be informed and enabled to influence events."
"After all, when an enterprise is taken over, it is not just power and a great deal of money that are at stake, but also the fate of many people."
"Issues of the enterprise’s location and the security of jobs are also involved."
"That is why the people affected must be asked their opinion and involved in what happens."
"Today sees us making a new start on the takeover directive, and the rapporteur would like us to be able to manage with just one reading."
"At an early stage, we in the Group of the Party of European Socialists have promised him our support, albeit subject to the condition that a satisfactory solution must be found to the issue of workers’ rights."
"He has promised that it will be, but I – like everyone else who thought there would be a good solution – am surprised to find a takeover directive that is not one whit better than the first one."
"Faced with such an impertinence, we will not be waving this directive through into a fast-track procedure until the workers’ rights issue has been sorted out in a manner favourable to them."
"Mr President, Commissioner, if the EU is to become the world’s most dynamic and competitive economy, the EU’s decision-makers must act consistently and quickly."
"This could have been an important directive for creating better preconditions for growth and for promoting restructuring within Europe’s corporate structure."
"It is the dynamic companies that can be restructured that create jobs."
"Without jobs, Europe will not survive."
"That is genuinely an issue in the employees’ interests."
"The expression ‘Much ado about nothing’ is quite a good description of this controversial directive."
"For fourteen years, we have tried to bring about these fair and common ground rules."
"In fact, we have failed, but it is nonetheless a step in the right direction."
"I personally have had some difficulty with this debate."
"In principle, my view is that the differentiated voting right does not favour the emergence of efficient companies able to compete in a global market."
"Over time, the various voting values tend to consolidate deficient corporate structures."
"I also think there are important legal objections to retroactive legislation, and I can also see the point of entrepreneurs being able to go to the stock exchange to obtain extra capital for their life’s work without losing complete control of it."
"In spite of this, it is incredibly important for us to obtain common corporate ground rules with a view to opening the European market to more liberal restructuring."
"We must, however, be able to live with this compromise. We could have obtained more, and more is what we wanted."
"Now, this directive is more about openness and the protection of minority shareholders, and less about takeover rules."
"It is, however, a step in the right direction, and I think we can support this compromise, even if it shows that it takes sixteen years for EU legislation to come into effect."
"An initial 14 years and then a further two years before it is incorporated."
"If we continue in this pattern, we shall never become dynamic and competitive."
"Mr President, we know that allowing companies to mount hostile takeover bids can jeopardise the right of States to maintain control over strategic businesses and decision-making bodies that are crucial to their development, specifically over companies that perform a public service. Such takeover bids frequently result in lower value for shareholders in terms of loss of output and, even more seriously, in the destruction of jobs."
"It is crucial that company workers and their representatives are, at all stages of the process, properly informed and consulted about the potential effects of a hostile takeover bid on employment and on company restructuring. Unacceptably, no such guarantees are given."
"The European Parliament must, therefore, approve the proposals for amendments intended to achieve this aim, although we must go further and ensure that workers and their representatives have mechanisms that enable them to obstruct a hostile takeover bid that will have potentially disastrous consequences for employment and for other rights."
"– Mr President, Mr Bolkestein, Mr Lehne, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to make a few observations."
"Although we have known this for a while, it has just dawned on me that Mr Bolkestein is rejecting the defensive mechanisms that are now being proposed in the amendments and that are more or less optional in each country, resulting in the creation, as he intended, of a very watered-down version of the directive."
"This also has some advantages for employees, for it means that, in some cases, these mechanisms will still give employees and employers themselves control over a few rights."
"Irrespective of that, I am in any case pleased that the new directive now contains what we have decided on in the meantime, namely new guidelines on information and consultation in a number of cases, for which praise is due, for that was one of the stumbling blocks last time."
"I should, however, like to add that we would actually want pro-active action to be taken in takeover bids that do not succeed – which is in about 50% of the cases."
"This means that consultation must precede the bid, that consultation about this bid must take place before it is made public, and so on."
"Mr Bolkestein, it is a matter of modern management, a matter of socially responsible management, that consultation should be further detailed in such a way as to entitle stakeholders, and not only shareholders, to consultation where necessary."
"We have tabled those amendments to improve matters."
"Although my group is divided on this, I think that the majority are behind our position."
"We would like those amendments to be adopted; if they are not, we want to vote against the proposal."
"The majority of the group are behind me on this."
"It has been said that a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush."
"They can stay in the bush as far as I am concerned, and another way could then be found to make consultation more detailed."
"I would remind the honourable Members that with the new electronic system the red circle does not light up, so you do not need to make any effort or hit the microphone when beginning to speak."
"No doubt, as a result of our past habits, we are all expecting to see the red light ..."
"– Mr President, over the past few months, we have followed with great interest the developments surrounding the Directive on takeover bids."
"At the start of the parliamentary discussion, it was already clear that only cooperation with the Council and the Commission could secure the proposal wide support."
"Consequently, the proposed compromise receives our approval."
"In particular, the recognition of employees' rights is a significant improvement on the original proposal."
"Despite this, we are also considering giving our support to a few amendments underlining the involvement of employees."
"Continuity and employment remain of major importance during takeovers."
"We welcome the fact that the proposal no longer includes a ban on temporary defence mechanisms."
"Countries such as the Netherlands and Germany were right to be completely opposed to this."
"We are not convinced by the rapporteur's arguments against adopting the amendment by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on employees' rights, and we would like to hear from Commissioner Bolkestein whether he will adopt it."
"Mr President, after fourteen years of negotiations to find a minimum agreement on mergers and acquisitions, the European institutions are still divided."
"Parliament was in favour of harmonising the law."
"As for the Commission, it advocated the principle of competition but deplored the dominant positions, which were the result of this policy."
"The Council did not want to see the withdrawal of Member States’ means for intervening in the case of attempted hostile takeover bids for their large national companies."
"For twenty years, Europe has indeed been systematically destroying the strategic actors that are the Nation States, and what is more without managing to replace them."
"The directive proposes to protect the interests of minority shareholders and to keep employees informed."
"In fact, it lifts the obstacles to our companies being taken over by interests outside Europe, to the extent that, in Article 6 for example, it designates a single supervisory authority and prohibits authorities in Member States from giving their approval or demanding the addition of supplementary information."
"Furthermore, this directive does not say anything at all about the specific control that the European Commission exercises over mergers that are likely to lead to misuse of a dominant position, control which, strangely enough, is still opposed to this type of merger when a European company has the dominant position, but much less so when a company from outside Europe has this position."
"Our North American competitors do not allow themselves to be so easily deprived."
"The Pechiney, Crédit Lyonnais and Vivendi Universal affairs, show this all to well."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the takeover bids directive is an essential legislative act for the creation of a genuine internal market in corporate control: a legislative act which can give a decisive boost to the virtuous circulation of capital in Europe."
"Virtuous circulation means more productivity, more growth, more competitiveness and - I am addressing the left-wing Members here - more employment."
"After 14 years, we have, at last, reached our goal and it is a pity that the Commission is not taking up the positive aspects of the present compromise."
"In recent months, there has been intense cooperation between the Council and the European Parliament, and that is a positive result in itself."
"Europe certainly needs positive results right now!"
"This is, of course, a compromise, the only compromise possible at the present time."
"We would have liked more, especially my country, whose legislation on the matter is very advanced and open; we would have liked a directive creating a genuinely level playing field with the passivity rule and the total neutralisation of defensive measures."
"We tried, but it was not possible because of the opposition of certain Member States which are now probably hiding behind so-called social amendments."
"The compromise to be put to the vote tomorrow reflects the state of European capitalism, which is still a mixture of small-scale and large-scale capitalism."
"However, it does provide proper protection of workers’ rights."
"Hence the opt-in/opt-out system as regards the level playing field."
"However, the undertaking is given to try again in a few years, with the useful sunset clause, when the time will be ripe because the financial markets will have favoured the companies which opt to be competitive."
"All we will have to do then is delete Article 11 A, make a few cosmetic adjustments, and we will have a new directive ready for the future."
"With this directive and the others which we are adopting in the framework of the Financial Services Action Plan, competitive companies, their governance and their balance sheets will be transparent."
"We have a great need of transparency, in view of recent cases such as the , and cases."
"Companies will be encouraged to opt to be competitive by the fact that competitive companies will be able to refuse to be taken over by non-competitive companies."
"We have established the benchmark and we have protected it, which is better than a directive merely laying down transparency procedures such as that which exists in the United States."
"All in all, we can be proud of what we have achieved."
"Mr President, a huge task has been carried out by a lot of people over many years."
"In spite of this, the compromise now before us is, in my view, unacceptable."
"The proposal would mean that vote differentiation in the matter of shares could be permitted to remain for a transitional period, as an exception to the general rule."
"Subsequently, a revision would take place, involving a review of the system of A and B shares and also of other forms of shareholding."
"Many believe that this has rescued the Nordic system of shares with different voting values."
"Those who maintain that this is a good compromise fail, however, to appreciate the issue of principle surrounding whether the EU is entitled to interfere in how shareholders in private companies choose to organise themselves."
"I find it regrettable to see so many in this Parliament so casually accepting infringements of the right of ownership."
"No one mentions the crucial issue of the principle of respect for the right of ownership."
"It is the business of no one other than the shareholders themselves how they organise their shares."
"That is a basic prerequisite of the market economy."
"If the compromise is approved, this means in practice that Parliament says it is acceptable to appropriate assets."
"If someone has bought a share with a higher voting value at market price, what right does the EU or any state then have quite simply to rob this person of this investment by saying that what he has paid for no longer has any value?"
"The Swedish Government maintains that this revision clause is a victory because the revision is to embrace more forms of shareholding than simply the system of shares with different voting values."
"That may be the case, but the Swedish Government no doubt knows as well as anyone else that, in five years’ time when the revision takes place, no one will either be able, or wish, to investigate the multiplicity of forms of shareholding that exist within the EU."
"Presumably, the discussion would, then too, be focused upon the system of A and B shares."
"The reason for that is simple."
"Different voting values are a clear and straightforward system."
"Unlike with most other systems of shareholding, it is very simple to see how many votes a type of share corresponds to, and it is at least as easy to see what the share is worth in the market."
"There are no pitfalls or secrets in this system."
"The main aim of the new regulations governing takeover bids is that the EU should be an open market and that obstacles to takeovers should be removed."
"The fact is, however, that the number of takeovers in countries in which different voting values are applied is not in any way lower than the number in countries where this system is not permitted."
"In summary, the proposal now before us is, in my opinion, unacceptable, for, in the first place, it infringes the right of ownership; secondly, does not respect agreements entered into; and, thirdly, identifies vote-differentiated shares as an obstacle to takeovers."
". Mr President, firstly I would like to refer to certain amendments."
"As I said earlier this evening I cannot accept Amendments Nos 5 or 21 because they introduce the optional arrangements which the Commission rejects."
"I also have some difficulties with Amendment No 4 and Amendment No 20, last paragraph, concerning special rights, which mix in an undesirable way special rights provided for in the articles of association of certain companies which could be exempted from the application of Article 11, and special rights provided for in law which, as I said earlier, are not within the scope of this directive in any case."
"Much has been said tonight on this subject but only two questions have been addressed to the Commission."
"The first question is about the inclusion of consultation and codetermination rights for employees and I would like to say in answer to that question that this is not a social directive."
"It would therefore not be appropriate to introduce through this directive new consultation and codetermination rights."
"Following Parliament's request, we have included in our new proposal a new Article 13 which makes it quite clear that all existing information, consultation and, where appropriate, codetermination rights which are part of Community law, also apply here."
"It is also stated very clearly that Member States are free to introduce rights that go beyond Community law as long as they respect the rules concerning insider trading."
"Furthermore, following Parliament's request, we have now stated in Article 8 of the directive that all information concerning the offer should be made available to the representatives of the employees or to the employees of both the offeree company and the offeror."
"The second question was addressed to the Commission by Lord Inglewood."
"He asked whether any more measures may be proposed by the Commission."
"Of course the Commission will review on a regular basis what is happening in this area, in particular how the market will react to this proposal if it is accepted, but the moment for reviewing the situation and revising the proposal is five years after its adoption."
"If one takes into account the normal period for adoption that date will then be in 2011."
"That is also a reason why the Commission is profoundly unhappy with the proposal as it now seems to be approved by Parliament, because the world is going to change a great deal between now and 2011 and, as I said earlier, this will only be reviewed in 2011."
"That is a long way off."
"The Commission agrees with Lord Inglewood in his assessment of this proposal.(1)"
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0467/2003) by Mr Schmidt, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 77/388/EEC as regards value added tax on services provided in the postal sector (COM(2003) 234 C5-0227/2003 2003/0091(CNS))."
". Mr President, in 1977, the Council adopted the Sixth VAT Directive."
"It was a tremendous step towards the effective removal of restrictions on the movement of persons, goods, services and capital and the integration of national economies."
"For the first time, the Community had a harmonised base of taxation and a harmonised list of exempted goods and services."
"Among them, the Community legislator, in 1977, included those supplied by the public postal services."
"This exemption dates from a time where in most Member States, the post office was a branch of the government with a monopoly on postal services."
"At the time, the post office undoubtedly was a public postal service and the exemption of its services caused no distortion of competition because no competition was possible."
"These facts no longer hold true."
"In most Member States, the post office is no longer a branch of the government, but a commercial enterprise operating under commercial law."
"In some cases its shares are sold on the stock markets."
"Some Member States already apply VAT to post, or to some or all services provided by the universal service provider, recognising the problems caused by an outdated exemption."
"Some of these companies are now expanding their operations to other Member States in order to reap the benefits of the internal market just like other third-country postal operators are doing."
"Consumers now demand services that only companies with a presence in several European markets can provide."
"But, under current rules, a company which supplies exempt postal services in Member State A is obliged to charge VAT in Member State B, because that country does not recognise it as a public postal service."
"The postal market is now largely liberalised."
"Although, as is often the case, post liberalisation advances at a different pace in each Member State, in all of them - in great measure due to the approval of Directive 97/67/EC, operators other than the former monopolies can and do operate."
"Since several operators provide postal services and VAT legislation does not treat them equally, distortion of competition inevitably occurs."
"A VAT exemption is not an unmixed blessing."
"Notably, it results in an inability to deduct input VAT, which in turn discourages investment."
"At a time where competition exists in the postal market and the communications revolution has created new channels that to some extent compete with post, lower rates of investment put public operators at risk."
"As is often the case with European tax legislation, the VAT Directive has lagged behind all these changes and now requires urgent changes since it no longer reflects the needs or the factual situation in the Community."
"Under Article 93 of the Treaty, provisions concerning VAT must be adopted to the extent that harmonisation is necessary to ensure the establishment and the functioning of the internal market."
"The Commission, in presenting its proposal, is fulfilling its obligations under the Treaty."
"It has done so after extensive consultation with universal postal services and other postal operators, as well as representatives of postal consumers."
"It has taken into account their opinions, in particular, those of private customers and charities by proposing that a reduced rate be applied to those services such as letterpost, small packages and direct mail which such customers need most."
"The combined effect of the savings to postal operators resulting from the right of deduction which the proposal would open to them and the application of a reduced rate to a wide scope of postal services is intended to limit or even neutralise any increase in postal prices."
"The Commission was the proponent of the universal service concept at the heart of Directive 97/67/EC and considers that every citizen in the Union has the right to a wide range of affordable and high-quality postal services."
"Universal postal service providers will not be in a position to provide such a service if they are discouraged from investing and modernising and as a result can no longer compete with other operators in the parts of the market which are already open to competition."
"In order to compete in such markets they need a Europe-wide presence and tools such as package tracing, which private and third-country operators already offer to European customers."
"The current VAT exemption makes the required investment more expensive."
"Universal postal operators in Europe recognise such challenges and accordingly most of them support the objectives of this proposal."
"To conclude, I would invite Members to support the Commission's proposal."
". Mr President, I wish to begin by apologising for failing to present a consistent report."
"This report might be my last in this Parliament and, Commissioner, I am not proud of the result."
"Mr President, the postal market is in the process of being liberalised at European level and also at national level."
"As Commissioner Bolkestein has said, the current situation has led to an uneven playing field."
"Public operators have a competitive advantage over those customers who are not able to claim back VAT, such as private individuals, charities and banks."
"Private operators are more attractive to VAT-registered companies, although the overall price may be higher, as the customer can reclaim the VAT, which generally results in a lower net cost to the business."
"A further disadvantage of the VAT exemption for public operators is that it favours self-supply."
"It is therefore more cost-effective for the operator to carry out a service itself than to use subcontractors."
"It is against this background that the Commission proposes that the exemption should be removed and that VAT should be charged at the standard rate for all items of mail over two kilos in weight."
"At the same time, the Member States must be given the option of applying a reduced rate of VAT to items of addressed mail weighing less than two kilos."
"I agree with the Commission’s assessment."
"As rapporteur, I also proposed only minor changes in the committee reading."
"All my proposals were voted down by the committee."
"In practice, the committee’s proposal means that the European Parliament must reject the Commission’s proposal in its entirety."
"I think that this would be unfortunate and, together with my colleague Mrs Lulling and the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I have therefore tabled a series of compromise proposals."
"Personally, I am not entirely delighted with all these amendments, but I can live with them."
"I also hope that Commissioner Bolkestein is able to live with them."
"The amendments are along the right lines and will mean the start of a more properly functioning market."
"The big changes we are now proposing are aimed, for example, at removing the two-kilo limit for the reduced rate of VAT."
"It also means clearer demands for a harmonised five to ten per cent VAT band."
"Allow me, in the first place, to address those fellow MEPs of mine, in particular the British ones, who have been concerned about price rises."
"As is well known, VAT can be applied and removed."
"The Commission estimates that the price of a first-class letter in the UK would, for example, increase by 0.3 euro cents in the case of VAT being applied at a reduced rate of 5% and by five euro cents in the case of VAT being applied at the standard rate of 17.5 per cent."
"It is worth noting that the UK mail regulator, Postcomm, has arrived at the same conclusion."
"Talk of price rises is seriously exaggerated."
"Certainly, postal services fulfil an important social function, but postage and related costs do, in spite of everything, represent only 0.1 to 0.2 per cent of the average household budget in the EU."
"The postal operator in my own country, Sweden, has noted that the annual average cost per household for letters and Christmas cards is SEK 190, or EUR 21."
"In the case of the UK, figures for 1996-1997 indicate that the average annual spend for a UK household was £ 29.40, or EUR 42."
"On the assumption that this was all spent on sending standard letters costing 28 pence, the impact on the household would be that the annual cost would increase by £ 1.05 to £ 30.45 if the national operator were to increase the postage by one penny."
"I think that this should be borne in mind during the vote tomorrow."
"Another sensitive subject is the impact on charities."
"Just like Commissioner Bolkestein, I think that this impact should be countered by the option of being able to claim back the VAT or by special tax rates."
"Finally, all those of you in this House who believe in a better, efficient market without obstacles and injustices cannot reject this proposal."
"I wish, in particular, to address Mrs Lulling and thank her."
"I wish to thank Mr Radwan, Mr Brunetta and Mr Karas."
"You have, in any case, helped to obtain some form of unity."
"Mrs Randzio-Plath and Mr Goebbels, who have such good judgment on so many other issues, I am relying upon your judgment tomorrow too."
"If nothing else, you could all listen to your own postal operators, or those that support the proposal."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has considered this dossier in very great depth, having been privileged to follow the development of postal services in the past, and having the hope of being able to do so in the future as well."
"It was for this reason that we examined the possibility of introducing VAT in the liberalised working conditions for which we are all striving, and I hope that we will have completed this important task by the end of the decade."
"Let me start by saying that the proposal that the Commission has put forward is a serious attempt at resolving this problem, but that, at the same time, it is true that good things can still be improved."
"That was the approach that the Committee on Regional Policy took, and there are, essentially, three things that I would like to address."
"The first is that, in principle, we wanted the minimum VAT rate of 5% to apply to postal services."
"We are aware of the legal problem involved in certain Member States being required to introduce what would be their fourth rate of VAT."
"We also take the view that this needs to be handled with particular care."
"Secondly, consideration should be given to what upper weight limit would apply to a reduced rate of VAT."
"The Commissioner was right to refer to the obligation to provide a universal service, but there is also the Universal Postal Union Convention, which also describes the consumers’ rights, and we therefore propose, taking the Convention as our guide, the provision of reduced rates of VAT on the sending through the post of items up to 10 kg."
"Thirdly, we propose that the entry into force of the directive should be harmonised with the further liberalisation of postal services scheduled for 2006."
"The Commission should, following a study of this issue, draft and submit proposals on the subject to Parliament and the Council of Ministers for their consideration."
"I would be glad if these proposals by the Committee on Regional Policy could be taken on board."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Bolkestein was right to remind us that the Sixth Directive on Value Added Tax makes no provision for the payment of VAT on postal services."
"This applies to the traditional providers of postal services, namely the former monopolies, whilst private postal service providers already have to add VAT to their bills."
"Some time ago, in order to make the internal market a reality in the postal services sector, we made a start on the sector’s progressive liberalisation, thus making it possible for private enterprise to operate in it to an ever-greater extent."
"The new private firms have to charge VAT, whereas the former monopolies are exempted from it, and distortions of competition will, sooner or later, be the result."
"For a start, the VAT is reflected in the price of the private firms’ end product, but not in that of the traditional postal operators, who – and this is my second point – cannot deduct the VAT that they have to pay on purchases and investments."
"I am given to understand, though, that the amount of VAT that would be deductible would be quite minimal, as almost 80% of the costs – in Luxembourg at any rate – are accounted for by wages, which are not subject to VAT in any case."
"The rapporteur and I have joined in putting forward a solution, one that provides for a reduced rate of VAT on all postal services, although those Member States that already impose very much reduced rates to other products and services would also be able to apply these to postal services."
"This is a balanced solution, taking into account to the greatest possible degree the interests of all parties; it should also not result in increased prices for stamps."
"In addition, the Commission has proposed a new definition of postal services, which has left me rather surprised."
"Ever since the 1997 Postal Directive, we have had a definition recognised by all participants in the market and used by them without problems."
"Any new definition would only make for legal uncertainty, as the parties involved would then be left wondering whether the postal services provided in accordance with the 1997 directive were the same as those that have now had tax imposed on them."
"In order that we may avoid such legal uncertainty and the confusion that it would entail, the rapporteur and I have proposed that, when defining postal services, the VAT Directive should simply refer to the definition in the 1997 directive."
"A final and important amendment deals with the point in time at which VAT is to be imposed on postal services."
"As we are dealing here, in essence, with a problem of potential distortion of competition, VAT should only be levied when such a problem actually becomes apparent."
"As things stand at present, some national markets are more liberalised than others."
"The amendment we are tabling provides for the introduction of VAT only when at least 50% of the national market has been liberalised."
"It remains to me to thank the rapporteur for his excellent cooperation, and to appeal to those Members who, in the Committee, voted to reject the Commission proposal outright, to reconsider their position, for it would be inappropriate to reject it now."
"I appeal to our Socialist Members in particular."
"We have to take a constructive approach to this matter, for only then will we have a chance of our proposals getting a favourable reception from the Council and the Commission."
"– Mr President, the postal services have been a state monopoly for 150 years."
"In the current parliamentary term, the majority has endorsed international, service-oriented companies taking over parts of this work."
"In the discussion on this subject, various drawbacks have been mentioned, including the fear that in future, an ever-higher price will be charged for an ever-worsening service."
"Hardly any attention was then paid to the impact on taxation."
"The complications are now evident."
"Public companies do not pay any VAT, but if customers can claim back their VAT, sometimes a private company becomes the cheaper option."
"As continuing to farm out postal transport to the rail services becomes too expensive, the companies' own use of environmentally-unfriendly lorry transport increases."
"It is uncertain whether the Member States will declare their high VAT rates or their varying low VAT rates to be applicable."
"Prices may well increase for the users in many cases."
"It is useful for the rapporteur now to propose postponing the application until such time as the market has been further liberalised and for the draftsman of the opinion to express the wish to increase the weight limit to ten kilograms."
"Not to privatise would be the best solution."
"Not the market, but the employees and customers deserve protection, and this is ideally done without this measure."
"– Mr President, I must confess that I have found it hard to speak in this debate and I would, in fact, start by remarking that we must all bear in mind the words of Mrs Lulling. Above all, however, we must consider the enormous effort made by Commissioner Bolkestein in order to complete the internal market, which is absolutely crucial to European integration and also to Europe’s economic recovery."
"I therefore believe that this Commission initiative basically makes sense, but unfortunately, the European Parliament should not give its support to it just yet, because such a move, in isolation, would add little to the real discussion, which concerns the crucial liberalisation of the postal services sector."
"At this stage, given the current structure of the market, the Commission proposal could lead to various unwanted effects, the most perverse of which would surely be the widespread increase in the price of postal services for citizens, without this yielding any immediate benefit."
"Not even the proposals for amendment and there is no guarantee that they will be adopted would prevent this."
"It is indeed sometimes legitimate to sacrifice this benefit in the short term, especially in the case of public services, although this must only be done if this interest will be safeguarded in the medium and long term, with the clear benefits that this provides."
"This does not, unfortunately, appear to be the case before us or at least it is not clear that the proposal accepts this fundamental principle."
"The postal services sector has been exempt from VAT since 1977, a time when, it is true, the sector was dominated by State monopolies, which meant that competition was practically non-existent."
"Despite the changes that have taken place since then, there is absolutely no basis for the idea that this area of public service provision now operates in an open market."
"And yet, this is the only situation in which the State would be justified in exerting its exclusive power for political regulation without having to resort to tax or other types of incentives that guarantee social effectiveness."
"If, therefore, we acknowledge that upholding the current status quo for a long time to come could harm the much-needed development of this sector, we must also accept that this proposal alone will not eliminate or reduce existing distortions of competition, especially given the diversity of VAT rates still being applied in the Union."
"Rejecting this initiative can, therefore, only be seen as a recommendation to the Commission to include the proposal in the framework of a broader debate on the total liberalisation of the sector, ensuring that the services provided are completely effective, without overcharging citizens who use the service from the outset."
"The report deals only with those distortions of competition that are liable to be detrimental to the private enterprises that are taking over the postal sector; in no way does it reflect the interests either of users or of postal workers."
"For over a century, the European states have established public postal services that worked in more or less acceptable fashion until criteria of public service began to give way to those of profitability."
"The efficient running of public services, and of the postal services in particular, has for some considerable time been one of the most reliable indicators of a country’s level of development, and, dare I say it, of its level of civilisation."
"It was precisely because the postal services were to some degree sheltered from competition and from the pursuit of profit that they were able to perform their role; it was because they did not exist to be profit-making but to provide a service that they served the most secluded villages and criss-crossed the land with a dense network of post offices."
"Such is the progress that both the nation-states and the European institutions are engaged in systematically demolishing."
"We are absolutely opposed to this exercise in the destruction of public services, which is both regressive and socially unjust."
"To this fundamental reason for voting against this report, we would add another, namely that we are indeed opposed to VAT and hence to it being applied, as also to the price increases that it will entail, and from which users on lower incomes will suffer most."
"Mr President, I must, all the same, ask Mr Bolkestein whether or not he supports the amendments that we tabled."
"What is this all about?"
"Either we follow the socialists and all those that did not understand the interests of those they claim to protect and we purely and simply reject the Commission proposal, or we follow the route that I was proposing, but that I did not have enough speaking time to explain."
"I was calling on all those who want to purely and simply reject the Commission proposal to think about it."
"If they adopt the amendments, tabled by Mr Schmidt and myself on behalf of our groups, then we are giving the go ahead for a rational directive, which will not cause prices to rise."
"Could Mr Bolkestein indicate whether or not he supports our amendments?"
". Mr President, it is with the greatest of pleasure that I shall reply to the question put by Mrs Lulling."
"I could have done so earlier but she did not ask for it and therefore I did not think it was necessary to reply."
"In answer to her question, the Commission considers that any study of the postal sector and particularly those which must be done according to Directive 97/67/EEC should take into account the impact of VAT in the sector and that it undertakes to take into account the spirit of Amendment No 6."
"As regards Amendments Nos 7 and 13 proposing to delay the entry into force of the directive until each Member State has achieved a certain degree of liberalisation, the Commission's position is that it cannot accept linking two issues which are quite separate, but the Commission could accept a date of entry into force of the directive no later than January 2006, by which date the Community postal market as a whole should have surpassed that degree of liberalisation."
"The Commission does not support amendments linking the scope of the proposed place of supply rule and reduced rates to Article 2(1) of Directive 97/67/EC."
"Postal services as defined in that Article are those supplied by the universal service provider."
"The linkage proposed by that amendment would not eliminate current distortions of competition in the postal market and therefore the Commission cannot support Amendments Nos 1, 8, 11 and 12."
"For reasons of subsidiarity the Commission cannot support Amendments Nos 2, 4 and 9 which seek to oblige Member States to apply a reduced rate and to prescribe how a certain part of national VAT revenue should be spent."
"Nor can it accept widening the scope of applicable rates as suggested by Amendments Nos 3 and 10."
"Such amendments would not be acceptable to a majority of the Council either."
"As regards Amendment No 5, the Commission considers that the issues posed by philatelic stamps are no different to those existing today."
"Under current legislation, stamps are only exempt when sold at face value."
"They are taxable in all other cases."
"Since this different tax liability is not causing problems today, it should not cause problems once the proposal is approved."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Bolkestein."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, at noon."
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0461/2003) by Mr Manders, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on environmental liability with regard to the prevention and remedying of environmental damage (10933/5/2003 - C5-0445/2003 - 2002/0021 (COD))."
". – Mr President, I apologise for being late, but we have been trying to reach an eleventh-hour compromise so as to obtain a qualified majority."
"Mr President, Council, Commission, ladies and gentlemen, above all, thank you for the pleasant working relationship in this particularly complex and taxing matter, which is both legally complex and politically sensitive."
"This cooperation has enabled us to vote in December after all, and I can see a possibility of reaching a compromise with the Council in this."
"We have already consulted the Council, and I can see some scope, that is if Parliament dares take a qualified vote about a package I have distributed a moment ago, for I see that as being, after all, a minimum requirement in the large groups."
"I also thank you for the option of postponing the vote to Wednesday in view of the translations not all having been received."
"They have now been delivered, but at least I now have some extra time to reach those compromises."
"And in the final analysis, this is very much to be welcomed."
"The whole procedure has turned out to be very difficult."
"Parliament had to vote on which committee should lead in handling this report, and that is, as far as I know, unique in the history of this Parliament."
"This has exposed quite a few sensitivities, some of which are excessive."
"I see the text we adopted at first reading as being a reasonably balanced one."
"Unfortunately, the Council has once again toned it down considerably with very many instances of the word 'may'. In other words, Member States are 'allowed' to introduce something."
"These should, I think, nearly all be replaced by 'shall'."
"Indeed, I take the view that both the environment and the economy would benefit if we could create a level playing field instead of creating this patchwork of environmental legislation about Europe, which benefits neither the economy nor the environment."
"This level playing field is of huge importance."
"During the discussion of the previous report, I noticed that many Members could talk of nothing else but the fact that it was agreed in Lisbon that Europe should become the world's most competitive knowledge-based economy."
"We should therefore have the nerve to take decisions that transcend our national interests, and transcend certain political items which we would like to realise."
"For after all, it is the result that counts and not the fact that I can walk up to my electorate and say: ‘Look how brave I have been to propose this."
"I may not have achieved anything, but I have proposed it’."
"I would regret it if we were unable to reach a qualified majority in some key areas at least, thus giving us some negotiating room in respect of the Council to remove some of those 'mays'."
"Fortunately, the joint proposal does contain many texts that were included in Parliament's adopted text, albeit considerably watered-down by those 'mays', and, last week, I think, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market adopted a number of pertinent texts, specifically on financial security with a built-in ceiling and the compulsory financial insurances that are possible over a certain period of time."
"It is useful and necessary to be able to guarantee insurability."
"With unlimited liability, not one insurance company will want to conclude policies, unless they introduce these themselves."
"I fear that we then end up with a situation that is completely out of control, one I do not think will work, either for the economy or for the environment."
"Consequently, we have once again endorsed state liability, the governments’ safety net function."
"It is necessary for all Member States to be forced to monitor carefully the permits that are being issued and to check these as well."
"We need this big stick."
"In addition, an amendment has been rejected on a mitigation system, a system whereby the factors are weighed up."
"Since an amendment with far-reaching defence measures, full exemptions and exceptions, has been adopted, this amendment has not made it unfortunately."
"As it has been re-tabled, I hope that we can find a qualified majority for these three important points, and that we can also introduce it in Europe."
"I think that the environment stands to benefit from this, as does our economy, because we will then have minimum harmonisation."
"That is particularly beneficial for the environment, which does not have any boundaries."
"Within the internal market that we want to optimise, there are no boundaries for our companies either, so as far as this is concerned, I think that minimum harmonisation is an excellent starting point that benefits both the environment and our economy."
"If we fail to reach a qualified majority on these points, I think that, on the eve of the elections, this Parliament should hang its head in shame, because we have given the Council free rein to lay down the detail of something that is tremendously important, and I would regret that."
"I hope that we will be spared this loss of face, and that we manage to find a qualified majority, particularly for the points that I have just mentioned."
"I will pull out all the stops for this, and we have all day tomorrow as well."
". Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Manders, for his work on environmental liability."
"The process of getting the proposal this far has not been an easy one, as Mr Manders has already said."
"It took a long time to develop the proposal and the subsequent discussions have demonstrated a great diversity of opinion in the Council and Parliament."
"With the overall goals of the proposal in mind, the Commission has shown flexibility in helping a balanced compromise to be achieved within the Council."
"This compromise enabled the overall goal of the proposal to be preserved."
"The common position aims to establish a Community framework whereby environmental damage would be prevented or remedied through a system of environmental liability."
"The main features of the liability regime itself have not been significantly altered except on one point, which is the very broad discretion that is now available to Member States when deciding to remedy or otherwise environmental damage for which no solvent polluter can be held liable."
"The amendments under consideration by the Parliament concern several key issues, on which I should like to comment."
"Firstly, it is proposed in Amendment No 6 that remedial measures in case of damage to habitats and species are only taken within designated Natura 2000 areas."
"This means in effect that the scope of the future directive would be restricted to the Natura 2000 network."
"The Commission cannot support an approach which would narrow the scope of the future directive even further than was agreed in the common position, which in itself was less comprehensive than the original Commission proposal."
"Conversely, the Commission does not believe it either justifiable or workable to expand strict liability to all occupational activities in the EU."
"It cannot therefore support Amendment No 45."
"The scope of the directive is also touched upon in Amendments Nos 41, 42, 50 and 51 seeking to ensure that the directive should apply in future when environmental damage caused by an incident involving nuclear activities is not remedied on the basis of the relevant international conventions."
"The directive would in a way 'complement' the international conventions."
"Regarding the proposed 'complementarity' approach, the Commission does not believe it can work since it would oblige Member States having ratified those conventions to denounce them."
"We believe, on the contrary, that the international liability regime for damage caused by nuclear activities should be preserved."
"It is true that environmental damage will only be covered by this international regime once the new protocol to the Paris and Brussels Conventions, recently negotiated under the auspices of the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency, enters into force."
"This protocol does not allow the EU to become a party to it."
"It thus falls to Member States to ratify this protocol so that it becomes applicable."
"I should also like to mention that the application of the relevant international conventions will be part of the review to be conducted by the Commission, as required by Article 18 of the draft directive."
"With regard to State subsidiary action, Amendments Nos 11, 13, 47, 59 and 60 require Member States to take remedial action in certain cases."
"The Commission’s view, after 13 months of difficult negotiations with the Member States, was that the time and conditions were not ripe for such an approach."
"It agreed consequently to amend its proposal."
"The common position leaves a wide measure of discretion to the Member States in deciding whether or not remedial action ought to be taken."
"This was a key point in achieving agreement among the Member States."
"The Commission will therefore not support those amendments."
"Concerning the so-called regulatory compliance and state-of-the-art or development risk issue, some amendments – Amendments Nos 9 and 16 – have been tabled that both seek to exclude from the scope of the directive damage caused by lawful events or which were scientifically unpredictable and to ensure that, under the same conditions, the operator will be entirely exonerated from any financial responsibility."
"The Commission stated on the occasion of the first reading that it considered that better specification of the scope of the so-called 'permit defence' would be useful, to avoid any suggestion that this might be tantamount to a 'blank cheque' to pollute."
"The Commission does not see that the alternative wording proposed by these two amendments would constitute a further improvement."
"Amendments Nos 48 and 61, for their part, seek to ensure that the liable operator will be entitled to invoke regulatory compliance and the unpredictable character of damage as mitigating factors."
"These amendments are acceptable in part and in principle insofar as their thrust goes closer to the current thinking on these issues, as it emerged from the debates that led to the adoption of the common position."
"Amendments Nos 52, 53, 57 and 58 seek to exclude from the scope of the directive good agricultural and forestry practice, as defined in some agro-environmental regulation."
"A total exclusion would be only warranted if the agro-environmental regulation ensured the same level of environmental protection as the liability directive."
"This does not seem to be the case."
"The Commission would rather see good agricultural and forestry practices as part of the circumstances which would lead to an attenuation of liability."
"Amendment No 17 seeks to impose proportional liability in case of damage caused by several parties."
"The Commission considers that Member States should retain the right to opt either for joint and several or proportional liability – or a mix of both – according to their national legal traditions."
"With respect to biotechnology, Amendments Nos 43, 44, 54 and 55 require the Commission to present a proposal to supplement the regulatory framework on liability for economic damage caused by genetically modified organisms."
"The issue of economic damage to conventional and organic farmers has been discussed and is still being discussed in the context of the so-called 'co-existence' debate."
"Insofar as this type of damage represents damage which has traditionally been dealt with by national civil liability laws, it is by no means clear whether Community action is necessary and would show such an added value as being justified under the subsidiarity principle."
"I believe that the outcome of that debate should not be prejudged here."
"On the question of financial security, Amendments Nos 22 and 49 require the Commission to submit proposals for a harmonised compulsory financial guarantee, should no appropriate instruments or markets for insurance or other forms of financial security have developed on their own."
"Everybody is convinced of the important role that financial security, including but not limited to insurance, can play in the implementation of the directive."
"Member States and market operators, as well as the Commission, will have an important role to play in encouraging a timely emergence of financial assurance systems, products and markets to that effect."
"Having said this, it is clear to me that Member States should have the possibility to develop financial assurance solutions at their own pace which are well adapted to their own needs and institutional conditions."
"It would be particularly difficult to adopt rules mandating financial security when the economic operators most knowledgeable and economically interested in developing such products have been unable to do so."
"The Commission is therefore not in a position to support the amendment on financial security."
"It is certainly willing, however, to encourage initiatives whereby further impetus should be given to the market and all financial security providers to develop financial security products that would meet the new demand resulting from the adoption of the directive and the fact that operators will now be exposed to liability."
"Finally, on the issue of the extent to which damage should be remedied, there is general agreement that the polluter-pays principle should imply for the liable operator, as for the polluter, payment of all damage caused to the environment."
"In addition, there is a clear need to have a common understanding, within the Community, of the costs of environmental damage to be borne by the polluter."
"Furthermore, the rules set out in the proposal specify the full range of remediation actions to be carried out by the operator liable."
"Amendments Nos 31 to 36 narrow down the scope of damage remediation by suppressing the remediation of interim losses, together with suppressing the concept of compensatory remedial measures."
"Deleting elements from this range of actions would inevitably result in the polluter not having to carry the full cost of the damage he has caused."
"Having said all that, the Commission can support either fully, in part or in principle several of the amendments proposed."
"Those amendments are: 4, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 23, 27, 40, 48, 61 and 63."
"We all agree that we want ambitious and workable legislation."
"The Commission sees the common position as a minimum in this respect."
"Finding a balanced compromise will be difficult, but the Commission will do all it can to help achieve this."
"Finally, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Manders, once more."
"– Thank you, Mr President."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by expressing especial thanks to our rapporteur, Mr Manders, who has been right behind this directive in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and has endeavoured to unite the various views on the directive’s scope into compromises that all the groups can support."
"So, once again, my warm thanks to him for that."
"Over 300 000 of the European Union’s industrial sites are contaminated, and so it is vital and right that this directive should be adopted, thereby achieving a substantial advance in the protection of the environment."
"Let me emphasise, on behalf of my group, that, although we support this directive, we argued strongly, as early as first reading, in favour of keeping a sense of proportion when dealing with this directive, for the best is sometimes the enemy of the good."
"What is good, in our view, is the consensus arrived at in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"What is beyond doubt is that those who cause damage to the environment in the course of their business have to accept responsibility for it."
"No attempt is made to interfere with the ‘polluter pays’ principle."
"If you can be shown to have caused damage, then you are liable for it."
"With this directive, once enacted, we will be breaking new ground in effectively protecting the environment in Europe."
"In none of the Member States so far has compensation been payable in respect of simple interference with flora and fauna."
"This directive changes this, and that is what is new about it."
"For the first time, compensation becomes payable in respect of damage to protected species and their habitats, too."
"Whilst we stand by this, I have to again emphasise the need for us to keep a sense of proportion as we prepare to take this step, for there is as yet little reliable data that would make it possible to assess purely ecological damage and to calculate what should be paid for it."
"Let me consider a few individual points that gave rise to controversy in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"Firstly, what are the consequences if an enterprise, in doing its work, remains within the framework of the authorisation given to it?"
"The ‘polluter pays’ principle applies; enterprises that damage the environment must accept liability for doing so."
"I do think, though, that fairness requires that those who remain within the framework of the authorisation given to them should be able to have the confidence that the authorities will make allowance for this if damage is actually found to have been done."
"The second point at issue is mandatory insurance against damage covered by the directive."
"I do not think it right to bring in mandatory insurance for environmental damage until such time as reliable data become available."
"Efforts must be made to obtain this data."
"The directive helps to do that, in that, for the first time, it imposes a duty to compensate in respect of damage that is done to the environment alone, but businesses, and, in consequence, the insurance industry too, must have time to devise insurance schemes that are affordable and the premiums for which are capable of being calculated."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market wants that time to be made available to them."
"In practical terms, that means that our group opposes the introduction of mandatory insurance with immediate effect from the enactment of the directive."
"The last point I would like to address has to do with farmers and foresters."
"If the directive is not clarified appropriately, farmers and foresters will be particularly hard hit by its provisions."
"Farmers live with nature and make their living from it."
"It follows, then, that they should be excluded from the scope of the directive if they maintain best agricultural practice in the course of their activities."
"To frame the directive in these terms is not to give farmers and foresters ."
"‘Best practice’ is a recognised concept in national and European law, one that the Commission has only recently defined, and it gives expression to an accepted standard."
"Let me conclude by summing up our group’s thinking."
"We want the directive passed into law so that it can improve, in the long term, the protection of the environment in the European Union, but let us not make the mistake of being led by good intentions to attempt the second step before we have taken the first."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, not only for our own sake, but also for the sake of future generations, we need to have proper regard for the environment, for an undamaged environment is one of the most valuable of the goods that are entrusted to us."
"It is for that reason that we have before us a directive that makes a priority of caring for the environment and preventing damage to it."
"Achieving that objective requires that we be consistent in applying the ‘polluter pays’ principle, which states that those who cause damage to the environment or bear responsibility for it, must pay for the damage to be dealt with, and that the burden of proof lies with them."
"Only in this way can we put a stop to negligence and the evasion of responsibility at the expense of society as a whole."
"The names of two ships, the and the , are synonymous with catastrophes that disproportionately burdened public funds and cost many people their jobs and livelihoods."
"Even minor environmental disasters can bring a community to the brink of ruin, and, although we will never be able to completely exclude the possibility of them, unremitting liability for environmental damage will deter those who might be the cause of them."
"My group takes the view that there is no room for exceptions to be made, and that is why we want this directive to fully cover sectors with grave consequences for the environment, such as the nuclear power industry or genetically modified organisms."
"Amendments to this effect are before the House."
"Let me conclude by adding something on the subject of mandatory insurance, which is meeting with such fierce resistance, particularly from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"In Germany, if you buy a house or own a flat, you have to take out insurance against fire and the forces of nature, even though, in cases of doubt, it is only you who will be out in the cold."
"No doubt the situation is similar elsewhere."
"It is, then, quite incomprehensible that the operators of environmentally hazardous plant or those who use dangerous substances should not have to insure against liability."
"Must it always be the taxpayer, by way of the public purse, who is asked to pay up when things get really expensive?"
"And are we in this European Parliament really going to introduce less protection, less of the ‘polluter pays’ principle, into this area, than the Council is willing to permit?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, this time I cannot talk on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party because we have not adopted positions on a number of the most critical issues."
"Just as Mrs Gebhardt said, we face an unusual situation."
"There is a danger of Parliament impairing the Council’s common position on environmental matters, a factor that also emerged from Commissioner Bolkestein’s contribution."
"It might conceivably involve a deterioration in relation to the position in the majority of Member States."
"That would be a scandal and must not happen."
"To Mrs Niebler, I wish to say that a strict liability exists that is much more comprehensive on many issues than the situation that would result from this common position."
"The proposal is not, therefore, particularly radical, either."
"Allow me to take a practical example."
"If the committee responsible had its way or if Amendment No 61 were adopted, we should be approving a situation in which it would scarcely be possible to require the Helsinki port authorities to repair the damage that is in the process of occurring there through TBT Poison being produced due to dredging and then spread in the watercourses in eastern Helsinki and in the surrounding archipelago."
"That is because dredging takes place completely under licence, and the authorities had at no stage been able to foresee that this poison would exist in the dredging waste."
"This case is now also being dealt with by the Committee on Petitions."
"I wanted to mention this in order to show how unreasonable it would be to adopt the reservations, now chosen by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, relating to existing levels of knowledge and to exemptions from liability if permission has been given."
"Financial arrangements must be acceptable in the compromise proposal we now have."
"They cannot, however, be harmonised too far, because we have different, quite creative arrangements in different Member States."
"Finally, I want to ask MEPs to remember that ‘state’ is not synonymous with ‘authority’."
"This matter also affects the local authorities to a very great extent, and this fact must be taken account of in the vote."
"Mr President, the directive we are debating is very important; perhaps it is directive of the parliamentary term."
"Because we are not just saying 'the polluter pays' and, consequently, whoever has to pay can pollute; we are saying that the polluter must pay the cost of restoring the damage which he has caused."
"Consequently, the directive may respond to our citizens' huge hopes for public health and the environment and we must not water it down."
"Various views were expressed during the debate."
"We have proven that we can find compromise solutions such as, for example, the gradual introduction of compulsory insurance so that the cost of the damage is never passed on to the taxpayer and the polluter can cover the damage under his insurance, or the compromise whereby the Member States must undertake to restore the damage if the polluter cannot or if the person responsible cannot be found."
"We have problems, however, to which it would appear that we cannot find compromise solutions: how can we talk of agricultural and forestry practices which somehow exonerate the use of chemical fertilisers, pesticides and weedkillers when we all know – from the Union's own statistics – the damage which they can cause to biodiversity, the ground and water?"
"How can we somehow issue blank licences to polluters, accepting the complete exemption of those who hold licences or respect the current state of the art?"
"We have to find ways here too and the relevant compromise proposals exist."
"If, however, we do not do something in this direction, industry will never be persuaded to abandon polluting processes."
"So things are still serious and I would say that we should also debate the other issues on which I heard the Commissioner being very negative."
"We cannot have a directive that says nothing about genetically modified organisms and the damage which their free use may cause or which makes no reference to the damage caused by shipping or the use of nuclear energy."
"Compromise amendments have been proposed which I find to be exceptionally moderate and realistic and I do not understand how citing international conventions, especially conventions which not all the Member States of the European Union have signed, can be the answer to this question."
"So greater willingness needs to be demonstrated by both the Commission and by us, ladies and gentlemen, so that this legislation really is legislation of the parliamentary term."
"I should also like to say something because certain members spoke of 'teratogenesis'."
"Frankenstein, with his technology, produced a monster ever greater than himself."
"Let us not therefore put ourselves in the ridiculous position of producing a baby monster which is far inferior to our powers."
"Mr President, I believe that we are all aware that this directive on environmental liability is potentially a key piece in the legislative arsenal aimed at making economic activities compatible with protecting the environment."
"Its declared objective is indeed to implement the polluter pays principle by making the polluter bear the cost of repairing the damage caused to the environment, but also to act pre-emptively thanks to a financial liability mechanism, designed to encourage economic actors to minimise the risks."
"The Commission proposal and, it must be said, the Council common position, leave us completely unsatisfied because they give us a text that, I am sorry to say, does not live up to the stated ambitions."
"Indeed, we note that it offers economic actors several ways out, in particular through legal derogations from liability, by having an appropriate permit or by having state of the art technology."
"Even these derogations are still considered inadequate by our fellow Members in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which adopted an amendment proposing a supplementary derogation for the agriculture and forestry sector: the respect of good professional practice in agriculture and forestry."
"I know that we are now at second reading and I have learnt to be realistic after several years as a Member of this Parliament."
"We have little room to manoeuvre."
"We must achieve a qualified majority, and this is why I added my name, on behalf of my group – and I will support further amendments – those which can be described as moderate in so far as they stipulate a very gradual entry into force of the restricting legislative measures without, for all that, invalidating the essential basic proposals"
"I will mention them in no particular order."
"The first proposal is to remove the planned derogations but turn them into factors that limit liability."
"This is wholly acceptable and I understand that the Commissioner is open to this suggestion."
"We are, therefore, concerned here with mitigating factors, which are very different from derogations."
"Secondly, in order that the directive is actually a preventive tool, it is a matter of setting up a mandatory system for financial liability, which will be phased in, that is to say, will be implemented gradually."
"Thirdly, it is absolutely necessary that, for a certain amount of time, after an introductory phase, the scope of this directive is enlarged."
"Fourthly, we are calling, and there are several of us doing so in this Parliament, for additional legislation concerning the liability of producers and users of genetically modified organisms in the event of contamination."
"I recall that the Commission promised this when Directive No 2001/18 was adopted."
"Fifthly and finally, the situation must be visibly improved as regards the risks from nuclear energy and of marine pollution by hydrocarbons."
"Mrs Gebhardt, on behalf the Group of the Party of European Socialists, mentioned the and tragedies I will not remind you of this problem but we know that it led to considerable environmental damage."
"I would, however, like to say a word about nuclear energy."
"As regards nuclear energy, in particular, operators’ liability remains limited."
"The fact that there are international conventions does not mean that the situation is satisfactory."
"Is it necessary to remind you that, according to a study by a group of researchers at the University of London, a major accident in a nuclear power station would cost USD 10 billion, and an accident similar to Chernobyl with extremely widespread contamination of the territory, USD 40 billion?"
"These are factors that I ask my fellow Members to take into consideration when talking about nuclear power."
"We cannot accept that such a dangerous activity is exempt from such important legislation on the liability of economic actors."
"Mr President, it is unacceptable that a directive on environmental liability should not include pollution from the use of genetically modified plants (GMOs)."
"In Parliament’s readings of directives on seed corn and the tracing and labelling of GMOs, it has been clear that there is a risk of unintentional pollution, even with the correct use of GMOs."
"What is at issue is pollution due to the spreading of pollen and waste seed accumulated in the seed bank."
"The experts argue about how much waste seed might be accumulated in the seed bank of the earth and for how long."
"That being said, GMO pollution is not included in the proposal for a directive on environmental liability."
"That is incredible, partly in the light of the fact that the ‘polluter pays’ principle is established in the Treaties."
"I am therefore able to support the proposals concerning GMOs by Mr Lannoye and others."
"I think that the ‘polluter pays’ principle should be more than just words."
"It is time that the EU lived up to its ideals."
"The EU should therefore require the Member States to impose a duty on GMO corn seed and feed – a duty used to fund control and supervision, as well as indemnification for damage that arises from correct use."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report on environmental liability has led to extremely complex and, indeed, emotionally-charged debates in the competent committees."
"I believe that the continuous search for a balance has made the directive now before us far too vague, but I nonetheless believe that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and its rapporteur, in particular, have done sterling work in their quest to achieve a more or less acceptable compromise."
"I am delighted that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has adopted my amendment on development risks and the permit defence."
"Both the development risks – which are, by definition, unknown and cannot possibly be discovered on the basis of scientific knowledge – and the permit defence will be included in the directive in the form of the entrepreneur's exemption of liability."
"I would therefore urge the Commission to accept this amendment."
"This is absolutely essential if we want to promote the innovation and creativity of European companies, particularly in view of the fact that their American rivals have enjoyed an arrangement of this kind for a long time."
"I do, however, regret the fact that the text does not give greater emphasis to the principle that ‘the polluter pays’."
"The current wording in the directive is very confusing and can, I believe, lead to legal uncertainty."
"I regard this as a definite loophole in the legislative text."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to add my voice to the unanimous acclaim of this directive as important and fundamental – maybe the most important directive achieved in the current legislature."
"Therefore, in my capacity as chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, I would like to stress the great balance achieved by Mr Manders in tabling appropriate amendments on a matter in which it is easy to see that exaggeration and underestimation are equally unhelpful."
"The directive is complex and the – positive or negative – impact on the environment and the production system as a whole depends precisely on whether we strike the right balance."
"A directive which went beyond what is sensible would be in danger, in practical terms, of imposing heavy, unbearable obligations and costs on companies, possibly even driving them to relocate to other countries where these rules are not in force - and they would be doing so reluctantly - so that they can compete on the international market."
"I, too, would stress the fact that the – not trivial, but important – ‘polluter pays’ principle, by which those who cause damage have to repair the damaged goods, is essential in a society which seeks to guarantee sufficient quality of life in the future too."
"It is also important to establish what is covered by the protection and, therefore, the ensuing liability: who is liable, for how long and to what extent."
"I believe that the Council’s common position is, in itself, a useful contribution in this sense, and we must support it."
"Thus, the principle of ‘discernment and balance’ – which I am repeatedly stressing and which has been a constant theme running through our debate – has led us to identify protected sites, define responsibilities and provide for exclusion from liability for those who have observed legal authorisations and rules."
"I will confine myself to adding to the proposals of the Committee on Legal Affairs, together with Mrs Niebler – the shadow rapporteur who really has done an excellent job, as was clear from her speech yesterday too – an amendment which I feel to be particularly important, seeking to maker clearer the definition of operator, which, as the text is currently worded, does not make it possible to exclude banks and other financial institutions involved from liability for environmental damage caused by financial operators."
"As I understand it, the Commission does not agree on this point, which I would like to see explored in greater depth, so as to give greater consideration to whether it is sensible to produce a definition which does not cover all possible eventualities and which might, in actual fact, lead to a claim for damages being made to a financial intermediary."
"This would appear to be a valid request and I do, indeed, recommend that the House support the directive."
"In conclusion, I believe that the Committee on Legal Affairs’ position has been linked to a common position;"
"I hope that it will receive broad consensus in the Chamber in the vote."
"Mr President, I should first of all like to thank the rapporteur."
"I should also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs because they have worked very hard and closely with the rapporteur in trying to come to a compromise on this directive."
"I should like to pick up on a couple of points."
"First of all, the 'polluter pays' principle has been mentioned a few times tonight."
"We already have 'polluter-pays' legislation."
"In the past the polluter has only paid a fine, but we have had a fundamental shift and now the polluter pays to clear up the damage that he or she has created."
"That is a fundamental shift in legislation."
"If we are to enact that then we have to look at the financial security systems behind it."
"That is why I believe mandatory financial security is important."
"It is a key point here."
"I accept the point that Mrs Niebler and the Commissioner made that the market is not yet developed."
"That is why, in a number of amendments, we ask the Commission to study the whole market and ensure that when we finally bring in a mandatory system at a later date, the whole area is covered."
"I should like to add that we have also gauged the points of view of the Member States and given them responsibility for defining low-risk activities, i.e. taking them out."
"That is a major step forwards for businesses of all shapes and sizes."
"With regard to the Commissioner's point on Member State responsibility, I realise that he had difficulties over the last few months negotiating with the Council on this point and that it has not been easy."
"However, we have to come to a situation where if somebody defaults, or an operator goes into insolvency and does not have this insurance, somebody has to clean up."
"Who is it going to be?"
"It cannot fall on the local authorities; it has to fall on a Member State and we cannot allow Member States to just walk away from it and allow pollution to continue to grow."
"Therefore the Member States have a responsibility."
"Briefly, on the mitigating circumstances, I am glad to see that the Commissioner is accepting Amendments Nos 40 and 61."
"I hope they go through."
"And I am glad to see the mitigating circumstances taken into account, along with permit defences."
"Mr President, I agree with what my friend and colleague, Mr Miller, was just saying."
"At the moment it is a pious platitude to say that the polluter pays - polluters on the whole do not pay or pay only a small part of what they should pay."
"It would be a great thing to move forward to a situation where it becomes a principle of law and not a pious platitude that polluters have to pay."
"I was grateful for Commissioner Bolkestein's remarks about Amendments Nos 48 and 61."
"It is important to take account of permits and state-of-the-art."
"However, as the common position indicates, there are permits and permits."
"The degree of detail and specificity of what is permitted varies from situation to situation."
"In these circumstances, to have an all-or-nothing principle - either something is covered by a permit and, therefore, exempt from any liability, or it is not covered and fully liable - seems like a mistake. It seems right to adopt a principle of mitigation so that there is a sliding scale taking account of the variability of permits and circumstances."
"The Commissioner also talked about nuclear liability."
"I happen to be the rapporteur for the still stalled report on the reform of the Paris Convention."
"I take his point that this will expand the range and level of liability of nuclear operators, but it remains the case, unhappily, that nuclear power still travels in a boat of its own, subject to a rather special exception to the 'polluter-pays' principle - the polluter pays quite a lot, but not necessarily everything in that case."
"My Group resents the special treatment of the nuclear industry."
"We said that during the Euratom debate and there will, no doubt, be other occasions to say it."
"We are also concerned about going too easy on the GMO cases."
"That is another example where deliberate economic activity aimed quite laudably at profit and gain can cause exponentially spreading damage of a most alarming kind, and not to bring that within the scale of this directive would be to create an unjustifiable exemption."
"There are other points I could make, but there are many speakers in this debate."
"We are very strongly in favour of this directive and hope that it will leave this House in a really strong form."
"Mr President, we feel that the proposal for a directive that we are debating this evening with regard to the prevention and the remedying of environmental damage is very important because it develops a system of liabilities based on the polluter pays principle for a whole range of damage likely to have been caused by economic activities to the natural heritage."
"This heritage is our shared asset and, in order to protect it, we must be extremely vigilant."
"We must not turn a blind eye to the damage, which sometimes is in danger of going unnoticed because it does not directly affect private property."
"This is why, at this second reading, we do not agree in particular with Amendment No 9 of the European Parliament, which excludes from the scope of the directive activities that have an administrative permit or those not considered to be dangerous according to the state of knowledge at the time when the damage occurred."
"Those who take the risk must also assume it, and this is why we do not agree with Amendment No 39 either, which seeks to supplement Amendment No 9 to exempt GMOs in advance or to lessen the liability of those who work with them."
"On the other hand, we support Amendment No 22, which, in contrast with earlier ones, moves towards better protection since it reintroduces the idea of a compulsory financial guarantee to be gradually implemented."
"Indeed, as regards this point, we cannot be satisfied with the vague wording of the current text."
"Mr President, I would like firstly, as other Members have done, to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Manders, and the rapporteur for my group, Mrs Niebler, who has not just been able to reach agreements with Mr Manders, but also to seek consensus within the group and also to inform us punctually of what was happening with this proposed Directive."
"As has rightly been said, we are dealing with a really important Directive."
"We are all aware of the importance of environmental protection and the fact that this Directive reflects the ‘polluter pays’ principle."
"However, we must also be aware that polluters are often companies, and we must ensure their survival within our economy."
"I therefore believe that there are two important principles: the first, which Mr Gargani has mentioned, is not to promote the relocation of our companies towards other markets, and the second is to find the greatest possible degree of harmonisation within the European Union."
"I believe that all the countries of the Union must comply with this Directive, and it must oblige the Member States equally: we must not allow each Member State to apply it differently."
"The scope must be as broad as possible, as laid down in the common position, and, with regard to the possible exceptions for operators with regard to compliance with any previous legislation, I believe it is true that Amendments Nos 9 and 16 are excessive, as has been said here, and would allow some companies to escape their duty to pay."
"But it is true that we must seek some mechanism according to which the fact that companies comply with the legislation in force is considered a mitigating factor."
"With regard to the reparation measures, we must allow the Member States to be able to cover the damage created, as reparation measures, as laid down in Amendments Nos 10, 11 and 12 approved by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"Finally, with regard to the time period during which a company can be held responsible, I believe that the 30 years laid down in the common position is an excessive period."
"The environmental contingency it would represent for companies seems to me to be excessive, and I support Mrs Thyssen’s amendment, which would reduce this time period to 10 years: it makes much more sense to reduce the time period during which companies must be held responsible for the environmental damage caused."
"Mr President, the Council has partially aligned with the position of the European Parliament on the question of the exemption of operators from environmental liability which, in the Commission's initial text, was so broad as to cancel out the implementation of the 'polluter pays' principle to all intents and purposes."
"At the same time, however, in order to mitigate the onerous consequences for companies which are not to blame, Parliament accepted that the licence or failure to diagnose the harmful consequences of the activity at issue in time could operate as mitigating circumstances when charging the operator for the cost of restoring ecological damage."
"This moderate position on the part of the European Parliament is now in danger of being cancelled at second reading, in that there are amendments which, if accepted, will result in complete exemption."
"The licence and knowledge must be taken into account solely as mitigating circumstances."
"Similarly, on the question of insurance, the cost must not be passed on to the taxpayer."
"We insist on the need to lay down the implementation stages of the directive, at reasonable intervals, and to define the types of activities and damage covered in the text of the directive as of now."
"To conclude, I should point out that the contradictory positions of the PPE-DE cancel out protection and it is worth questioning how it is that, while they are calling here for collective responsibility, they advocate personal responsibility everywhere else."
"– Mr President, environmental liability is a sensitive topic."
"This is also evident from the battle between the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"The Council has struck a feeble compromise, which just may take effect after the review in a few years’ time."
"At the moment, it is feeble at any rate, and will not do much to help improve the situation of the environment."
"Where biodiversity is concerned, we are lagging even behind the United States in terms of legislation."
"It is very important to us, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, to extend the scope of this directive."
"It has been said before: firstly, nuclear energy, secondly, pollution by sea-going ships and thirdly, damage caused by GM crops."
"Commissioner Bolkestein, you have the reputation of speaking in no uncertain terms and of not pulling your punches, but I have to say that your hiding behind the coexistence rule is, of course, nonsense."
"What is at issue here is that the Commission is frightened of pressure from the United States, and it should simply admit this."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy was in favour of extending the directive by these three supplements; the Liberal rapporteur, regrettably, was not."
"Another important point is compulsory insurance."
"That is essential."
"Unfortunately, the Christian Democrats are opposed to this, and so is the Liberal rapporteur."
"The crucial question is: who should foot the bill for environmental damage?"
"In its draft, the Commission wanted to pass the buck to the governments, and it is fortunate that these, in the common position, declined to do so."
"The polluter pays, and so he should."
"It is the businesses, not the governments, that cause pollution."
"I have to get something off my chest."
"The rapporteur has made rather a hash of things. He has taken only right-wing views into consideration, as illustrated by the amendments relating to good agricultural practice."
"He is responsible for Parliament’s lack of power, and industry will be grateful to him."
"Mr President, we in the British Conservative Group have a strong commitment to protecting our environment and this is an important directive which is capable of doing good both for the environment and for business."
"However, like many pieces of legislation it could be many years before we see the full impact of it."
"It is important, therefore, to take the longer view."
"On the one hand, unfettered commercial activity, as we all know, can destroy the environment."
"On the other hand, over-regulation closes down commercial life at a stroke."
"It is precisely this commercial life which we all depend on, on which our culture and our society is based."
"The second reading position is an excellent starting point and one which we support."
"However, there are very important points which we need to bear in mind."
"The first is the absolute necessity to allow the permit and state-of-the-art defences to remain."
"It would be terrible to see companies in 20 years' time facing prosecutions for things which they did now, which are later judged to have been wrong."
"I am very concerned also about the workability of the compulsory financial security, whether it is in the form of insurance, bonds or other forms of security."
"We know perfectly well that the insurance industries are not yet able to offer schemes which would meet the needs of this Parliament or the Commission in bringing forward this legislation."
"We also know that it would lead to a disproportionate burden on small businesses."
"Do we wish to be responsible for making small businesses go under because we are putting this compulsory liability on them?"
"Indeed, mention has already been made of the taxpayer having to bear the burden, but if we made this compulsory, it would be Member State taxpayers who eventually would have to stand in place to guarantee this."
"It is much better to leave this on one side for now and see how the directive begins to work and come back to this in the future."
"Nor can we be certain that pollution will respect the boundaries of the EU, however large the EU becomes."
"It is important, therefore, certainly with nuclear matters and pollution at sea, that we use those models to carry on with our international obligations and work with our other partners around the world."
"Too often the best is the enemy of the good with legislation."
"We need to be moderate in what we try to achieve today."
"If we keep with what we are proposing in the common position, this piece of legislation can do some real good and should be welcomed and we welcome it today and we wish to see the directive in place."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am a convinced supporter of the European model of the environmentally-responsible market economy, which makes it clear that the liberalised market is not the irresponsible thing it is often suspected of being, but has social and environmental responsibilities and hence a responsibility to future generations."
"It follows that there is no doubt that a responsible European economic and environmental policy must, together with the approval procedure, ensure that serious damage to the environment can be prevented, and that any damage caused can be made good, with the costs being borne primarily by the persons or bodies that caused the damage."
"As yet, not all the Member States apply the polluter pays principle, and so European regulations are needed to prevent the incidence of distortions of competition in the market."
"It is in relation to this that my colleague Mrs Flemming and I support the re-submission of two important amendments calling for nuclear damage to be included within the scope of the directive."
"I ask to support Amendments Nos 41 and 42, since this directive is meant to cover activities that actually are dangerous."
"I regard the decision by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market to exclude nuclear power stations from the scope of the environmental liability directive as incomprehensible, as it cover all the alternative forms of energy; whoever is responsible for damage done to the environment by wind power, biomass, biogas and solar energy installations, must be held liable."
"Why not in the case of damage done by nuclear power?"
"In Amendments Nos 41 and 42, then, we are asking for this to be included."
"I also want to put the case for greater legal certainty, which is why we are in favour of the period of liability taking the form envisaged in Mrs Thyssen’s amendment, and of legal certainty being created by approved plant being excluded from liability."
"The issue of how costs are to be shared between several different polluters must be clarified."
"I am very grateful to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market for the sensible and moderate approach that it has taken."
"This is a legal directive rather than an environmental one."
"Above all else, I am grateful to our rapporteurs, Mr Manders and Mrs Niebler, for the work they have done."
"– Mr President, like Mr Karas, I am an adherent of an ecologically-adjusted market economy, and consequently, a strict liability regulation does not worry me."
"After all, that can have a significant preventive effect and can, as such, be justified."
"However, we should not, in my view, forget that in the proposal we are discussing this evening, we are introducing ‘liability without fault’."
"Some see it as self-evident that there can be liability without fault; personally, I think it is, compared to the traditional liability theory of the continental legal tradition, a very radical instrument, and it is precisely because it is so radical that we have to treat it with caution."
"It is precisely because this instrument is so radical that we have to ensure that a number of pre-conditions are in place."
"Those pre-conditions have to ensure that the regulation is legally certain, that it is practically workable, that it is fair and that it does not interfere too much with innovation and development."
"I will not list the amendments that are useful in this respect."
"Everyone who has followed the debate will know that I am talking about, , the exclusion grounds for licence holders, about the regulation in relation to the state of scientific knowledge, about the exclusion grounds for people who adhere to good agricultural practice and about the replacement of joint liability by proportionate liability."
"The Manders report, as we have voted on it in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, provides for those pre-conditions, so I must congratulate the rapporteur and our group’s shadow rapporteur on the work and on the team effort."
"I should like to ask those of my fellow MEPs who have difficulty with the restrictions introduced in the report, and also the Commission in a way – for it, as I understand it, also has difficulty with a number of our amendments – to revisit the concept of liability without fault very carefully, to bear in mind the difficult, serious impact this can have, and to ensure that we will eventually end up with a better regulation which, for economic reasons and reasons of fairness, is showing some clemency."
"We must naturally ensure that the earth remains viable, but I think that we must also ensure that we have a viable economy, and that we find people who are willing to go into business here."
"Mr President, an accident such as the Aznalcoyar accident – which took place in my country in 1998 – plus almost 300 000 sites identified as definitively or potentially polluted in the European Union they have been pointed out by Mrs Niebler are direct examples of the need for effective rules at European Union level to make the ‘polluter pays’ principle a reality."
"I understand and share the concern to make progress in environmental terms while at the same time maintaining the economic good health of companies, although I believe that is an argument which is used too often and which often does not respond to the reality of the effort companies can and must make in order to conform to this and other Community legislation."
"I believe that the common position would have achieved, or has achieved in fact, a satisfactory balance between legal certainty, environmental protection and industrial development."
"However, I believe that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, despite having done good work, is tomorrow presenting certain amendments – such as No 9 and No 16 – which excessively weaken the common position and which I cannot support."
"We cannot accept that the mere fact of complying with legal activities should be a licence to fail to comply or to be able to act irresponsibly."
"If measures such as these are applied such as those proposed in these amendments accidents such as the Aznalcoyar accident would once again go entirely unpunished in whichever country they took place."
"I would, however, like to point out that I support Amendment No 46, since I believe that, otherwise, we would further weaken the system of environmental responsibility in certain types of maritime transport, which I believe to be important."
"With regard to the issue of financial guarantees, I believe that it improves the Commission’s proposal – which did not provide for them – but that it has not been either as ambitious as initially hoped or as concrete as it could have been."
"I understand the need to give companies a period for adaptation and I hope, of course, that they will do so as soon as possible."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the position of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market outlined in the recommendation tabled by Mr Manders - whom I thank for the enormous amount of work he has done - takes the right line."
"Indeed, it does not make any substantial changes to the Council’s approach but clarifies a number of its fundamental principles so that the directive can be implemented in a more uniform manner over Union territory."
"Given the impact that the regulation will have on industrial activity, we deem it necessary to remove the asymmetry between the legislation of the countries of the Union so as to avoid distortions to trade or to competition between companies."
"However, a number of principles must be clearly stressed: we need to avoid the concept of ‘operator’ being extended to parties responsible for monitoring activities."
"The identification of merely potential damage is contrary to the principles of legal certainty and could therefore lead to lengthy disputes which cannot be addressed with the technical and scientific instruments available."
"The operators responsible for the damage must have the option of taking the necessary measures themselves and informing the competent authorities in due time."
"Intervention on the part of the authority, where either preventive or remedial measures are concerned, should be limited to cases in which the operator is not prepared to act or is unable to do so, in that it is not acceptable for the authority itself to be given the power to take the unquestionable decision of adopting such measures itself."
"Clearly, therefore, such intervention only becomes necessary in the case of what are known as ‘orphan’ or ‘public’ sites, or in the event that the operator fails to act."
"These provisions must be laid down so that decisions are not left too much to the discretion of the Member States."
"The text of the common position states that the individual Member States may, at their discretion, grant exemptions for exceptions where damages are caused by an emission or activity or event allowed in applicable laws and regulations or in an authorisation issued to the operator or which was not considered to be harmful according to the state of scientific and technical knowledge at the time when the emission was released or the activity took place."
"As regards the apportioning of the burden of costs where the damage has been caused by more than one party, the Council has given each Member State the right to provide for both joint and several, and proportional liability, according to the national legislation in force."
"The apportioning of joint and several financial liability, in addition to being in blatant conflict with the ‘polluter pays’ principle, would certainly make it more difficult, if not impossible, for operators in production sectors to calculate insurance premiums and other financial security."
"Liability and related costs must, therefore, only be apportioned on fair, reasonable bases, with the requirement, moreover, that each operator performs a part of the remedial operation which corresponds to that operator’s share of the liability."
". Mr President, I shall be brief because no questions have been addressed to the Commission and therefore I can confine myself to making the following remarks."
"The common position which was sent to Parliament for second reading is clearly a compromise."
"The main issue at this stage is whether it is possible to improve it without opening a Pandora's box and possibly jeopardising what has been achieved so far."
"I am well aware that this proposal is complex and sensitive."
"Difficult choices have to be made among competing interests."
"We believe that the common position preserves a generally satisfactory balance and it is with the aim of seeking further improvements, whilst maintaining this balance, that the Commission will consider the amendments adopted by Parliament."
"In conclusion, I should like once again to thank the rapporteur, Mr Manders, and may I also thank you, Mr President, for giving me the floor a second time in this debate."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0418/2003) by Mr Koch, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive 74/408/EEC relating to motor vehicles with regards to the seats, their anchorages and head restraints [COM(2003) 361 C5-0283/2003 2003/0128(COD)]."
"Mr President, the Commission would like to thank Mr Koch for his excellent report."
"This proposal to amend the Council Directive of 22 July 1974 relating to seats and head restraints of motor vehicles is one of the two proposals associated with the 1997 directive on installing safety belts."
"This latter directive is, moreover, the subject of a change that seeks to make the installation of safety belts obligatory in all vehicles."
"These provisions follow the enforcement of compulsory use of safety belts in vehicles, provided for in the directive of 8 April 2003."
"At the moment, only car seats must comply with the technical criteria and satisfy the resistance tests provided for in the directive of 1974."
"From then on all seats, and in particular those in coaches, that are in vehicles put into service in the Community from July 2004 should be tested in accordance with the directive."
"They must be compatible with the installation of safety belts."
"The Commission proposal also includes a ban on installing side-facing seats in any vehicles designed for transport of persons, with the exception of city buses with more than 22 seats."
"The Commission cannot support the rapporteur’s proposal to allow, despite everything, the installation of side-facing seats in coaches."
"I must remind you that when the directive of 20 November 2001 was drawn up as regards safety of buses and coaches, this issue had already been the subject of a debate."
"The Commission was then called upon to carry out a study on the safety of passengers travelling in side-facing seats."
"This study showed that there were no technical solutions adapted to this layout of seats and it recommended a ban on side-facing seats in all vehicles for the transport of people."
"Another study, conducted by the Commission in 1996, had already showed all the risks incurred by passengers wearing a safety belt not adapted for this arrangement of seats."
"The Commission cannot, therefore, accept Amendments Nos 1 and 2."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the White Paper on European transport policy, we set ourselves ambitious goals, especially as regards the improvement of road safety."
"Far from requiring us to approach this in a spirit of unthinking activism, these goals oblige us to take sensible courses of action in various sectors in order to have an effect."
"The measures in question certainly do not always involve high investment costs; one good example is the introduction by law of the mandatory wearing of seatbelts in all seats of a motor vehicle fitted with them."
"This strikes me as sensible, effective and much to be welcomed."
"Since we already have the requirement to wear a seat belt, it makes sense also for the law to require them to be fitted with few exceptions and this is something to be advocated."
"I am grateful to the Commission for doing this."
"Even in buses, which are in any case among the safest means of transport in the European Union, safety belts will, in the event of an accident, help to reduce injuries and save human lives."
"With this in mind, the Commission is now proposing that side-facing seats, for which there are as yet no effective restraint systems, should be permitted only in buses used in urban and interurban regular traffic, there being, in the Commission’s view, no particular danger to the persons using such seats."
"This covers seats in thousands of buses, used to transport millions of adults and schoolchildren every day."
"The fact is that there are no analyses of accidents to which we can refer."
"On the contrary, it strikes me as utterly illogical that the Commission, in its proposal for a directive, seeks simply to ban side-facing seats of this kind only from comfortable coaches, in which only a few of these are to be found, as individual seats forming part of comfortable groups of seats of a type with which few of us will be familiar."
"These the Commission does see as potentially hazardous for users, but it makes no attempt to motivate or oblige industry to develop restraint systems suited to such seats."
"Having no prejudices in this matter, I initially asked myself whether this was an example of carelessness or of an oversight."
"The answer, though, was provided by the discussion in the Committee, in the aftermath of which two – admittedly populist – questions forced themselves into my mind: firstly, is the Commission prepared to expose people in the ‘cheap’ side-facing seats in buses in urban and interurban traffic – which it wants to permit – to a greater safety risk than the people who use similar seats in luxury coaches, or, secondly and contrariwise, is its call for a ban on cosy corner seats in luxury coaches founded on envy and ill-will towards those who can afford to travel on what are regarded as luxury vehicles."
"I think we can be clear in our own consciences when declining to answer both questions in the affirmative."
"I therefore propose that the tourist industry be allowed the cosy corner seats in its luxury buses, which we made possible only a few years ago by enacting the directive on the use of 15-metre buses."
"We should, however, call upon the industry to develop appropriate restraint systems for side-facing seats of this kind as well."
"We must aim to provide an equal degree of protection for people wherever they are seated in a vehicle, that is, whether in side-facing seats or in those facing the direction of travel."
"European policy should be not so much to prohibit as to promote and to support."
"That would enhance us as an economic base in terms of the Lisbon targets, whereas the prevention of development would not."
"Mr President, on behalf of the PSE Group I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Koch, for what is truly an excellent report, closing this big loophole in seatbelt legislation."
"I would also like to take this opportunity, on behalf of the PSE Group, in particular to thank Commissioner Liikanen for bringing forward this proposal."
"There is no difference between us on the core of the proposal, but merely on this issue of side-facing seats."
"In the short time available I wish to focus on that issue alone."
"That does not mean to say that I do not applaud the rapporteur for his efforts on the bulk of the proposal."
"However, the issue is an important one."
"If we prohibit seats without seatbelts that face forward, why then - if the rapporteur has his way - are we not doing the same thing for side-facing seats?"
"Far be it from me to defend the Commissioner - I am sure he will respond to these points."
"However, we cannot support the committee amendments."
"There is no sound logical reason why side-facing seats are safe."
"Surely the laws of gravity apply to people facing sideways, just as they do to people facing forwards."
"Indeed all the research from the Commission suggests that these seats are simply not safe and that no safe technology exists to secure the occupants of side-facing seats."
"To use the comparison of city buses is just not credible."
"City buses, in the main, travel at low speeds in towns and cities."
"We are talking about coaches, perhaps travelling at 90 kilometres per hour on motorways."
"The big question for our Group, for me - and, I am sure, the big question for Parliament, when we vote - is how we can demand that our citizens wear seatbelts if we send confusing signals."
"If the bulk of people have to wear a seatbelt in a coach but those at the back, in a so-called cosy corner, do not have to wear one, it simply does not make sense."
"Let us not forget that one of the principal causes of death and serious injury on the roads in the European Union is still, sadly, people not wearing a seatbelt."
"Parliament has to send out a very clear, simple message when we vote tomorrow, and say that people travelling in one of these vehicles must wear a seatbelt."
"Given that there is no technology for side-facing seats, then we must say to industry that these particular seats must be phased out."
"To be pragmatic and practical, if industry can come up with a safety-belt for side-facing seats then the PSE Group will of course, think again, as, I am sure, will the Commissioner."
"There is not much dividing us."
"But it is important that we send out a clear, simple message tomorrow that if you travel in these vehicles in the future, you must wear a seatbelt and that there will be no derogations, no room for doubt."
"It must be clear and simple."
"I am sure that is what we will say tomorrow."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon."
"(1)"
"The Commission can accept the following amendments: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 (except paragraph 5a), 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 33, 38, 39, 40, 41 and 42."
"The Commission rejects the following amendments: 4, 5, 20 (paragraph 5a only), 21, 31, 32, 34, 35, 36, 37, 43, 44 and 45."
"(1)"
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"- The European Council report and Commission statement European Council (Brussels, 12 and 13 December 2003);"
"- Council and Commission statements Meeting of Heads of State or Government on the IGC (Brussels, 12 and 13 December 2003);"
"- Statement by the President-in-Office of the Council The work of the Italian presidency."
"I should like at the outset to profit from this moment to share with you a brief report of the summit meeting and the IGC from the perspective of those questions which I raised on behalf of this House so that before we go into our debate proper you will have been informed of what we had to say."
"I am bound to say that, as regards the work that was done at the European Council meeting, a very high volume of business was transacted in a short period of time and considerable progress made in quite a number of areas."
"Indeed it is worth placing on the record that we in this House enjoyed in those terms a very positive engagement with the Italian presidency in working across our committees on many different areas."
"In particular and following the recent resolutions of the House I welcomed the conclusions on EU-transatlantic relations, but I made the point that it is precisely in a phase of deepening transatlantic relations, which is the objective of the conclusions, that our candid friendship with the United States should not exclude our candid concerns about Guantanamo Bay."
"I spoke on behalf of the House in those terms."
"With regard to the Kyoto Protocol, I recalled that as we were meeting there was a UN-sponsored meeting in Milan."
"It seems that Russia still has an open mind on whether to sign the Kyoto Protocol."
"We Europeans have a strong interest that the Russians should do so and therefore make it effective."
"I believe the Commission and the incoming presidency should take clear initiatives to ensure that in the months to come we who believe in Kyoto should seek to bring it to a satisfactory definition by deepening our contact with Russia, and I made that point also this weekend."
"As regards the Intergovernmental Conference we will have a debate today on the wider questions and I look forward to being guided by that debate and our resolution."
"When I spoke at the Intergovernmental Conference, I raised two specific concerns of a parliamentary nature."
"The first concern was on the financing of the European Union and its budget procedure."
"I pointed out in the clearest terms that the European Parliament supports the balanced outcome of the Convention as regards the different institutions and their roles in budget-making."
"I explained what that Convention procedure was and what its balances amounted to."
"I explained that the European Parliament wholly rejects the interference by Ecofin as an undue, unwarranted and unacceptable interference in the budget process."
"I explained that not only was Ecofin an attack on the conclusions of the Convention, but even on the budgetary treaty of 1975, and that in institutional terms it in fact represented a step backwards."
"I pointed out that through that period Parliament has exercised considerable restraint on spending."
"The House will be interested to know, because it is the product of our collective work, that we have 15 years of budget-making experience since we signed an interinstitutional agreement with the Council on financial perspectives in 1988."
"In that period, by discretionary additions in the aggregate, the Council added EUR 33 billion of discretionary expenditure."
"Parliament, under its discretion, added EUR 21 million."
"If there is a relative tendency to stretch the budget, it is found more in the Council than Parliament, and Parliament should not be the object of the presumption that if it gets responsibility it fails to act responsibly."
"The final point I made for Parliament regarding the Intergovernmental Conference and Parliament was to invite the IGC to ensure that Parliament should not be used as some kind of last-minute bargaining chip, where the numbers of Members in this House would increase regardless of our ability to be effective."
"We are not some kind of globalised rubber-stamp congress of the peoples of Europe; we have serious budgetary and legislative functions."
"There must be an upper limit on our size, and we must respect the principles enshrined in the work of the Convention to cope with who gets how many seats."
"These were the points I made on behalf of this House to the IGC."
"Finally, with regard to the outcome of last weekend, there is no doubt that the failure to agree in the IGC represents a setback."
"However, that setback is not necessarily a calamity."
"If agreement was not possible last weekend, it does not make agreement less necessary."
"It shows the immensity of the challenge we have undertaken together."
"Last weekend, although the key players arrived, a collective spirit and a will to settle were absent."
"That absence is something for which we paid a price, and that absence of a spirit of compromise on the part of all key players needs to be explored."
"Together with the leaders of the Groups, I would like to carry from this House a clear set of messages from today's debate to the incoming Irish presidency."
"I look forward to this debate and to what messages you, as the European Parliament, believe we should give to the incoming presidency regarding the next phase of play."
"I should like to welcome this morning the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Berlusconi, and to say to him and his colleagues, Mr Frattini, Mr Antonione and Mr Buttiglione, how welcome they are."
"I should like to say again in Mr Berlusconi's presence that in the course of the ordinary work of the presidency, work with our committees, legislative work and contact with Parliament, we have enjoyed very good, positive relations with the Italian presidency."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I stand before you today to illustrate the work of the Italian Government, which has presided over both the Union Council and the Intergovernmental Conference in this six-month term of office, which is about to come to an end."
"With regard to the Conference, Italy has been committed from the very beginning to achieving consensus on a high-profile document, without any watered-down compromises; a document that would allow the Union of the future to function and to stand as a leader on the world stage."
"Added to this commitment was the hope that the enlarged Union would be able to establish a genuine Constitution on the basis of the draft drawn up by the Convention, within the timeframes agreed at Thessaloniki and thus in time for the European Parliament elections next June."
"As we know, the hope we all shared that the constitutional negotiations would be concluded within the 60 days we had available from the opening of the Conference in Rome has not been fulfilled."
"This fact must be accepted calmly, without drama or exchanges of recriminations but, at the same time, with a clear vision of how we are to proceed now."
"Our commitment to keep clear of compromises and agreements, which are difficult for our citizens to understand, has been fully respected."
"This was an obligation on which our Presidency focused from the very beginning of this complex negotiation process, for we felt that the contributions of the national parliaments and the Union’s institutions, first and foremost – as you said, Mr President - your own, and the work of the Chairman, Mr Giscard d’Estaing, and the Vice-Chairmen, Mr Amato and Mr Dehaene, combine them into a document, which should form the basis on which to build a unanimous agreement, without further delays on the key points of the draft approved last July."
"At the formal opening of the Intergovernmental Conference, the Presidency’s intention was to reaffirm these concepts by means of the Declaration of Rome adopted by the Heads of State or Government of Member States, of acceding countries and candidates to the European Union, President Cox and President Prodi."
"We have remained faithful to this approach throughout the negotiations, reconciling the desire to preserve the Convention’s draft to the greatest extent possible with the obligation to give due consideration to the legitimate needs of all the Member States with regard to their priority issues."
"Our working method has been visible and transparent."
"We have fully involved the European Parliament representatives in the work of the IGC, going beyond what was done in previous Intergovernmental Conferences, and we have ensured that all the documents presented during the negotiations were made fully public and available for consultation."
"Thanks to this impressive, patient, meticulous work – for which I would like publicly to thank all those involved, in particular the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Frattini, who is sitting here on my right we have been able to resolve almost all the questions raised by the IGC participants without much diminishing the overall level of ambition of the Convention’s draft."
"During the initial exchanges of the Conference, we reviewed over 80 controversial issues on which the different States were in disagreement, and for each one of them, with the exception of a purely institutional point, adequately mediated solutions were found."
"I would add that, on some aspects in particular that absolutely crucial aspect of defence the IGC has supplemented and improved on the Convention’s draft, succeeding in defining permanent structured cooperation that is fully compatible with the Atlantic framework and respectful of the political needs of certain Member States."
"This fundamental step forward will be made in accordance with the decision-making procedures of the Union using an inclusive approach that will allow some countries to proceed more rapidly on the basis of a specific protocol governing the military capabilities required for participation in this permanent structured cooperation."
"In practice, to start with, this point seemed very problematic."
"We succeeded in reaching agreement, fully in harmony with Nato summits, and, as you know, the three pillars on which the Spring Council can take action and decisions have been taken on board by all."
"The first pillar – the regulation establishing structured cooperation and making it operational – will have to be approved by the European Council; the second pillar will make it possible for each Member State to become part of cooperation at any time; the third pillar stipulates that European defence – necessary to give Europe independent power and dignity, enabling it to sit down at all tables with the other world military powers – must not be seen as in opposition to Nato but must, on the contrary, work hand in hand with Nato, the means having been found to establish a European military planning and command cell in the Nato operational base in Europe."
"The final IGC session has thus had to concentrate its efforts on the major institutional issues which, because of their particularly high political sensitivity, it had not been possible to resolve in the previous phases of the negotiations."
"Thus, the final meeting had to decide on the composition of the European Parliament and the Commission, there were still some points to be clarified regarding the extension of qualified majority voting in the Council, and, most importantly, the method of calculating that vote remained to be defined."
"In the course of the most recent bilateral meetings that the Presidency conducted at a spanking pace through the days and nights of Thursday, Friday and Saturday, a solution to some of these issues appeared possible, although all the Heads of State or Government assembled felt the need to point out that the institutional framework of the future Union should ultimately be evaluated in its entirety by means of a general, all-encompassing agreement."
"Agreement on the composition of the Commission and on the matter of the qualified majority was within arm’s reach."
"As regards the number of Members of Parliament, Mr President, there was practically no debate: the countries with smaller populations asked for one more Member, taking the number from four to five, and all the other countries assented."
"On the other hand, it was not possible to bring positions sufficiently close on the point qualified majority voting despite all our efforts, and, therefore, after consulting all the delegations, we decided to put an end to a debate that was in danger of causing conflict and that, at best, might have resulted in a watered-down compromise of the kind we had excluded from the very beginning."
"True failure would have been precisely a watered-down agreement incapable of ensuring the proper functioning of the Union in the future and its ability to act as a decisive political entity on the world stage."
"As the meetings concluded, all my colleagues expressed great appreciation of the work of the Italian Presidency which, of course, gave my team and myself great pleasure but, most importantly, I can tell you that I perceived the firm desire not to waste the heritage that we have built up in the negotiations of these past months."
"Indeed, we counted 82 points on which agreement has been reached – 82 points which, before that, were under discussion and many of which even seemed impossible to resolve."
"Thus, an of negotiations remains from the Conference which all felt to be important and, I would add, not to be reopened."
"For this reason, all the speeches made at the Council table recommended that the Conference’s next task should be to focus on the points, or rather the point, on which agreement has not yet been reached."
"We should not reopen the chapters of the major work carried out on the other points, in which all the delegations of the Member States were involved."
"It will therefore be possible to resume the constituent process completing the great project launched by the Convention, on the basis of the Conference’s precious of negotiations, which covers almost all the previously controversial points."
"I have to tell you that we were genuinely close to concluding the agreement."
"Late on Friday night, agreement seemed possible, for some of the countries who had initially appeared to have taken up certain specific defensive positions became much more open, but then, the following morning, a step backwards was taken and, by mutual agreement with all the delegation heads, we decided that everyone needed more time."
"Some even asked to be able to consult their national parliaments."
"Thus, rather than starting a debate which would have given the failure to achieve an agreement a higher profile, we decided to close while everyone was feeling positive. All expressed the willingness to resume the debate, to preserve the on which all had agreed and to proceed with the goal of giving Europe a Constitution which would make it able to function properly, to take timely decisions and to act on the world stage as a political giant, not just an economic giant."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would now like to illustrate the most important results of the European Council that has concluded the Italian Presidency’s six-month term of office."
"I do so with particular satisfaction, not only because we addressed important matters, but also because the decisions we have adopted are the result of intense work carried out with all the countries sharing responsibility."
"The tangible results affect the direct interests of the European citizens and reinforce the Union’s overall image."
"These results have been made possible by an excellent relationship of cooperation with the Commission - which I would like to thank - and worked on in a spirit of open, constructive dialogue with Parliament, to which I would like to express my appreciation once again."
"I would like to begin precisely with the economic issues that we addressed in order to boost development, to boost employment, to increase the competitiveness of European industry and to complete all elements of the internal market."
"Firstly, the December European Council formally approved what we have called the ‘European Initiative for Growth’, a measure proposed by the Italian Presidency which was developed by Ecofin and the Commission with a contribution from the EIB."
"This is an initiative with which you are familiar, seeking to promote a substantial programme of investment in the sector of major trans-European infrastructure that includes transport, trans-European energy networks and the telecommunications sector, as well as investment in human capital, in other words in research and development, innovation and technology."
"We set ourselves a two-fold objective: to create, by means of these projects, the conditions for improving the quality of material and immaterial infrastructure networks dedicated to linking up the great European market, especially with a view to enlargement, but also help to boost economic growth overall, and therefore employment, with adequate financial support."
"We are hoping to use both public funding - from the Union budget and, in part, from the individual Member States - and private sector financing, thanks, not least, to the decisive role of guarantor played by the European Investment Bank."
"I would like, in this regard, to stress that this is the first major economic policy manoeuvre at European level decided on in a framework which fully complements the Lisbon Strategy and is also fully compatible with the Stability Pact."
"There is no point in hiding the fact that, as individual States, now that the single currency has been adopted, we have no means of implementing monetary policy or economic policy; we cannot devalue our currency in order to support our products and exports; we cannot use deficit spending policies, even medium-term policies, to observe the Maastricht criteria."
"This right, this power, which the individual States no longer have, must, therefore, be replaced with a higher power."
"Unfortunately, our European Bank, the European Central Bank, has the task of controlling price increases, of controlling inflation, that is; it does not have the task of supporting the economy, unlike, for example, its counterpart in the United States of America, the Federal Reserve."
"Therefore, Europe must muster the will and give itself the ability to take steps to support its economy."
"With regard to a different, more specific matter, although still in connection with strengthening the internal market and boosting growth, we then reached agreement on the adaptation of the trans-European transport networks TENs to the new context of an enlarged Europe."
"In this same framework, the European Council has ratified the agreement on the decision to double the contribution from the Union budget increasing it from 10%, as provided for up till now, to 20% for interventions on cross-border sections."
"This is a highly significant result in terms of the capacity to mobilise private funding for large-scale infrastructure projects."
"The European Council has stressed the importance, in terms of the free movement of goods, of overcoming the difficulties posed by mountain passes and natural barriers, and by traffic congestion along the main communication routes."
"We hope that, on this basis, it will be possible in the near future for the Commission to evaluate and quantify the negative impact of mountain passes and natural barriers on the proper functioning of the single market."
"I would say that, as regards trans-European networks, extremely important work has been carried out, in that we are completely without roads and communications, both rail and road, to provide links with the countries which are to become the new Members of the Union as of 1 May."
"It was absolutely essential to update the plan of trans-European networks, which was laid down some years ago, and this has been done."
"There is something else I would add: we have produced a list, known as the quick start list, which provides for a series of projects."
"I would, however, like to make it clear that this is not a closed list: quite the opposite, it is an open list to which all the projects which are ready for implementation can be added, projects which are ready for presentation to give the go-ahead for contracts and for the necessary funding to be sought."
"Among the matters on the Lisbon agenda, we have focused, in particular, on the issue of employment and competitiveness in order to underline once again the need to pursue structural reforms."
"These reforms have already been launched by a number of Member States, and are measures that, at times, impose short-term sacrifices and costs on society but which constitute the necessary conditions for ensuring reinvigoration of the economy."
"I am talking about labour market and pension reforms."
"With regard to employment, we have assessed and evaluated the report by Mr Wim Kok’s Task Force and its recommendations."
"I have to say, Mr President, that Mr Kok has done a truly outstanding job and his work is the fruit of his experience as both a trade union leader and a head of government."
"We all owe him thanks, for not only has he identified solutions to general problems but his Task Force has gone into the situations in the individual countries and has recommended for each individual country the measures that it feels need to be taken."
"I can say that, where my own country is concerned, the Task Force’s analysis is absolutely spot-on."
"It is to this report that the extraordinary Social Summit was dedicated, which I chaired on the eve of the European Council, a summit of trade associations and trade unions."
"This summit revealed the shared desire of the social partners to proceed with the implementation of the European Employment Strategy within a framework of greater flexibility and commitment to the greater enhancement of human capital."
"With regard to competitiveness, the European Council has noted the progress made over these six months in line or almost in line with the expectations of European enterprises and economic operators."
"I must make something clear regarding this point: I was able to participate in a conference held by UNICE last month in Brussels."
"The symbol of the conference was a giant created by Jonathan Swift, the giant Gulliver, held prisoner by the Lilliputians."
"The image was intended to convey to the political representatives of the individual States and Europe that the European economy is a giant held in the grip of too many traps and snares – as industrialists call the excessive amount of regulations, directives and laws which prevent them competing fully with external economies."
"We must give this fact all due consideration, for the European economy is going through a difficult time, which I fear will become even more difficult given that the economy is gripped in a vice consisting, on the one hand, of the United States economy, which is expanding rapidly with the support of an injection of USD 350 billion decided upon by the Bush administration, an economy sustained, first and foremost, by rates of taxation which are the lowest in the Western world, and, on the other, by the Far East economy, which is in a state of almost total anarchy, with no rules being observed where either workers or the environment are concerned and not even minimal fiscal control."
"European entrepreneurs welcomed the creation of the Competitiveness Council, which will, from now on, have the task of assessing the impact of measures adopted by authorities and European institutions on the competitiveness of our businesses."
"We must all cultivate awareness of this dimension if we do not want our economy to stop being competitive with other economies."
"I would also like to mention the understanding reached recently on the proposal for a directive on takeover bids."
"This is a highly significant political agreement that brings to a close almost 15 years of negotiations."
"Thanks to this agreement, we can now say we have helped to define a key element for the completion of the internal market."
"In this connection, I must thank the Italian minister, Mr Buttiglione, who engineered this agreement."
"Much work remains to be done, however, to give firms operating in Europe those general conditions associated with the legislative framework and the state of the job market that can guarantee their genuine competitiveness on world markets."
"This is an important undertaking to be pursued in the coming months and to be formalised at the spring European Council."
"This brings us to the matter of security."
"With the objective of putting the Community institutions increasingly in touch with the citizens’ real needs and interests, the Italian Presidency has worked on strengthening the security of the Union’s citizens in the knowledge that, even more so than other issues, it is on this matter which is particularly relevant to the daily lives of us all that the effectiveness of the Union’s action will be judged by public opinion."
"One of the central themes of our work has been the development of common strategies in the field of the management of migratory flows."
"In the first place, the concept of ‘common external borders’ has been further reinforced, and, in that sense, the European Council has taken note of the agreement reached on the main constituent elements of a special Community border management agency."
"The decision has been taken to set up the agency and the Commission has committed to making it operational as of 1 January 2005."
"The European Council has also taken note of the adoption, at the Presidency’s proposal, of a special programme of measures on immigration by sea, a tangible sign of the Union’s particular concern over the often tragic phenomenon of the attempts of illegal immigrants to reach our coasts with results, I would point out, that are often genuinely disastrous."
"As regards this point, too, we must inform the European Parliament of the meeting, held in the presence of the Presidency and the Commission, of the five European countries bordering on the Mediterranean and the five countries of the North African coast."
"These countries are traversed by increasing migratory flows which they describe as characteristic of our time, by citizens travelling from Africa to Europe, which they see as heaven on earth."
"These countries, when invited to take part in bilateral agreements by individual European countries, declared themselves willing to participate in cooperation, which would make it possible to control departures from their coasts."
"However, during this ‘five plus five’ meeting, they did call for greater involvement in this measure and, of course, for us to bear the substantial financial costs which they incur for the benefit of Europe."
"In this connection, the Council has invited the Commission to look into the matter and put forward solutions."
"The Presidency has paid due attention both to the issue of the reception and integration of legal immigrants and to the issue of persons in need of international protection."
"We are awaiting, in particular, a Commission study on the relationship between legal and illegal immigration, a study that should also include the matter of the establishment of European entrance quotas."
"We have, nevertheless, taken note of the progress that has been made in the matter of asylum, even though I am afraid that it has not been possible, as we had hoped, to reach agreement on the two directives under examination, relating, respectively, to minimal procedural regulations and to the definition of the status of refugee and beneficiary of subsidiary protection."
"Effective management of migratory flows must, moreover, go hand in hand with fruitful cooperation with third countries of origin and transit."
"To this end, we have gone ahead with the process of fully integrating migration issues into the Union’s external relations."
"We have noted the implementation of a mechanism for the evaluation of third countries in combating illegal immigration."
"This is a mechanism called for by the Thessaloniki Summit, on which we very quickly achieved an interinstitutional agreement with the European Parliament by means of a regulation establishing a new programme of technical and financial assistance to third countries in the field of asylum and immigration."
"This programme will endow a sensitive sector with new financial resources, EUR 250 million for the coming five-year period, as the first step in a more substantial increase in funds for immigration, an increase that should take place with the next Financial Perspective."
"Still on the subject of immigration, but with aspects clearly associated with citizens’ security and combating terrorism, as the European Council we noted the agreement reached on the inclusion of biometric data in visas and residence permits."
"In the near future, this innovation will be extended to the passports of Community citizens as well."
"Significant results have also been obtained with regard to combating drug abuse."
"I would mention, in particular, the political agreement on the framework decision on combating drug trafficking an agreement patiently brokered by the Presidency."
"The European Council has highlighted the importance of interfaith dialogue, a matter to which the Italian Presidency dedicated a special conference in Rome in October as an instrument in the integration of the immigrant communities in Europe and, more generally, as an instrument to aid understanding and cooperation in international relations."
"The issue of relations between the West and Islam, between Christians and Muslims, is a matter which comes up every time we meet with the countries of the Arab League."
"We need to work hard on this, for an Arab minority is still emerging which sees the challenge as to be taken up at all costs."
"There can be nothing worse than going down that road."
"I believe, therefore, that we must make every effort to achieve genuine, ongoing, constant, far-reaching dialogue between the West and the Muslim countries."
"I would also point out that the Heads of State or Government have formally confirmed their firm opposition to every form of extremism and intolerance and their condemnation of terrorism and all other kinds of violence, and their explicit, unambiguous condemnation of all forms of anti-Semitism."
"The European Council has also adopted the European Security Strategy: an excellent document, the work of Mr Solana and his team, which analyses security threats to the Union and how to address them."
"On this basis, we should be able to improve our capacity for intervention in the area of both conflict prevention and crisis management."
"Finally, the European Council has noted the progress achieved in the development of the CFSP."
"Acquiring more capability remains our primary commitment and, to this end, the decision to create a European agency specifically dedicated to fostering the development and acquisition of new military capability has particular importance."
"In this context, the European Council’s decision to accept the proposal presented by the Presidency, on the basis of discussions with various partners, to boost the Union’s planning capacity according to procedures compatible with the role of Nato and the ‘Berlin Plus’ agreements, takes on special significance."
"With this decision, a matter that, up until a few months ago, was the object of far-reaching division among the Members of the European Union has now been brought to a positive conclusion in an institutional framework."
"Lastly, I would like to mention that, at the Brussels Summit, the agreement on the location of 10 European agencies was concluded something that had been left on hold for about two years."
"On the basis of this agreement, which was the result of diplomatic preparatory work in the months preceding the Summit, we will now be able to work with greater peace of mind to provide the operating conditions in the respective locations for agencies which will supplement the work of the Union institutions in a number of major sectors."
"The Italian Presidency is justifiably proud of this major agreement, which deserves to be emphasised all the more as it was achieved under conditions certainly not facilitated by the difficult negotiations over the Constitutional Treaty taking place at the same time."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Brussels European Council has taken place just a few months before the entry into force of the Accession Treaty."
"The enlargement set to take place in 2004 looks increasingly set to be a complete success, thus confirming the wisdom of the decisions taken by the Heads of State or Government at Copenhagen in December 2002."
"We noted that the acceding countries are continuing with the full transposal of the Community and will, I am sure, by the deadline of 1 May 2004, be capable of shouldering the responsibilities deriving from their full membership."
"The Commission’s recent strategy document has confirmed without a doubt that Bulgaria and Romania have made considerable progress towards entry into the Union."
"These two countries are now ready to complete the decisive steps that precede accession."
"The European Council has drawn up a timetable with specific deadlines: 2004 for the conclusion of negotiations: 2005 for the signing of the Accession Treaty and, finally, accession to the Union in January 2007."
"Turkey, too, has completed a substantial part of its institutional reforms and has made further progress towards compliance with the Copenhagen political criteria."
"We have therefore duly recognised these positive developments in the conclusions of the European Council."
"Moreover, we have also given Turkey our recommendations and encouragement to continue in this direction, while also highlighting the areas in which Ankara is being asked to make a particularly intense effort."
"The medium-term goal remains Turkey’s adequate preparation with a view to the decision to be adopted by the European Council one year from now."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Council has also devoted great attention to the major developments which have taken place over these six months in the European Union’s relations with its partners, its neighbours and the rest of the world."
"We have, first and foremost, noted significant progress being made towards achievement of the objectives of the Stabilisation and Association Process for the Balkans and the major work carried out by the Italian Presidency in this field, and we have reiterated the Union’s determination to support the European prospects of the countries of that region, inviting them to intensify their commitment to reforms, especially in the sectors essential for integration into the Union."
"Equal importance was accorded to the results achieved in these six months in the context of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership and, in particular, on the occasion of the Conference of Foreign Ministers held in Naples on 2 and 3 December 2003."
"I would like to point out that, on that occasion, the creation of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly was formalised, we agreed to set up the Foundation for Dialogue between Cultures and Civilisations and we provided for a substantial increase in the EIB’s Euro-Mediterranean Facility, all in the anticipation and hope of a genuine Euro-Mediterranean Bank being set up handling capital from the countries of the African continent too."
"Transatlantic relations remain an irreplaceable cornerstone in the Union’s external relations."
"The European Council has devoted a specific declaration of major political importance to the matter."
"Moreover, it comes at the end of a period that we will remember as one of the most difficult in relations between Europe and the United States."
"Among the declaration’s most important points, I would mention the statement that constant dialogue between the Union and the United States on an equal footing is necessary and fundamental if we are to deal successfully with global challenges."
"Therefore, the Union will have to commit itself to strengthening cooperation with the United States in order to convert that community of values that lie at the root of our historic relationship into a community of actions."
"A common commitment to combating terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction will be central in this regard."
"Lastly, the development of the CFSP and the EU-Nato strategic partnership will increase the overall effectiveness of the transatlantic community."
"We have also stressed the strategic value of our relationship with the Russian Federation and the importance of developing a broad-based partnership with Moscow aimed at facilitating and promoting the increasing integration of Russia with the European institutions."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as outgoing President-in-Office of the Council of the European Union, I would like to leave you with a message of confidence."
"Indeed, I can assure you that all the countries have defended legitimate interests with respectable arguments, and, most importantly, that no one has denied the existence of a prevailing common European interest at all."
"It is normal now that there be a pause in which our countries and public opinions can reflect more deeply on the debate, but we are certain that the negotiations will be resumed on the basis of the Convention’s draft and of the results achieved through the work carried out by our Presidency and all the Member States together."
"Each Member State will have to make its contribution in the coming months to the process of integration, for the European undertaking must remain unified and inclusive, without shortcuts or fragmentation."
"The Constitutional Treaty is a goal that will certainly be reached."
"The upcoming presidencies, with your support and the support of the future European Parliament, will certainly be able to work to this end thanks, not least, to the work already done and the results already achieved."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will end by thanking you for having responded so actively to my invitation to cooperate closely in every phase of the work of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"I have handed over the texts of the agreements already concluded to the Irish Presidency with my very best wishes for successful work in creating that great Europe that we all want."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the six months that are drawing to a close have been full of events and projects."
"You will remember that, at the opening sitting on 2 July 2003, I listed 13 legislative proposals that the Commission hoped would go through by the end of the year."
"I am very happy to note that, thanks to the efforts of the Italian Presidency, agreement has been reached on five important items on that list: I am thinking, in particular, of the amended directive on the traceability of GMOs and the framework agreement with the European Space Agency which will give a great boost to the development of our space policy; the introduction of the Single European Sky and the rules on public procurement are other major achievements of these six months and both will be formally approved early next year; lastly, clear outlines have now emerged on a political agreement on takeover bids, which Parliament will be considering during this part-session."
"The Italian Presidency has carried the flame responsibly and with a great spirit of cooperation, for which the Commission is grateful."
"For this and for the strenuous efforts they have made, I want to express my thanks publicly to the political leaders of the government and the whole team, both those working in the various institutions in Italy and the Permanent Representation in Brussels."
"The last act of these six months was the Summit of Heads of State or Government that ended in Brussels last Saturday."
"The part devoted to the Intergovernmental Conference rightly attracted most of the public's attention, but we must not overlook the other important issues on the table that were successfully resolved."
"Of course, the topic to which I attach most importance is the European Initiative for Growth, which the Council approved unanimously."
"This Initiative is the most visible part of a general plan of measures to stimulate the European economy."
"Indeed, the measures adopted by the Council include measures to enhance our competitiveness and encourage job creation."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the opportunity offered by the current recovery needs to be grasped now so we can reinvigorate the Lisbon agenda, which remains the key strategy for sustainable growth for the continent as a whole."
"Lastly, I welcome the agreement reached in the Council on the seven new European Agencies which will deal with transport safety air, rail and maritime safety - food safety, fisheries, chemicals and disease prevention and control."
"I want to stress the role played by the Commission over the now four years of work which have led to this achievement."
"It is all the more satisfying to reach this outcome because the course has been uphill all the way."
"The task was difficult and called for quiet work behind the scenes, but the Commission never doubted we would succeed in our undertaking. There are two reasons why the agreement on the Agencies is so important."
"Firstly, it provides a more flexible and more efficient model for Community structures, a model that will bring the Union increasingly close to the European citizens."
"Secondly, it is the result of a comprehensive approach that reconciles individual countries' interests, which can hold up or impede progress towards the common interest if they are not aligned."
"I will now move on to the other major topic of the Brussels Summit: I am sad and disappointed at the failure to adopt a Constitution for the European Union."
"Let us cast our minds back two years to the Laeken European Council and the reasons behind its historic conclusions."
"The conclusions were a response to a need felt by all at that time: for the Union to be given a more coherent, better-structured institutional framework."
"At the time, the Member States were agreed on three basic points."
"Firstly, the need to improve the functioning of our institutions, following that famous night at Nice."
"Secondly, the need to rationalise our legislative and institutional structures. Over the decades they have grown so complex that this has diminished the coherence of the Union's policies and procedures."
"Thirdly, the need to involve the European citizens more in European integration."
"The great innovation at Laeken was the Convention, the most ambitious and democratic institutional project in our history."
"We have invested years of work in the undertaking, bringing together under the same roof 105 delegates from democratic bodies across Europe: national parliaments and governments, representatives of the European Parliament and members of the Commission."
"The Convention did a good job. After 18 months, it presented a draft Constitution that we concluded was a good basis for the Intergovernmental Conference to work on."
"Moreover, as we have stated repeatedly, the text needed just a few amendments on certain points, because we were convinced as we still are that it strikes a delicate balance for the whole systemunderpinning the European Union and its work."
"On the major points, the Convention's work was excellent."
"I am thinking of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the method of qualified-majority voting and the distribution of political responsibilities."
"I am also thinking of the increased role of the European Parliament, to which the draft Constitution gives, at last, greater decision-making powers in the area of the Union's budget."
"As regards other issues, in particular the procedure for amending the Constitution, there was just not enough time."
"Lastly, on the issue of the drafting of the Constitution, the principle of one Commissioner per Member State was already there in essence."
"The practical arrangements were not satisfactory, but work carried out after the Intergovernmental Conference sorted this out."
"Like every working basis, the Convention's draft was intended to take us forward, but some Member States have used it to take us backwards."
"That, ladies and gentlemen, is why I am here expressing my sadness and disappointment to you today."
"Last week, the European integration project ground to a halt and we all, all of us, missed a great opportunity."
"The consequences will not be tragic, however, if we can keep resolutely to the course set by the Convention."
"The problems identified in the Laeken declaration still need resolving; the basic text is still that produced by the Convention."
"Although there is no sense in pointing the finger and pinning the blame on any particular national delegation, I must stress that we cannot shape our institutions with the possibility of blocking decisions as the only parameter."
"That is not our role, it is not the role of Parliament or the Commission."
"The deadlock at Brussels means that the Council as a whole failed to reach consensus on a unified proposal."
"Sharing the blame is not enough, however, ladies and gentlemen."
"We will now have to explain to the citizens how best to protect their future. Alone or together?"
"Divided or united?"
"There is only one answer: we just need to open our eyes."
"In line with the Laeken declaration, I still believe the solution cannot lie in a combination of vetoes but in the convergence of interests and proposals."
"The right of veto is not an expression of democratic will and our institutions cannot side step the rules of democracy."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we are currently seeking a common solution and I realise that this is terribly difficult when there are still so many important issues on which agreement has yet to be reached."
"Having said that, however, I am convinced that the right solution will be found with time and patience."
"I therefore hope that future European Councils will come back to the issue of our Constitution with a realistic timetable and also with an overall perspective that we have, perhaps, lost in the course of recent months."
"We all need to display courage and imagination, the qualities that major political decisions demand."
"Only a few days have gone by since the Brussels Summit. It is too early and could even be presumptuous to put forward a full response as yet."
"However, we clearly have a duty to reflect on what has happened and what we need to do in the future."
"Some are thinking about a vanguard of pioneering States paving the way for greater cooperation and serving as the foundations for a stronger and more closely integrated Union open to all."
"Solutions of this kind are part of the tradition of European integration, and if we cast our minds back, we see that such solutions emerge first and foremost when things are at their toughest and most complex."
"Today, we are at one of those moments of crisis, and we therefore need to be courageous, responsible and forward-looking as we start to reflect on the future."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I want to close this brief speech with an appeal from the heart."
"I ask you to bring your political wisdom, your farsightedness and your experience to bear in the service of the first Constitution for a united Europe."
"I know there are many of us in this House who see the European Union as the only viable answer to the challenges of history and politics."
"As the directly elected representatives of our fellow citizens, you are very familiar with their views: thus, you know that they are perfectly aware that Europe is not an abstract ideal or a whim but a historical necessity."
"Just step outside our geographical borders: from a Chinese, Indian or American perspective, the individual countries of our continent grow indistinct and merge; what people see increasingly is Europe as a whole; just cast your mind beyond our own age: in the eyes of history, the integration of the whole continent is the only chance of survival for the individual States."
"Only Europe can give us the strength to maintain and develop our cultures and the regional and local traditions we are so proud of."
"If we do not all stand shoulder to shoulder and defend this Union we have started to build over the last half a century, we will lose our autonomy and our influence in the world."
"The Union will be the loser, but the biggest losers will be the Member States and our citizens, and we will all inevitably end up on the sidelines of history."
"– Mr President, Mr President of the European Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say – speaking on behalf of the Members belonging to the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats – that 13 December 2003 was not a good day for Europe."
"We are disappointed, but, in our disappointment, in the darkness, a light shines, for it was on 13 December 2003 that we got the news that the Charlemagne Prize of the city of Aachen had been awarded to the President of the European Parliament and thus to Parliament itself, which shows that we have allies in the cause of a strong, democratic, and active Europe."
"Mr President, we congratulate you on this distinction."
"That the Intergovernmental Conference has failed must not mean that the Constitution has failed."
"Let me say, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, that there must be no doubt about our desire for a European constitution, that we declare our determination that there should be one, and that we are striving to have one as soon as possible, because without a constitution, Europe has no future in the twenty-first century."
"We want a European constitution, because, in a community of 450 million people – and perhaps eventually even more – it is the only foundation for our peaceful progress through the twenty-first century."
"We need a constitution so that the problems that arise in our society can be resolved on the basis of law."
"We need a European constitution in order to be able to defend our European values in the world."
"Let there be no doubt about our desire for a European constitution founded upon Community law."
"We will stubbornly resist any attempt to take us back to mere intergovernmental cooperation or to the formation on our continent of axes squaring up to each other."
"I would like to thank the Italian Presidency and the President of the European Council for having managed to get agreement – as you said – on 82 points."
"My appeal to all those in positions of leadership is this: let us not again unwrap this package; let us instead focus on the few contentious issues that remain."
"No one European government is in the right, and nor will we get caught up in apportioning blame, for once started on that, we will soon come to recognise that almost all of us bear a large part of the responsibility for Brussels having been inconclusive."
"Rather than holding just one, two or three countries responsible, we now need the good will of all."
"We need a compromise; our willingness to compromise has always been a distinctive characteristic of Europe, for compromise is an expression of our shared goodwill, of our mutual trust, and of our desire to go forward into the future together."
"Let me make it perfectly clear that if a government thinks – and I am putting this in very abstract terms – that it can get out of European solidarity and defend only its own national interests, then such a government will, if that is how it behaves in future, be excluding itself from European solidarity."
"Solidarity is not a one-way street; it is binding upon all, and so it is that the practice of solidarity is in the national interest, because those nations that withdraw from European solidarity will end up having no part to play in Europe."
"Today, we hear people pondering the idea of a ‘core Europe’, but how is that meant to work?"
"A ‘core Europe’ is no solution, for the problems on which the few agree are always different ones."
"One group will agree on monetary issues; another on defence matters, and yet another on questions relating to the environment."
"It is for that reason that a ‘core Europe’ is no solution."
"We must walk together; together we must take the road that leads to Europe’s future."
"I urge everyone to join in seeking out this road."
"People’s questions to me betray their concern; this very morning, a renowned European journalist asked me whether the euro would still be there in ten years’ time."
"Let us defend what we have achieved in Europe rather than jeopardising it."
"Certainly, what we need right now is a moment to pause and to consolidate, but let me tell you that we should now be thinking about Europe’s need for clear foundations in the shape of a constitution."
"We should not already be talking about further enlargements of the European Union that could put the whole concept of European integration even more at risk."
"I would like to conclude by reiterating my gratitude to the Italian Presidency for its goodwill."
"We know how difficult things are in Europe, but Europe will indeed suffer harm if we now lack the will to keep on working on the basis of what the Convention produced."
"Next Thursday and Friday, we will be in Dublin, and I hope that the Irish Presidency will do everything in its power, starting by sounding out the individual governments as to their positions, so that the foreign ministers can then achieve a result that will enable, in due time, a summit of the European Union to be held, at which the European Constitution can be adopted."
"In this responsibility we all share."
"This is not a day for apportioning blame, but a day in which, despite the difficult situation in Europe, to have faith and to keep working on Europe – with patience, but also with the passion that the task demands."
"Our group is determined that this Europe should be a success, and for it to be that, we need a European constitution."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, when your Presidency of the Council began, you said that what concerned you was the football in Tokyo and we should point out that the Milan team reached the penalty stage. You did not even play in the second half."
"We can see the results."
"This is despite the serious and professional work of the Italian Presidency – and I would like to publicly thank Mr Frattini, Mr Antonione for their efforts."
"My group profoundly regrets the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference and the fact that it was not possible to approve a Magna Carta, which may cause us an existential crisis if we do not provide a serious political response."
"We believe that we must recover the Community spirit, which is to take decisions together, combining our interests, acting in solidarity and not trying to block decisions."
"I say this with particular feeling, because my country was always in the vanguard of European integration and now it is in the rearguard."
"I must also say, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that you have said – and I believe this must be recorded in the Minutes – that 95% of the Constitution is not subject to debate, but is part of our ."
"I believe this is an important fact."
"Now, in order to resolve the other 5%, there is something that was demonstrated in Nice and which has now been ratified: that methods involving all-night negotiations, haggling, do not resolve the problem."
"And therefore, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would put a question to you: the Convention was not the outcome of Nice; we achieved it at Laeken."
"The Convention has produced this text."
"Are you in favour of returning to an open and democratic method – the Convention method – or do you think we can resolve the matter by staying up for another night like tonight?"
"I believe we have to be very clear in this approach, and it is also important, therefore, that the Irish Presidency takes up this baton."
"I have been particularly struck by the fact that you have been especially critical of the current situation in the economic field and this is understandable."
"What you have said would justify reconsidering the issue of economic governance."
"You mentioned Gulliver and I am a great admirer of Jonathan Swift, but I do not believe this is the appropriate example."
"We are not like Gulliver, but like Italo Calvino’s [The Cloven Viscount], we have one half, the European Central Bank, but we do not have a figure in charge of the economy."
"Are you prepared to propose an amendment to the Constitution and a reform of the Stability Pact aimed at giving us Europeans strength?"
"I believe this is an important issue to which we have to respond."
"I must also say to you, on behalf of my group and of the European Parliament I believe that we are prepared to continue working to achieve the Constitution."
"We have 95%."
"The important thing now is to complete a Magna Carta, which is absolutely essential for our future and also for enlargement."
"Mr President, Liberals in this House expected rather more from the presidency of a country with a proud European tradition."
"In six short months, the presidency has conspired to undermine the Stability Pact, has shown contempt for the European Union's policy towards Russia and offended Canada."
"The President-in-Office has treated us to a 40-minute catalogue of the achievements of his term of office."
"Yet it is hard to escape the conclusion that this presidency and IGC have been a personal failure for the President of the European Council."
"The 'piece of paper' in Mr Berlusconi's pocket turned out to be a -stained napkin with a few bad jokes scribbled on it."
"The President came to the IGC poorly prepared; he ignored the warnings of this House that holding back compromise proposals would produce this kind of stalemate."
"While the Americans were digging Saddam Hussein out of a hole in Iraq to global acclaim, our leaders were digging themselves into a hole in Brussels."
"A successful summit needed two things: political will on the part of the major countries, and skilful diplomatic leadership."
"It showed neither."
"This IGC was not fated to fail it chose to."
"Five countries walked away from an agreement which everybody needed but none of them wanted enough."
"Yes, a delayed deal is better than a bad one."
"But the problem with postponing a decision by kicking it into the long grass is that you might not find it again."
"Especially with a crowded agenda ahead which includes negotiations on the next financial perspectives, talks on Turkish membership and elections in Spain, Britain and Italy."
"So after a short post-mortem, the IGC must resume and must conclude its work under the Irish presidency."
"The Irish have Mr Ahern, one of Europe's most seasoned negotiators, and Mr Cox, the President of our own House, whose joy at the Charlemagne Prize we share."
"It may be possible to relaunch the European Union."
"Our first Constitution deserves public debate and endorsement, and that requires a Treaty before the European elections in June 2004."
"I would like to underline the extent of the concern felt by Liberal Democrats and Reformers in this House and beyond and our feeling that the actions of the larger Member States are plunging the European Union into a crisis which could endanger the democratic nature of our Union."
"The summit conclusions are also a disappointment to us."
"There is nothing on Guantanamo Bay, despite the explicit demand of this House that our leaders should uphold the rights of the detainees."
"On Russia, the conclusions scandalously make no reference to elections which the OSCE called 'a regression in the democratisation process'."
"The decision to bring the People's Republic of China into the Galileo programme seems to have encouraged talk of the lifting of the European embargo on selling arms to the world's only significant remaining Communist dictatorship."
"On all these issues, the Council behaved as if it is ashamed of our values or ignorant of them altogether."
"At your press conference after the summit, President-in-Office, you said that but for the IGC, your presidency would be remembered as 'the most glorious of recent years'."
"Yet agreement on the five issues mentioned by the President of the Commission represents a meagre return on a presidency in which such high hopes were invested."
"If this was a glorious success, I would be fascinated to know your definition of a failure."
"You set your presidency the target of a Constitution by Christmas."
"By your own standards, you have failed."
"– Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, on 3 September last, in this very place, Mr Giscard d'Estaing presented us with the draft constitution for Europe."
"I was extremely critical of the text at the time, since I and my group saw it as constitutionalising the liberal model by perpetuating the most contentious part of the Maastricht Treaty both in its direction and as regards the institutions."
"The project is now frozen for several months."
"Some might think that gives us some satisfaction, but for my part that is far from being the case."
"First because the course of liberal Europe is not affected by this failure."
"It will continue for one simple reason: it is unfortunately not the subject that divided the 25 governments."
"Everyone, from Mr Berlusconi to the Polish Prime Minister, has been keen to underline that there was consensus on virtually every point of the draft constitution apart from the method of calculating the qualified majority in the Council."
"All the problems so forcefully raised in the growing public debate on the draft constitution, in the recent European Social Forum for example, are therefore still on the table. That is nothing to be pleased about."
"Then we had the distressing spectacle of ambition for power and dreams of power, with no comparison being made of the options for the Union’s policies, objectives and values, seemingly echoing that stupid watchword ‘Nice or death’, a complete denial of the politics and spirit of responsibility."
"This Europe long in tooth and short on ideas, alien to people’s expectations and insensitive to the frustrations welling up everywhere, is a princely gift to populists and demagogues of all kinds."
"This failed prelude to an enlarged Europe is likely to have a devastating effect on all who have real ambition for Europe – an alternative ambition to the present treaties, but a strong ambition nevertheless."
"Finally, this impasse is giving new life to the outdated old ideas of the hard core."
"Only too glad of an opportunity to pull out, the richest countries are threatening to cut back the funds intended for the least developed."
"By doing away with the notion of solidarity between Member States, such a development would be the death-knell of any community, allowing the dream of the most liberal to come true, the free trade area."
"We cannot accept such a view."
"It is a caricature of the idea of closer cooperation between nations, some of whom want to see a more advanced social model and some a more independent and more offensive international policy prevail without waiting for an impossible unanimity of 25."
"But for that to happen there would have to be a real European political project within the European Council."
"But the truth is, there is no project, except perhaps for that very ambiguous one of European defence, made worse by the Union’s new strategic doctrine that makes your blood run cold simply by reading it."
"There is the rub."
"The way this European Council has gone and the results it has produced ought to convince the doubters on one point: because of the major changes it will require to the present institutions and directions, a project that our fellow citizens can identify with and feel part of will not, will never come about spontaneously from a conclave of Heads of State and Government."
"A convention will not be enough either."
"The challenge must now be taken up by the citizens who aspire to it and the parties with which they identify."
"In my view, it is this level of ambition, more than ever, that will have to shape the next stage in European policy."
"Mr President, by way of assessment of your work at the helm of the European Council, all we need to do now is say that the Union is not stronger or more united than it was six months ago, that your government’s contribution to increasing the cohesion lost during the battle over Iraq has been insignificant and that your statements on Chechnya, your failure to produce an initiative on the death penalty and the support and lack of criticism you showed for the Bush and Sharon governments have reduced the already poor credibility of the Union as a player on the world stage."
"Or else we could point out the disinterested involvement of Mr Tremonti in Ecofin’s attempt to undo the agreements reached by the Convention on the budget, or, again, the outrageous behaviour of Mr Lunardi, who is pushing for European funding for trans-European networks which his company would then like to build."
"Your Presidency, however, will be remembered, above all, by Europeans for the failure to achieve agreement on the Convention’s text."
"This will be the case even if you, with the help of your television networks, succeed in convincing the Italians that success was achieved because you have managed to win the seat of the Food Safety Agency for Parma and to produce an agreement – as yet still on the drawing board – for the funding of a couple of tunnels and a useless bridge."
"Of course, it really would not be fair of me to say that the reason for this failure lies entirely in lax preparation or in the original approach of bilateral meetings which provided for no plenary discussion and prevented everyone from forming a clear idea of what the mysterious compromise proposals were or of who was for or against what."
"However, we do believe that the agreement that was taking shape would – we are sure of it – have created more problems than the current crisis."
"I will tell you something else: I do not believe that we can genuinely say today that there is a consolidated agreement on the majority of the 82 points put forward by the Italian Presidency, points which, moreover, are largely unacceptable because they represent a step backwards, and not just with regard to the Convention but with regard to Nice too."
"Whether you like it or not, the only text on the table is that adopted by the Convention."
"Your weak Presidency and the Spanish and Polish Governments are not the only ones to blame for this crisis."
"There are many others, starting with those who rejected double majority voting at Nice and are now setting themselves up as unlikely European political heroes."
"Therefore, we accept the challenge posed by the crisis: it might lead to a better Constitution for the future."
"However, we need to take note of the fact that the governments of both old and new Member States of the Union are unable to reach unanimous consensus on a viable Constitution for Europe."
"It is useless: you will not be able to do it on your own!"
"The Irish Presidency will not succeed where Italy has failed."
"In order to succeed in giving Europe a Constitution, you need us, your citizens, your parliaments, if you want to prevent the project for a united, enlarged Europe breaking down soon in disastrous disputes over the Financial Perspective or over national sovereignty."
"The Constitution is not dead; the governments are not the masters of Europe, not least because when they attempt to be they lose their way in domestic wrangles."
"We must resume the initiative without delay and prevent the work carried out by the Convention being filed away in some dusty drawer forever with the excuse that we need time to think or to fulfil our electoral obligations."
"To this end, we need to find allies both in the national parliaments and among those governments which, like us, can see the urgent need to overcome the crisis quickly, restoring confidence in the European project and restoring its credibility and also asserting the need to abolish the right of veto for institutional reforms."
"I regret, Mr Berlusconi, that it is not clear whether or not Italy is one of these."
"I hope you will tell me that it is."
"Beware, however: we are not yet resigned to the idea that, with the European Union only just reunited, it should already be divided or that the time has come to set its rate of progress on the basis of the interests of a small élite: we do not believe there should be two different groups or factions."
"Our aim must continue to be the reinvigoration of the project for a democratic, effective Europe with which all can identify."
"It may be true that an agreement was not far off in Brussels."
"If that is so, we call upon the Irish Presidency to convene another Convention without delay to ascertain in the clear light of day whether it is still possible to reach agreement."
"Otherwise, the plan must be to relaunch the constituent process after the European elections."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the Italian Presidency for its work in a difficult situation, both because of international developments and because of the tragedies that have struck several of the European peoples, Italy, in particular."
"The memory of those who gave their lives for freedom and democracy in Iraq will be indelibly engraved in our minds as we pursue our political undertaking."
"The Italian Presidency said that keeping the peace – and, therefore, combating terrorism and disruptive forces across the board – and pursuing stable prosperity for our people and for all the countries whose people live in difficult, tragic conditions because of hunger, poverty or lack of development, or, as is all too often the case, because of oppressive political systems, are the primary tasks performed by society."
"The Presidency stressed that, if we are to achieve a stronger, freer, more independent and inclusive Europe, institutional changes are necessary and they cannot be brought about by watered-down compromises."
"The European citizens need clarity and efficiency and the Council has a duty to define unambiguously the political, economic and cultural role that Europe must play on the world stage."
"Terrorism cannot be overcome by conventional methods alone, without the involvement of the citizens."
"The globalisation of the markets calls for new financial and economic rules to replace the obsolete rules of the past century."
"There must be renewed cooperation with regard to the geographical areas closest to us, in particular, and fresh consideration must be given in this context to the countries whose languages and cultures are similar to ours."
"Mr President, I would like express the regret of the and my own regret as a member of the Convention at the failure to reach agreement on a new Treaty."
"The Union cannot have a two-tier system of first- and second-class States, or several individual or alliancesof dominating States, displaying two faces to the world."
"A new Treaty is necessary and each State must lay aside the mental reservations which are a barrier to political Union."
"The undertakings given to the citizens must be delivered on and we are sure that Italy will give its full support to the Irish Presidency so that what was not achieved yesterday can be as soon as possible."
"The citizens of the 25 Member States of the Union want neither a federal superstate nor a Europe consisting merely of a free trade area."
"Split over Iraq, failure in Cancun, snubbed in Sweden, the stability pact wrecked, and now the constitutional fiasco, 2003 will indeed have been the for Europe!"
"There will therefore be no European constitution, but not to worry, Europe is so far removed from the hearts and minds of the Europeans that no citizen will miss it or, doubtless, even notice."
"I do not really know to whom we owe this ‘miracle’, Mr Berlusconi; whether it is the Spanish, the Poles or, as many are saying here, the French, I think they have acted wisely since it is very obvious that the Europe of the 25 has not grown up and it was premature, to say the least, to give it that mark of political and democratic maturity that is a constitution."
"Let us have mercy therefore on Turkey, Mr Berlusconi, and let us think again for a century or two, maybe even longer."
"For my part, I think we owe the Brussels fiasco as much as to the corporatism of the European institutions, and first and foremost the Brussels Commission, as to some Member States defending their legitimate interests."
"That is what happens, Mr Prodi, when Penelope goes against the teaching of the Odyssey and unravels instead of knitting."
"But let us calm ourselves and be consoled: we might not have a European constitution but we have won over the !"
"Like the Constitution then, it may become immortalised!"
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, this Europe has acted in the same way as it did at the time of the Balkan crisis and the Milosevic atrocities; in the same way as the Europe which, even today, has no position on the Middle East other than the short-sighted positions of each of its parties and factions."
"We failed, you failed to produce a Constitution, a Constitutional Treaty, because we are now experiencing a period of comeback from bureaucracy and false nationalistic hopes, which now carry the weight of new ideologies in this House."
"This is not the United States of Europe, the Europe of Altiero Spinelli, the Europe of Ernesto Rossi – the Europe conceived in prisons by unyielding federalists, liberals and democrats."
"This is not the Europe of Robert Schuman or Konrad Adenauer either."
"Mr Barón Crespo’s words on the subject are spot on."
"This is a Europe that disappointed Mr Pasqua somewhat, although he finds in Mr Chirac, today, the old, essentially anti-Europeanist, antifederalist position."
"You have paid, Prime Minister, for your pretence at arbitration. You treated the minor economic – but so very understandable – egotistical concerns of Spain and Poland equally, but then gave in to the constant, arrogant, nationalistic blackmail from France, which is used to being the only country to gain anything from Europe."
"It was time for France to start paying too, now, as we have all paid."
"Well, Prime Minister of Italy, you have certainly failed to remember, you have not put enough faith in those who, more in prison than on luxurious conferences, laid down for us the path set by Parliament in the period 1982-1984."
"We need to go back to that time, to the Europe of our Parliament, whose primary task must be to break free from its shackles."
"It is a symbol: we do not even have the power to decide where we should meet, when or how."
"We are forced to meet in Strasbourg."
"First and foremost, we must show an example to the Europeans."
"As Members of Parliament, we must decide on the location of our Chamber, in which we will debate the matters which concern us."
"Mr President, firstly, has the IGC been a failure?"
"Surely it is just a reflection of current opinion at government level about the structure and implementation of a new EU Constitution."
"The lack of unanimity reflects divisions that are real within Member States, divisions which are too readily dismissed and which perhaps have been too readily dismissed in this particular debate."
"To me the question is where we go from here."
"Is it an issue on which we have a realistic prospect of seeing progress during the course of the Irish presidency?"
"Sweden said at the end of the IGC that it is a matter that could probably not come back before the Council until 2005, and others have talked about it not coming back for at least two years."
"I say to the President-in-Office that he should dismiss much of what he has heard in the more recent speeches, not least from Mr Watson, the leader of the Liberal Group."
"Mr Watson was up to his sanctimonious best during the course of what I regarded as a number of cheap shots against the President-in-Office of the Council."
"The President-in-Office might like to know that when he was endeavouring to reach agreement in the IGC on Friday, Mr Watson had his name on the front page of the Murdoch press arguing in the United Kingdom for a referendum on the outcome of these constitutional talks."
"That was just a day after all his members had voted against a referendum here in this House."
"That inconsistency is something that we have come to recognise from Mr Watson."
"It is worth reflecting that the President of the Party of European Socialists, Mr Robin Cook, the former Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom, has recognised what he believes the route forward should be."
"He said that perhaps we in Europe need to move away from this introspective constitutional debate, as it has taken up too much time and energy; and that what we need to focus on are the issues that matter to our European citizens, such as jobs and growth, the environment, human rights and quality of life."
"He says that we need to get closer to the citizens we were elected to serve."
"These are remarks he made on the BBC broadcasting in the United Kingdom."
"They may not be said when he comes to speak to Mr Barón Crespo's group here."
"However, I welcome the fact that Mr Cook has endorsed the approach I have adopted in almost every debate we have held in relation to this constitutional issue."
"There is much that is contained within the draft Constitution with which I take issue."
"This is not the occasion to revisit that area."
"But all of us should be committed to the prospect of getting back in touch with what matters to our constituents; and I would just remind everyone that we face them in June of next year."
"Mr President, the truth is that while I was listening to the speech by the President-in-Office of the Council I had the impression that the failure of the Intergovernmental Conference was being regarded as a rather unimportant detail within the context of six triumphal months of Presidency."
"That is not the case."
"This Committee on Constitutional Affairs, which met yesterday evening with a great many representatives from national parliaments, has expressed a common, deeply-held feeling of disappointment and concern, together with a common determination to help in every way possible for the constitutional process to be resumed and brought to a proper conclusion."
"We must not play down what has happened; we must not hide behind the comforting argument that the European Community has faced other crises and come through them successfully."
"This time there is likely to be a deep split in the Union, on the eve of the great enlargement."
"This time public opinion in all our countries is likely to suffer a serious crisis of confidence in a united Europe."
"Yesterday evening we talked about how to prevent the road to the constitution from remaining blocked."
"It is a fact that when the process of drafting the constitution or revising the Treaties stopped being a government monopoly and was entrusted to a European body on which representatives of the national and European parliaments also sat – that is to say, the Convention – the work proceeded in a European spirit and an agreement was reached that was based on the common interests of Europe."
"When the process was handed back to the governments with the Intergovernmental Conference, individual interests and even matters purely of national prestige prevailed in crucial areas."
"What can be done?"
"First of all, the approach that you, Mr Berlusconi, mentioned remains valid."
"The constitution cannot emerge out of a watered-down compromise."
"It would, however, be a good idea to clarify what the Italian Presidency meant by ‘a watered-down compromise’."
"What was the actual compromise that was avoided?"
"A return to Nice, the intangibility of the Treaty of Nice as regards the system for calculating a majority vote?"
"It would be useful if the outgoing Italian Presidency could tell us more clearly instead of praising all those who took part in the IGC."
"Secondly, we must not throw away everything that has been negotiated in recent months."
"Well, we still want to know what solutions have been found for the 82 points and they have to be made public, so that we can see what substance there is to these solutions."
"Further discussion is also required on one issue that has remained unsolved: the procedures for revising the Treaty."
"Lastly, the Irish Presidency has been given an extremely limited mandate."
"Our message – as you, Mr Cox, have mentioned – is that the Irish Presidency should interpret this mandate in a broader and more inclusive manner, extending its consultations so as to make good use of the Convention’s advice and contributions."
"Mr Berlusconi, you have finished your work, but Italy’s responsibilities do not end here: as one of the founding countries, it must be a decisive driving force at this critical moment in ensuring that the process of integration continues."
"Mr President, the truly frustrating thing about the fiasco we saw at the IGC in Brussels was that, Poland aside, a solid agreement was closer to being reached than is frequently appreciated."
"Clever brokerage will still be able to achieve a respectable deal upon the outcome of the work of Mr Giscard d'Estaing and the Convention."
"The fact that the IGC has failed makes the process and the outcome of the Convention more attractive."
"The Irish presidency should certainly press forward quickly to seek to complete the IGC."
"For them to be able to succeed they will need assistance and there is nobody more capable of proffering advice than the Convention itself, which should be recalled in January to consider the full package of presidency proposals that was published on 9 December."
"Prime Minister Berlusconi says that much has been agreed, but precisely what was agreed?"
"That the financial system of the Union should deprive Parliament of the last word on the budget?"
"Was it agreed in the area of the third pillar that the emergency brake clause would suppress qualified majority voting and codecision?"
"Was qualified majority voting agreed for foreign and security policy, as the presidency proposed?"
"In the 'passerelle' clause, will the blocking of a single parliament be able to paralyse it?"
"Parliament has a need and a right to know the answers to these precise questions."
"Mr President, I think it is impossible not to see that we are faced with a setback."
"The problem happens to be knowing what kind of setback it is."
"I believe it is the defeat of the construction that you have chosen."
"Whom do I mean by ‘you’?"
"The Italian Presidency, the Treaty Convention and the IGC."
"You have reduced the conflict that Europe is experiencing to a clash over the political aspect of Europe – whether it should be as much as possible or as little as necessary – in short, a clash between Europhiles and Eurosceptics. By doing so you are obscuring the real conflict and the drama of the choices Europe is being called upon to make."
"You have thus stayed within the same real model and have called this conflict – which is over who should make decisions and how – a model when it is not, distancing yourselves even further from the peoples of Europe."
"The model is, in fact, a social model of a political construction: it is its international aspect."
"You have chosen to constitutionalise the market at a time when neo-liberalism is failing and, although you prefer peace, you have considered war possible, in these terrible times when the world is racked by wars and terrorism."
"The uncritical alignment with the Atlantic framework negates any ambition for an independent Europe."
"You did not choose the ambition of a model but settled for an accommodation and for staying afloat, which in practice has proved to be a framework of shifting sands, which has exalted the power struggle between powers and between countries."
"That is how the construction was blown apart."
"It would be good if you at least did not deny your failure, as the Italian Prime Minister has done."
"The chairman of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party used the word in all its harshness."
"Mr Prodi has, I think, also recognised this, but I believe he is wrong in thinking that a solution will come from setting store by the Convention."
"In fact, I think the answer will be to stop pursuing a mistaken path which, if we continue along it, will lead to the ultimate crisis of Europe."
"We shall have to make a new start, then, but from what point?"
"The first point is one of method: from a different relationship with the peoples, movements and democratic public opinion of Europe."
"The second is one of substance."
"There are three core issues facing us: the economy, social conditions and the international aspect, and these are inescapable."
"There is not just yesterday’s failure; there is also the Maastricht crisis, the paradigm for a Europe of markets."
"Europe, as the President-in-Office has said, is caught between the political process in the United States, where the dollar favours their competitiveness, and the aggressiveness of economies like China’s."
"In this situation, the IGC response is not at all convincing, positioned as it is between a bastard Keynesian view and an attack on the social conditions of the workers."
"Mr President, what really needs attention is the rights of the workers and the peoples."
"If we do not make a new start based on this reality, Europe can have no future."
"– Mr President, Mr Berlusconi, at the opening of the Intergovernmental Conference, you amused your colleagues with a joke about how you might make the people happy."
"The punchline is that someone advises you to throw yourself out of a helicopter."
"We are very glad that you did not do so, but we are not amused by the way you threw out the European Constitution instead."
"There are three kinds of failure: you can lose to your opponents, you can fail to achieve goals that are set too high, and you can be your own downfall."
"The Intergovernmental Conference brought itself down."
"Nobody was against it."
"You had the Convention behind you, with an overwhelming consensus of the larger Member States and the smaller ones, the old ones and the new, of parliaments and governments."
"Only in your own ranks did you have opponents."
"Did you fail because you were aiming too high?"
"No, for, apart from the Convention proposals, there was no controversy; even with your 300 amendments, you went nowhere near as far as what the Convention had proposed, and not even as far as the Treaties of Nice."
"You were the cause of your own failure."
"Having been called upon to take responsibility for Europe, you fought for national egoisms; having been called upon to create a balance between the institutions and a European democracy, you tried to build on your own power advantage, and to waste no time in gaining advantages for the national governments."
"You had the chance to defend the Convention’s consensus – which was the greatest that could have been achieved – but instead you lost it."
"There is, I believe, one hope left to us."
"You, Mr President-in-Office, have tried; the governments have tried – and they have failed."
"After the partial failure of Amsterdam and the total failure of Nice, they have now, finally, failed."
"All that we can now do is to appeal to the governments’ sense of reason in persuading them to accept the Convention draft, Europe’s highest common denominator, after all."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, nothing surprises me any more since I have been sitting in this Assembly."
"At least, that is what I used to think, because this morning I confess I am surprised, but not at the outcome of the Brussels European Council or the failure of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"I have said on a number of occasions, including here, that I never imagined for one second that the Heads of State or Government, who represent the highest democratic authority in the Union, could reasonably agree to the draft European Constitution prepared by the Convention as it stands, without amending it – at least that is what the ukases of the majority of this Parliament wanted."
"No, what surprises me is the behaviour of the federalist majority here present, whose blindness it must be said is beyond understanding. You never question yourselves."
"I have not heard one of you say: ‘Perhaps we were mistaken."
"No. You persist, you sign, as if nothing had happened."
"Better still, like worthy followers of poor Lysenko, you look for someone to take the blame for your failure."
"Like all fanatics, you want heads to roll."
"But if you look things calmly in the face, you will see that the cause of this fiasco is not the Italian Presidency, whose excellent work I commend in passing, nor the attitude of some Member States, who have courageously defended their national interests as their peoples demanded, but quite simply our Convention and its incredible draft constitution."
"Noble as it may have been, this project was doomed before it even saw the light of day, because it ran radically counter to European political reality, a reality which, whether you like it or not, continues to be determined by the existence of peoples and nations."
"In rejecting a division of power based on the federal model, Spain and Poland have rendered Europe a great service by finally saying out loud what many others have been quietly thinking for months, namely that the old Europe of Jean Monnet inherited from the division agreed in Yalta is dead and gone."
"Do not persist in trying to resurrect a federalism that is a thing of the past."
"Unlike the chairman of the Convention, the draft constitution is not immortal, so let it rest in peace."
"Let us rather take the opportunity that is given to us of laying the foundations of a new Europe, one which has rediscovered its natural borders."
"Let us build a political Europe which, while never denying its history and taking into account the constraints of modernity, tends towards an ideal of freedom and not of uniformity."
"Mr President, I am pleased that we are now being given a little more time in which to discuss the Constitution."
"Negotiations are complete regarding 99% of it."
"Only one very important aspect is missing: the definition of qualified majority."
"Then there is the encounter with the electorate."
"Why not use the time to prepare referendums in all the countries?"
"Parallel with the summit, the European Referendum Campaign met in Brussels with 100 participants from many different organisations."
"Both Mr Leinen and I were among the speakers."
"On behalf of SOS Democracy and the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities, I should like to undertake to contribute to some solid information work on the draft Constitution."
"Let federalists and Euro realists present our different visions for Europe, together with accessible editions of the Constitution wording."
"Let us together demand referendums in all the EU countries under a common motto: EU Constitution?"
"Ask the people."
"In Denmark, we are to be given a referendum, but the June Movement would like to help gather signatures for referendums in all the EU countries."
"When we have a referendum and vote ‘no’ in Denmark, a new referendum is held."
"Instead of giving the Danes and the Irish a second ballot, it would be better to consult the whole of the EU."
"I should therefore like to collect signatures demanding referendums throughout the EU."
"People cannot be given a constitution without permission being asked of them."
"– Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Berlusconi for the six month Presidency of the European Union and especially for that part of his speech which did not focus just on the Convention, the Constitution or the Intergovernmental Conference, which did not reach a successful outcome."
"This does not mean that Europe is dead or finished."
"The Treaties are still fully in force and will remain effective and in operation until they are replaced with a new text."
"In the President-in-Office’s speech, I was pleased to hear the reference to issues closer to the citizens, who, I believe, are not particularly interested in whether voting is by double majority, whether Spain should have 27 rather than 28 votes or other such things."
"I think the citizens are very interested in major public works, not having tailbacks on motorways, being able to travel on fast trains, having special attention paid to employment and – as Mr Berlusconi recalled – taking action against those countries that operate on the free market without complying with the rules on environmental and worker protection."
"Ten years ago in this Parliament I was arguing for exactly the same things, so I was pleased to hear the President-in-Office of the Council calling for them."
"I must also add that this kind of unfair competition is also seen in the pirating of products and brands, and in this context, now that the baton is being passed on to Ireland, we must in my opinion make a great effort to protect our industries, our products, our workers and ultimately our standard of living."
"The institutions are important, as is their reform."
"We must, however, as Mr Berlusconi has done, pay attention to the living conditions of our citizens."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, over the weekend, I sometimes got the impression that we were discussing the rendezvous clauses rather than having a rendezvous with history, and that the reason why we did not come to any conclusion was that we were perhaps not aware of our responsibilities in all the areas."
"My great concern is now that everything is running through our fingers."
"When I contemplate the vast timescale, extending into 2005, I fear it will rob the Convention text of its momentum."
"I believe that it is for this reason that, on two points, we have to make it clear what we do not want. I do not want a ‘core Europe’; instead, we should waste no time in resuming the attempt, with the Convention text, to get more of a constitution for a large-scale Europe with twenty-five Member States."
"Secondly, I do not want a compromise if it does not increase our capacity to act."
"Discussion of that brought the IGC down."
"There can be no compromise if, having got it, there is less transparency – the Legislative Council springs to mind – or less democracy, of which the Budget debate and Parliament’s budgetary rights provide us with examples."
"Despite these criticisms, though, I would like to thank the Italian Presidency of the Council for having kept close to the Convention’s text throughout all these weeks and months and for actually keeping the commitment it made in respect of it."
"This is why the Convention text still stands; it is now for us to breathe new life into it."
"This being so, and in view of Mr Berlusconi’s statement that a number of formerly critical points – apparently 82 of them – had been satisfactorily dealt with in Brussels, it would make sense to hold fast to it if we are to maintain momentum."
"For this reason, I believe, the foreign ministers should meet together as early as January in order to consolidate what has been achieved."
"That, I believe will enable us to maintain momentum, and you, Mr President, could perhaps prompt them to go down this road."
"This could provide a basis on which the Irish Presidency of the Council could put forward proposals for holding a new meeting of Heads of State or Government as soon as possible, although the timetable has to be planned in such a way as to make compromises possible."
"This meeting must be held, and must resolve matters, before 1 May, when enlargement is due to take place, for this project is, logically speaking, intended to enable the European Union to be enlarged."
"I want to give a second reason why this meeting should be held before 1 May, which is that I do not know how, if things remain as they are today, the Heads of Government and we in this House can face the voters on 13 June."
"It is for this reason – so that the voters can have a perspective that keeps them from losing faith in Europe – that it is from this point that the Heads of State or Government must make a new start before 1 May."
"I hope, Mr President, that you will, in the remaining weeks of your presidency, join with your successors in setting a project of this kind in motion."
"– Mr President, the weekend’s summit is a source of danger for Europe, but I want us to be consistent."
"For years, we condemned lowest-common-denominator compromises; this time, the lowest common denominator would have been a ‘Nice II’, which would have destroyed the draft constitution."
"Let me say, therefore, that it is better that the summit should fail than that the draft constitution for Europe should be lost."
"We in Europe’s Parliament will not now allow this draft to disappear back into the archives of history."
"It is still on the table."
"Working to keep it there will be our first priority in the coming months and years, and we will have to keep working to that end even after the next European elections with our new fellow-Members here in the European Parliament."
"Europe is indeed in a crisis situation, and we have to face this crisis calmly."
"We must not allow ourselves to be influenced by soothing words about business as usual."
"We will overcome crises like this one not by standing still but by getting moving."
"Where is this danger that hangs over Europe’s future?"
"It does not lie in the possibility of the constitution arriving a couple of years behind schedule."
"It lies in a new division that is opening up in Europe."
"In a stronger and united Europe, there are, on the one hand, governments that seek to use it as a means of promoting their national interests and, on the other, there are governments that want to defend their interests against it."
"This gulf must not be allowed to get any wider; bridging it is our most important task."
"At the end of the day, the dispute at your summit was about the division of power in Europe, which the world powers have long disregarded."
"Therein lies the danger facing Europe."
"While you are in Brussels, fighting tooth and nail over influence, Europe is in the process of losing all influence in the world."
"Such is the danger of which this summit is the source."
"I will dare to say that it is easy to overcome the differences that have become apparent between the governments, but restoring people’s confidence in Europe’s future will be difficult."
"Yet it is that which will be our task, a task we must accomplish over the coming years and decades, a task in which I wish us all much success."
"– Mr President, the failure of the IGC may well lead to a failure of Europe because, although it is a marvellous historical goal, we all know that enlargement to 25 Member States without majority voting will be a nightmare: a nightmare in which Europe will be divided, paralysed and impotent in a globalised world."
"The final report that Mr Berlusconi gave here for three-quarters of an hour – 82 points ‘with one exception’, which must be the success of the IGC – is a clumsy way of giving us an extra dose of misery."
"Unfortunately, he is once again concerned with distancing himself from a mark of failure rather than pointing out the right road on behalf of a great founding country like Italy."
"Mr Prodi has honestly expressed the extent of the failure and the risks associated with it, and has started to mark out a possible route for the future."
"I say yes, Mr Prodi, to an initiative by pioneer States for a Europe that in no way underrates the importance of this broad Union extending from Portugal to the Baltic States, but you know we have to move towards an effective, democratic integration of the Community based on the results of the Convention."
"Yes, then, to starting out with those who share the results of the Convention – an honourable compromise – on the new European Community path."
"In this way all 25 can be helped to reach the goal."
"This is the objective around which we should and can unite as from tomorrow."
"– Mr President, there is no doubt that the Brussels fiasco has landed the European Union in a grave crisis."
"This is the first failure of an enlarged European Union, even before the accession of new Member States."
"It represents a setback for European integration, but what brought it about?"
"The Brussels summit did not focus on the creation of a democratic, social and peaceful Europe."
"Instead, power and influence were haggled over, and a narrow-minded nationalism again prevailed in yet another demonstration of the fact that Intergovernmental Conferences are completely unsuited to advancing European integration."
"The European idea sustained serious damage at the summit, at which it was the real loser."
"There were winners, though, as well; they include, for example, the USA, for it is the USA that will profit from the summit’s conclusions on European security and defence policy, which tied Europe and NATO together as brothers in arms and put us under American guardianship in security policy matters."
"I am in favour of a European constitution – a modern and progressive one."
"It was with that in mind that I involved myself in the Convention, but it should give politicians like ourselves serious misgivings that – figuratively speaking – nobody took to the streets to demonstrate in favour of the constitution that the Convention produced."
"Only 38% of the public at large have ever heard anything about the Convention and only a fraction of them are familiar with the text."
"Quite apart from that, the real problem is to be found elsewhere, in that the public are not convinced that their fundamental concerns and needs are a priority."
"The degree to which they are right about this is demonstrated, to take one example, by the fact that the IGC as a whole did not even once turn its attention to the inherent contradictions between Part 3 and Part 1 of the draft, and by the manifest fact that two mutually antithetical economic philosophies are to remain in the text of the constitution – the social market economy on the one hand and free competition on the other."
"That is not the way to get people enthusiastic about a European constitution."
"I hope that the time of reflection – the crisis – will be understood as an opportunity."
"I urge you to have an open discussion with the public about the constitutional project, and, above all, take seriously the serious criticisms that civil society makes of the Convention’s draft."
"Mr President, we have just seen a spectacular failure in European integration on the part of the Heads of State or Government, who have not been sufficiently statesmanlike to see and preserve the collective interests of all the citizens."
"I have often had to hear disparaging descriptions in this Parliament of the historic democratic nationalist traditions, such as the Basque nation, when all we want is to safeguard our identity and our culture and are prepared to share our laws and political competences with the other Europeans."
"To this end, not only are we calling for recognition as historic nations, but also a role in the democratic decision-making processes."
"It is not we, but certain irritating State nationalist traditions, which are slowing down Europe, as in the case of Mr Aznar, who only thinks about how to block decisions in order to impose his views on others, rather than thinking about how to build a stronger, more prosperous Europe, united in its diversity."
"I am convinced that, in order to move forward, the Union must cease to be dominated by State governments, that is, by executives, and become a genuine federal union, in which it is the citizens and their representatives, we Members of the European Parliament, who determine the Constitution and other Community laws."
"It is time to leave behind intergovernmentalism and to move towards becoming a full political entity, a supra-State with common laws for all the peoples and nations of the continent or at least for those who wish to build a common future based on dialogue, trust, understanding amongst equals and good for all."
"Mr President, however it may appear, the Brussels Council on the European Constitution failed for three reasons."
"Firstly, the Convention claimed to have reached a consensus, but that was not true."
"The IGC has simply unmasked the lie of the Convention."
"Secondly, Spain and Poland’s opposition over the method of calculating the qualified majority was in fact motivated by profound differences, which were shared by other States although they did not say so openly: the rejection of a unitary Europe run supranationally by a coopted elite."
"Our thanks are due to those countries for defending Europe’s true interests."
"Thirdly and lastly, the intransigence of those who clung to the qualified majority formula proposed by the Convention showed that in reality they did not want it to succeed."
"Perhaps because they thought the Convention’s conclusions were not as good as all that."
"But perhaps especially because, knowing the state of mind of their fellow citizens, they wanted to defer the problem until after the European elections."
"In reality, Mr President, it was the citizens who blocked the European Constitution, even though they were not consulted directly."
"Mr President, practically all the parliamentary groups and – it appears – all the Member States claim to want a new legal framework for the Union in the form of a Constitution."
"Work by many people over many months has resulted in a proposal with which a great majority appear to be in agreement."
"The good work of the Italian Presidency has furthermore allowed us over the weekend to add something very important to the agreement, which is the establishment of a European defence doctrine."
"All of this acquis, the fruit of negotiation – as Mr Berlusconi has said – must be recovered and consolidated as an approved text."
"What then has led to this failure?"
"I believe that the failure stems from a proposed institutional reform which the President of the Convention came up with at the last moment, which was not debated sufficiently, and on which there was certainly no consensus within the Convention."
"Apparently in Brussels six months has not been enough time to complete a compromise."
"This is no great tragedy."
"We must remember that of the five previous Intergovernmental Conferences which negotiated reforms of the Treaties, only one ended within the six-month period in which it had begun."
"The Irish Presidency must simply carry on working where the Italian Presidency has left off."
"What I believe should be ruled out, Mr President, is the following: firstly, the absurd idea of postponing this debate until after the European elections; secondly, the idea that what interests me is Europeanist and that what does not interest me is anti-European; thirdly, the nonsense of dividing Europe even before it has been enlarged; and fourthly, the recriminations which get us nowhere, except for some people, of course – such as the President of the Group of the Party of European Socialists – who believe that the government of their country is solely to blame, whatever it does and whatever happens."
"I believe that the only phrase he knows in Italian is [it is raining – damned government]."
"He indulges in this type of national opposition in the European Parliament and is then surprised that he loses election after election."
"It must be the electorate’s fault, naturally."
"In any event, we now all have responsibility."
"Mr President, we must keep the IGC open, we must contribute to dialogue and the commitment we all aspire to."
"Let us pray that we achieve it before 13 June."
"Mr President, it is clear from the debate here this morning and in yesterday's discussion in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs that Parliament is divided into two camps."
"The two camps are the optimists and the pessimists."
"The pessimists point out that we are in a major crisis, perhaps, I have heard it said, the biggest since the rejection of the EDC Treaty in 1954."
"The optimists say no, because 95% of the draft Constitution has not been challenged and has virtually been agreed though I would like to see the text of the final versions of these articles that have virtually been agreed at the IGC."
"There is just one key subject left to argue about and settle."
"It concerns the voting system within one of the institutions."
"We can still do this."
"After all, on the original timetable nobody had originally thought we would finish before Christmas, so there is nothing to panic about."
"It can all be resolved in due course."
"Which of these two views is right?"
"I tend to be an optimist by nature, but I am a cautious optimist."
"We can salvage this IGC but it will need us all and the Member States in the IGC especially to be focused: focused on the remaining issues that need to be settled and attentive to solving them sooner, rather than later."
"If we take too long, there is a risk of reopening the debate on virtually every article in the draft Constitution."
"That above all must be avoided."
"We must focus on the points that remain."
"We must ask the Irish presidency to tear up its original plans and timetable for its presidency and focus first and foremost on this."
"It is true that business as usual can go on to a degree on the basis of the old Constitution, namely the various treaties that we have, but these treaties are not satisfactory."
"They need updating, they need streamlining."
"They need modernising."
"We need the new Constitution."
"The Irish presidency must not just carry on, business as usual."
"It must focus on getting a result on this as soon as possible."
"– Mr President, the importance of fundamental freedoms, including the freedom of information, was reaffirmed at the recent Brussels European Council."
"In this respect, how can one doubt the contribution made by the President-in-Office of the Council?"
"This is why I turn to you and to the Members here to underline the extremely serious attack on the multiplicity of information posed by the Gasparri law on broadcasting."
"Virtually all public and private broadcasting services in Italy are controlled by the Prime Minister."
"The advertising market is also in practice dominated by the companies he owns."
"It is not an exaggeration to call it a media , which sets a highly dangerous precedent for the Community countries."
"If the problem of the enormous conflict of interests that strikes at the heart of democracy in my country is not addressed and resolved within the Community, the creeping regime that is suffocating Italian society will be consolidated."
"What will elections mean if the Prime Minister controls most of the media?"
"I turn to you, ladies and gentlemen, with bitterness, concern and anxiety, and ask you: what can this Parliament do to protect the freedom of information in Italy?"
"Please help us, please help my country to save the democracy for which the forefathers of our Europe battled."
"Mr President, between some people’s euro-scepticism, some people’s arrogance and the stubbornness of others, the governments of the Member States and their leaders are endangering the adoption of the Constitution that the peoples and the citizens want and need."
"Their fight solely over the right of veto not only caused the Brussels Intergovernmental Conference to fail, which is what happened three years ago at Nice, but also managed to obscure the positive aspects and the shortcomings of the draft Constitution, stifling real debate in European society and in our various States and Nations."
"These factors have obscured the extraordinary value of the existence of the Constitution, the progress made in external policy since the crisis in Iraq, the leading role given to Parliament and consequently to the citizens, and the shortcomings of our policy for social and territorial cohesion, the failure to recognise national political diversity in Europe as well as in the Member States, which I wish to highlight as a Member of the European Parliament for Galicia and as Chairman of the Intergroup on Stateless Nations."
"Mr President, I wish to make it quite clear, since most of us are citizens of the Spanish State - that we are not judging the Constitution on the basis of our State Government’s potential power of veto and that we do not share the stubbornness of the current Prime Minister, José Maria Aznar, who distinguishes himself now and then by his talent for making enemies and by obstructing the solution to all problems."
"There are many more of us who wish political and social union to progress, united in diversity."
"Mr President, please allow me to congratulate you on the award of the Charlemagne Prize, which is also good news for this Parliament; a Parliament which, since 1984, has wanted a Constitution, through the Spinelli Treaty, then through the Herman, Oreja and Colombo projects which called for the establishment of the Convention in 1997 and which, after Nice, opted for the Convention."
"That is why there is a touch of melancholy in the air today."
"What I mean is that, although this contradicts the philosopher, this melancholy is not the result of pointless efforts."
"The Convention’s efforts have not been pointless, because – and I firmly believe this – this Constitution is necessary for the enlarged Europe and there is no alternative."
"Since the European Parliament – as the poet would say – has yet to speak, we must now consider how we are going to act in the future."
"Firstly, we must recover our common sense, and there are a series of things we must not do: we must not talk about dividing Europe, about dividing ourselves, the Europeanists, up; we must not talk about founding countries, about pioneer or vanguard countries, as if to reproach those countries which do not seem up to the job; and, at this time, nor should we send letters to the President of the Commission telling him to reduce the budget to 1% of GDP."
"We must recover our common sense."
"We must consolidate the constitutional ."
"You, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, have said that 82 solution measures have been proposed."
"Tell this House whether this is the case and, if it is, they must be consolidated."
"Let us consolidate them under the Irish Presidency and, before 1 May 2004, let us resolve the outstanding institutional issues and let us go into the elections of 13 June asking the Europeans to vote for this Constitution."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you can hardly be surprised that I am not rising to ask you about what has been achieved as regards the constitution."
"Many Members have done that already."
"I want to refer back to what I said on 2 July, when, in this House, I asked you, as President of the European Council, ‘What do you intend to do to speed up the introduction of the European arrest warrant?’"
"On that occasion, demonstrating a distinct lack of charm, you declined to answer me."
"Then, in September, I asked again what progress had rewarded your efforts, and I can tell the House that I have received an answer."
"The answer to the question as to what you intend doing to speed up the introduction of the European arrest warrant is ‘nothing’."
"On 1 January next year, there will be no European arrest warrant."
"The area of security, freedom and justice is at the heart of European legal policy, a core policy of the European Union – as, indeed, you yourself said in your first statement to this House."
"I take the view that it would have been one of your tasks as President-in-Office of the Council to make this landmark a reality, for the fact is that the failure to introduce the European arrest warrant means that, from 1 January 2004 onwards, the position as regards criminal prosecutions in Europe will be worse than on 31 December 2003."
"The absence of the European arrest warrant will make it more difficult to prosecute criminals from 1 January 2004 onwards."
"Precisely whom this state of affairs is meant to benefit, Mr President-in-Office, I have no idea, but I know full well who is put at a disadvantage by it, namely the citizens of Europe."
"If we want to establish this area of security, freedom and justice, if we want to make Europe more secure, if we want to guarantee more efficient prosecution across frontiers, if we want to combat organised crime more effectively, then this landmark in the area of security, freedom and justice is what we need."
"I very much regret that."
"Back in September, I believed you were on the right track."
"Today, I have to say, with regret, that, on this issue – and let me repeat myself, we are talking here about the accelerated introduction of the arrest warrant, which was necessary in July – you have, lamentably, not only failed to do your homework, but have, in my opinion, proved yourself an outright failure."
"– Mr President, the tendering directive, the single European sky directive, the directive on takeover bids, the agencies, the concrete work on economic growth – one need only recall the decisions made on major public works and the finance mechanisms associated with them – and the careful analysis launched by the Italian Presidency, followed by specific proposals on competitiveness, a subject which lies at the root of the Lisbon process which is only slowly taking shape in the way we want; the specific measures on immigration – which should take place legally with flows regulated by individual countries’ requirements – with particular regard for the border control agency; the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly and the Foundation for Dialogue between Cultures and Civilisations, whose main task will be an assessment of the dialogue between religions in the hope of curbing fundamentalism, since this is terrorism in the making; the action in the Middle East – where we have worked hard towards a dialogue between the two sides, and Italy in particular has also provided a venue – with the launching of an intervention plan with a EUR 5 billion budget for the next five years: these are undeniable achievements that attest to the generosity of the Italian Presidency."
"There is, of course, one discordant note: the mechanism for giving the European Union a new formal constitution has jammed."
"At this moment we must pay particular attention to the sirens of the material constitution."
"We need time to reflect, because what emerged in the heat of the moment is certainly worrying."
"I will not mention those involved but rather the issues: a two-speed Europe, the emphasis on closer cooperation, a Europe made of concentric circles, in which all share the same policies but each group remains open to new associations – this is not the political scenario that the 25-Member Europe needs."
"We must not lose what lay at the heart of the Convention: the general interest of Europe, which gave rise to the decision to abolish national veto rights in most cases and proposals for a transparent and credible voting system."
"In the general interest of Europe we must make a fresh start and work with new formulas that we can create if we so wish."
"Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, the American hyperpower has just scored a double victory."
"After dividing Europe by unleashing the war in Iraq, it has just prevented Europe from giving itself the constitution it needs to operate with 25 members, at the very moment when it was arresting Saddam Hussein."
"Over the last century, the only wall of freedom will have been the Wall of the Atlantic."
"Since then, we have had the Berlin wall and the Jerusalem wall."
"That is not the way to build peace."
"To those who added a brick to the wall of Atlanticism this weekend I want to say that the cement of peace, security and stability that our continent needs will not be built with walls like that."
"Since 1986, the European Union has experienced a divorce between the nature of its project and the institutions able to sustain it."
"Before now, we did not have the right to frame the question in those terms."
"But because enlargement reverses the numerical ratio, it forces us to raise the question of the institutions in such stark terms."
"And the Heads of State or Government are unable to deal with it because then they can only go back home with bad news and they do not have the double legitimacy of the nations and states."
"That double legitimacy existed in the Convention."
"That is why we reached an outcome that ought to have been validated by the Heads of State or Government."
"Now, Europe’s contribution to the world balance will not be consolidated on the blocking power some wanted to introduce this weekend."
"Do those who rejoice at this failure, imagining a hard core resigned to not having a working Europe of 25 and allowing this wall of Atlanticism to be built want to be the agents of division and of new rifts in our continent?"
"Let us note those things where we can make progress, but let us not give to those 82 points."
"Let us look at them one at a time and see what can be done."
"Your Presidency’s conclusion, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, where national egotisms have carried the day, turns its back on the hopes that were born of the Convention."
"The mandate given to the Irish Presidency is not equal to what is at stake."
"Those who still want to provide our continent with the conditions for its stability must take up the flag again."
"– Mr President, it would be wrong to say of the Intergovernmental Conference held in recent weeks that it was a failure."
"On the contrary, under the Italian Presidency we were able to keep the basic ideas of the Convention virtually intact and agree jointly on 22 of the areas involved."
"Consensus was reached on an important issue relating to future security: the development of common European basic defence structures."
"When the IGC realised it should include the Convention’s original wording regarding the relation between the position of the non-aligned countries and security guarantees, Finland, Sweden and Austria were also able to become fully involved in security cooperation."
"A by-product of the summit was the way it also resolved disputes over where to locate EU agencies, wrangles that had long been a source of irritation."
"Italy can therefore go away happy to brag about Parma ham and prosciutto and we Finns on the other hand will monitor the situation from the Chemicals Agency and ensure that they do not use the wrong ingredients when they produce them."
"The argument over how the voting rights of the countries in the Council should be allocated left everything that had already been agreed open."
"As President Chirac himself admitted, the failure of the Nice Summit was the reason for this."
"We cannot be biased and point an accusing finger at the country currently holding the presidency nor even at Poland or Spain."
"It is natural that Germany was unable to accept the Nice decision."
"It is just as natural, however, that it cannot dictate the solution; instead, we are now to have talks aimed at a balance, talks which take a balanced view of the status of small countries, and not just the large ones like Spain and Poland."
"A return to genuine double majority voting – half in respect of the population and half in respect of the countries – must certainly be one aspect of the solution which would also reassure the small countries that they are not going to be dictated to by the large countries in the future."
"It is important, however, that debates on matters that have already been agreed on are not reopened on account of a row that has not been settled."
"If that happened we could really say that the Brussels Summit and the IGC have failed."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, the failure of the draft constitution has obscured the fact that a number of positive decisions were taken at the Brussels summit, on such matters as, for example, the European security strategy."
"How, though, is such a strategy meant to be implemented if both the common political will for it and common institutions – such as a European foreign minister – are absent?"
"Today, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you have declared, and rightly, that we are in a very, very precarious position as regards competition with the United States of America and with Asia, and you also referred to the state of affairs in the Far East, which amounts almost to anarchy."
"You were right to do so; how are we to compete successfully with them without a common will and common institutions, if we do not join together as Europeans in, for example, ensuring that Kyoto is implemented as a whole?"
"Already, I hear many European industrialists saying, ‘We cannot be the only ones to implement Kyoto, or we will lose our competitive edge.’"
"That is only possible provided that a minimum of social and human rights is enforced, along with protection for the environment, provided that this shared constitutional Europe comes into being."
"The capacity of common purpose to accomplish something has been demonstrated by the way in which the Americans have dispensed with steel tariffs."
"If Europe acts together and presents a united front, we too have the opportunity and the capacity to get things done together."
"This leads me to agree wholeheartedly with Mr Poettering that we need a European constitution as a symbol and as an instrument if we are to make this common purpose a reality on the global stage too."
"It is for that reason that I do not see the creation, at this point in time, of a core Europe as a way out."
"I might add that it is generally not the core of a fruit that is interesting, but its pulp, so creating a smaller core Europe is not a way out."
"Instead, Europe must be great, and we must hold it in common."
"If a few are unwilling to join in, then we have to consider how we are to achieve this constitutional Europe, this Europe in which as many as possible can share and which is open to all."
"What this means is that both the Italian and Irish Presidencies of the Council must now carry the message that we have to work in order to bring about a common Europe with a common constitution and with as many Member States as possible."
"We must not allow our vision to fade away, nor must we, under any circumstances, abandon a common Europe with a common constitution!"
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe will never be finished, but we must press on with the project for political union with determination and vision, and on a Community basis."
"If we do not, the public will lose confidence in us."
"If we do not, we will achieve neither integration nor consolidation."
"If we do not, we cannot discharge our responsibilities for our continent on the world stage, and mistakes can be made."
"They can be corrected, and they must be."
"What has happened, though, is not just a matter of mistakes being made; what I find lamentable is the lack of sufficient political will on the part of the Heads of State or Government who took part and hence the lack of European leaders, indeed of European statesmen."
"Will, courage, emotion, enthusiasm – all are wanting, and so, therefore, are credibility and confidence."
"Whenever the future of Europe depends on unanimous approval by the Council rather than on agreement between the Community institutions, crisis is in the air."
"It happened with the sanctions against Austria, it happened with the Iraq crisis, it happened with the Stability and Growth Pact."
"More and more frequently, we blame the Community objectives for problems at national level."
"So let me conclude by saying that the Convention has not failed, the Commission has not stood in the way, Parliament is not putting the brakes on a Europe that is more democratic, more transparent and closer to its citizens."
"We say a forthright ‘no’ to unanimity and ‘yes’ to a dual majority, which is democratically fair, ‘no’ to the apportionment of blame and ‘yes’ to shared responsibility in Europe, ‘no’ to a more nationalised internal policy and ratification process and ‘yes’ to their becoming more European, ‘no’ to the Intergovernmental Conference method and ‘yes’ to the Convention in which governments and parliaments are represented, ‘yes’ to a European Union of peoples and citizens, ‘no’ to an intergovernmental core Europe, ‘yes’ to shouldering our responsibilities within Europe and around the world, ‘no’ to a reduction of Member States’ contributions."
"We say ‘yes’ to the idea of summoning the Convention after Christmas in order to discuss the failure of the Intergovernmental Conference and in order to speedily implement all that came out of the Convention, or was agreed at the Intergovernmental Conference, and is feasible on the basis of current law."
"Mr President, let us send a positive message to the citizens, huge numbers of whom have supported the work of the Convention and the draft Constitution it has drawn up: in 2004 – whether one likes it or not – Europe is going to have a Constitution."
"Otherwise, we would have to face working with a botch-up, like the Treaty of Nice, carrying out enlargement without deepening the Union, under bad conditions, and discussing the financial perspectives in a stifling political atmosphere."
"In view of its content and the way it has been produced, the Convention’s draft Constitution is good for the citizens and today, following the failure of the Brussels Summit, even those who criticised certain specific aspects of it accept it as a good document."
"The Convention was a success and the Intergovernmental Conference is a failure."
"There are certain obvious contributors to the failure of the Brussels Summit and, for me, as a Spaniard, it means a great deal to hear the praise of the Eurosceptics in this House for the President of my country’s government, he of the ‘letter of eight’ and of the last Brussels Summit."
"The process of producing a Constitution must continue and that European Constitution must be created during 2004."
"Of course we do not want a Europe of varying speeds, nor pioneering groups."
"We want a politically united Europe, a Europe which is autonomous in its external actions, a Europe with competencies and resources to resolve the demands of the people and, therefore, we must strongly urge the Irish Presidency to call an Intergovernmental Conference in January in order to consolidate the 95% agreed and to resolve the outstanding issues in a negotiated and appropriate manner."
"Why not also call the Convention, which has legitimacy?"
"And naturally the European Parliament must play its historical role as a driving force, in this case as the driving force for the European Constitution."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I think we should subject everything that happened last weekend to a very sober analysis."
"We may perhaps then come to the conclusion that we have, in recent years, not engaged very seriously with the question of whether the EU can be made both deeper and wider at the same time."
"Let me put that question in very graphic terms. The reason why the Convention was so very successful was that this issue was the cement holding the whole thing together."
"It was because there was a common interest – on the part of the actors, but not on the part of the Member States – and hence it is now important that we give some thought to what really are the common interests of the 25 Member States that will be joined together in this European Union from 1 May onwards."
"That needs to be analysed in a very matter-of-fact way."
"What are the tasks that we have to perform at the European level? What are the tools, what are the procedures, that we need in order to perform them?"
"What kind of financial framework does this Europe need if it is to be able to perform the tasks allotted to it?"
"Only when we have come up with serious answers to these questions will we be in a position to draw the necessary conclusions, and learn the necessary lessons, from what was completed at the weekend, and that means that we also have to ask ourselves whether, at the moment, a deeper EU is perhaps more important than its enlargement over and above the twenty-five – which will mean discussing what a Europe of 25 Member States has in common."
"I think we must start by fulfilling the fourth Copenhagen criterion – that was indeed laid down at Copenhagen."
"We must be able to concentrate on what we have in common."
"What is within the EU must be made capable of sustaining enlargement."
"That is the task we have to tackle in the coming year, and with a great deal of commitment, and then we will be able to draw from it the helpful conclusions that we need."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, our feelings can be summed up in one word: disappointment."
"Not only are we disappointed, however, the overwhelming majority of European citizens, who are in favour of a European Constitution, are also disappointed and perplexed."
"Fortunately, and to the despair of the Eurosceptics, the European Constitution is a popular idea and one that mobilises the people."
"The European project is the finest idea that the twenty-first century has inherited from the violent twentieth. Today, Europe stands at a turning point."
"Enlargement will bring change; we are creating another political entity."
"I am not indulging in political metaphysics here – this is the reality of the situation."
"Enlargement without a Constitution is something that can no longer be contemplated, less still accepted."
"This is something that the recalcitrant Member States must understand."
"Unfortunately there are a few States that attempt to counter the spirit of Europe with the old myths and delusions of grandeur or of national importance and still advocate the political fossil, albeit a recent one, that is the Treaty of Nice."
"Europe must be built, however, through a positive, not negative spirit."
"Some leaders act as if the Union gave them rights but no duties whatsoever."
"We cannot and must not fail in our confrontation with history."
"Europe urgently needs a Constitution and it is within our reach."
"Long live the Constitution!"
"– Mr President, the disappointing outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference is a surprise to no one."
"It was an expected disappointment, perhaps, – but no less disappointing for that – to find that a year’s work by our 105 members of the Convention could be called into question in a few hours for futile considerations of the respective weighting of the different member countries of our Union."
"If there is a lesson we can and must draw from that, it is that we cannot hope for any progress in an intergovernmental context towards the completion of European integration since, as Mr Pasqua rightly said, in that context the Heads of State can do no other than defend their national interests tooth and nail, even at the expense of the general interest."
"I do not share the view of those who imagine that, in the weeks ahead, the Irish Presidency will be able to reverse the trend that has now been set."
"We must therefore prepare ourselves, ladies and gentlemen, to ask the real questions that remain in the course of the forthcoming European election campaign."
"After all, it is an ill wind and it will give the campaign added interest."
"Having said that, President-in-Office of the Council, you raised the general issue of security, which you rightly understand to be a major concern of our fellow citizens in Europe."
"In this connection, while welcoming the good intentions shown, I cannot help remembering the proverb that says that the road to Hell is paved with good intentions."
"I therefore hope that Europe will go beyond mere words and commit itself, in reality and not just virtually, to constructing the instruments necessary for establishing its objectives and implementing its strategy in this field."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, you have heard a great many criticisms which I endorse but which there is no reason for me to repeat."
"I want to dwell on something correct which you said when, speaking of the statute of the European Central Bank, you pointed out that it was inferior to the statute of the Federal Reserve Bank, because it does not contain the objective of supporting economic activity as well as the objective of price stability."
"It is important that you are the first Prime Minister and President of the European Council to point out the shortcomings in the statute of the European Central Bank from such an official tribune and I thank you for that."
"I trust that the Italian Presidency's proposal that the Council should have the facility to amend the statute of the European Central Bank by a qualified majority will be accepted and I hope that the statute of the European Central Bank will soon be amended along the lines you indicated, so that the European Central Bank can finally start to encourage investments, especially public-sector investments, instead of trying to strangle them at every step, as if they were illegitimate children."
"– Mr President, today we should all have liked to welcome the agreement that would have given rise to the first European Constitution, but it would be a serious political mistake – which some have already made – to say that Europe is finished, to persecute those responsible and to give up in the face of the difficulties encountered along the way."
"This is why we must continue to press forward in the spirit of the Convention and on the strength of the considerable results achieved through the Italian Presidency’s hard work, and in the certainty that the final objective can really be achieved."
"It is worth remembering that 95% of what was decided by the Convention was adopted by all those taking part in the IGC."
"It should also be highlighted that the Italian Presidency has remained faithful to the commitments made in this Chamber six months ago, starting with the decision not to put its name to a low-profile compromise that would be an affront to the work of the Convention."
"Another positive aspect has been the relationship with this Parliament, which has at last, for the first time, been truly involved as a major player in the work of the IGC and has been kept constantly informed about the Council’s work."
"The other decisions by the Italian Presidency that Mr Fiori has mentioned should therefore be judged favourably."
"Indeed, the work of these last six months cannot merely be assessed superficially, acrimoniously and in a partisan spirit or, worse still, with a concern just for the internal affairs of the countries of the Union."
"Mr Barón Crespo does not practise what he preaches when he talks of Community spirit, for he only seems concerned about the Spanish elections, and the same applies to Mr Watson, who often worries about Italian matters but loses sight of the interests of Europe."
"Some of the Members from my own country seeking visibility or lost consensus also seem to care little about European matters when they use this House to talk about local issues, and unconvincingly at that."
"A word to Mr Schulz, who has raised the matter of the European arrest warrant for the umpteenth time."
"The Italian Presidency has, as is its duty, asked all the governments what progress had been made with their national legislative measures to adapt their laws to the decision on the European arrest warrant."
"The answer was clear: only three countries out of 15 will have taken the necessary measures by December; four others said they would need three or four months longer; the other eight countries are even further behind."
"Mr Schulz, you cannot really be asking the Italian Presidency or any Presidency to overrule the sovereign voice of the national parliaments – that would be unthinkable."
"In conclusion, I want to make an appeal to get down to work involving all the countries, abandoning the idea that a few should move ahead and leave the rest behind, and looking towards a Europe of values that does not want to give up its Judaeo-Christian roots."
"– Despite Mr Tajani’s conclusions, I must turn to you, Mr President-in-Office, to say that in your statement you tended to minimise the failure of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"This is the second time in just a short while that the intergovernmental method has failed, and this time it had behind it a complete, widely supported draft prepared by the Convention."
"What is even more disconcerting is the lack of prospects that can be inferred from your terse statement handing over to the Irish Presidency."
"In this context, there is a real risk of facing both the European elections and enlargement without a constitutional treaty, but it does not seem to worry you very much."
"If you would like to dwell a little on the prospects in your reply, I should be very grateful."
"The end of a presidency period is also a time for weighing things up."
"In foreign policy, no attempt was made to secure an active political role for the European Union and the United Nations: there was coolness towards the important Middle East peace initiative at Geneva, which you did not even mention; the commitments made here were ignored, such as the acceptance of the arrest warrant and the moratorium on the death penalty."
"We welcome the growth initiative but it will not be enough because only control of the economy, at least in the euro zone, can ensure the recovery and quality of the European economy."
"Lastly, Mr President-in-Office, information."
"You are aware that, during the six months of your presidency, this Parliament decided to enhance the status of media freedom and multiplicity in Europe, particularly in Italy."
"The fact that the President of the Italian Republic sent back to parliament the dreadful, dangerous law on this issue that was presented by your government and voted for by a majority in it confirms these concerns."
"In short, apart from the quite commendable conclusion of certain dossiers mentioned by you and Mr Prodi, how would you describe what the six months of this Italian Presidency have meant?"
"Mr President, I have a somewhat urgent question to put to Mr Prodi before he speaks."
"We have just heard that Mrs de Palacio announced at the Transport, Telecommunications and Energy Council meeting that the Kyoto Protocol is dead."
"I should like to hear from you what the Commission’s position is on this and whether Mrs de Palacio has acted within her mandate."
". Mrs de Palacio was expressing the well-known concerns within the Commission regarding the dangers of the non-adoption of the Kyoto Protocol and the need, therefore, to react to this situation."
"The Commission wants to continue to work with Russia and the other countries that have not ratified it in order to achieve ratification."
"We have not put out any other message, and I can assure you that Mrs de Palacio too is committed to the ratification of Kyoto."
"Naturally, the fact that Russia is hesitating and continually putting forward alternative strategies is a serious cause for concern for us."
"A very brief observation, Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen: I should like to thank you all for the debate we have had, especially because it has been directed more towards the future than towards recriminations for the past, more to solving our current concerns than to blaming one another."
"I should, however, like to make an observation that I think is of vital importance: be careful, ladies and gentlemen, not to throw away in a few minutes all the work done in preparation for the Brussels Intergovernmental Conference, by hastily describing proposals on which there is not yet agreement as an ."
"While it is true that a consensus seems to have emerged on many points, particularly at Naples, for instance on the Council presidencies, research policies and a great many other fundamental issues, this consensus does not actually exist."
"Let us not deceive ourselves: it does not exist."
"I refer above all to the large number of decisions on the return to unanimity, degrading not only the text of the Convention but also the Treaty of Nice; not to mention, ladies and gentlemen, the lesser role envisaged for the European Parliament in approving the budget procedures."
"It is clear that the overall result of the negotiations and bilateral concessions does not mean total acceptance by everybody, not even if you look for agreement on the lowest common denominator."
"It is also clear that nothing is accepted until everything is accepted, and that the conditions for acceptance will depend on our future."
"Let us not, then, throw away any of the great work that has been done, but let us openly acknowledge the problems that exist."
"This is the best way to solve them, and for that reason the Convention text remains our constant point of reference."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this is the last meeting before the fifth Christmas we will have spent together, and the last of this Parliament and this Commission."
"I should like to close by offering all of you and your families my best wishes for peace and happiness, and my thanks for your valuable collaboration."
"I should like to thank the President of the Commission for his best wishes, but as you know, colleagues, we have a few important votes to get through this week, including the budget vote, so do not start the holiday season prematurely!"
". The failure of the Intergovernmental Conference is to be welcomed."
"The inability to reach agreement was caused by the enormous contradictions between the largest European powers and their divergent interests."
"The uncompromising positions of France and Germany were unacceptable to Spain and Poland, who would have lost voting rights Nice."
"It is obvious, however, that they had the more or less open support of other countries."
"Although the interests of neoliberal capitalism unite the right and social democrats in Europe, the interests of individual nations, international alliances and of various economic groups do not match Franco-German interests."
"One example is how the Bush Administration has shared out the contracts amongst its friends, allowing US and European companies to work in Iraq."
"Not everyone gets a fair share of the plunder."
"We knew that we were at a particularly critical time for European integration, because of the increasingly centralised decision-making, the more aggressive form of capitalism, and the increasingly less democratic and dangerously militaristic approach."
"We know that the failure of the Brussels Summit has not solved the problems, but it has not made them any worse."
"This gives new hope for the battle that we must continue to fight in order to achieve a Europe of greater social justice, development, economic and social cohesion and of peace and cooperation with the peoples of the entire world."
". In the wake of the breakdown of IGC negotiations on the proposed draft Constitution of the European Union, I welcome the breathing space which will result."
"I urge the UK Government to make maximum use of this interval to review its position on key areas of concern to Scotland."
"The reference to marine biological resource conservation must be removed from the list of exclusive competences."
"Furthermore, assurances are still required in relation to the protection of Scotland's offshore oil and gas reserves and the need to ensure that control and licensing powers are not conferred upon the EU."
"The example set by many small nations, independently negotiating their own terms and conditions at the IGC, underlines the need for Scotland to regain her independence and therefore the full rights of participation and voting in all international negotiations."
". – The European Summit has ended in complete failure; no Constitutional Treaty has been established."
"This has not come as a total surprise, nor is it a total disaster because for the time being, Europe can continue to function in the same ramshackle way as it has done so far."
"Unfortunately, though, it does illustrate once again that this way of decision-making, involving Heads of Government who have to reach consensus behind closed doors, does not work."
"It is also regrettable that these days, governments have to prove their worth at home by the extent to which they manage to prevent the rest of Europe from doing something."
"To my group, what remains paramount is that the Constitutional Treaty must culminate in one voting Commissioner per Member State, and in the election of the President of the European Commission by the European Parliament."
"This is what we defend in The Hague and in Strasbourg."
"The EU becomes more efficient to the extent that it becomes more democratic, and, in achieving this, it is crucial that there should be codecision across the board for the European Parliament and that the role of national parliaments should be greatly reinforced."
". My congratulations and heartfelt thanks go to Mr Berlusconi, whose six-month presidency of the Council started in such spectacular fashion in this Chamber in July 2003 and led to the fiasco in Brussels at the weekend."
"Perhaps he really has helped to kick into touch this awful Constitution."
"If only."
"The one thing the European Union cannot do is take NO for an answer."
"We first saw this when the Danes vetoed Maastricht."
"No doubt huge pressure will be put on the plucky Poles and others to ensure a signing ceremony on 9 May 2004."
"If this does not succeed, some states will press ahead and a two-speed EU will emerge."
"Some in my country might be happy with life in the slow lane."
"But to me, it just prolongs the agony and keeps us heading in the wrong direction."
"Increasingly, the peoples of Europe are saying 'Let us go in the opposite direction'."
"I should like to record today a moment that, I believe, is significant in the lifetime of this Parliament."
"It relates to the long negotiations we have had since the Seville European Council, between Parliament, the Commission and the Council on the issue of better lawmaking."
"On behalf of Parliament, I should like to thank four colleagues from our House who led this work and who made substantial contributions: Mr Gargani, Mr Swoboda, Mrs Frassoni and Mr Clegg."
"Thanks to the leadership of Mrs de Palacio, Vice-President of the Commission, as well as the Danish, Greek and Italian presidencies, we are now in a position to sign a draft interinstitutional agreement today."
"The challenge of this agreement was to improve the quality of lawmaking in the Union through a greater focus on relevance, transparency, coordination and effective transposition by Member States."
"What we sign today, by way of an is an agreement on greater transparency, which Parliament introduced."
"It means in particular that the Council, in its political dialogue with Parliament and its committees, will engage at all stages of the legislative process in a transparent dialogue with Parliament."
"Secondly, the three institutions will seek collectively to programme our legislative workload."
"Thirdly, the recourse to instruments other than EU legislation, where appropriate – in other words, so-called 'light-touch regulation' – must be subject to parliamentary control and must be under full conditions of transparency."
"This agreement insists that before any proposal is launched, and in a public way, there should be pre-consultation."
"This agreement insists that there must be impact assessment of legislative proposals, including the amendments of this House, in terms of effects on employment, environment and competitiveness."
"The agreement insists on the effective monitoring of the transposition of EU law by Member States and effective enforcement."
"I believe our delegation succeeded in bringing Parliamentary scrutiny and transparency into this process in a real way."
"The agreement is a significant step forward."
"On behalf of Parliament I want to say that we, as an institution, will apply this agreement fully and firmly."
"It is an important step forward which anticipates perhaps some of the areas to be covered in a future constitution."
"I should like now to invite the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Frattini, and the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, to step forward with me for a signing ceremony."
"I also invite our Parliamentary colleagues – Mr Gargani, Mr Swoboda, Mrs Frassoni and Mr Clegg – to join us, along with the Vice-President of the Commission, Mrs de Palacio and – should he like to do so – Mr Berlusconi, for a family photograph."
"(1)"
"– Mr President, the announcement by Mr Cox is very important for Members of the European Parliament in one particular regard."
"Members will have noticed that he mentioned the idea of impact assessments on amendments proposed by Members of this Parliament."
"That is a very good idea, but it will come into operation as of January 2004."
"What we need to know is who is going to do these impact assessments and how the system will work."
"I invite the President to set up a working party which must, I suspect, work over the Christmas period to produce some proposals as to how this system will work."
"Having had this great signing ceremony, it is up to us to make the agreement work."
"I am informed by the services, Mrs Jackson, that the process will come into place gradually."
"There is nothing there at the present time."
"However, your comments will be passed to the President of Parliament so that he is fully aware of the position and wishes of this House."
"The next item is the vote."
"The next item on the agenda is a vote on two questions concerning parliamentary immunity."
"I think it is right that our Assembly should allow the Members in question to address the full Assembly in the same way as they are able to do in committee."
"It seems to me that, in institutions that are rightly very concerned about rights of defence, that would be a natural guarantee and I will shortly be lodging with the competent committee a proposal to amend the rules to that effect."
"Your wish is well within the Rules, Mr Gollnisch."
"I should like to point out, however, that we have had the debate on this matter: we are now dealing with the vote."
"Ladies and gentlemen, please do not object if I speak now, since we have no hesitation is losing five minutes for a photograph to be taken, one where there was no gender mainstreaming, although there was at least one Luxembourger, the usher. You can therefore easily give me two minutes."
"Mr President, since 1993, when the internal market became operational and border controls were abolished, the Customs authorities have ceased to be a source of basic statistical information on the trading of goods between Member States, but such information is still needed, and that is why the system known as Intrastat was set up."
"It could have celebrated its tenth anniversary this year, but the people at Eurostat are at present not in a celebratory mood."
"If, though, the changes over the past few years are to be taken into account, then the 1991 Regulation urgently needs to be adapted; the proposal put before us by the Commission is a good one, and one that we can largely accept."
"Above all else, both its text and its rules have become simpler and more comprehensible."
"The scope has been more clearly delimited, and that is something that we do not always see."
"The Member States have been left more room for manoeuvre where the collection of statistics is concerned."
"Finally, we can welcome the way in which the Commission’s text takes account of the SLIM programme in lessening the burden on firms."
"Despite this, I tabled a handful of amendments, which were adopted unanimously, and I might add that I did this with the agreement of the Italian Presidency of the Council."
"For a start, the threshold at which firms are exempted from providing information is raised by 1%, which will allow thousands of small and medium-sized enterprises to cut costs without the quality of statistics being adversely affected."
"Another amendment is aimed at excluding goods which are imported into a Member State only temporarily but without being altered there."
"Such would, for example, be the case if I were to get married and hire my wedding dress in a neighbouring country, and then take it back there."
"That would not be included in the statistics."
"Thank you very much Mrs Lulling!"
"You always keep the House up to speed. I am sure we are much better informed on this matter now."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this amendment requires clarification. I personally am in favour of its substance, and, like the majority in this House, I also voted in favour of it at first reading stage, but the Council could not be persuaded to accept it."
"We have just voted on a compromise with the Council."
"Amendment No 38 is not part of the compromise package agreed with the Council, but Amendment No 58 is, and replaces it."
"I believe that if we vote in favour of Amendment No 58, we will be making it possible for the directive to be adopted without a conciliation procedure."
"That does not mean that Parliament has changed its mind in this matter; indeed, we made this clear not only at first reading but also, repeatedly, on other occasions."
"In this procedure, though, we should not insist on the amendment."
"Somebody asked me, ‘How, if you have principles, can you compromise on such important issues?’"
"I believe that Europe demands compromises of us in matters of policy in order that we may make progress."
"I do not believe that politics should be left to people who have no principles."
"That is why I ask you to vote against Amendment No 38 and in favour of Amendment No 58."
". – I am taking the floor to thank Parliament, and particularly the rapporteur Mr Lehne and all the committee members, for this important vote which at last gives us a European rule on takeover bids."
"We have been trying to achieve this result for 15 years. At last we have succeeded."
"It is an important step towards unifying the markets and providing greater efficiency."
"It is the outcome of hard work, and I should like to express the Presidency’s satisfaction."
". I am supposed to say the following: I regret the outcome of the vote."
"I have taken note of the position expressed by a majority of Members."
"In accordance with the arrangements between Parliament and the Commission, I will raise the issue in the College of Commissioners in order to consider carefully the Commission's position under these circumstances."
"The Commission will, in due course and in an appropriate way, inform Parliament of the outcome of these considerations."
"Have a nice lunch!"
"Commissioner, I can only assume that means you are not withdrawing the text."
"(1)"
"That concludes the vote."
". As has been stated many times on this matter, it is crucial to undertake a thorough streamlining of Community law, in order to make it more accessible and understandable to the citizens."
"This idea is all the more relevant in the context of the Cohesion Fund, which involves various actors, both institutional and private."
"It is only by simplifying the bureaucracy, which is directly linked to the intelligibility of legislative texts, that the aims of these mechanisms will be effectively served."
"Consequently, the clarity and transparency of Community law also depend on codifying legislation that has been amended many times – legislation that has, in the case in question, been preceded by consolidation in all the official languages of the European Union."
"This proposal for codification therefore warrants my applause and full support."
". Milk is a product of strategic importance to the economy of the Azores, due to the economic activity and jobs that it creates, accounting for 80% of regional gross agricultural product and 25% of national milk production and because it provides income for around 5 000 highly productive milk producers."
"Since the 1999/2000 season, the level of production has reached 500 000 tonnes, and even attained around 523 000 tonnes in the 2002/2003 season, which would have led, if the derogations had not been secured, to producers having to pay supplementary levies for exceeding their quota, causing many to go bankrupt."
"Given the specific characteristics of the Azores, the milk quota for this area needs to be increased, particularly because there are no viable economic alternatives in this outlying region."
"The agreement reached at the Luxembourg Agriculture Council of 26 June 2003 still fails to meet the Azores’ needs."
"The additional quota of 50 000 tonnes from 2005/2006 to 2014/2015 and the derogation from the 23 000-tonne exemption threshold for supplementary levies are not enough."
"The fairest thing to do would be to turn this exemption into a quota and guarantee its permanence."
"The Portuguese Government acknowledged the need to increase the quota by 100 000 tonnes, but deplorably accepted considerably less."
". I voted in favour of this report because I believe that account must be taken of the special circumstances and needs of this beautiful Portuguese island region – the Autonomous Region of the Azores – where the milk sector plays a crucially important role."
"The process of stabilising the milk and dairy products market must be achieved whilst ensuring that Azorean farmers have a reasonable amount of time in which to adapt to the constraints imposed by the regulatory instruments and that their traditions and way of life are respected, in a broad framework of understanding for the specific problems arising from their location in an outlying region."
"Because I am aware of the reality of the situation in the Azores, I believe it is crucial to allocate to this region a supplementary quota and temporarily to extend this derogative system because, in coordination with national and regional authorities, the Union must promote the dissemination and adoption both of viable alternative forms of production and of other ways of keeping farmland profitable without condemning it to abandonment and desertification, for the sake of the much-trumpeted and rarely observed economic and social cohesion."
"Without this effort, the unemployment, loss of character and the (e)migration that result from the potential decline in the milk sector could threaten the Azores, as has already happened, specifically at the time of the ‘orange crisis’, which had a devastating effect on the archipelago in the nineteenth century."
". We voted against the Daul report on the 3% reduction in the tobacco harvest premium in order to fund the Community Tobacco Fund, because this retention will reduce even further the already miserly incomes of the poor tobacco producers, especially in Greece, in order to promote research into how tobacco farmers can diversify into other crops or professions."
"In brief, they are asking tobacco producers to uproot and to pay for the privilege."
"The proposal for the Community Tobacco Fund is in keeping with the imminent reform of the regulation, which aims to shrink tobacco farming until it no longer exists."
"However, any such move would spell ruin for tobacco-producing countries such as Greece, because the areas farmed with tobacco are not suitable for other crops, in that they are mainly located in barren mountain areas and are almost the only form of employment and method of survival available to the people who live there."
"In 2005, when the new reform of the CAP will apply, the sums which the Fund will have collected will be enormous and will be used to deceive and uproot tobacco producers · at their own expense. At the same time, they will support the American tobacco multinationals, which supply 70% of the tobacco consumed in the ΕU."
"The hypocrisy and cynicism of the ΕU have reached their zenith in the name of a senseless anti-tobacco offensive, not a responsible anti-smoking campaign, which we support."
". I welcome the renewal of the Agreement on scientific and technological cooperation between the European Community and the Government of the United States of America, which was adopted by the Council in its decision of 13 October 1998, and which entered into force on 14 October 1998."
"Because I am aware of the common heritage and values that bind us, I have stated the importance of the transatlantic relationship and the need for the Union to maintain and improve its partnership with the USA."
"This agreement, the implementation of which already demonstrates clear mutual benefits in the field of science and technology, is a step closer towards achieving this."
"In the hope that this agreement becomes even more advantageous to both parties, which is a very real possibility, particularly if its existence is given more publicity and if awareness of it is raised, I naturally voted in favour of this report."
". I support this proposal, and the work carried out by the rapporteur, Mr Pirker, and I congratulate the Council, which took account of most of the proposals tabled by the European Parliament at first reading."
"This initiative is intended to turn Directive 92/109 into a regulation, so as to enable the legislation to be simplified, making it easier to apply in a uniform way and at the same time."
"This has become even more relevant with the enlargement of the Union, because otherwise, for every amendment tabled to this Directive or to its annexes, national implementing measures would have to be established in 25 Member States."
"This is, therefore, an attempt to achieve the harmonised monitoring of the trade in drug precursors and to prevent their being diverted into the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs."
"The intention is also to facilitate legitimate trade in precursors within the internal market, used for legal and legitimate purposes, such as the manufacture of medicines."
"Given the growing increase in the production of and trade in synthetic drugs, effective and rigorous monitoring of the manufacture and marketing of these substances must be set up, as they can be diverted to the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances."
"At the same time, there must be close cooperation between the competent authorities and the economic operators in the chemicals industry."
". Given the increased consumption of synthetic drugs, I believe that the measures that have been taken represent a significant step forward for the flexible and effective monitoring of many types of precursors available in the Community area in large quantities, thereby preventing their illicit use."
"The recommended simplification of legislation, which seeks to remedy shortcomings in the current system, could facilitate improvements in monitoring and control, which would mean progress in the fight against drugs."
"Similarly, and given that these substances are not used exclusively in the illicit manufacture of drugs, but also for legal purposes, we must ensure closer cooperation between the industry and the public authorities."
"I voted in favour because I believe that there has been a significant improvement between the first and second readings, which is duly reflected in the unanimous vote that the latter received in the committee."
"We Moderates believe that cultural policy is not best conducted at EU level."
"Culture is a part of our society that operates best without political interference."
"We are therefore voting against this report."
". The ‘Culture 2000’ programme was set up to provide a single funding and programming instrument in the field of cultural cooperation in the European Union, replacing existing sectoral programmes, namely Rafael, Ariane and Kaleidoscope."
"Culture 2000 was given around EUR 167 million and will end on 31 December 2004."
"The new framework programme for Culture is not due to start until the beginning of 2007."
"The Commission plans to extend the current programme to 2005 and 2006 in order to ensure continuity in the actions that have been undertaken, which we believe is a positive step and we consequently voted in favour of this proposal."
"We feel, however, that the sum allocated to this single instrument is clearly insufficient to meet the needs in the field of cultural cooperation."
"The sum proposed for 2005 and 2006, of around EUR 67 million, is particularly low, given that enlargement will have taken place."
"An evaluation of the impact of the current programme is becoming crucial because, as the Commission admits, some changes will have to be made."
"Examples are: greater support for preserving and restoring cultural heritage of European interest that is considered to be cultural heritage by UNESCO; greater participation and support for cultural cooperation initiatives by local associations and institutions, greater support for acquiring cultural equipment by local associations."
". We should support the Commission proposal to extend the Culture 2000 programme, which combines the three previous cultural cooperation programmes, namely, Rafael, Ariane and Kaleidoscope, creating a single funding and planning instrument in the field of cultural cooperation."
"This framework programme seeks to establish a common cultural space, by promoting cultural dialogue and knowledge of the history, creation, and dissemination of culture and the mobility of artists and their works, Europe’s cultural heritage, new forms of cultural expression and the socio-economic role of culture."
"Bearing in mind the consolidation of the European project – something we all wish to see – I would highlight the usefulness of this intercultural dialogue and the need to maintain, promote and disseminate the cultural diversity of the Member States, which constitutes one of the Union’s greatest assets."
"When implementing a policy of cultural cooperation we must, therefore, shun narrow-mindedness, the cultural ‘monologue’ and, above all, historical revisionism in the light of utopian projects."
"I voted in favour of this report."
". The vote on the discharge in respect of the Convention budget provides an opportunity to point out that, despite the praise lavished on it by the federalists, that body was largely responsible for the final deadlock in the Brussels Council on the European Constitution."
"First of all, its membership did not at all reflect European public opinion, since the separatists were hardly represented."
"Gisela Stuart, the British representative who was nevertheless a member of its Praesidium, recently referred to it as a ‘self-selected elite’."
"Its conclusions were not inspired by a consensus at all."
"On the contrary, they were manipulated by the European institutions."
"Countries or individuals that did not agree were marginalised in accordance with Valéry Giscard d'Estaing’s formula that ‘consensus is less that unanimity but more than the majority’."
"In those surroundings, a microclimate developed, a kind of infectious euro-enthusiasm driven by the federalists; it caused many members to lose sight of their national positions and interests and they had their revenge later."
"Finally, to completely rewrite the treaties was over-ambitious and at the last moment it became evident that a good number of problems had not been dealt with properly."
"– The report deals with the procedure for adopting derogations concerning the creation of a common system of value added tax."
"If the European institutions were concerned about the interests of the majority of the public then they would standardise VAT by proposing to abolish it, which would simplify the procedure at the same time."
"Of course, though, the European institutions, like the individual States, chiefly want to exempt private companies and the privileged social classes from the tax burden by making the public, including the poorest people, bear the bulk of it."
"Indirect taxation, in particular VAT, serves to do this."
"It is especially unfair because, since it is not proportional to income, then it hits the poor harder than the rich."
"We obviously voted against the report."
". The apparent aim of this proposal for a directive is to prevent the double taxation of company profits, to be precise, ensuring that profits taxed and paid as dividends by a subsidiary to its parent company are not taxed twice."
"In fact, however, the proposal seeks to resolve the ‘disadvantage’ in taxation between multinational groups and national groups, thereby responding to requests from the ‘business community’."
"The proposal’s base consequently seeks to extend the directive’s scope to cover more types of company and to lower the minimum participation threshold from 25% to 10% for one company to be considered the parent and the other as its subsidiary, with the aim of guaranteeing exemptions, for example, from deduction at source."
"The rapporteur, who would prefer there to be no threshold, suggests one of 5%, which is lower than the one proposed by the Commission."
"In other words, the issue at stake is not so much double taxation, but one of providing the legal means for multinational groups to manage their tax benefits, enabling them to use cross-border exemptions and deductions actually to reduce tax on their profits, thereby increasing the ‘legal’ possibilities of tax evasion, which is not acceptable."
"Portugal is one of three countries where the threshold stands at around 25%, which means that this directive will increase pressure for amending arrangements that apply to national groups."
". The proposal for a directive on high standards of quality and safety in connection with human tissues and cells fills a huge gap in Community legislation to safeguard a high level of quality and safety for tissues and cells intended for transplants or any other uses which need to be accurately defined."
"Similarly, it will result in comparable levels of quality and safety in all the Member States."
"On the basis of the positions of my group, the GUE/NGL, I voted against block Amendments Nos 1, 3 and 4 and Amendment No 38 and I voted in favour of block Amendment No 2 and Amendment No 58."
"The European Parliament should not restrict the operational breadth of the directive for reasons of conservatism but should safeguard high levels of safety and quality."
". The main thrust of the report is to advocate the non-commercialisation of human tissue and human cells, preventing the human body or its parts from becoming a source of financial gain, ensuring that tissue and cells are not collected for the purpose of making a profit."
"This would provide a guarantee that such tissue and cells are donated, that the donation is voluntary and unpaid (as in the case of transplants) and cannot be paid for."
"This means combating trafficking and the huge profits of the health-related industries and groups involved in such tissue and cells."
"We must combat the attitude that life can be turned into a commodity, which means that transparent criteria and rules are needed, without jeopardising scientific research for therapeutic purposes."
"This is why my group supported the compromise solution that was voted for."
". – The lifting of the anonymity of sperm donors is the least controversial point in this proposal."
"The correction of defects and injuries of the human body by means of tissues and cells, on the other hand, remains a sensitive issue."
"There is, quite rightly, strong opposition to the creation of children with a view to having embryos available, by means of abortion, as suppliers of human repair material, and an equally justified aversion to commercial exploitation, whereby people sell material from their body as a means of making money, as has been the case for a long time with blood donors in America."
"I support rules that are intended to prevent human material being obtained by these means, but I do not approve of attempts to make the rules stricter, so that research of stem cells, for example, is banned."
"If it transpires that by means of stem cells, defects and injuries of the human body can be corrected, then it is short-sighted to rule out this alternative in advance."
"The same criteria should apply to organ transplantation, for which a separate arrangement is underway."
"I respect the view that man should not try to improve on God’s creation, but if we follow this line consistently, then some elements of existing health care also become illegal."
". It is impossible to set standards for quality and safety on an issue as sensitive as human tissue and cells, in which the main concern is to ensure a high level of health protection, without laying down some ethical standards at the same time."
"The absolute need for ethical standards should not be questioned, and furthermore, as the rapporteur rightly states in his explanatory statement, many of the amendments containing ethical considerations that have been tabled seek precisely to guarantee a minimum level of health protection."
"Consequently, I do not believe that the legal basis set out in Article 152 of the Treaty is breached by tabling a certain type of amendment, such as the voluntary and unpaid donation of human tissue and cells, or the ban on making the human body or its parts a source of financial gain."
"Unless the common position takes account of these important aspects outlined by the European Parliament at first reading, it will be very hard to accept."
"Nevertheless, as I am aware that this directive is of the utmost importance, I supported the compromise that was achieved, which is also supported by the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, of which I am a Member. Although this is not a perfect text for this issue, it sets a reasonable level of health protection and achieves a balance that is better than nothing."
". I voted for this report and I am glad that a large majority of Parliament did the same."
"Thanks to the compromises negotiated with the Council and Commission, everything is ready for this directive on setting standards of quality and safety for the donation, procurement, testing, processing, preservation, storage and distribution of human tissues and cells to be quickly adopted and implemented."
"This is excellent news for the fight against a number of incurable diseases, which can increasingly be treated by transplanting human cells and tissues, and it gives new hope to many of our fellow citizens."
"There does of course need to be transparent and strict regulations for such therapeutic practices and medical research both in order to minimise the risks and to ensure that ethical principles are followed."
"The result obtained is quite satisfactory in this respect."
"The principle of voluntary and unpaid donation is therefore established."
"The principle that the human body is not to be treated as a commodity is also recognised, avoiding it being regarded merely as a source of financial gain."
"– Mr President, there are too many Members in the Chamber."
"I am not used to giving my explanation of vote with so many members present."
"If you want us to wait until everyone leaves, I am happy to wait."
"Otherwise, I shall begin to give my explanation of vote."
"Mr Fatuzzo, the order of the House requires me to call you now."
"It seems you have a larger audience now than you sometimes might have had in the past!"
"– Mr President. I voted in favour of Mr Lehne’s proposal on takeover bids, but I thought about savers, both pensioners and those who are not pensioners, who, I am sorry to say, have not been protected, in the case of Argentinian debts, from huge losses in their savings and from money invested in Argentinian bonds."
"This has led to the impoverishment of a large number of pensioners, workers and citizens and I hope the European Union takes steps to ensure that no similar situations occur and intervenes to tackle problems affecting citizens of all European Member States who placed their trust in their governments’ controls."
"The right of ownership is a fundamental prerequisite of the market economy."
"The fundamental prerequisite of the control that will take place though the directive on takeover bids must be respect for the right of ownership."
"For many years in Sweden, we have had a system that works, involving a division into A and B shares."
"The control to be carried out must provide an opportunity to retain this system."
". After years of discussion concerning harmonisation of the law in respect of takeover bids in Europe, we have finally reached the only common sense conclusion: that it is better not to seek harmonisation on the sensitive points, but to allow States the freedom to choose the system that best suits their economic and cultural context."
"What a lot of time has been lost in getting there!"
"In particular, we support the compromise that was found on defensive measures against hostile takeover bids. Some Member States will be able to allow boards room for manoeuvre, others will leave it solely to the general meeting of shareholders."
"Let us hope that this provisional compromise will become the norm: it in fact foreshadows a more pragmatic and less standardising view of the European market, which in our view is the right one."
"We regret, however, that this compromise did not include the question of ‘golden shares’ or in French, which some States use to maintain a public interest in large privatised enterprises, especially when there is a risk of foreign takeovers."
"The Commission and the Court of Justice are fiercely against the system, but it affords protection and it should be given greater legitimacy."
"– In the case of takeover bids, some Members would like staff representatives of the businesses concerned to be better informed than this directive provides for them to be."
"So be it, but why then does one of these amendments simultaneously propose the acceptance of ‘confidentiality clauses’, which in the end means restricting information to certain delegates and denying it to the workforce as a whole?"
"In addition, even if these amendments were adopted, that would not protect workers at all from the tragic consequences of buyouts, in particular, mass redundancies under the pretext of restructuring."
"European authorities are concerned with bringing some degree of unity to this jungle-like system, as this House is doing regarding takeover bids."
"They are, however, wildly scorning those who, year after year, takeover bid or not, find themselves in ever greater numbers back on the streets because reducing the workforce, and therefore the salaried masses, is one of the ways in which those who possess capital can increase the price of their shares on the Stock Exchange."
"Only a ban on mass redundancies could protect workers from the tragic consequences of takeover bids for jobs."
"We voted against this report."
"."
"For over a decade now, we have been debating the takeover directive, the first version of which, as we know, was unable to get over the last hurdle in this House."
"I am glad that, thanks to the negotiations involving the Council and our rapporteur Mr Lehne, the adoption of this important text is now, at last, within our reach."
"The Portuguese-Italian compromise arrived at in the Council and adopted in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs strikes me as the best possible result in a complex situation."
"Stipulating the Europe-wide applicability of Articles 9 and 11 whilst allowing the Member States the option of not making them binding on their businesses, although not ideal, is the only compromise possible, to which the alternative would be not having a directive at all, and nobody wants that."
"A small step in the right direction is always better than marking time on the spot for years."
"I would argue that there are a few highly strategic areas in which the Member States should be accorded special rights, which they would be entitled to use in the event of takeovers."
"The report before us indirectly covers the possibility of the Member States availing themselves of the right already referred to, and also solves the specifically Scandinavian problem with securities with multiple voting rights without jeopardising the important level playing field, which guarantees enterprises equal opportunities."
". Although I have voted in favour of the directive, I have great difficulty with it and I have been tempted to vote against."
"A few elements, such as the compulsory bid as a means of protecting minority shareholders, constitute a slight improvement."
"After years of political tug-of-war, the legislative proposal has degenerated into a watered-down compromise."
"In fact, the term 'directive' is not even justified; 'empty shell' would be a more accurate label."
"The directive's original goal, namely to create equal conditions for company takeovers across the entire EU, has been completely eroded away."
"Since it is up to Member States to decide whether they want to transpose the directive into national legislation, defensive mechanisms in the EU will continue to form a barrier to the free movement of capital."
"As a result, the internal market's desperately-needed dynamism is under-used."
"The fact that the Council and Parliament have accepted this proposal demonstrates once again that national interests still prevail over enhancing the competitive capacity of the EU as a whole."
"With this, some of Europe's powerlessness is once again exposed in a painful manner."
"I have from the very outset pleaded in favour of a complete breakthrough rule."
"Only a complete breakthrough rule guarantees a fair internal market for takeovers, which is of crucial importance for optimising the EU's competitive position compared to the rest of the world."
"This is also the view of all the Members belonging to the VVD, the Dutch People's Party for Freedom and Democracy."
". The EPLP is disappointed that additional amendments to strengthen information and consultation provisions in the directive were narrowly defeated by a PPE and Liberal led coalition."
"The EPLP supported amendments affording employees more extensive rights of information and consultation during the bid process."
"Nonetheless, we accept that this directive does represent an improvement for employees on information and consultation, compared with the July 2001 directive."
"Articles 6, 9 and 13 represent an improvement on employees' rights."
"Indeed the original Commission proposal provided that the provisions of the information and consultation directive would be without prejudice to the takeovers directive, now it is explicit that the takeover directive is without prejudice to the information and consultation directive."
"For the EPLP, it comes down to question of political judgement: Is it better to have no directive thus allowing the continuation of an unregulated market for takeovers, with no disclosure or transparency of corporate structures and little or no guarantee of employees' rights to information and consultation, or, is it better to vote in favour of a directive allowing substantial progress on creating a open, transparent framework for takeovers, introducing new standards to guarantee both employees' and investors rights?"
"We voted for the latter."
". – In the past, companies were meant to last."
"Despite conflicts of interest, entrepreneurs and workers agreed that their companies would provide jobs for future generations."
"The entrepreneur who had founded the companies saw this as his life’s work."
"He believed in his product and in his contribution to progress for his town or region."
"For the workers, it was the place that provided them with a source of income and brought them and their colleagues together."
"More say in the business and a better income were the future."
"These days, companies are commodities."
"They are bought, closed down or plundered to release the capital for activities that yield more profits for the owners."
"Anonymous international forces are quick to call an end to all the old certainties."
"Legislation about takeovers can serve very different goals, one of which is to protect the employees and their permanent living environments, while another is to facilitate the trade in companies in order to yield maximum benefit for their shareholders."
"These two goals are not very compatible."
"This is why those who claim that the fact that a directive on takeover bids is being introduced is more important than its content are wrong."
"As in 2001, I am once again voting for everything that contributes to a directive of the former kind and against everything that leads to one of the latter."
". On 4 July 2001, I took part in the Conciliation Committee meeting on this matter, at which the agreement between the EP and the Council was blocked."
"At the time, the issue at stake was that of forcing the management boards of companies subject to a takeover bid to refrain from adopting defensive measures against the offer or company."
"Today, the European Parliament has basically adopted a set of rules in this field which mean that Member States and companies will have the option – but not the obligation – to make these defensive measures illegal unless they have been formally approved at a general shareholders meeting."
"This new wording, designed to protect minority shareholders in the event of a takeover bid and which unblocks this issue, which is of importance to company law and to international economic and financial life, leads me to consider that this report warrants my favourable vote."
". This proposal seeks to integrate European markets, to harmonise conditions for company restructuring, to strengthen the legal certainty of cross-border takeover bids in the interest of all concerned and to ensure protection for minority shareholders in the course of such transactions, thus increasing the transparency of defensive structures and mechanisms."
"This is the third proposal for a Directive and I have given it my support because what we are now seeing is the outcome of overcoming many obstacles and heated debates, in the context of institutional cooperation and consultation, which I welcome."
"In fact, strengthening the internal market and the vitality of European competitiveness – particularly in relation to the USA – will lead to gradual improvements in our own financial services, which promote a healthy competitive environment between European operators, in a context of fairness, transparency and sustainable growth."
"I also believe that the main obstacle to this directive’s adoption in 1989 and 1996 – the effect of takeover bids on employment and their social repercussions in general – must remain at the heart of regulatory concerns."
"This is the only way of understanding the scale of the Union’s fight to achieve real ‘Corporate Social Responsibility’. This is furthermore the only way we will attain the goals of economic dynamism and competitiveness, which are intended to create more and better jobs and greater social cohesion."
"I have chosen to vote against the report and the proposal for a directive, which was however adopted by 325 votes, with 221 votes against and 7 abstentions."
"A certain harmonisation of the EU countries’ rules governing the financial markets may be needed in order to favour the internal market and, thus, growth."
"The directive on takeover bids is, however, along the wrong lines."
"If the directive is adopted, the Swedish system of A and B shares will continue as an exception."
"The directive is to be reviewed after five years, with an obvious risk of the Swedish system again being brought into question and abolished once and for all."
"The system of A and B shares is open and non-discriminatory and based upon purchasing agreements freely entered into."
"There is no evidence for assertions to the effect that the system involving differentiated vote values impedes company takeovers."
"A more principled objection is that forms of ownership should not be decided upon at EU level, nor the right of ownership brought into question nor long-term shareholder liability in a company impaired."
"I have also voted in favour of amendments aimed at giving company employees an opportunity to give their views of a takeover bid through having the company’s board consult their representatives."
". I voted against this directive because three crucial amendments were rejected that were aimed at ensuring that the workers of both the bidding company and the target company were fully informed and consulted in good time in the event of a takeover bid."
"Some claim this is already guaranteed by other directives and that there is therefore no point in dealing with the matter in this directive."
"That view is shared by Commissioner Bolkestein."
"I am not convinced and it is hard to understand why the introduction of a minimum amount of social dialogue into this directive should meet with such opposition."
"But I do agree entirely with Mr Bolkestein that this directive, as it has been adopted with the Commission’s and the Council’s agreement, is not a social directive, it is even a clearly antisocial directive!"
"After more than 15 years of debates, I regret to note, like the ESC, that neither the Council, nor the Commission, nor the majority of Parliament have been able to understand something so simple and obvious as that workers are just as important as shareholders and that they have in particular the right to be informed and consulted over mergers."
"It is a sad day for the European social model."
"– Mr President, this document refers to VAT, value added tax, on postage stamps."
"I had a vision: it was the year 2013 and I was still a Member of this Parliament and Mr Schmidt was again presenting a report on stamps."
"In the future, however, increasingly fewer European citizens used – I am speaking as if the year were 2017 – postage stamps and the ordinary postal services so Mr Schmidt’s directive made provision for financing people who write letters by paying them the postage on their correspondence."
"I mean to say, Mr President, that postage stamps and postal services are becoming so rare that letters will become antiques, just like vintage motor cars."
"That is my last statement today; indeed it is my last statement of 2003."
"Thank you and ."
"Thank you, Mr Fatuzzo."
"I think you have brought the House to silence with your remarks."
". I do not agree that, in the name of competition between state and private services provided in the postal sector, we should be led to increase the cost of postal services to citizens and to a complete denial of the utility function of state post offices."
"That is why I too, like the whole of the GUE/NGL Group, voted against the amendments by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the proposal as a whole."
". The Liberal Democrat delegation did not vote with the rest of the ELDR Group on the Schmidt report."
"We voted against Amendments Nos 1 to 13 and the proposal, as we wished the proposal in its current form to be withdrawn."
"Our reason for doing so is that we believe VAT on postal services, especially in respect of securing a universal service for packages below two kilogrammes, is a matter best left to national governments under the principle of subsidiarity."
"However, we remain open to considering future proposals aimed at ensuring greater competition."
". – The report concerns itself only with those distortions of competition that are liable to be detrimental to the private enterprises that are taking over the postal sector; in no way does it reflect the interests either of users or of postal workers."
"For over a century, the European states have established public postal services that worked in more or less acceptable fashion until criteria of public service began to give way to those of profitability."
"The efficient running of public services, and of the postal services in particular, has for some considerable time been one of the most reliable indicators of a country’s level of development, and, dare I say it, of its level of civilisation."
"It was precisely because the postal services were to some degree sheltered from competition and from the pursuit of profit that they were able to perform their role; it was because they did not exist to be profit-making but to provide a service that they served the most secluded villages and criss-crossed the land with a dense network of post offices."
"Such is the progress that both the nation-states and the European institutions are engaged in systematically demolishing."
"We are absolutely opposed to this exercise in the destruction of public services, which is both regressive and socially unjust."
"To this fundamental reason for voting against this report, we would add another, namely that we are opposed to VAT and hence to its being applied, as also to the price increases that it will entail, and from which users on lower incomes will suffer most."
". In the present European context, especially with regard to the problems raised by taxation and indirect taxation in particular, I cannot accept the Commission’s proposal to remove the VAT exemption for postal services."
"How can such a proposal be made, knowing that the 1977 sixth directive has still not been updated, that the problems of harmonising VAT rates persist, and that an impact assessment has still not been made of liberalisation in the postal sector?"
"Regardless of the matter of VAT liability, how are we to believe in healthy competition to the sole benefit of users in the Member States when the Commission proposes an optional reduced rate for conventional postal services, which can only highlight the technical problems relating to weight and the disparities in rates between Member States."
"Once again, the Commission is putting the cart before the horse and trying to persuade us by autosuggestion. Well, we are not stupid and we reject this text."
". This Commission proposal seeks to remove VAT exemption for postal services, which has been in place since the sixth directive on VAT of 1977."
"The Commission is thereby seeking to achieve two things: to continue the process of establishing a single VAT system and to contribute to the current process of liberalising postal services at EU level, as recommended in directive 2002/39/EC."
"Consequently, as a result of this process of gradual liberalisation which I reject because this undermines public service and its universal scope the effect of removing this exemption, which would oblige public operators to charge VAT at the full rate, would be higher costs for the services provided, especially for private individuals and would encourage the subcontracting of external services."
"I therefore agree with the recommendation by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to reject this Commission proposal, even though this is not the position held by the rapporteur."
"Consequently, I welcome the rejection of the proposals for amendment tabled by the rapporteur himself, with the support of his group and of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, which sought a compromise that would make it possible to adopt this proposal for a directive."
". I opposed the Commission's proposal to harmonise VAT between state postal services like the Royal Mail and private sector delivery services."
"The Commission’s bad timing was not lost on Scotland with the debate taking place in arguably the busiest week for postal services across Europe and I am glad it got the knock-back it deserved."
"It is often rightly assumed and argued that many of us now have access to e-mail and other communications technology and that the cost of postage stamps is irrelevant."
"However, many pensioners and low-income households still depend on reliable and affordable postal services."
"It would be their pockets which would be hit hardest if VAT was put onto the price of a stamp."
"I call upon the Commission to reflect on this and shelve the proposal."
"That concludes the explications of vote."
"(2)"
"Mr President, at the start of the part-session yesterday, I wanted to make a proposal and I asked for the floor. However, I was not given it due to a lack of time."
"I wish to make that proposal now."
"Would that be possible?"
"I am afraid that I cannot give you the floor, Mr Patakis, because you were not originally given the floor, and in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, I cannot give it to you now."
"Can you tell me, as you do not now know, if I will have the opportunity to express my position during this part-session, and if so when?"
"I will pass on your request, Mr Patakis, and I am sure we will find a way for you to take the floor."
". – Mr President, since the last time we discussed the budget in this House, significant progress has been made, particularly following the joint meeting between the Council, Commission and Parliament on 24 November."
"Finally, an agreement has been reached about the funding of Iraq’s reconstruction."
"From the 2004 budget, EUR 95 million will be taken from the flexibility reserve and EUR 65 million from Heading 4."
"The fact that it was Heading 4 means that cuts will need to be made in other lines and that the lines by which some groups set great store have lost some of their importance."
"However, I welcome the fact that there is an agreement."
"We have also reached agreement about the increase in payment appropriations: 2.3% compared to the 2003 budget."
"This means that, irrespective of whether 15 or 25 Member States are involved, in 2004, we will in all probability spend 0.98% of the gross national income."
"I am not certain whether everyone knows this, but that is the lowest percentage since 1990, and as far as that is concerned, we fully comply with the objectives which we set ourselves at the beginning of this year in the directives for the 2004 budget, namely to draft an economical budget."
"There is also agreement about common foreign and security policy."
"A Police Mission can be sent to the Former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia."
"We hope that with this agreement, the provision of information to the Parliament will also improve, for that is of extreme importance to us."
"All praise goes to Mr Böge and Mr Colom i Naval for the agreement on the programmes under codecision, particularly the programmes following enlargement."
"That is, in my view, quite a feat because in future, it will considerably simplify decision-making and budgeting."
"The same compliment can be made to Mrs Dührkop Dührkop and to the rapporteurs of the various specialised committees for the agreement that has been reached on subsidies."
"Finally, there is the result of the most recent conciliation meeting."
"Not only will we save about one billion on agricultural expenditure but the Council of Ministers has also adopted Parliament’s priorities in agriculture."
"Enlargement was the single most important element in the 2004 Budget, and I am therefore delighted to be able to announce that Parliament has agreed to the majority of applications of new Commission posts."
"We will put 25 posts in reserve."
"We want the Commission to comply with certain other conditions, but I think that the Commission has received most of the posts it had requested."
"An important initiative has also been taken in the area of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"In our opinion, the economy in the new countries and in the old Member States can ideally be boosted by increasing the opportunities for small and medium-size businesses."
"This is also something which we managed to secure via this budget: considerably more credit has been made available."
"As to agencies, with the entry into force of the new Financial Regulation, Parliament should also gain a better insight into personnel policy of these agencies."
"This year is still a transitional year, but in the next few years, Parliament will be paying a great deal of attention to this."
"As far as reserves are concerned, according to the result, at least of the votes in the Committee on Budgets, the reserves will be maintained for the NGOs, Eurostat and for Afghanistan."
"At the beginning of this year, Parliament declared itself in favour of a budget for 25 Member States."
"What we will be voting on this week, is a budget of 15 Member States."
"The groundwork has been done, though, and has been done well, so that we, on the basis of the agreements of Copenhagen and on the basis of Parliament’s first reading, can submit a sound, amended budget, or approve one for the ten new Member States."
"With regard to the 2005 Budget, with a reduction of the financial perspectives, the 2005 Budget will become considerably more difficult than that of 2004."
"I would therefore wish Mr Garriga Polledo and my successor every success."
"Finally, as is known, we in this Parliament have an excellent secretariat for the Committee on Budgets, without whose efficiency, it is obvious, the work here in the Parliament would not have been completed."
"I should like to express my warm thanks for this."
"I should also like to thank all the group coordinators."
"In my view, cooperation was excellent and I am very grateful for this."
"Cooperation with the Italian Presidency has also been very successful, for which my thanks."
"Finally, I should like to say special thanks to two people: the first of whom is the chairman of the Committee on Budgets."
"I have valued him for years, but I have now also seen him in action close-by."
"I can only express my admiration for the way in which he has done things. My thanks for this."
"Finally, I am also indebted to my personal assistants, particularly Mr Marko van Workum."
". Mr President, this budget for the other institutions sets the foundations for the imminent enlargement in stone."
"It will equip all the different components that make up the European Union to meet this historic challenge, at least in administrative terms."
"My aim has been to ensure that the EU hits the ground running when we have a Union of 25 next year, also to achieve a balance between the necessary increases in resources and at the same time ensure value for money for the European taxpayer."
"Earlier this year I outlined my main priorities."
"I shall now encapsulate four of these priorities."
"Firstly, to prepare for the final stages of enlargement."
"I am pleased that we were able to fine-tune the original predictions from the secretaries-general for enlargement."
"However, it has to be recognised that the scale of some of the budgetary increases for individual institutions are up to 50% higher in some cases."
"This will fundamentally change how those organisations function a note of caution therefore."
"It is crucial that this change be managed with care and to ensure that effective change management strategies are in place to avoid chaos."
"Secondly, to advocate greater reform."
"All the institutions have to modernise if they are to meet successfully the challenges of the future."
"Let us not underestimate the challenge of 25 countries working together."
"Last weekend's deliberations point to lessons that need to be learnt by the other institutions."
"Complacency will lead to gridlock."
"Thirdly, to push for greater openness, transparency and accountability."
"Every single element of the EU has to be more user-friendly."
"We need to make greater use of new technology, rationalise more processes, focusing on the Internet as a tool of communication to achieve our objective to get closer to the citizens and to communicate more effectively with the people of Europe."
"We have sown the seeds for this, and of course we will need to build on this."
"Fourthly, to alleviate the pressures on the ceiling of Heading 5."
"We have overcome this by frontloading buildings for the Court of Justice this year."
"I believe that Parliament's policy of frontloading for building expenditure has been vindicated as we now have huge pressure on Heading 5."
"This policy has contributed to reducing this pressure this year and next year."
"It therefore makes sense to replicate this policy for other institutions as well."
"I am pleased to report that I have had considerable successes in meeting some of these objectives; but there have also been some frustrations along the way."
"Firstly, on the successes, we have made progress on all the issues I have just outlined."
"This budget achieves value for money."
"We can congratulate ourselves that we have achieved the juggling act of managing to finance enlargement without breaking the ceiling on Heading 5."
"This budget therefore fundamentally completes the process of enlargement budgeting and is a good result for the European taxpayer."
"Moving on quickly to the frustrations, we could have expected greater economies of scale given the expansion proposed."
"However, my biggest regret is that we have not made significant inroads into introducing activity-based budgeting in the other institutions."
"This is a missed opportunity, given the immense pressure on Heading 5, as I have just said, in the remaining years of this financial perspective."
"In 2005 and 2006 it will be much harder to prioritise and to ensure that there is an effective financial decision-making framework."
"The lessons I have learnt throughout this process are that we need better budgeting and improved planning processes."
"The regularity of the last-minute request for unforeseen expenditure is relentless."
"Last month we had to find an extra EUR 77 million for all the EU staff and a further EUR 24 million for the for the Council."
"I am amazed and astonished that we can continue to receive requests of this scale at this late stage."
"The pace of reform has to speed up."
"We need to fast-track, to improve quality of spending and to focus more on our core areas and secure greater rationalisation of our processes."
"Earlier this year I visited the Rikstag and the Bundestag and these visits were very illuminating for me."
"They demonstrated to me a degree of devolvement in decision-making and transparency in the decision-making chain and the budgetary planning process that is achievable."
"But we also need to grasp some thorny issues, as my first reading resolution stresses: all institutions need to review and reform the system of travel reimbursement."
"This is not only an issue for Parliament, but also for two committees and any other body that regularly reimburses expenses."
"It is imperative that this issue is addressed quickly so as to regain the trust and respect of our citizens."
"There are a number of other areas I would like to touch upon but I see that I am running out of time so I would just like to thank all my colleagues for their cooperation and support and for making this report what it is."
"More particularly I would like to thank the Committee on Budgets' secretariat, especially Walter Masur, for their unstinting support and hard work to make this budget what it is."
"I would also like to congratulate my co-rapporteur, Mr Mulder, for what he achieved in his budget in finding solutions which are acceptable to all."
"Finally, my thanks to Mr Wynn as chairman, Mr Walter as coordinator, and our own group secretariat."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the 2004 budget has squared the circle."
"It is the first budget for a Union with 25 Member States. It is an historic budget."
"The profile of the 2004 budget is clearly geared towards enlargement."
"It is also clearly geared towards Europe’s growing role in international affairs."
"Establishing an area of freedom, security and justice is also given a higher profile in the budget."
"At the same time, payments have successfully been reduced to an historic low."
"Payments amount to EUR 99.7 billion, which represents 0.98% of Gross National Income (GNI) for the enlarged Union in the year 2004."
"This outcome – catering for the historic enlargement process, on the one hand, and restricting expenditure, on the other – this squaring of the circle, is, as we know, not a miracle but the outcome of rational calculations."
"On Thursday, this House will vote first of all on the budget for the 15 State EU, with a total of EUR 99 billion in commitments and EUR 95 billion in payments."
"This represents a decrease of 2.8% on the current budget plan."
"At the same time, we have already reached political agreement on the supplementary and amending budget to be adopted in March 2004, which will formally establish the financial resources for the enlargement countries, that is, an extra EUR 11 billion in commitments and EUR 5 billion in payments."
"Overall, the budget for 2004 will increase by just EUR 2.3 billion, and is therefore EUR 11 billion below the maximum amount for payments originally planned for next year in the Financial Perspective in Agenda 2000."
"Next year, the national composition of staff across all the European institutions will change when the appointment of officials from the new Member States begins on 1 May."
"For example, the number of posts in the Council will increase by 286, in the Parliament by 355, and in the Court of Auditors by 133."
"On behalf of the Commission, I would like to thank the Budgetary Authority for also recognising the Commission’s staffing requirements."
"I am especially grateful to Parliament for its efforts to secure the additional resources for the 780 new posts at the Commission."
"I am grateful that you have kept the reserve low, since the integration of new staff, the recruitment processes and of course – in particular – the tasks to be mastered in the wake of enlargement will pose a challenge to all the European institutions."
"In this budgetary procedure, we have also set the figures for all multiannual funding programmes – from funding research to programmes for the environment and trans-European networks – for the new Member States."
"For research funding – let me quote a few figures – a total of EUR 4.8 billion will be available next year, of which EUR 500 million will be earmarked for the new Member States."
"EUR 138 billion will be allotted to the closure of nuclear power plants in the enlargement countries and more than EUR 770 million in total will be available to fund trans-European networks."
"These measures are essential to ensure that the benefits of the large internal market can be utilised to the full."
"The European Union is taking on ever more responsibility in the world."
"This is clearly reflected in the European budget."
"I greatly welcome the fact that everyone involved has been successful in safeguarding the Union’s capacity to fulfil its responsibilities in Iraq, in Afghanistan, and in our cooperation in the Balkans."
"For the measures in Iraq, it has been agreed that the flexibility instrument will be used to provide the sum of EUR 95 million."
"This means that, by the end of 2004, we will meet in full the EUR 200 million pledged for reconstruction in Iraq."
"In my view, conditions will also improve as a result of Saddam Hussein’s arrest, enabling us to devote all our energies to helping the people of Iraq."
"EUR 83 million are earmarked in the budget for Afghanistan."
"I would ask the House to reconsider the reserve here as the Commission intends to propose a comprehensive programme to restore law and order and support the war on drugs in Afghanistan."
"Given that the Loya Jirga is convening in Afghanistan at this very moment, these are important signals that we can send out through the adoption of the budget."
"In the Common Foreign and Security Policy budget for 2004, resources are earmarked to fund the continuation of the EU Police Mission in Bosnia and the new Joint Action in Macedonia."
"The funds for the programmes for the Mediterranean region have also been substantially increased."
"How will the budget develop in the coming years?"
"For 2005 and 2006, the scope will in fact be very limited."
"We have the decisions for the new Member States, the setting of the figures for the multiannual programmes, and the provisions of Agenda 2000."
"As envisaged here, the expenditure for the enlarged Union will increase in the next two years while remaining within the agreed framework, namely 1.06%."
"The Commission will present its communication in January for the period after 2007."
"This will start the debate about priorities and the financial framework."
"At this juncture, let me reiterate one point which is self-evident: anyone who takes decisions must expect to have to foot the bill for these decisions sooner or later."
"In my view, we must all work together on realistic proposals."
"I would like to say a few words about the constitutional debate."
"It is disappointing that the new constitution could not be agreed before enlargement."
"Let me also say, however, that there was an attempt in some quarters to restrict this House’s budgetary rights."
"The Commission firmly rejected this attempt."
"My experience over the last four years has taught me one very important lesson: anyone who claims that the European Parliament does not exercise its budgetary rights responsibly is utterly wrong."
"Every budget that we have adopted, and especially this 2004 budget, shows that the opposite is true."
"The budget is an excellent example of outstanding interinstitutional cooperation."
"I would like to mention the very positive cooperation with the Italian Presidency and the President-in-Office, Mr Magri, in this context."
"I have great respect for the general rapporteur, Mr Mulder."
"Quite simply, you have an outstanding grasp of the material and have been resolute in preparing the 2004 budget."
"Mrs Gill, thank you for your diplomatic negotiations on the sensitive issue of new posts."
"Mr Böge and Mr Colom i Naval, you showed great pragmatism in dealing with the negotiations on the adjustment of the multiannual programmes together with all this House’s specialised committees. Mrs Dührkop Dührkop, you rose superbly to the challenge of achieving a consensus on the subsidy programmes for institutions, which was a Herculean task."
"Above all, however, it was the outstanding leadership of the Committee Chairman, Mr Wynn, which made this all possible."
"Mr Wynn, you have ensured, over all these years, that the committee’s work has been prompt, objective, competent and sound. It has been a real pleasure working with you and your colleagues."
"In short, the budget experts have acquitted themselves with honour in the run-up to enlargement and have created a real masterpiece at the end of this legislative term."
"Many thanks for the excellent cooperation."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, representatives of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, in my capacity as budgetary spokesman for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I would like to congratulate the various rapporteurs involved in the budgetary procedure for 2004, as well as the Commissioner, Mrs Schreyer, and her services, for their great cooperation, and also Mr Magri, who, as has already been said, has done a great bridging job within the Council – an always difficult Council – in order to be able to achieve this draft budget."
"I would also like to congratulate the chairman of our Committee on Budgets, Mr Wynn – who will speak after me – with whom we have enjoyed five unforgettable years during which he has demonstrated his great political skill and above all his great human qualities."
"I would also like to acknowledge the work of the general rapporteur, Mr Mulder, both because, as coordinator of my group, I have closely followed his work, and also because I am going to have to follow in his footsteps as rapporteur for 2005 and I would sincerely like to reach December 2004 with the same sense of a job well done that Mr Mulder must be feeling right now."
"I know that I have a difficult job ahead, as he has mentioned previously, but that is what Parliament's work is all about."
"Our group agrees with the whole of the draft budget presented and we are going to renounce any separate vote."
"We are doing this for two reasons: firstly, because Mr Mulder’s draft budget is balanced, as a result of negotiation, and takes up the essential elements of the positions of the political groups and because, furthermore, my group offered him support at the beginning of the procedure and now we want to demonstrate it; and secondly because we want to send a message of unity from this Parliament to a Council of Ministers which is prepared to unilaterally reduce the budgetary powers of this House, as laid down in the text of the Convention, which has yet to be approved."
"The draft budget for 2004 fully responds to the most significant concerns of our political group."
"These include the maintenance of a level of payments compatible with the needs of enlargement and with the absorption of the RALs."
"All of this must be undertaken while applying the necessary austerity in the total growth in spending."
"Furthermore, the draft responds to the need for greater parliamentary control of specialised agencies and, furthermore, the amount for the financial packages intended for programmes subject to codecision until 2006 is guaranteed by agreement amongst the institutions."
"This draft budget also responds to Parliament’s promise to contribute actively to the reconstruction of Iraq without prejudice to the geographical lines, which are the traditional priority of all the political groups."
"The Council has finally agreed to the mobilisation of the flexibility instrument: for much less than Parliament requested, it is true, but it is also the case that it is much more than the Council wanted to mobilise, which was zero."
"Furthermore, it maintains its pressure in relation to the reform of the Commission by means of this compromise amongst the political groups, which gives the Commission the 272 posts requested in order to carry out enlargement, but which keeps a certain quantity in reserve until this House receives the information it has requested on the development of human resources."
"Our task is now going to be to involve Parliament more and more in the legislative and budgetary procedures."
"We want the Commission’s annual strategy to be discussed here with sufficient time for the preliminary draft to take up and respond to our budgetary guidelines."
"Let us remember that the Union’s budget is more than an accounting exercise in balancing spending and income: it is the political expression of a desire to create more Europe by means of Community programmes."
"This is going to require of us authority and efficiency in spending, but let us not forget that now and forever, and, above all from next May, it is also going to require great generosity."
"Mr President, in the light of what the last four speakers have said there does not seem much left to be said about the 2004 budget."
"Therefore, I will concentrate on one or two other things."
"Firstly, I join with others in thanking the Italian presidency for being cooperative in the way we came to a conclusion on this budget."
"It is nice to see Mr Ionta here with us today he has recently been in hospital and I hope he will send our best wishes for a speedy recovery to Mr Magri who has also been hospitalised."
"We wish him well and we are sorry he is not here today."
"But it is important to stress that the cooperation we have had from the Italians has helped in this process, as with previous budgets, whether it be under the Finns, French, Belgians or Danes although with the Finns it was rather nerve-racking when we all came into this Chamber with two different voting lists on the final day."
"But even then it was high drama!"
"It is also fair to say that, whilst a lot of thanks have been given to me, I want to reciprocate because this is probably the last budget debate I will be involved in as chairman."
"There will be the supplementary and amending budget next year, but this will be the last one I will be involved in as chairman for the general process."
"I have been told what a good job I have done, but you cannot do it unless you are working with the right people."
"Mr Mulder has already thanked the secretariat."
"He is right to do so, as we have an excellent secretariat in the Committee on Budgets, not least Alfredo de Feo, who leads that team extremely well."
"I have three good Vice-Chairmen who support me."
"I have a very good committee membership who take their subject seriously and show great interest."
"But the beauty of it is that it is a great team of coordinators, and especially Mr Walter, who makes my life so easy."
"I say that because I was a coordinator for five years, I have been a chairman for four-and-a-half years and I know which is the harder job it is not this one."
"It is wonderful being chairman, but the coordinators never get the thanks they deserve."
"All the coordinators in the Committee on Budgets have worked extremely hard."
"As you can see with the way that we will vote on Thursday for this budget, it will probably be the easiest budget that any of us have ever voted."
"Having said that, I want to touch on a point Mrs Schreyer also mentioned, which is the future and what was proposed by Ecofin."
"Over the last 15 years in which I have been involved in the Committee on Budgets we in this Parliament have always shown how serious we are about the budget."
"We are not profligate; we are not wasteful; we do not do things because we just want to do them on a whim."
"As Mr Garriga Polledo said, there are political aspects to a lot of this budget and it is not just an accounting exercise."
"But if the Ecofin proposals had gone through – and they could still go through some time in the future – it will be an absolute disaster for Parliament and will lead to chaos."
"What we need between the two arms of the budgetary authority is a more realistic conciliatory approach from both arms."
"We have to start trusting each other."
"In the last four-and-a-half years we have tried to build that trust between our two institutions."
"But until we reach a position where we trust one another, there will always be suspicion from the Council, which wants to take away our powers, and we will always be suspicious of the Council and feel that if it does that we are going to get our own back in some way, shape or form."
"We could have lived with what the Convention proposed."
"We want to ensure that whatever comes in the future gives stability and realism to the system and also to show that we take our position seriously."
"It has been great being chairman of this Committee on Budgets."
"I still have two presidencies to go – the Irish presidency for six months; and then, for the trialogue and the conciliation in July, I will even be involved in the Dutch presidency."
"It is a wonderful position to have held."
"I am grateful to have held it and I just hope that in the future this Parliament has the dignity, powers and ability to serve the people of Europe in the way we have served it during these last five years."
"– Mr President, right at the start I wish to congratulate the budget rapporteurs Mrs Gill and Mr Mulder and thank them for their excellent work."
"I would likewise like to thank Mrs Schreyer and Italy, as the country holding the presidency, for their good levels of cooperation."
"I would particularly like to express my appreciation to the Chairman of the Committee, Terence Wynn, for his role as leader and arbitrator and the constructive cooperation he offered the political group coordinators."
"Next year’s budget was drawn up to apply to 25 Member States, as was the wish of my group."
"This week we are adopting a budget for 15 Member States, but the figures for an enlarged European Union have also been agreed in terms of policy, and they will be adopted in next year’s Amending Budget."
"This will strengthen the reliability of the budget as a basis for the EU’s operations for the year."
"There is budgetary discipline."
"The payment appropriations for Fifteen Member States are down by 2.9% on this year and total payments for the enlarged EU are only 2.3% higher than this year’s budget."
"Accordingly, the desire expressed just before the Intergovernmental Conference held by the Member States to restrict Parliament’s current budgetary authority is incomprehensible."
"Regarding the details, it might be mentioned that the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party supported the general rapporteur’s areas of priority, which were comprehensively adopted – my warmest congratulations."
"My group also supported the Commission’s proposal to increase staff numbers sufficiently as a result of enlargement."
"Despite the Council’s objections this position was adopted."
"The most problematic issue was once again Heading 4, ‘external policies’."
"My group was in favour of participating in the reconstruction of Iraq."
"During the conciliation procedure Parliament succeeded in squeezing EUR 95 million out of the flexibility instrument."
"It was possible to finance the rest by reallocating appropriations within the heading."
"We are pleased that our group’s other priorities within the context of this heading were also taken into consideration, such as the Northern Dimension, action to strengthen human rights and democracy, and the fight against diseases connected with poverty, such as malaria and AIDS."
"Our group has always taken a sceptical view of cash earmarked for various special organisations – the A-30 budget lines."
"There has always been the view that there is no great justification for them and they have been likened to gifts of cash for Christmas."
"Now they are to be phased out."
"The EU’s approach to granting finance is gradually changing to one based on application and is becoming transparent, by virtue of the Financial Regulation."
"In this connection it is worth mentioning that Parliament succeeded in protecting the funding of Info-Points and rural Carrefours for next year, when their status is to be clarified."
"But for Parliament’s intervention, things would have been a shambles."
"Next year’s draft budget at the end of the day reflects the sense of responsibility that Parliament feels in its role as budgetary authority."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, the EU’s draft budget for next year has remained in the shadow of certain major events."
"These also nevertheless have an impact on the EU budget."
"The first that comes to mind is America’s attack on Iraq, which was illegal when viewed in terms of international law, as it was carried out without a mandate from the UN."
"The EU pledged EUR 200 million at the Madrid Donors’ Conference to help the United States of America in the post-war reconstruction work in Iraq."
"In that way, and using money that belongs to all of us, certain large Member States, which did not take part in the oil war, wish to normalise their bilateral relations with the United States."
"If a Member State wants to give money to Iraq, this money should come from that country itself."
"That would have been the case if the flexibility instrument, as it is called, had been activated and EU expenditure had been increased by a corresponding amount."
"It would not have meant abandoning financial discipline because the grand total in the EU’s budget for next year is the lowest for almost 20 years in terms of GDP."
"That means the EU is not sworn to the same kind of Keynesian policy on debt as Germany and France, which do not make the same sorts of demands on themselves with regard to discipline under the Stability and Growth Pact as those made on others."
"The way things work now is that the flexibility instrument is just partially activated and some of the assistance money for Iraq is being taken from other budget lines."
"In that respect the reconstruction of Iraq is being paid for by those beneficiaries that are being deprived of corresponding amounts of cash."
"Our group cannot support the fact that the destruction caused by America’s war in poor but oil-rich Iraq is being paid for by other poor people: the poor in Asia, Latin America and the Mediterranean countries."
"The EU constitution was not adopted last weekend in Brussels."
"That will have no real impact on next year’s budget, but it might have a huge impact on future budgets when talks begin on the financial frameworks for the period 2007-2013."
"It should be noted how Germany’s and France’s political elite are lumping together continued negotiations on the Constitution and talks on the financial framework."
"It would seem that this is a threat to those EU candidate countries which insist on their constitutional voting rights and which are net beneficiaries of EU budgetary funds."
"It is clear that, under the Treaty of Nice, Spain and Poland have too great a voice in the EU, but the EU budget should not be used for political pressure in respect of these countries."
"If, however, countries are to be treated in this way, let the same be done with regard to all countries, using the same criteria."
"With reference to the budget we should put pressure on the United Kingdom, whose net contribution we the citizens of the other countries pay two thirds of."
"There is no sustainable basis for such discounts on contributions."
"In exactly the same way as we wish to get Spain and Poland to implement the will of others, Great Britain too should be made to pay its share of EU costs on the same basis as that which obtains with others."
"As for Parliament’s own budget, our group takes a critical view of the proposals for Parliament’s funds to be used to aid political parties at European level, which is to say the parties of parties."
"Financial support for them will mean weakened national parliamentary democracy and a transfer of power to supranational level."
"I wish to thank the budget rapporteur and the various group coordinators for their excellent levels of cooperation, although I did put forward some points of view that differ from the general approach."
"Mr President, the rapporteurs, Mr Mulder and Mrs Gill, have worked hard over the past year to present a budget which reflects the European Parliament’s priorities but which at the same time fits within the stringent framework of the financial perspectives."
"They succeeded in this, and I should like to thank them both warmly for their efforts, their work, but also for the good team spirit and pleasant cooperation which I have experienced from both."
"Despite sound preparations, this discussion of the budget appeared to be precarious last week because at the IGC, it transpired that a number of Heads of Government had had enough of parliamentary democracy and threatened to remove the budgetary rights which Parliament has had for over 30 years."
"They believe that Parliament has too much power and that it sometimes misuses it in order to impose its views in other areas where it has no authority."
"That is, of course, a little bizarre as a reason, though."
"If we enjoy parliamentary rights, we can use them, but also in a way that does not please the Heads of Government."
"While I do not doubt the legitimacy of the decisions of this House, I do, at times, doubt its intelligence."
"My group particularly disapproves of the fact that on every occasion, the majority of this House wants to place some of the funds in reserve in order to score a political point."
"The members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, in particular, are very adept at this."
"Accordingly, some of the funds intended for the reconstruction of Afghanistan have been placed in reserve and will not be released until the Commission has taken action against the large-scale drugs trade on the ground."
"Like yourselves, I naturally have a great deal of faith in the Commission, but this appears a little ambitious for our officials in Brussels."
"The media point, however, has been scored, it has been said, ‘You are opposed to drugs’."
"Terrific!"
"This does mean, however, that Afghanistan has less money to spend, or does the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats intend to release this money at a later date without one single measure being taken against the drugs trade?"
"Some of the subsidy for non-governmental organisations is also being placed in reserve."
"The majority of the Members of this House here present would like a little more information from the Commission about how this money has been spent in previous years, and that is of course fine;"
"I want this too."
"A reserve, however, does not only function as a big stick, it also claims victims."
"After all, it entails a huge amount of administration and, with this, overheads, because the Commission can only award subsidies to organisations up to the amount that is actively mentioned on the budget line."
"So, either the Commission will delay the procedures for the award of the subsidies and will wait until all the money has been released – only to be told off by Parliament, of course, for not spending the money quickly enough – or the Commission has to run the procedure twice, with all the red-tape that this entails, and we are, of course, firmly opposed to this red-tape."
"The same problem occurs in the recruitment of personnel."
"A small proportion of the new posts that the Commission needs in order to guarantee the smooth running of enlargement is now being placed in reserve."
"I can well imagine the reasons for this."
"Parliament wants more information about the steps that are taken in the Commission’s reform process."
"That is a good idea and we must request, or even demand, this from the Commission, and, if it does not provide this information, we should have the courage to take political steps against it."
"Frustrating the recruitment of personnel for enlargement is not, however, the right way to go about this."
"The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is not, in principle, opposed to deploying the instrument of reserve if it is a means to an end."
"We ourselves, in fact, suggested placing some of the money for KEDO in reserve when North Korea failed to adhere to all the conditions of this nuclear energy programme."
"We have also voted for certain other reserves, provided that they clearly served a purpose and that this purpose was achievable within a clear timeframe."
"However, the instrument of reserves is sometimes used too lightly."
"We must certainly not prevent the Commission from being able to function properly, certainly in view of the fact that third parties also stand to be adversely affected."
"We have asked for a split vote for a number of reserves, and I hope that the groups will reconsider whether they simply place the money on the line and subsequently judge the Commission on its actions."
"– Mr President, I also want to express my thanks, not because it is Christmas, but precisely because it is only right to acknowledge how useful it has been having a chairman like Terry Wynn, even if all these words of praise sound like a ‘beatification’ of Terry who is, on the contrary, a lively and warm personality as well as being extremely pragmatic."
"I want to thank all my fellow Members and coordinators for the hard work carried out in recent years."
"I also want to thank the Secretary-General and above all Mr de Feo, who is Italian, and all those who worked with him."
"Even though we have had lively exchanges within the committee, thanks are also due to the Commissioner: The fact is that young people like me want to have a revolution but in the end we cannot and so we attempt to contribute in some way."
"Thanks also to the Directorate-General, now skilfully led by Mr Romero, and those who worked with it."
"I should like to say that the work carried out by the rapporteurs in the context of the present budget has been of real importance."
"I would like to stress my agreement with the proposal to place administrative expenditure in the reserve, in particular for job creation, on the grounds that we must have more information."
"The funds for the Info-Points, which we managed to have reinstated only by recourse to the conciliation procedure, should not be granted for this year alone but also in following years."
"As regards TENs, I want publicly to thank everyone for the assistance this programme received, even if I do not agree with the criticisms made this morning against Mr Lunardi which may, in part, have been voiced because of jealousy harboured by a political group."
"I believe that the work carried out with the Italian Presidency over this period in relation to my report is something unique which I want to emphasise."
"Finally, thank you for supporting the amendment concerning the Centre for the Disabled, which will be presented during the budget vote. This is something I consider essential."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, just about everybody is bemoaning the so-called failure of last weekend’s Summit in Brussels."
"What is positive about the outcome is that we need not worry in our debates about the threat that the Council will touch Parliament’s say in the budget."
"At the same time, Parliament should realise that it is mainly the Member States that cough up the money to finance the European Union’s policy."
"According to an old democratic rule, whoever pays can at least share in decision-making."
"Moreover, we take the ultimate decisions about the taxpayers’ money."
"They are entitled to guarantees that their money will be spent wisely."
"The rapporteur, Mr Mulder, has presented a modest budget, for which I would like to applaud him."
"The Council, Commission and Parliament have the responsibility for sound budget management, an important area in which the Commission has dropped huge clangers, failing to deliver on its emphatic pledges from 1999."
"Reforms are still required to improve management and transparency."
"In addition, a great deal of work is to be done internally so as to create an organisational culture in which taking responsibility and rendering account are considered to be normal."
"I like the amendment tabled by Mr Mulder, Mrs Gill and Mr Garriga Polledo, but surely they are not so naïve as to believe that the Commission’s reforms can be completed by next spring?"
"I would sooner say that they have only just started properly."
"One major point of concern is still the enormously high outstanding amounts for the structural funds."
"They amount to no less than EUR 92 billion, almost an entire annual budget!"
"The strict application of the N+2 rule is a first necessary measure in order to address this problem."
"At the same time, the policy must become a great deal more coherent."
"I would therefore suggest for the structural funds policy to focus on Objective 1, for which only the poorest regions qualify."
"Other forms of structural policy, especially those for the benefit of richer regions, often appear to frustrate labour mobility or lead to distortion of competition."
"What is also often the case is that national or regional authorities put forward the least effective projects for European aid."
"Export refunds are very susceptible to fraud."
"Those for live cattle should be abolished altogether, certainly when these are exported to countries that are exempt from EU import levies."
"This is simply asking for fraud carousels."
"Would the Commissioner promise today that she will present a proposal on this topic before long?"
"In general, the European Union should let the proximity principle play a much greater role in external policy."
"The fact is that Member States continue to pursue their own foreign policy anyway."
"Internationally, they form the key players."
"The European Union should set itself to coordination and mutual harmonisation, as well as funding emergency aid."
"Support to the reconstruction of Iraq and Afghanistan becomes the European Union much better than many other forms of external policy."
"This is why I am disappointed that many in this House are not prepared to set aside substantially more money for the reconstruction of Iraq."
"Now that it is curtains for the dictator, Saddam Hussein, this would be more than ever appropriate."
"I regard subsidies from the EU budget to European think-tanks and organisations promoting the European idea as misplaced."
"We should not get involved in imposing a unilateral opinion on the citizens."
"Moreover, these are private foundations that do not serve a general interest, but at best make the European Union even more remote from the public."
"– Mr President, like others I would like to thank those who have been part of this budgetary process, particularly our rapporteurs as we come to the end of the fixing of the 2004 budget."
"As others have commented, it will be sad to have a Committee on Budgets without the chairmanship and the fairness, humour and goodwill of Mr Terry Wynn."
"But who is to say who will be chairman of that committee?"
"If the biggest group in this Parliament decided to have the Committee on Budgets as its primary committee then it would not naturally fall to the PSE if it was not the largest group."
"But this is all for the future and we should not be indulging in too much speculation."
"Rather we should be happy that we have had a great chairman who has been in charge of our committee during this period in Parliament."
"I would like to stick to three themes."
"The first is the question of the Commission reform."
"In this debate I have heard it said that we should not be having reserves, particularly a reserve on Commission posts at this stage, because the Commission would like to have all those posts for enlargement purposes."
"We fully understand that, but we think that a small number – 25 out of 270 or so posts – should be located there because we would like to have a clearer definition of what has actually been achieved in the reform process and what still needs to be done."
"In this Chamber last month, Mr Prodi, the President of the Commission, was indicating that yes, there are some things, which recent events, such as the Eurostat affair, have revealed in relation to lack of information flow or responsibilities here and there."
"By 15 February 2004, we would like to see a document that refers to these particular types of items, informally completing the document we received from the Commission a few weeks ago."
"Secondly I would like to turn to one particular aspect of this budget, which is external financing."
"One criticism I heard from Mrs Buitenweg is about why we as a Group have been asking for certain funds to be placed in the reserve."
"In comparison to many previous years, this year we have been extraordinarily modest in putting funds in the reserve because we want to see some indications in Afghanistan that action is being taken to try to solve the extraordinarily different problems of drug production."
"70% of the drugs that arrive in Europe come from Afghanistan."
"Mrs Buitenweg! I see you are supporting me in the Chamber."
"Perhaps under the circumstances I could refer to you as an honorary member of our Group!"
"We are thinking about releasing this money as soon as the reserves are released."
"We have a letter from Commissioner Patten – you can ask Mr Garriga Polledo – saying that progress is on its way and therefore putting money in the reserve has actually been to some real purpose in that field."
"In Iraq, as other Members have mentioned, we have seen some recent changes which will of course change the nature of financing in 2004."
"My Group looks forward to Commissioner Patten coming forward with the document which is meant to be looking at medium-term funding for Iraq."
"We believe that further funding could well be needed out of the 2004 budget for this purpose."
"The flexibility instrument is already in use, but it is for 2003-2004, and therefore some funds will remain should there be other causes which we have to finance, whether in Iraq or elsewhere."
"The fundamental political point I would like to make here - and I believe it is a view shared in all parts of the House - is that we cannot continue to finance external policy simply by relying on goodwill when utilising the flexibility instrument."
"We have to be able, when we come to the next financial perspective, to think clearly what our priorities are and how are we going to be able to meet them."
"Some Members in the House in 1999 doubted whether we had enough funds in Category IV for external funding."
"We have been proved right in the operation of this and therefore when these negotiations open out in 2004, with the document from the Commission looking at this question of financial perspectives, we need to be clear that we have the funds necessary for our ambitions."
"It seems to me that this is now going to be the big debate we will be holding next year when we have elections: a new Commission will be coming in and a new Parliament."
"What is the framework going to be for our financial perspectives over at least the five years from 2007 onwards?"
"On the front page of the today we see at least six Member States saying that they do not want to exceed 1% of GDP."
"Our message as a Group is: please do not decide, as governments, to sign up to actions which you then do not wish to finance, because it then makes the whole question of the running of this budget impossible."
"In conclusion, when we come to the financial perspectives we are going to have to be very realistic and very coherent, but above all, let us make sure that when we have ambitions we have the means to achieve them."
"Mr President, Commissioner, let me begin – as all the other group spokespersons have done – by expressing my warmest thanks to the two rapporteurs for their work this year."
"Mr Mulder and Mrs Gill have produced an outstanding report."
"I would also like to thank our Chairman of the Committee on Budgets once again for his cooperation over the last two years."
"He has said that he no longer wishes to chair the committee, but I am sure he will keep his seat in the next Parliament and the House will continue to benefit from his wit and wisdom, unless the British people are foolish enough not to re-elect him."
"However, I cannot imagine that the British would do such a thing."
"Of course they will re-elect him and then we will have him back again."
"Europe is being built by those who have a desire to create a future and bear responsibility."
"I think it is important to state this clearly at the present time."
"In order to achieve this goal, extraordinary patience and an ability to listen are essential, and extraordinary efforts must be made to achieve mutual understanding."
"Only if we listen to each other and seek to understand each other is it possible to achieve extraordinary things. In this respect, Europe’s citizens can depend on this House."
"Where others sow the seeds of discord, we have shown solidarity."
"Where others incite mistrust, we dare to build democracy and trust in each other’s ability. Where others instil fear, we offer fresh prospects, and where others vie for power, we seek compromises."
"The result is the ability to produce a budget like the one before us."
"It is thrifty, sound and forward-looking."
"Yes, it is thrifty, contrary to popular opinion."
"This morning, the President of this House, speaking in this debate, pointed out that over recent years, the total discretionary expenditure added by the Council amounts to EUR 33 billion, whereas Parliament, under its discretion, has added just EUR 21 million."
"In other words, we have exercised far more restraint in this area, and despite the frequent accusations, we are not the ones constantly stretching the budget."
"In fact, the 2004 budget represents a decrease of 0.26% for commitments for the EU of the Fifteen and, indeed, a reduction of 3% for payments."
"Even if we include the new countries in the equation, the staff-to-population ratio falls from 0.8 officials per 10 000 inhabitants to 0.7 per 10 000."
"Let me give you a comparison: according to the OECD, Spain, for example, has 388 officials per 10 000 inhabitants."
"This is the personnel basis on which we are shaping the future of the European Union."
"In other words, we are extremely thrifty, and we also exercise sound financial management."
"We want the funds to be spent on the purposes for which they are intended, which is why we exercise control over spending, firstly through the Committee on Budgetary Control, but also at the financing planning stage."
"That is why we set up reserves in various areas."
"This year, we have formed relatively few reserves."
"Those we have set up are linked to specific conditions."
"We will dissolve these reserves as quickly as possible, as soon as we know that the relevant measures have been adopted."
"Blind faith would be overly optimistic, while excessive mistrust would be paralysing."
"We are therefore adopting a middle way."
"As Social Democrats, we are trying to work with properly established and tightly restricted reserves."
"This budget also shows that we are future-oriented."
"That is why we in the Group of the Party of European Socialists (PSE Group) can say that we are very, very satisfied with the result."
"What we have achieved is that in future, we will be working through OLAF to combat VAT fraud in Europe."
"Here, financial resources that can be generated must be generated."
"Next year too, as in previous years, we will continue to promote small and medium enterprises, for they are the backbone of the European economy."
"We want to prepare for demographic change, as population levels are declining throughout Europe."
"In Spain and Italy, the population figures are already falling."
"In Germany, this will be the case from next year."
"This will have an impact on life in our communities."
"How will we target the Structural Funds to take account of the fact that in future, Europe will have around 15% fewer people?"
"We need to find an answer to this question – and we cannot wait until the problem is upon us. We need to make preparations now."
"Under Heading 4: External Policies, we are in part consolidating existing measures."
"However, we will also master the new challenges."
"We will provide adequate funds for Iraq for measures which can actually be implemented."
"Nonetheless, we will still provide EUR 168 million for Afghanistan, and we will continue to participate in the funding of measures in the Balkans."
"What we need, however, is not just remedial aid after the event; we must also be working with an eye to the future."
"That is why we are pleased that we have been able to expand the resources for preventive measures: to promote human rights and democracy around the world and to combat ABC weapons and land mines."
"I would like to express my warmest thanks to everyone, including the Commissioner."
"I think we have a very good budget before us."
"Naturally, we will be voting for it."
"Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, the budget for 2004 is in many ways a complicated budget because enlargement will happen part way through the year. If we were so successful at putting the budget in place, it was of course due to the splendid cooperation between the institutions and, of course, to fantastic contributions from the rapporteurs, the coordinators and our chairman, Mr Wynn, who is truly adept at cooperation."
"Our success should be honoured and appreciated and not be greeted with attacks on Parliament’s budgetary authority."
"I wish especially to emphasise three things about this budget for 2004."
"First of all, we put enlargement in place."
"Secondly, we found the EUR 200 million for Iraq."
"It is now that the Iraqis are short of money."
"In the longer term, Iraq is of course a country rich in resources that can fund its reconstruction itself."
"Thirdly, I wish to mention a lesser, but nonetheless important, matter for the next few years."
"This budget placed special emphasis on the decentralised agencies, so we can sincerely welcome last week’s summit, where something was in fact decided."
"At long last, domiciles were established for a whole series of agencies following the failure to decide about this matter at numerous summits."
"About time, too."
"A steady stream of new agencies is now being set up, and the good thing about these decentralised units is that they guarantee expertise, concentration upon a particular area and the arms-length principle when it comes to administration."
"The problem, however, is that the many agencies may lead to unduly large expenditure on administration, both because we obtain small units that are expensive to administer and because we use the action appropriations for these agencies."
"It is therefore good that, with this budget, Parliament has emphasised that we wish to have control over the development of the agencies in the future, and that we wish to have transparency."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by complimenting the rapporteurs, in particular Mr Mulder, and I will confine my brief remarks to the agricultural budget."
"The current figures in proposed agricultural spending amount to over EUR 40 billion for the enlarged EU of 25 next year."
"This is a vast amount of public money."
"I am aware that there are many critics of the European Union's common agricultural policy, which continues to receive more than half the annual budget."
"I have consistently defended this policy and believe it has been one of the most successful common policies operated by the Community since its foundation."
"From the beginning, the CAP was always about far more than products and markets: it was, and is, about people and communities."
"Critics of the CAP seem to lose sight of this."
"The second pillar is about rebuilding rural communities and restoring urban/rural balance."
"The critics also lose sight of, or choose to ignore, the series of major reforms which the CAP has undergone over the past decade, culminating in this year's Luxembourg accord."
"I very much welcome the direction in which the CAP has evolved."
"The future is in a multifunctional agriculture which serves social, environmental and consumer needs."
"Farmers continue to raise doubts about the continuity of budget support for family farming."
"In many respects this is an unnecessary waste of energy."
"With budget stability to 2013, I suggest they use this period to replan their farming practices, to become more efficient and use the opportunities of recent reform to meet the challenges and opportunities which the future holds."
"Mr President, going back into the early part of the preparation of these budgets, first, in several instances the other institutions wanted enormous increases in their budgets."
"I accept that we are expanding from 15 countries to 25, that we are expanding from 11 languages to 20, but I was delighted that the Council of Ministers chopped the huge increases being asked for by the Court of Justice, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions."
"With regard to Parliament's budget, at the start we faced the fact that there could have been a statute for Members of the European Parliament."
"We all agreed, across all parties, that this would have meant an increase of probably tens of millions of euros in the budget for Parliament."
"It is not my job to say here and now whether it is a good or a bad thing to have a statute, but I must point out that it many mean a further increase if one is ever implemented."
"We have funding for political parties starting in the middle of next year, after the European elections in June."
"Again, we have reserved enough money within the budget and it is quite right and proper that we do so."
"We will have proper working arrangements that are above board, with proper checks and balances, but it is an item on which we have to finalise some of the details."
"Looking ahead in relation to languages, I should like to think that overall there would be a use of fewer languages."
"I know that it is right and proper, with enlargement, to give all the new countries the possibility of using their native languages, but we ought to rationalise the use of languages in future years."
"I hope that minds will be concentrated in that regard."
"There is one unfinished item of business: whether Parliament should have a health insurance scheme for former Members."
"I am delighted that a few weeks ago a report was commissioned."
"I understand that the results will be published next month."
"This will enable us to look at whether this is a good and sensible thing for former Members who fall ill."
"They would have to have served two full terms 10 years."
"I consider this to be something that Parliament needs to look at in order to redress the imbalance between ourselves, who as Members of the European Parliament do an awful lot of travelling and are put at health risks because of that, and other people in the various institutions."
"We have heard mention today of the overall cost of the European Union to the taxpayers in Europe."
"I am convinced that the has got it absolutely right, as Mr Elles pointed out."
"Admittedly we can spend upwards of 1.24% of the gross domestic product of all the countries on the European Union budget."
"I am so delighted that we have managed to drive that percentage down over the four years that I have been in this Parliament, so that even with enlargement, we are just below 1% of the gross domestic product."
"That is a huge compliment to everyone involved: the Commissioner herself, the staff of the Commission, the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, the Council of Ministers."
"Everyone deserves credit."
"Therefore I would like to see us carry on giving better value for money to the European Union taxpayers over the years."
"They want to see the real cost of Europe reduced."
"That way they will see that we are responsive to their wishes."
"Mr President, I am speaking as draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets on the former A-30 budget lines."
"This is a series of budget lines which financed subsidies from the appropriations included in Part A of the Commission’s budget."
"I would like to point out that, with the entry into force of the new Financial Regulation, it became necessary to adapt the subsidies to the rules of the new Regulation."
"Firstly, the spending in the A lines had to be reclassified as operational appropriations, rather than administrative ones, and, secondly, as laid down in Article 49 of the Financial Regulation, the legal basis making it possible to execute these appropriations had to be created."
"In line with this Article 49, at the beginning of the summer of 2003, the Commission presented seven proposals, which took the form of a multi-annual Community action programme, with the aim of guaranteeing its entry into force in 2004 so that the activities of the subsidised organisations could continue."
"Over recent months, the main rapporteur and the draftsmen of the committee opinions have worked together to maintain a common position for the seven proposals with the Council at all times."
"I would now like to focus on the result of the conciliation of 24 November, the essential points of which were the duration of the programmes, the financial contribution and, above all, the issue of pre-allocation or earmarking, which is undoubtedly the main stumbling block."
"Before that, however, I would like to offer my profound gratitude to all the rapporteurs of the committees involved and the general rapporteur, Mr Mulder."
"First stumbling block, the duration of programmes."
"The European Parliament requested that all the programmes should be of the same duration, until 2006, in other words, until the end of the current financial perspectives, a position which was accepted by the Council."
"Secondly, with regard to the financial contribution, I believe we can feel more than satisfied, since we have been able – if you pardon the expression – to ‘wrench out’, as a total for the seven programmes, EUR 23.1 million, more than the sum proposed by the Council."
"Those of us with experience of this House know how difficult it is at times to get anything out of the Council, however insignificant."
"Thirdly, with regard to pre-allocation – which I said was the most troublesome issue – the agreement provides for the inclusion of beneficiaries in the basic instruments, specifically in the citizenship and culture programmes for 2004 and 2005, and with appropriations within lines, not in reserve – as voted for at first reading – but with the same quantity."
"This means that with a view to the renegotiation of the programmes after 2006 – that is, the renegotiation in 2005 for the new programmes in 2007 – the benefiting organisations have sufficient time to adapt to and prepare for the system of invitations to tender, as laid down in the Regulation."
"Finally, I believe we can all take mutual pleasure in this result, because in this way not only do we have the house in order but we also guarantee that the valuable activities of the different organisations included in these programmes are not jeopardised or interrupted."
"– Mr President, I should, in turn, like to congratulate Mr Mulder on the result of all his efforts: a well-balanced budget which reflects the largest possible consensus in our Parliament."
"Nevertheless, as rapporteur for the budget of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, I am left with a somewhat unpleasant feeling."
"After all, it has become a constant during the annual budget negotiations that in terms of foreign policy, all kinds of new pledges are made, as a result of which cuts have to be made elsewhere, which I regret."
"Indeed, how can the European Union be a credible and effective player on the world stage if we get Latin America and Africa to pay for Iraq’s reconstruction?"
"EU Member States often tend to make big promises, but then forget them when it comes to putting their money where their mouths are."
"This is why I am pleased that the Committee on Budgets has backed my main amendment, in which it is clearly stipulated that new future commitments can only be funded if these are met by new additional financial resources."
"Commissioner Schreyer was right to note that the actual extent of expenses still remains under the statutory ceiling of 1.24% of the EU’s GDP, so I see it as extremely significant that the Committee on Budgets accepted the proposal to set aside a substantial part of the EU budget’s margin, namely EUR 16.5 billion for external EU policy."
"After all, anyone who has ambitions on the world stage not only requires one voice but also more funding."
"If we fail to succeed in this, we will be excluded from the negotiating table through nobody’s fault but our own – which is often the case as it is – and will afterwards be presented with the bill for international crises without being able to influence the decisions made."
") Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like raise a couple of points in connection with the adoption of the 2004 budget today."
"Firstly, as I recall, this Commission pledged, when it came to office, to carry out reforms and equip the European Union and the European Commission with the capacity to act for the future and make them less vulnerable to fraud."
"The 2004 budget will be your last budget, Commissioner, and it is not yet apparent that all the reforms have been completed satisfactorily."
"That is why I hope we can agree to put the relevant items in the reserve so that you can finish the work."
"We will gladly release the funds as soon as the relevant documents have been submitted to us."
"I want to raise a second issue which I addressed in very clear terms in connection with the first reading, namely the issue of ‘Europe of the citizens’."
"We fought for this, and I am very happy that an agreement has been reached with the Council and a legal framework has now been established for city partnerships that will help us to overcome all the problems and create legal certainty for the next three years."
"It is undoubtedly a programme which can be extended."
"However, I now hear that there is a solution for the Carrefours and Info-Points for 2004 but not beyond."
"I do think it is rather worrying, especially after talks with the Info-Point in my home town, that there are obviously different budget lines from which the Info-Points can draw funding and that not all of them are affected by the problems relating to the new budget regulations."
"Perhaps the Commission could check internally to see where the error lies. I do not think that we can offload the problem on these agencies, which are performing outstanding service to the European Union by providing information to broad sections of the public."
"Continuing our debate of this morning and in response to the Intergovernmental Conference of last weekend, I would like to make one thing very clear: it is quite pointless at present to mull over how much money the European Union will have at its disposal after 2006."
"From this perspective, I can understand why the six governments sent their letter, if we do not yet know what the agenda for the European Union will be after 2006."
"In my view, that is the first question which must be answered."
"If an agenda is defined, adequate funds must be provided to carry it out."
"It will not work if the Member States say: ‘That is the financial platform, but everything that I wish to achieve must be carried out anyway.’"
"We should use the time that the Heads of State or Government have given us to consider what the European agenda should be and how much money it will cost to fulfil – and this financial framework should then be made available."
"That is the only rational approach when we come to discussing the financial period after 2006."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, I should first like to congratulate our rapporteurs, Mr Mulder and Mrs Gill, as well as the entire Committee on Budgets and those who have worked on preparing the 2004 Budget."
"It all happened with unaccustomed ease, within a completely new budgetary framework and in the context of an enlarged Europe."
"I believe that our Committee has achieved, for this legislative period, a mature ability to compromise and has proved itself capable, under the leadership of our Chairman, Mr Wynn, of developing successful working methods, which have borne fruit this year in particular."
"Our group’s priorities have been heard, taken on board and reinforced."
"I am thinking in particular of Community policies to benefit companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises. There have been all those policies that have contributed to the construction of a people’s Europe, such as town-twinning projects in the enlarged Europe, and also those such as the earmarking of funds for vaccination against poverty-related diseases, which make Europe’s active role in the world visible."
"A trouble-free budget, then, but one marked by a general reduction in Parliament’s powers on financial matters."
"Yet again, the Council has challenged our rights and prerogatives."
"And for what?"
"It is high time that questions were asked about the discrepancy between political rhetoric and budgetary feasibility."
"Every year, I stand before you and denounce what has become a recurring problem."
"The Council’s frosty attitude is prejudicial to our legitimate budgetary ambitions."
"Furthermore, the Brussels fiasco has demonstrated what kind of future our Heads of State or Government have in store for Europe."
"We cannot achieve a Europe that is genuinely relevant to the lives of its citizens without major, far-reaching policies."
"And major, far-reaching policies require a budget to match."
"The Council seems to have ignored this obvious fact, focused as it is on the Stability Pact and pandering to national self-interest."
"Is this the Europe that we want to build?"
"It most definitely is not."
"It is, however, the Europe that the Council would like us to have."
"During the budget vote, we had an example of such inconsistency with information policy. We want to bring Europe closer to its people."
"Being concerned about the general public’s disaffection with European integration, we are trying to unite the people around major projects."
"All of this requires a coherent, ambitious information and communication policy and without Parliament’s intervention, funds set aside for this policy would have been subject to budget cuts from the Council."
"What is most serious, however, is the reduction of our budget. Payment appropriations have fallen this year below 0.99% of GDP, their lowest level since 1987."
"I therefore endorse Mr Cox’s remarks and Mr Prodi’s analysis in response to the calls by six Heads of State for payment appropriations to be capped to 1% of the GNP."
"Where is the consistency with the Lisbon Agenda, the Union’s blueprint for growth and competitiveness?"
"Miracles do not happen, and nobody has ever managed to square the circle."
"Being Head of State or of Government is a position of responsibility; it is about ensuring the matching of means consistent with objectives."
"If the Council wishes to lead us into a dead end, it is up to us, the European Parliament, to remind it of its promises."
"I do not see how we can finance these crucial reforms on increasingly meagre resources."
"MEPs are elected by the people; they are elected to take responsibility, and I am grateful to Commissioner Schreyer for reminding us of this."
"They are capable of preparing EU budgets within the bounds of fiscal orthodoxy, and will continue to be so, but they also know that the EU must abide by approved – jointly approved – political priorities."
"The Council must respect Parliament now, and in the future must show more trust towards this House, which enjoys the legitimacy of the ballot box."
"Mr President, Commissioner, representative of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, please allow me to begin by saying that, following the events of last weekend, and what has already been said here this afternoon, the main virtue of this 2004 budget, for an institutionally very complex year, is the mere fact that it exists at all."
"The budget offers stability and confidence, key factors if enlargement is to be a success."
"It is therefore essential that the Commission and national administrations respond effectively."
"This Parliament has offered its support for the reform of the Commission and its request for posts, because we believe that the Union’s budget is synonymous with credibility, and there can be no credibility when in the last three financial years the average use of available payment appropriations stood at 85%, according to the European Court of Auditors."
"The agreement between the Council and Parliament has once again been in the interests of the citizens."
"Once again, Parliament has demonstrated flexibility in the negotiations, without relinquishing its political priorities."
"The work of the rapporteurs, of the chairman of our committee, Mr Wynn, and of the Members who have participated, has been of great merit, because, amongst other things, the agreement allows us to maintain a level of spending which is in line with the efforts of the States to achieve a balance in their public accounts, to deal with the Union’s basic commitments in processes of institutional crisis – I would remind you that next May there will be a Latin American-European Union Summit, and it is important to stress that, from a budgetary point of view, the creation of a solidarity fund has also been promoted – and, finally, give value to Community policies which have, and will have in the future, a fundamental role."
"I am talking, for example, about the financial support for programmes such as Argo, which is essential to the common management of migratory flows and the control of external borders, as well as the approval of a Community initiative in favour of the victims of terrorism, which, beyond the sums which have been directed towards them, demonstrate to the citizens that the Union is involved in the fight against terrorism in any of its forms."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have had broad agreement about the budget for several years in succession."
"The main reason for this is that we have rapporteurs, a committee chairman and a collective spirit in the Committee on Budgets that I think the Member States should learn from, if what happened in Brussels last weekend is anything to go by."
"I should like to thank the rapporteurs and my colleagues."
"As last year’s rapporteur, for the 2003 budget, I have this year mainly had responsibility for implementing the budget, and that is something on which I thought I would reflect."
"Adopting a budget is just the first, relatively easy, stage, and then comes what is really difficult, namely implementing it."
"In that respect, I am concerned, both for 2003 and for the future, for example 2004."
"For a number of years, we have had large surpluses and large outstanding commitments, known as RALs, especially within the structural funds system, and these are huge amounts."
"Unfortunately, we are seeing this now too."
"We have recently had a report on the implementation for 2003 that identifies clear problems, even though there are areas that are being improved."
"We have recently decided on what is known as the global transfer of ever larger amounts left at the end of the year that have to be moved from under-implemented areas of the budget to other areas."
"That is, to an ever greater extent, particularly worrying when it comes to category 4, an area in which we have a severe lack of resources."
"It is also worrying when it comes to the Community initiatives, in which we have problems with a very large proportion of the resources."
"When even implementation of the information programmes is lagging behind in a situation in which we face large tasks of providing information in connection, for example, with the new Constitution, enlargement etc., it is clear that it is in actual fact a problem."
"Something serious must happen in this area before 2004 if the new Member States are not to be very disappointed when they see that implementation is at a quite different level than that stated in the budget."
"For several years, we have adopted a variety of reports on implementation etc. I believe that Parliament might need to adopt a more extensive, purposeful strategy in order to tackle the annual surpluses, the accumulated quantity of outstanding commitments and the poor implementation and to do so, for example, through a special report involving a strategy of some kind for dealing with the problems that cause this lagging behind."
"Last year, we in the Group of the Party of European Socialists put forward a number of proposals concerning simplification."
"I think we should extend this to include a more radical and strategic review of the way in which budget implementation in actual fact operates."
"I have seen on several occasions what I think is an absurd situation in which, for example, regions, universities and non-governmental organisations cease to seek appropriations, partly because the application procedure is so complicated and partly because the payments take so long to materialise that the applicants incur financial problems even though their projects have been earmarked for appropriations."
"I believe that the solution lies, for example, in continued reform, more modern budgeting techniques, more up-to-date auditing and a culture of greater openness."
"In the long term, I even believe that we could question the system of commitments and payments."
"We must definitely obtain financial perspectives that do not lock up all the sectors for seven years, something that is impossible to manage in the end."
"Parliament must perhaps also realise that the budget cannot simply be increased without ensuring that the Commission has the resources required for implementing the decisions."
"Those of us who may possibly be re-elected and who will then immediately have to begin debating Agenda 2007 will be faced with a large task as the next period of office begins."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to add my thanks to the rapporteur, to the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Wynn, who has led negotiations with great authority, and also to the Italian Presidency. Credit must be given where it is due."
"Yes, we have had some long and difficult sessions during the conciliation process. Nonetheless, the Italian Presidency has, I believe, contributed greatly to the final outcome, notably with respect to the mobilisation of the flexibility instrument."
"When one considers what is happening in Iraq and the prospects ahead of us, it is regrettable that we had to squabble over peanuts, while the needs of that region, and the role that Europe could play there, are much more pressing concerns than the EUR 95 million obtained at the conclusion of negotiations."
"Given the threats, recrimination and pettiness that have dogged us, is it any wonder that we had misgivings when voting on this budget?"
"Six countries, including some founding Member States, now come and tell us that yet again we have to reduce a budget that is already ridiculously low in relation to needs and to the ambitions of the Europe represented by the letter of amendment under discussion this afternoon."
"I believe that we have indeed sunk to a very low level in our debate on budgetary and fiscal policy."
"We understand that certain countries, by issuing their threats, actually wish both to launch a challenge to those countries that have, supposedly, prevented the Constitution from being adopted and, more importantly, to take a retrograde step, without taking into account either our institutional role or the ambitions that Europe ought to have."
"As Greater Europe is enlarging to 25 and later to 27, at a time when the new democracies are yearning for democracy, this threat consists of providing even less than we did for Spain and Portugal, and actually to provide less than the already meagre offering we are making today."
"You are signatories, so why do you not abandon the CAP?"
"I would say to President Chirac that doing that – to take just one example – would, even now, make it possible to save half of the budget, and redirect it towards other forms of finance."
"We could get rid of export refunds, given that, in any case, blatant examples of fraud have been uncovered."
"We have to get tough."
"In this light, it is appalling that this weekend’s negotiations on Parliament’s role in the budgetary procedure have failed, as, indeed, have the negotiations as a whole."
"I believe that its success would be a step forward for Europe."
"As for Parliament’s role, I think it has shown more rigour, more European spirit in the work carried out to establish a budget."
"In this regard, I should like to pay tribute to Mr Mulder, the rapporteur, for retaining the cap, despite the fact that the Council has negotiated this way not by accident, but deliberately in order to reach the conclusions that we now know. So this is my tribute to Parliament for this budgetary year 2004."
"Mr President, much has already been said about the budget."
"Nevertheless, I believe that we can give ourselves a little pat on the back today."
"This week’s states that the gross national product of the European Union has risen above that of the United States again this year. This means that we have become the world’s leading GNP power, and out of all of this we are spending 1% on this budget."
"That 1% ensures that we are able to maintain the possibilities of that GNP."
"That 1% is truly the best investment imaginable, therefore; and you could make yourself extremely sad listening to the weeping and wailing in the Ecofin Council."
"I do think, however, that the issue of Ecofin is a difficult one."
"What does Ecofin consist of?"
"It consists of ministers who think that they should in fact be prime minister."
"They think it totally unfair that there is also a European Council; they believe that they themselves are that Council, and thus they go ahead and make their own policies."
"That is the main problem at this time."
"The Treaty assumes that there is one European Council, which has a definite coordinating role."
"The members of Ecofin think that they, too, play that role, and the way in which they go about it is so parochial, so sad, pedestrian and mournful, that it makes us shiver."
"Naturally, everyone thinks that I am only talking about Mr Brown, but unfortunately there are other ministers, too, who think along the same lines."
"That is a problem, and I think that this is perhaps the main point."
"I am not concerned with restricting the rights of this Parliament, but what would be eminently possible would be to restrict Ecofin’s rights somewhat when the European Council meets again."
"This might enable us to be a little more forward-thinking and to finally go the right way about drawing up an EU budget, rather than only going by the lowest common denominator out of the 15 – soon to be 25 – Member States."
"– Mr President, Commissioner Schreyer, ladies and gentlemen, because this year’s budget is the budget of an enlarged Europe, we must understand – as Members have done – the substantial negative factors accompanying the excellent work carried out by the rapporteur, Mr Mulder, the chairman, Mr Wynn and the coordinators."
"Whilst underlining the positive mediation role carried out by my coordinator, Mr Walter, I want to point to three negative factors: First of all, payments have been maintained at very restrictive levels, one of the lowest for the last ten years; secondly, in the context of the structural funds, at the end of the year we saw the usual refund of almost EUR 5 billion to the Member States; thirdly, the dispute – already referred to – over Heading 4: as it has done before, the Council proposed cuts in Parliament’s traditional priorities for the purpose of financing this year’s emergency, Iraq."
"Last year it was Afghanistan."
"It is against this background that the usual fight between the poor relations has broken out: cut the budget lines for MEDA or for Asia, cut the funds for illnesses linked to poverty or the funds for humanitarian aid, and other possible solutions."
"I wonder how far the flexibility instrument and painstaking accounting will enable the circle to be squared?"
"Moreover, as if that were not enough, this year the entire budget procedure has been weighed down, as we all know, by a series of attacks against Parliament’s budgetary powers in the context of the work of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"It is clear that the problem is political and much broader, as many Members have noted."
"The problem arises from the lack of generosity on the part of certain Member States towards the Union – yesterday’s letter is a further demonstration of that – as if the road travelled together so far were not sufficient to demonstrate that the resources granted to the European Union are resources given to ourselves, for the peace, security and well-being of the Member States."
"The accounts of the European Union cannot be taken as the starting point for establishing its political priorities."
